suspect\nOccasion that there is no time to wait for a SWAT Team at twenty Eighteen Avon\nAbsolutely ethic I Want to mediate lay\nRight absolutely you go in and clearly that's what happened I mean some of the officers did go in but let me be clear\nI I have not seen or I don't have I haven't found yet that and if it's out there to see if we can find something soon my executive producer on a timeline on who went in for us I don't know if\nIf the Pittsburgh Police the point I I haven't seen it but I if I can find that and if it becomes available to study who went in but it does appear the Pittsburgh Police went in and they put their lives in danger trying to neutralize the shooter and protect the congregation\nWell the only scenario where he could have come out alive is if they go on and the man had his weapon on the ground and a chance up otherwise if you come in and he has a gun in his hand and you know that there's been rounds fired you take him out first because you don't know if he's one of many you take him out and move on I just don't see that happening\nIn some of your concern is that what your question is why was he taken alive I he was he had he didn't have gunshots he was treated at the hospital in fact in just a minute I'm going to play some audio ah incredible\nThe doctors the nurses were working on ... hours to shop the Jews at the Pentagon they were working on them in the hospital while he was still spouting anti Semitic bourbon so we'll get to that coming up in just a bit\nGreg we know that it's the bad guys are not always taken out and killed some times that neutralize\nAnd you know if you have them on the ground and let's say you wanted him you you've hit him in the shoulder you've hit him in the leg and he's down and you're able to put them into custody a police officer just can't take\nA his service weapon or her service weapon and put a gun to his head and and and popping and take them out and that's not going to happen so we don't have I haven't seen all the details on why he was taken alive but clearly\nHe was Greg thanks for the call eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine the nationwide number here on Schmidt so

[laughter]\n[noise] [noise]\n\nYeah ... ... who is trying to save this guy or work on that does sound like he had a life threatening injuries but just the fact that the Jews were working on the shooter who killed eleven people at the synagogue\nWhen I stopped to see him I just asked him how he was doing was in pain and he said nobody was fine [noise] um\nI'm not going to get into the

dollars and service technicians no experience required take indoor offers I'm job training paid time off health insurance and four O. one K. apply online at stake indoor dot com or click the banner\nAnd what time of the actually engaged so here's the timeline\nThis happens to be published by CNN on their website nine forty nine AM and anti Jewish or Jewish messages posted on social media can for this Robert Bowers\nThe gunman\nAnd this was on this gab website which will get into a little bit later on and he wrote on this Web site\nSo about five minutes before he went in so he must have done this on a mobile device logged in and he left a message I Can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered screw your optics I'm going in\nI don't think it takes a genius to figure out that he was talking about going into the synagogue\nTo them shoot the Jewish people inside nine fifty four I Am as I mentioned the nine one one calls started rolling into the Allegheny county emergency operations center nine fifty five AM a minute later to police cars are dispatched\nAccording to radio traffic posted by broadcasts defy\nThey are told one caller reports twenty to thirty shots heard from the lobby numerous other officers say that they're responding about four minutes after that nine fifty nine or ten o'clock officer identifies himself by number and says he's on the perimeter were under fire he's got an automatic weapon\nAnd firing at us from the synagogue\nThen a month later another officer says the one of her colleagues are going to be heard shouting is shot in the hand another officer calls for a medic\nSo I mean within minutes are responding we already have a cop shot so I you know some are trying to send that should have gone in sooner again I don't have a firm grasp of what has is verified reality on the timeline\nJust after ten am an officer says every unit in the city needs to get here now\nDispatcher relays request to all available units fan that that will give you chills every unit in the city needs to get here now\nIs broadcast two minutes later about ten o two AM officers on the scene request city and county swat teams and again they're not just sitting around waiting at the swap members\nAre you know typically on cell phone twenty four seven and they were available some are already on patrol or they're doing other duties them and they quickly assemble\nAnd get to a scene as quickly as possible different swat teams work different ways but a lotta times SWAT Team the truck arrives uh whenever I can get there but other team members are typically in there whether it's a their city or county issued vehicle they have all their tactical gear and their trunk\nOr in the back of their a SUV the body armor their fatigues a they're a high powered rifle scopes what they they typically have it all with them\nAnd they'll respond as quickly as they can\n[noise] ten eleven AM there's a discussion among officers about going into the synagogue one says there has been no gunfire since officers initially arrived\nOnce we have the resources here we should consider going in now this is what and again I don't want to jump down and he wants throat or I don't want to jump to conclusions yet I\nI I Want to have an absolute grass on the time is a hundred percent right but this is an area where there could be some complaints but remember I mentioned that we already had a police officer shot\nAnd that could have been fired from the windows out at the police are responding but they they've already an officer was already hit\nThe outside so ten eleven they're talking about\nGoing in\nOnce we have the resources here we should consider going in now\nThat is going to give some people some pause and should the officers have gone in and made entry into the building sooner did they wait too long\nOr were they waiting for those other resources or swat and those with more protective armor to show up when they should have gone in and of course this is going to be reviewed it's going to be up for debate\nUltimately you did a four officers shot here and I'm just not going to arm share this right now\nI'm not going to Monday morning quarterback this because I don't have all the facts and I'm not going to go on just the CNN timeline here until I Know all the facts are operationally if things were not done properly or if they should have been faster or there could have been lives saved if they would have a breach the buildings sooner\nOr without technically swamp showing up\nWell that'll be determined but I Can't sit here in this chair behind this microphone and make definitive statements because I just don't know at this point but that's a potential area which is obviously going to be looked at ten Nineteen am\n[noise] a a worker at the emergency operations center said nine one one calls indicated the shooter came into the lobby and began firing a ten Twenty one I Am someone says an officer fired up the suspect during the initial gunfight and believes the gunman may have been hit so again\nI'm trying to reconcile an earlier incident so before swat arrived it appears that swan or some members of swat and again it's not like the whole truck pulled up you know and the back\nOpens up and the officers jump out like in the movies are on TV officers they started arriving at the scene individually some reports have some of the swap members arriving at ten twelve\nAt ten twenty five officers says suspects wearing green vast green jacket weapons slung around his neck\nAbout ten thirty AM so ten twenty nine to ten thirty tactical teams enter the Senate gone so was that too long to go in\nOr should they have gone in sooner if that is accurate why did some of the SWAT Team members why did they wait so long to go in but at that point at that point though it seems that\nThe shooting was already done or the the the ... eleven that were murdered it seems that most were already killed before even police arrived on the scene so I don't know\nRenovations breach\nChampionship cybersecurity\nJoins secure innovations for cocktails and conversation with Justin Dr

we'll get to that coming up in just a bit here on that I I'll tell you I'll get to it before the end of this hour or so we got about twenty three minutes left will get to what you want to hear this and it's coming up momentarily here on ...\n... when you're the president\nEverything you say and do what you where the way you look at someone any everything is under the microscope\nWith Trump he is even more under the microscope couple audio by so I wanted to play from me Sarah Huckabee Sanders press conference from earlier today uh the first news or in a long time I think since early September\nIf I'm not mistaken so little um old occasion with Jim Acosta there was an interesting episode was Sarah Sanders and Jonathan Karl from ABC News will get into that in a bit\nNow with the president but I just said about the president being under the microscope whoever the president isn't with Trump even more so because valley's a different kind of president you different kind of guy and he\nClearly handles the media much differently\nAnd he's a bulldozer\nAnd he does things different than other presidents have in the past the president now must saying that a lot of these issues and similarities didn't occur behind the scenes or cause less\nThan Obama's White House Obama's administration they had an adversarial position with the press the press were locked out of many events the difference is is that Obama would not have these temp sore spots in front of the media\nA subtle say hey it's better to have this uh out in the open it provides a or the ability for everyone to see what's happening it it it opens up a green pastures and can\nView it's happening and see what's happening versus what happens secretly quietly behind closed doors\nAnd the Obama administration and his staff talking about the media who they like they don't like I had to keep the media away from certain events that Trump does it in public\nFor all of us to see and you've got an asshole so then if we're able to see all of their Senate if it gets sunshine and sunlight though what the hell happens behind the ... that could be even crazier\nThe point I'm trying to make is the president's tweets from this morning\nI've been very clear I Do not like the enemy of the people I think it's destructive I don't think that it is any place for a president of the United states to call the media the enemy of the people or\nThe delineation of the fake news is the enemy of the people but then you know he'll call CNN and and and and the NBC and MSNBC the fake news so essentially he's calling them the enemy of the people 'cause you're qualifying so ... tweets this morning and again I\nJust I don't think that the president should\nBe engaged in this type of Twitter activity especially under the microscope especially since we've had the pipe bombs from last week the synagogue shooting from Saturday morning the president this morning\nIn his first sweep this was [noise] see what time was this a well he had he had a ... actually ... tweets I Want to go over because the one this morning rolled out at a nose three am about twelve hours earlier\nIn the eight o'clock hour last night so Sunday night the president tweeted the fake news is doing everything in their power to blame Republicans conservatives and me for the division and hatred that has been going on for so long in our country\nVery first thing the media ISIS goes on and then they they tangled little further down the road here ... that major news networks first public statement was to blame the president and myself included I mean that is outrageous that anybody other than the individual who carried out the crown withhold that responsibility these are\nSlowly go and you could say she's riled up I mean and she is emotionally affected by what she just talked about in the end the conversation of illicit it's her job to [noise] actually have the president's backing and following his position even if she doesn't always agree I don't think Sarah Huckabee Sanders always agrees and I\nI'm pretty confident she would not officially endorse enemy of the people if you have the opportunity to honestly say whether she likes it or not so I promised this audio this is this is crazy a Latino\nMother or a Latino woman this isn't the Houston area was on our way to vote\nWhen she was a verbally abused by a apparently

there's a split among those that belong to the synagogue I just don't think I\nI just don't think that [noise] a position of saying the president's not welcome I don't think that's warranted and the price of the United states coming to help the community heal and try to use the cover all he's divisive his terminology the words he uses\nA not help I I just don't think that that that has a place I think the president or the ... the the current head of the synagogue has the right\nThe rabbi Jeffrey minds he has it right at the front of the United states is welcome any time and I think that's the right answer and not just a an answer I think it's the correct thing to want to end the correct thing to say\nYou know the president was hit with some criticism that he did mention that hey this might not have happened if they had an armed guard and listen that's a fair comment just not immediately\nAnd I think that the Trump lacks that mechanism on sometimes timing of when to say what and I fundamentally agree with him I agree with that guess what if they were armed parishioners or in this case a\nCongregants I'm the synagogue ah that may be an armed or individual can stop this person or if there were security in the lobby or at the synagogue when you had three different congregations holding three different services\nI Do agree but I don't think I Would have roll that out as one of the first things that I said in response to the massacre but as long as they seem to hear just two different takes on from coming to town I think it's the right thing to do and I I think the president first lady should make their way\nAnd try to help with the healing process\nIn Pittsburgh eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine of the nation wide number eight hundred three eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine if you agree disagree want to get on brings something new to the table another area of agreement that I have with the president is\nThe sending in troops to the U.S border now it has been up\nUh I don't\nWant any type of military confrontation and most likely troops are not going to be arm or if they are they will not be permitted to fire at migrants that try to break into the country and that shouldn't be the case we should not that I\nI mean that an image of some kind of a you know I'm like had a massive Kent State like massacre I I don't want to see that but the president is\nA hundred percent right to protect the sovereignty and our borders and one was eight hundred troops last week now it looks like they're going to be\nA about fifty two hundred troops deploying to the southern border\nAs this migrant caravan keeps rolling north\nSaying that they're coming in\n... quote will reinforce along priority points of and freeze so as to enhance border patrols ability to harden and securing the border\nThat's talents are shorter a that's Terence oh Shauna see who is an air force general and he's the head of the U.S northern command\nAnd this was at a press or in Washington and at the deployment will be completed by the end of this week\nI have no issue with this the president has all the right to protect our borders and the sovereignty of the United states of America\nWe want immigrants we're a nation of immigrants you'd do it the proper way you don't form a mob chain and a caravan and say hey we're about seven thousand strong now or I saw numbers fourteen thousand for whatever the number is\nJust more of your way to the southern border and say hey we're coming it like it or not no we don't like it and you're not permanent\nXena phobia that it's not anti immigrant low it's anti lawlessness and trying to smash your way through our border and the president has all the rights\nTo request troops sent troops and now we're up to\nFifty two hundred troops and man is uh James Mattis the secretary of defense I'm also it said\nThis was on this morning as well that ah the military has already started bringing in equipment and those Jersey barriers to assist the troops\nAre to try to force this caravan from trying to push its way into the United states I that's why we have a couple of calls here eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine\nThat's how you get on any comments on Pittsburgh uh oh some new details on the pipe bomb or with the fifteenth bomb I Believe discovered\nAnd then you know those that are saying oh false flag oh the stamps won't even canceled walk as I said last week there's an explanation for that us and we'll get into that and just the ... how about we grab current in Danbury, Connecticut hurt your next Don Smith welcome\nThank you and I appreciate your taking my call I also appreciate your at that and said that'll actual honesty uh as someone who's more on the progressive side I appreciate your loving to pitch the truth at times four year college may be uncomfortable with that I'm having said that\nA\nCouple of things I just went to I wanted to make real quickly nope as far as the people who are coming to our border from Central America they're actually coming as refugees which means they're and they're very claiming to be refugees\nSo that makes them entirely

you disagree with the caravan and their political motivations or whatever their motivations are it's it's ... it's an organized event essentially and it is not\nFilled with people I truly believe that are in fear for their lives that are fleeing a and if that's the case then like I say you go to Guatemala or you go to Mexico and and try to seek asylum in no this is about coming to the United states\nAnd you've got a massive caravan and some are upset that the language that Trump and others are using that their invaders invading the country if you want folks if you have like a caravan\nThat was four thousand then five thousand in Seventy five hundred now again ... late last we saw numbers upwards of fourteen thousand\nAnd if they're rushing the border if they're coming to

insightful language and they're trying to say that Trump is calling the migrant caravan and invasion\nAnd the synagogue shooter also said that uh he likes the fact that it's being called an invasion really\nI'm telling you there are many people like me that again\nAre are just absolutely heartbroken and what happened and I want the worst things to happen to that shooter but still just 'cause he says he likes the term invasion I Can't also describe it as an invasion when you have all those people are trying to bust into the country\nOr the demonization of a word I think every you know where

my tickets a loser\nEvery ... every one of you listening to my vote I don't care if you think your congressman as safe or not you better get out and vote\nBecause otherwise if you don't vote that's pretty much a vote for Nancy Pelosi and if you have a Senate race going on in your state that's vote for Chuck Schumer\nThe second potential outcome is a split decision\nSplit decision would be Republicans hang on to the Senate gain a couple seats and Nancy Pelosi them become speaker\nAnd Maxine Waters is a chairwoman Adam Schiff has a chairwoman and let's say Gerald ... chairman Elijah Cummings that chairman and it's endless investigations\nInto one of the most unbelievable things that we're watching unfold here\nIs what we got this desperation factor of the Democrats I mean even when I think even want to warn you of what they do every two and four years racist or sexist besides ... Gina phobic Islamophobia homophobic you know dirty air dirty water kill children pro granny over the cliff\nJust one you think it can't get worse it gets worse and the echo chamber\nBut ever doubted ever doubted who the media in this country has pulling for just just watch any so called cable news channel besides Fox\nFor thirty seconds because every second every minute of every day hate Trump destroy Trump help the Democrats and if it means falsely accusing the president of being responsible\nFor the synagogue shooting over the weekend and not even tell the people there viewers that well the shooter this mad man power hated Trump because of Trump being so allied and good partners with our closest ally Israel\nAnd the same people you know saying Trump cause this promise responsible for this you know it's a it's it's a sense of madness but it also does show a desperation that has now kicked in for the Democratic party they are desperate\nYou know one thing I I think I'm going to talk about polls a little bit in the course of the program today but I'm also on the other hand seems like I'm Talking to both sides of my face I'm really not\nI'm I'm gonna tell you to just ignore the polls at this point doesn't matter you still have a job to do and if you want to to keep the progress that we've had you\nWant to prevent hearing the night of one week from tonight\nAnd one day after one week from tomorrow when we talk about the results if you don't want to hear the words speaker elect Pelosi Senate majority elects sure then you're going to have to do something about it\nThe worst case scenario is they can win at all and the only way that's going to happen is if you stay home\nAnd the reason I'll tell you not to pay attention to the polls is because they get it wrong so often just two years ago the exit polls showed that Trump lost Florida he won it\nLast North Carolina he won it that he had lost Ohio he won Ohio that he lost Pennsylvania He won Pennsylvania that he lost Michigan in Wisconsin and he won both of them\nAnd the media nobody they weren't candy because they read these results as I was on the air at five Fifteen I had it before everybody else\nI remember my first break at at the about twenty after the hour I called then candidate Donald Trump and I said somebody's going to come in in about a minute with bad news and tell you that you lost everything don't believe it\nI said I don't believe these polls I said there's no way these polls are accurate\nAnd he goes why do you believe that and then I told them the story about two thousand and four\nWhere the media again the polls came back and George Bush and Dick Cheney and lost Florida Ohio Pennsylvania and it was over\nAnd Dick Cheney called the radio program this radio program at you know on election day two thousand and four or five thirty five and reminded people they still had time to vote because he read the same information that I just read that John Kerry was going to be the next president\nYou know if you go back in you know other polls where they've been wrong twenty four team you know let's go back with the election one week away it's coming down to the wire conventional wisdom is Republicans will pick up a few seats in the house or in the Senate but lose the house by a painfully slim margin\nOne of the reasons is look if you look at real clear politics that's based on polling polling is not totally inaccurate information there's some things you can glean from polling that are\nAnecdotal maybe the way to put it helpful in other ways right now real clear politics has the Democrats have two hundred and five seats locked solid\nOr leaning Democrat and it has leaning Republican rock solid Republican two hundred that's a five seats different spot because Republicans have the majority\nOf ah right now that means that they have more seats they have to defend is like thirty seats that they called toss ups that can swing one way or the other we've identified these we put them up on Hannity dot com you can check it out for yourself and\nThe only thing that can make a difference is if you want the progress of the last two years to continue\nYou get to decide how you're gonna feel a week from tonight I mean when the when you watch called back the media in twenty sixteen this five Fifteen they were getting\nWell it's pretty clear Hillary I think is going to the next president Frank Luntz was reporting from Times Square at six Fifteen and I'm watching him it's over Trump lost it ain't happening\nTurned out not to be true turned out the polls were wrong and I'm not criticizing prank he was reading in the polling data I had read the same data\nSo if you don't have the sense of urgency I don't know what I can say or do to give it to you but the media is all in on helping the Democrats get back the house and the Senate and they're doing everything within their power to make that happen\nBecause they've had a Trump since the day walk down the escalator with no earlier\nI think it's worth noting now that conventional wisdom does not exactly have a stellar track record this is where I urge you to be cautious about the polls and don't let the polls influence your motivation here\nBut it's not only were they wrong in twenty sixteen they also wrong in two thousand and four they were way off in the last midterm election member Republicans have been set up because Ted Cruz's fellow buster oh we're going to get cleaned out in the Senate that didn't happen one year before the twenty four\nTeam in terms of media insisted the GOP hopes to recapture the Senate were dead on arrival that\nGoes in October Ted Cruz had filibustered Obamacare and shut the government down for sixteen days good for him makes me like Ted Cruz more\nExperts such a short us a hundred percent certainty in twenty four team Republicans are going to pay huge price when the twenty four team midterms rolled around Thirteen months later the G O P not only won back the Senate they did it with a ... seat Senate landslide\nNow remembers the night went on in twenty sixteen media was kinda Getty but then that getting this began to give away to a little bit of a little bit of nervousness I think we got it still but uh yeah to get a little tighter than we thought isn't it\nAnd then I turned into what all out melt down depression collectively by the media and they couldn't believe it because you we the people shocked the world\nAll that but an old for it's happened in fourteen and it happened in sixteen don't resent it can happen in a tea\nYou should do it for no other reason because you want to keep America on the great growth growth trajectory we're on and maybe for another reason to watch these idiots in the mainstream media these sanctimonious\nA self righteous they're not news people advocates that they are the extension of the Democratic party\nThey're going to lose it if the house remains in Republican hands and Republicans picked up a number of Senate seats they will lose it just like they did in twenty six the this is a this is a white flash CNN was reporting that night\nAnyway the so called experts saw the Republican landslide coming that none of them thought in twenty fourteen no very few of us saw that we could wait\nI'll give you the let's go to twenty fourteen final Wall Street journal NBC News survey before balloting and twenty fourteen had forty six percent of likely voters favor Congress led by Republicans forty five prefer democratic control kind of similar where they are now\nThe G O P claimed a similar one point advantage lead in\nTen states where Senate races where the most competitive with a balance of power in the chamber would be decided those results suggest a narrower advantage for Republicans in in the latest mid term\nAnd you know still they claimed oh Republicans pick up nine seats that's a hell of a field goal they were saying they might they might well twenty ten was kind of a two touchdown embarrassing laws for Democrats this is more Republicans went on a field goal\n[noise]\nGo to bed sleep get out of bed introducing the Nairobi to lift our new\nLift

investigation I mean that's the thing I think that um uh we don't know what's gonna happen because this has been going on for quite some time they've been gathering a lot of evidence Andrew also the same lobbyists that arrange that New York John get paid for a for night stay in a luxury Costa Rica villa for Andrew go I'm\nAndrew didn't pay a dime of that and then Andrew turned around and gave that lobby is a two million dollar contract to do a restaurant in the city of Tallahassee now we know in addition to that thousand dollar ticket\nThat the agent gave to go on the FBI agent\nAlso under rode a forty three hundred dollar dinner for Andrews campaign nine twenty sixteen I was never reported which it needs to be and so the question is\nAnd you have reported that after the fact that just basically covering your tracks CYA so I don't mean resident reported\nAt all the only reason we know about it\nIs because there's an ethics commission investigation of Gillum and and and a response to those subpoenas or one of the lobbyist attorneys release that said the public so\nForty three hundred dollars and then at least a thousand dollars for Hamilton Andrew says he's not under investigation but Sean you tell me what other reason what an undercover agent have to do those things if he wasn't investigating mayor Andrew Gillum\nWell let me ask you to two days ago\nIt was the political reported that apparently his running mate you know claimed that quote Jews nailed him to the cross and read the text message to you know apparently it's now out there many you know people in in South Florida apparently are pretty angry at this remark\nAnd er which seems pretty anti Semitic to me as he's standing by this\nBook I think it's reprehensible Andrew Gillum picked this guy knowing\nThat he had done that but here's the thing about Andrew Gillum he is aligned himself with some of the most anti Israel and anti Semitic groups in Florida including this radical group called the dream defenders\nWhich is a leader and the boycott divest and sanctioned movement targeting Israel they actually say Israel the genocidal apartheid state and so that's one of the Andrew strongest supporters\nAndrew to this day of poses having our embassy in Jerusalem he opposes recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital\nAnd when a Israel fought back against the Moffett path and may ah Gillum blamed Israel you know they just use those attack as a pre tax to be able to do a disproportionate response to\nWhat what is in a relief ... organization that he won't disavow\nThey're one of the most radical organizations in Florida or they they believe that the police and prisons have no place in justice\nAnd that the police needs to be the funded they pay they say the U.S is the biggest bully in the history of the world that our military needs to be caught\nThey if they favor replacing what they consider disaster capitalism is their words with socialist principles that are so radical it'd make Nicolas Maduro flush\nSo he signed their candidate alleged gang that he would support a this radical manifesto so that just who he is he believes and what they're doing is endorse them personally and uh it would\nLose a tape of him I guess that was discovered in June saying that he's please them proud to a snake food to dream defender activists during a thirty days sleeping protests at the Florida State Capitol\nReferring to the twenty Thirteen month long anti gun protest or after the Trayvon Martin George Zimmerman case and I hope you keep at it and he supported them but you're saying that there are radical group\nWithout question I mean they they are anti law enforcement they're anti free enterprise they're anti military um they're anti Israel uh I don't know I mean like that may be a group you would want to be aligned with if you're running for the mayor of the Gaza Strip but not for governor of Florida\nWow well let's go over a little bit of his his background and the proposals that he's making but he's I think it's fairly extreme a number one he was endorsed by Bernie Sanders that speaks volumes to me\nThere's a lot of outside money uh reports that he's getting money from the left wing billionaire as like the George Soros the George Soros really spend one point two million in this race in Florida to help him\nOh yeah I'm probably much more than that at this point now\nHe says that he supports Medicare for all I Am a champion of treaty health care and as a right not a privilege so he wants what nationalized healthcare\n... in the bill he supports what abolish Medicare and Medicare Advantage for seniors enforce them on a single payer\nGovernment planned it would eliminate everybody's employer based coverage and force them on a government single plan so it's really a fan the arrangements of millions and millions of Floridians that he thinks it's appropriate for government to take away health benefits that people have burned and the force them to be on the single payer plan I think that'd be a disaster\nHe wants to raise the corporate tax rate forty percent of forty percent increase what what's that going to what's the impact that's going to have on Florida businesses and Florida workers if the businesses pack up and leave\nWe will lose jobs we will lose business says and we're also I mean you know shock because everyone who works in high tech state they're always thinking about relocating to Florida and we have a historic opportunity to really capitalize on that when I'm governor buddy Andrew has his way\nThey'll stop the flow of investment coming into Florida because people are going to invest if you have the highest tax rate in the south east and actually he would raise it to be higher than New York\nYeah and he also was the first democratic candidate Nash nationwide I read to call for the abolish meant a vice is that true\nHe supports abolishing ice and impeaching President Trump\nAnd he wants to eliminate Florida's Stand your ground law\nYeah she wants to impose on law abiding Floridians a duty to retreat so somebody for criminal is attacking you you have to run and try to hide rather than fight back\nYou also support legalizing drugs in Florida like marijuana and others yes he does\nWell I mean if you're just looks like he is Bernie Sanders on steroids that down there I mean I've got to believe this controversial background that looks like almost a phenomenon that the media's just pushing for him and pushing for him and\nYou know his record I only spent about a half hour and I was able to dig it up it wasn't that hard to find and it seems like most of the media's ignoring who he really is\nOh without question I mean the day he won the primary particularly the national media you know they've tried to elevate him and try to make him into this great candidate\nA they do not like the scrutinize his record uh the fact that those documents released after he lied and the debate last Sunday or the media kind of had to cover that but at the end of the day\nHe has been given very kid glove treatment so really falls to me and other folks to go out and make the case and let people know and the good news is just one Floridians figure that out or they definitely don't want him as their governor and so we're going to keep making the case for the next week\nI'm worried about our friends not only the recovery of thoughts and prayers go to all our friends in the panhandle\nUm but but the panhandle to so many people whose lives have been up ended and disrupted and some people losing pretty much everything they own and they have now moved out the panhandle happens to be one of the most conservative areas of Florida are you concerned that people from the panhandle of going to be able to get their hands\nAnd Michael even Florida I Hope people are waking up to the fact\nUm and you are ... you're in the middle of early voting now and absentee voting obviously goes on and a one week from today we'll find out hopefully that you're the next governor of Florida otherwise I think among packing up my bags and I'm going to pull out of Florida and I'll go looking at Texas no offense\nTo buy presents out I got and I look I mean we're we're going to be going to go there and you're going to increase taxes forty percent forget it I'm Out\nNow I Know now that exactly right so we're going to get it done I think the folks understand that and uh you know when I'm governor will be able to do about it I got a world track record year\nRound the Centers for governor of Florida thank you for

now coach and obviously fast Jefferson surreal\nAre the are the big point getters into big performers covered back from last year and then you look for people to feel or the rolls back to Nineteen Jeff headache team thrill had sixteen and then next time I was Christian with aid\nOr over the course of time you have to narrow that gap a little bit with a FOUR score of ... you know give it another double figure guy things of that sort of ... where does it go from here\nWell depends on the defensive and if we can always are twenty four and a little bit of\nDifference we went to school in Ninety once again right right or nothing to point distribution is probably just about right I'm going to need those guys those three guys a squirrel anywhere between sixteen and twenty points a game ... each year and I'm going to need you know Christmas ... eight and twelve points each you know it's going to be you know hard for me to relax\nYou know ... ... on Christian to do much more often than because it's going to be so heavily relied on on a decent man up but again he's a a outstanding shot maker and I I Am hoping that he gets a little bit more aggressive with this ah with this billboard attempts because as you do mention yes we're going to be you wouldn't need the score and until\nOne of those freshmen can can possibly emerge you know uh it looks like a C team got he said he was a dual who said\nYeah he did he say that we've got it on tape you added\nWe have to worry that back on your watch right today where he will have to give me ... you mentioned the young guys in ... it was one

and better\nAnd more out of hand confidence yes the ferry come on land yes any fallacy yeah he's just a little bit of a flair and you know a little bit of a flair to his game so we're trying to cut back a little bit on the flare and maybe a little bit more substance does it come a little sooner for him than you expected though it is actually has been a pleasant surprise ever since the first day he walks\nOn campus so now he's a rotation a player and I was able to make sure that he's been thrust into the position\nOf manning the the point guard spot on a second TV and been here and that's tough I mean you're going to guess Jeff from scratch almost almost every day he's never played one guard exclusively a but it's helping him I think developed a as a player you know he's coming true CONMEBOL guard and not just the sugar\nAnd then when I and I don't know much about my I just really know what I read it when you first got him and I'm thinking that later in his career is going to help out you know junior senior years as he developed some but it looks like a you know when in certain situations whatever he can he can help\nYou yeah maybe yeah no absolutely we're looking forward to that he's gonna he's gonna have to them and again these these these when asked\nSo he had three drumming a of course had to with the the fall trouble so those those are the new guys coming in

of\nHappy just started me depended on just out as a freshman at the luxury may just gotten to a couple of the MPs early in his freshman year I did start to gain eleven ... and even then he was surrounded by you know\nThe talented older guy a fast Russell you know came off the bench last year and wasn't so you know\nThese freshman or a different position you know they're going to be relied on a lot faster a lot earlier in their career so uh but I don't want to put any number expectations on them I just want them to be I'll be able to come up there and play quality minutes for us uh you know on both ...\nAnd rebounding shrill had seven I think you you're going to always look for him to be in the high single digits double figures are in rebounding for yet but you got a couple of guys

Fox News President Trump the first lady along with her daughter Yvonne ... son in law Jared Kushner travel to Pittsburgh to honor the victims of Saturday's mass shooting at a synagogue a president's\nAs he's heading to Pittsburgh again I support the president going to Pittsburgh I think it is the right thing to do\nAh I I Believe that he will strike the right tone when he's on the ground in Pittsburgh\nAnd it again it's presidential it is the correct thing to do I'm pretty sure that Obama would have been on the ground them is a similar timeframe or George W. Bush or whoever so again I support the president going to Pittsburgh the president\nOf the temple the synagogue\nSays he's my president he's welcomed but you contrast that with the fact that the mayor of Pittsburgh the mayor's name is bill to do though\nHe wants no part of Trump's he says I'm not I'm not going to be with Trump I'm not going to be the airport when he arrives which is pretty standard for mayors and and and dignitaries to appear he says no I'm not going to be there are also the county executive his name is rich Fitzgerald he's not going to be there\nThe governor of Pennsylvania is Tom Wolfe and he will also not meet with Trump and an interestingly all of the congressional leaders also declined the ride\nTo attend with the president and first lady so Mitch McConnell\nThe Senate majority leader Paul Ryan the outgoing speaker of the house of of course on the Republican side they said no that they did not accept the invite to go and then on the Democratic leadership side Chuck Schumer the Senate minority leader and the Nancy Pelosi\nOr the the the devil leader for the house of representatives or below sea and Schumer also declined\nBut really the before we move on and we're going to monitor the president when he arrives in if he speaks and we'll bring you audio during the course of the show this I'm telling you right now that this is a Trump damned if you do damned if he adult situation\nPresident Trump deciding to go which again I think is the right thing to do a he's being met with some resistance but again you have the leader of the synagogue that was the center of the attack the target\nThe head of the synagogue is saying he's my president he's welcome you don't want that to me is what counts the most\nSo if Trump didn't show up\nIt'd be impacted oh how ... you know he's on Twitter is talking about this and he hasn't gone to Pittsburgh so I think this is a classic example of\nThe president is heading there he's taken flack and and criticism from individuals but if he didn't go he'd be take the same individuals probably would be saying the same thing about or just reverse that can't believe the president is not making a trip so again damned if you do damned if you don't\nEight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine\nEight hundred three eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine is the nationwide number Iran Schmidt I did see in Pittsburgh media\nThat a Mayor Bill or William ... do do the mayor of Pittsburgh he wanted President Trump to wait so hold off on his presidential visit\nUntil all the funerals had been completed of the victims which again I mean could the president have done that and made a statement that he's going to wait\nA Sheree caught them but again I think that in a time of uh of grieving and morning that presidents do make appearances to the best of my recollection on a similar timeframe so I get I I I don't fault the president and I'm guessing that if he didn't show up\nThat he'd be the the subject of criticism and and ridiculed for that long enough show today you know Whitey Bolger them the famous up mobster Whitey Bolger apparently ...\nIn a federal locked up in West Virginia he said no home to the plays a so in West\nVirginia and Whitey Bolger he's been moved all over the place memory a big Boston mobster and then he was on the run for what about sixteen years and he was finally busted\nAt some you know nondescript ... condo or a little apartment complex in Santa Monica you know what a couple of blocks off the pier I think my half mile off the the Santa Monica pier so Bolger\nReports habit for multiple sources that he was white in prison by somebody connected with the mob so ... and ... eighty nine years old\n[noise] eighty\nNine and you know Bolger had FBI protection for years because he was a an informant so I Wonder if that has to do with you know why he was taken out and did they know that they put them in a facility apparently there's some other inmates connected to the mob\nOr ... more is going to come out but the ... those are the early rumblings so Whitey Bolger taken out\nWhich is quite incredible\nNow what's the fiduciary responsibility of the federal prison system to protect to a guy like Whitey Bolger\nCertainly caught some folks off guard guessing the war was going to have a a finger to to answer might get a phone call from from somebody important to check up on this\nAh [noise] again just a lot of ground to cover there is some Bob ... breaking news this Hillary Clinton situation with this audio by this video clip\nIs a unbelievers I mean I I'm just like I

we've gotta Hillary Clinton in ... where's the outrage you've\nGot a year there's it's insane and then Bob Mueller story breaking just a short time ago that Bob Mueller is accusing his opponents\nOf

loaded slate here a birthright citizenship I Want to get into that next if you want to get on any thoughts on this\nOn the president is essentially undoing the fourteenth amendment via the executive

and birthright a birthright citizenship and\nLook like what a Supreme Court fight look like as far as the the constitutional scholars\nOn the Supreme Court unless we all we all know how all of the the left justices would react the the the four justices on the left we we know but we don't know a little wild card here\nIs the justices on the right as you look at the originalists and and and and how you know what the constitutional ideological bent does of each of the justices and I tell you right now\nI Am not a constitutional expert on NATO Supreme Court expert but I I've been doing this long enough I I read enough I study enough I'm exposed to enough that I certainly have I think above average a knowledge of and opinions and I don't think that even\nThe Trump picks necessarily could be counted on to uphold an executive order getting rid of the fourteenth amendment now\nWhere do I stand on this the world according to sniff I've never been comfortable whipped I understand I respect the constitution I respect\nThe amendments to the constitution I don't always agree with everything but I Do understand that these are amendments these are the laws of the land until the color and constitutionally challenged and until there would be on any of the amendments or any constitutional change you know the rules\nAre dictated fire remember my my civics properly\nThat in order to repeal\nA an amendment you'd have to have a two thirds of uh of Congress right two thirds and\nThree quarters of the states\nIn order to repeal a constitutional amendment summers and that's a tough road to hoe and I\nDon't think we're going to get there but also ... is the president even get to open up this can of worms and go down this road and open up a constitutional challenge that would absolutely make it before the Supreme Court this would be\nOne of the biggest cases in my lifetime but there's a huge case now back to birthright and I'd love to grab your calls on his folks eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine\nEight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine as the fourteenth amendment states that I got the fourteenth amendment\nRight before my very eyes and I think we ought to spend that just a moment on the fourteenth amendment [noise] the fourteenth amendment\nReeves states\nAll persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are\nCitizens of the United states and of the states\nWhere in they reside so less than it\nDoes you know say that if if you're born in the United states that you're a citizen you also have\nSubject to the jurisdiction there of\nAnd\nThe difference between a\nBorn or naturalized in the United states you know is that up to a legal debate now my personal opinion of course it is it would absolutely be open to interpretation by guys much or more\nVersed in in in a constitutional law than I Am a I I mean it'd be a fun fight to watch here but the question is is the president is Trump\nGoing to go down this road and open up this can of worms now I've always felt that I've had a problem with anchor babies for instance that are illegals or make it across the border into this country and they they drop a child here an anchor baby\nThen to have citizenship for uh their child or children I I've got a problem with that I've got a fundamental problem with that I don't like it I think it is wrong\nOr to come here for the express reason I'm dropping anchor and in in many cases coming to the country illegally and dropping that anchor baby I don't like it I never liked but does it mean that the the fourteenth amendment should change um I I just don't think it's going to happen\nThe president saying that it's going to have but he says the executive order will happen\nWill it I mean he has to know and he must have been council that if he does issue the executive order it's going to be many legal challenges ... legally challenge and it's probably going to lose and be found unconstitutional ...
