years ago and there were Capitol Hill\nPolice with him and this was in Pennsylvania I was at\nA Newt Gingrich's mothers are like the fifth anniversary party and that's a long story but we were friends with with ... drink Gingrich and Bob Gingrich a\nNewt's a mother and his stepfather and uh we were at this event in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania\nIt's back in the late nineties is is when Newt Gingrich was speaker of the house\nAnd he was in PA but still had to Capitol Hill police officers with him they were in regular suits and ties but they have the Capitol Hill police little a lapel pin arms\nAnd we were introduced so I'm just curious area of the Senate majority leader and things are so contentious and nasty these days\nYou know they are on break\nSo I don't know if that's why there wasn't any security but nobody intervened and some of the reporting is pretty nasty\nSo the video and for those of you are just tuning in I play this confrontation and you know this is on the heels of be playing

that in Sochi in Russia where the Winter Olympics were held so Russians will will go to heaven as martyrs in the event of nuclear war because Moscow\nWill only ever use nuclear weapons in retaliation that's what ... said this was last week we have no concept of a preemptive strike\nNow that's that's not that's not true they have all the contingencies for all types of strikes including a first strike just as we do as well\nI you know it's not our intention that it would be essentially mad or mutually assured destruction in that uh if somebody did for a strike us that while they would be completely obliterated 'cause we have the response capabilities\nBut you know for for ... saying we have no concept of a preemptive strike that's just a flat out lie so this was this is a forum that ... was that last week\nAnd it was a question that came in from the audience he said in such a situation we expect to be struck by nuclear weapons but we will not use them first he said\nThe aggressor will have to understand that retaliation is inevitable that it will be destroyed and that we as victims of aggression as martyrs we'll go to heaven\nThey will simply die because they won't even have

going to include us so [noise] ah well we'll see what develops here but certainly things continue to chill\nBetween us and that's not chill on a good sense of a sudden the the Russians no doubt about

they're trying to turn Camilla or Cory into the the next Obama next savior of the Democratic party the next anointed one it is dying to find the right person okay what give me your best shot at the

am\nNever mind what he had already admitted he did on his own\nOn top of Keith Ellison he would've been investigated not one of the these Democrats have called for an investigation\nI don't know if

very optimistic about how this election is shaping up\nWell I'm Glad you there do me a favor I think uh one of the biggest mistakes I made in my life in terms of supporting somebody of disappoints\nIs a guy by the name of Ben Sasse Ben Sasse had his way Hillary Clinton\nWould have been at the president the last two years she would have made the two Supreme Court appointments none of the bureau bureaucracy would have been removed we'd have open borders we would have Obamacare on steroids\nUm but he was never Trump her now is blasting made a new book trying to get me to talk about it so that he can sell copies when he hasn't passed a single piece of legislation with his own name on it alone that he sponsored\nSorry it's personal point\n[laughter] ... that's personal but you know the fact is\nThe never Trump or his are a fossilized group [noise] that are less and less relevant I mean with every passing month the president's support on the Republican Party goes up or I Know this this extraordinary rally in Texas um\nI don't know of anybody in American history who attracted as many people to as many different rallies as Trump has this year\nI was just an astonishing achievement and I think it boasts very well ah for the impact that he's going to have on both this year's election and on two on two thousand twenty\nWell let's talk about what do we do about this caravan [noise] you know there are ... by foot they make it in what\nThree weeks three and a half weeks but one thing that I think we both agree on is that I don't want a crisis precipitated at the border but goes Mexico is allowing this caravan to march through their entire country\nAnd we have no choice but to guard our borders because it's our sovereign land right where a nation of laws and idle and in the process\nThe people on that side of the border that are not respecting our laws could they could precipitate a crisis where innocent people get hurt and I don't want that to happen right is that better\nSo show now you'll understand\nPsychologically what Abraham Lincoln and went through between Eighteen fifty eight and um the spring of Eighteen sixty one and he says again and again you know we do not have to fight as soon as this this was you know you aren't going to choose\nHe said I'm not going to choose on I'm going to defend the constitution and do my duty but I'm not choosing to fight\nBut if you give me no choice I won't have no choice and I think this this is I think\nOne of the great test that President Trump is going to face because he he when he talks about a person the other day he doesn't want anyone hurt\nHe feels this very deeply on the other hand he has sworn to protect the United states he has sworn to uphold our borders and and I tweeted this morning to manage money if if the president is serious\nThe Mexicans only have two choices\nThen you can deal with the caravans now in southern Mexico for when the president blocks from entering the United states they can deal with them in northern Mexico like if you ask yourself this simple question if they literally can't get across the border\nThey're stuck in northern Mexico well and I think our our position ought to be a mess you know this decide whether I Want us to deal with them now he wants to deal with them when they returned back the border but under no circumstances\nShould we accept them in a City College done some brilliant legal work on the fact that the president has the authority\nTo block aliens that he deemed should the national threatened always got to say it doesn't have to defend this decision as to say I did this to be unacceptable for national security reasons\nAnd that blocked\nNow in all likelihood I don't think it's going to get to that point my guess is at some point because of the economic connection that Mexico needs with the United states that they're gonna have to step in here somehow in turn this caravan around how they do that I don't know\nBut the reality is either by the way and I do have compassion I understand people in\nIn Central America El Salvador Guatemala Nicaragua or that they want a better life but this is not the way to do what we have a process by which we have an immigration system and we're a sovereign country you don't get to ... you know create a crowd and rush the border\nAnd my fear is if they get to the border that we could be a potential outcome that's not going to be good for the people if we had the wall Mr Speaker built this wouldn't be an option for that if we had the wall we would have that would be no risk of anybody getting hurt on either side\nRight but but be bringing home or in the near future the next few weeks our policy should be\nTo hope for the best for planned for the worst I think the worst case is pretty simple the Mexicans end up with their own political reasons doing nothing they decide that they expect Donald Trump to cave and so there is going to let you know as many thousand people just want to enter the United states\nWhat they haven't thought through is what if he doesn't have what if he does call out to the military what if we do in fact create or in a factory human wall\nAnd block people from entering the United states now\nAnd then I have what what could be down as much as ten or Fifteen thousand people because of their ass keep growing\nWell there was one report yesterday from a newspaper in Mexico that said it's already ballooned up to fourteen thousand\nRight so so part of what I'm saying is at this at that point we we have a real decision to make and this is this is what Lincoln as saying over and over again yeah uh you\nKnow if you're going to preserve the union you're going to do whatever it takes to preserve the union and he didn't say it happily he didn't say it excited Lee ... many of his key early speeches as this nostalgic sadness to them\nOr that we are bound together by the common core of mystique memory and that we have no reason to fight each other a and he's almost cleaning you know don't do this well I Would say the same thing here this this is\nThe perfect crossroads to make the decision are we prepared to defend our sovereignty and to defend America or in the end and people blocking us or sister cave\nAnd guilt us into allowing them to invade our country because we don't have the nerve to stop to\nWe got to take a break or I Want you to weigh in when we get back on what the next fourteen days are going to look like what you think of Nate Silver as a production and much more of a former speaker of the house Newt Gingrich

that in a sense\nOf the whole question of what kind of country do you want to become clear on the left that you now have\nSort of a brown shirt Nineteen thirties to a total of cherry an attitude a that they are willing to use force\nOr they openly said they're willing to use force former attorney general saying when the Republicans go low kick them or you have various democratic leaders saying

I Would I ran into\nUm what's his name Blumenthal the Connecticut Senator\nAnd when I was in Washington went during the Capitol hearing said he was a total jackass during those hearings it was coming out of where I was going in\nAnd I said senator Sean Hannity how are you we had a very cordial conversation if he was sitting at a table I Would never I might go over and say you know send a drink over I might just because I disagreed vehemently with them I don't feel I have a right to tell them you don't belong here\nHe has a different point of view than I Do what we get to settle out at the

I listen I train five days a week an hour and a half maybe they aren't the large and they know this well it's a it's it's not going to stop crazy people\nBut I got to tell you something I Will walk away I Will do everything I can do to walk away I Do part of martial arts all the arts that I practice we ... we bow out if we're doing weapons training we show great respect if we're doing grappling or or\nOutright full contact we do it with respect we respect the tap we were ... you know we're not there to kill each other we're there to make each other better\nI'm so there's a certain discipline David associated with that and but most people age don't know how to defend themselves and be they're going to react like past caught then they're going to get past and somebody's going to get hurt\nI couldn't agree more and it is a danger for people in the public square and especially people who hold themselves out as Christians whether you're a pastor or you have a Christian themed blackout you really gotta be careful\nAt it but we do anyway we need to be civil and and when some people on Twitter ... and our other interactions but I don't think that means we don't fight I don't think it means we don't uh communicate our ideas as passionately and as intensely as the last that this is we don't have to get his dirty as they do\nWell I look I don't know I I we just had Newt Gingrich on and pass to what he was saying is between Cavanaugh I mean all these American\nValues that have have served us so well due process presumption of innocence and then you see that there was no core operation any of these charges\nIf the Democrats really cared about the issue they'd be going after Keith Ellison right now demanding an FBI investigation of an Cory Booker will be having an FBI investigation and Claire McCaskill's husband would be having an FBI investigation\nAnd Bill Clinton would be in jail for the rest of his life\nBut they're obviously playing politics with with very important issue so the hypocrisy is there but between Kavanaugh the mobs\nThe caravan that's happening and the fact that we've had on paralleled economic success\nFourteen state record for states record low unemployment record low unemployment for African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans women in the workplace are vets record low unemployment youth unemployment lowest ever I I'm hoping that people factor that in in fourteen days when they vote or if they vote early\nI think the man on the street will factor then I don't think the people on the street are stupid Democrat or Republican\nThen that stupid to party leaders are stupid but the man on the street they're able to see this process that they know that Kavanaugh was that whole cabinet issue was a sham they see the hypocrisy of the left on full display\nThey know that this a caravan is not simply a random occurrence that you know a a all these unconnected people just randomly deciding to all walk thousands of miles to America to look for better jobs they can see the orchestrated now some people are going to vote the party regarding this but the others say listen I'm tired of this\nBecause all of the nonsense seems to be coming from the left\nAnd the very behavior that they\nPretended to criticize they've put it on steroids and I ... so you know they said well we don't like the some of the behavior the president during the campaign but you say they have it to another level and you're you're propagating\nYou're out of Cleveland, Ohio okay you're a an African American conservative you took a lot of heat for supporting Donald Trump out at the results are in\nAnd we're seeing all of these jobs being created for the people will get a picture over there that's the forgotten men and women of America that's what that's what twenty six team was about for me the Thirteen million more Americans on food stamps the eight million more in poverty after Obama's eight years\nNow we've got four million jobs created eight million fewer people in poverty and on food stamps we have four hundred thousand manufacturing jobs that Obama sober never coming back\nWhile the predator didn't get credit when you break down boats demographically with the black community because they're never doing better they've never done better\nThank God he's going to get the votes you know a ... in the Bible nicotine was came to Jesus by night and there are a lot of ... diem is and they say listen we see what Trump is doing we embrace with Trump is doing is not what they told us that waking up and you know if they say is thirty six percent approval rating\nAt twenty or thirty percent of the fifty six sixty six percent believe me his message just rent cream tell him his message has made in the black community I come\nFrom a traditional democratic family years voted party forever blacked it in my family and our sphere are now so ... to it that they're either going to not vote at all which is which is really go\nFor what we're doing with the conservative movement or\nThey're going to vote with us because just starting to see that this is a charade here you know the media constantly but right and President Trump for no reason they've been doing it all day today CNN blacks used to go and get their news from CNN their politics from CNN and MSNBC they're starting to see\nWe got to get in the trenches we got to figure this out so we're getting a bunch of calls from people saying hey what's going on how's it going how's Trump doing this how can we help on this particular side he's going to get off the black vote than any other Republican president I'll throw this\nBut if if we all believe in in God the father Jesus is okay and I think all of us here do if we believe that\nAnd we all believe one thing and that predicated on that he created every man woman and child on this or we agree with that right okay yeah so in that sense where brothers and sisters we're all Americans to right and if we really believe that in every human soul God put some talent some ability\nAnd our goal is to to create an environment where that that talent that natural talent flourishes the the word\nEducation from the Latin isn't due to bring forth from within\nThat tells you the God put it there our job is to put enough sunlight and water on something make it grow and help people and that's what I see Trump's doing and it and it's now hitting the forgotten men and women David that's a great story of the two years at Trump so far\n[noise] yeah yes and and we want to get back what Trump is trying to do when he says I Want to make America great again it means to restore its founding principles is Judeo Christian founding principles which is based on the idea that we're all created in God's image and that's why we had an alien Abul lights it flows from that but I think the left this\nAuthoritarian by nature who their economic coercion can lead to political coercion and that's where they are and I I think the left is losing it because they don't have any ideas that worked\nI don't have any proposal so they're frustrated and they resort\nTo identity politics and

speaker elect Pelosi well you're somebody that needs to win this is one of the top fifty races I'm following\nThat literally where the where the balance of power is going to be made in terms of who's going to control the house look I think we're going to do well in the Senate but you know off year elections are historically what they are and they're tough but I Do think that you have a great chance of holding on to this seat because you've served the people in North Carolina oh\nIt was so this is a blue moon election for us here in North Carolina there's no governor no us center on the ticket I'm at the top of the tickets so you know well that makes mom really proud of the same time uh it's I'm at the top of the ticket and so we got to make sure that people come out at the for us\nUh Shaun this is a turnout turnout turnout election people just have to get out and go vote a we've got all the way through November third and then back again on November six plenty of early voting um you know we've got a lot of good things on the ballot North Carolina this year\nI'm I'm very excited I think we're going to win this but we've just got to do the work we've got to have people turn out like the president knows how important that says he's been into the district um he's coming back again to the state here friday night that's a sport my hope to be colleague mark Harris a younger Charlotte\nBut ah yeah we've got a lot of tough races this year there's been a lot of articles written about North Carolina Thirteen but you know like you said I'm a is a clear\nContrast race I'm a conservative member of the Freedom Caucus I'm In a tough district I'm a small business center and my opponent\nShe's one of the largest Nancy Pelosi donors she's against this tax cuts and JOBS Act is getting a lot of outside money from ... she's pack Tom ... each drunk guy a from a bomb a super PAC and that's kind of all that money is flooding and right here to the middle of North Carolina so it's a tough fight one that we can win but it's definitely a clear contrast you know\nBoth the cook Political Report an odds maker Nate Silver and tightened their assessment of this race\nOr and the cook report actually listed this is North Carolina while you can explain the exact areas are that are going to be impacted by by this um this district anyway is among the five congressional districts across the country\nThat it said had shifted more towards democratic candidates and yours is gonna be a a bellwether district and you're going to come in I think your polls

will move your best to be there and so uh you know it's I I'm almost at the point of of stop stopping trying to predict what our score will do I mean I have my opinion as to what he should do but ultimately how do you question the guy with ...\nNo that's true and but you know ... nice to see the last couple of games so he was warming up with the bad again after he's been in such a slump for so

that\nDidn't play in the postseason be it a ... and a few others but you know these guys will be getting their first taste of it and then you do have\nGuys like you can learn much more or less than you know they were on World Series team's not one that won but teams that\nAt least competed at at this stage in Texas couple of times the price of the world series and or a couple of other guys as well but you know top to bottom there's not a ton of championship round experience on the roster so it does help you know when when you start to think about\nNerves anxiety extra pressure temperature whatever it may be this time of year when you're playing leading to October\nAt at least kids what it does have that are under his belt\nAnd all that stuff does factor and there's no question of course John just really not all that familiar with Fenway Park and its nooks and crannies and what have you so please could be a real adventure if he starts in right field\nYeah absolutely you know I I think that it you know one of the most telling things that you saw the Dodgers arrived in town was\nGoing back to what Sunday night I think they they showed up early in the Sunday or early afternoon Sunday in the quake Kirsch or who\nUm is is going to see them out a whole heck of a lot in the series was out there uh in the ... and Sunday evening in the cold and just stretching getting loose getting a fuel a rubber ... feel\nUh just the the the way it is\nA you know his his positioning every mound is you know while the distance obviously ... six inches every mound took these pictures anyway\nFeel a little bit different you know something that you know you need to get a little bit accustomed to you and so are the larger point you're going to see that all across the outfield Fenway Park has has some\nWeird dimension of these guys have not dealt with whether it's you know a plane the ball off the wall and left whether it's to try and go\nOut towards that or whether it's a you know try to get a feel for how to walk out of wrapped around pass these oil and right and so there are a lot of those different things these outfielders going to have to deal with as you said not all of them have\nBeen in Fenway a bunch and the Dodgers as ... as an organization certainly not they haven't been\nA play the game at Fenway since two thousand ten yeah with Manny Ramirez his first trip back after that trade no wait so been a long time but you know ultimately you know we we can shut up as many numbers and staff as we like as we know none of that stuff\nMatters anymore you hope that the experience benefits you playing in the coal benefits which the Dodgers do not\nHave a habit of having to do but you know everything is does each and every round the postseason that it'll resets that I\nYou know these these Adam Kaufman Adam thanks for being here bundle up and enjoy the game ...\nSports reporter got hit in the Naga and with the football during a live broadcast let's listen to

Fox News secretary of state Mike Pompeo with the pointed message by the thousands of people ... to the southern us border\nA thousand new Hondurans have crossed into Guatemala\nFollowing this group of Seventy five hundred or so that's a you know parading from Mexico and you know busting through so a Guatemalan now\nIs I guess the geography where the latest caravan is is rolling through the first caravan seven thousand Seventy five hundred that was put together about two weeks ago and again there has to be a\n... there there are obviously organizational influences here I'm I'm On my uh certain it's George Soros by the way had the the little scared his house in Westchester County New York will get to that later on\nThe second caravan of saying roughly a thousand people\nAnd it is currently around the town of\nI she\nMona cheeky mullah\nC. H. I. Q. U. I. M. U. L. A. G. ... Guatemala\nSo I get ready to start hearing about a second caravan now is there any chance that the second caravan could somehow rear end the first caravan and build the merger\nWill say but that's that's breaking will get into those details later on also the latest on the migrant caravan of illegal aliens who think they're entitled\nTo declare that they're unsafe or they don't like where they are there are drug gangs or this or that or whatever the whatever the story is uh they're suddenly entitled to just crepes across a couple of thousand miles and then Boston to the United states that makes perfect sense to me right uh\nGive me a break so we'll get into the latest on the caravan we get are gone and the whole show he's single violence to that and just a bit on a lighter note but certainly a significant do for many people especially those that are spending disposable income\nWhen some people probably should spend the money elsewhere because the odds of winning this mega millions lottery are so astronomically ridiculous but\nThere are again and I want to put a couple of things in perspective and yes am I going to buy a twenty bucks worth of mega millions tickets on the way out of the studio tonight\nOr jazz or I Will so a one point six billion dollars is the estimated a jackpot but to put things into\nA a framework of understanding with all of the people all of the Americans across all of the states that and it's most of the states that have a mega millions um [noise] do you realize that on last friday's drawing\nThat only fifty nine percent of the possible combinations were take\nThat means that forty per cent tour\nForty one percent if you want to be a hundred percent I forty one percent or so of the possible combinations number wise or not chosen so that's why there was nowhere on Friday nights is clearly obviously nobody picked the winning ... but the point is with\nThis many Americans playing mega millions it shows you\nHow astronomical the odds are yes I Know you've got to be in it too when it and yeah there's always some uh you know of folks working in a meat factory that uh their their pool or one that you you know the stories that that surface on these things but it just grass this the\nHem and tens and tens and tens of millions of Americans buy tickets spending not just the two bucks for a ticket on spending twenty bucks fifty bucks some people and what happens is you know there's a there's a disproportionate number of those that are\nNot well off and they're\nSqueezing to make ends meet that that buy lottery tickets whether it's the uh you know the scratcher tickets or you know these type of drawings and a lot of folks that you know I'll just dreaming are spending money that they probably should be using for other things 'cause well their budgets are tight\nAnd they're scraping by as is and just have a lot of folks to those boats that\nI end up spending a ridiculous amount on these lotteries when the chances of winning below their terrible so again I mean this is this is mind boggling last friday the theme of this huge fever was a billion dollars\nAnd with all the people playing still forty one percent of the possible combinations\nWere chosen either manually by people or the computer's just randomly spinning out the tickets I mean that is that was that's daunting and listen to this the estimation by the mega millions folks and I think the drawn in Atlanta\nI I think that's where they do the mega millions or a drawing but by tonight\nBy this evening lottery officials for mega millions only estimate that Seventy five percent\nAre going to be sold of the possible combinations that leaves a a a a four twenty five percent of the possible combinations\nWon't be sold so does uh\nIn the Seventy five percent sold is that going to contain the winning tickets or tickets\nOr is this jak pocket a probably climb to what two billion dollars over two billion dollars by by a friday if there's no winter tonight or winners tonight I I Know it's I I find that the numbers are are are just staggering on how\nLikely it is I mean you've heard all of a deal yeah you're you're likely to get bitten by great white shark while being struck by lightning and having sexual relations with a supermodel on the cover of vogue magazine I you know as you've heard all of the [laughter]\nThe the comparisons but ... and it's it's and the people that are ... and there's nothing wrong with dreaming but just as long as you have a a good grasp on the fact that I Know that somebody ended up winning these things at some point but again\nThe odds are just so astronomically against you and then uh one of the things that I saw\nA well reading a whole variety of stories on the mega millions with the white bowls being from one to Seventy and then the mega bowl is a one to twenty five possibility with the two separate the containers with the ping pong balls\nWhat number comes up most on mega millions out the stats say since twenty ten number two the number two\nHas come up the most Ninety two times then the number twenty the number eleven number thirty one\nAnd the number seven teen and
