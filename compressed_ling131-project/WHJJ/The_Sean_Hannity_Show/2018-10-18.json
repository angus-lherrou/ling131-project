them on the streets God Knows what those pills really are the drug dealers don't give a rip that these kids die\nThen when they find out that can't afford eighty bucks the pill well then some genius idiot friend or dealer friend quote of there's there's one for heroin does much better ... totally ten dollars a bag\nAnd they'll start snorting heroin or chasing the dragon as they call it and they light up in smoke it and then eventually they're going to remain lining it and then guess what they're on a trajectory straight into the grave\nAnd a life of a living hell\nAnd that's the opioid crisis and wears a lot of those drugs coming from right over the border where's human trafficking happening right over the border what's happening all across the border there's a new thing it's called

I think it will get worse before it gets better 'cause I ain't gonna keep losing and I think\nThat they they are so alienated from most Americans that all they have left there's this kind of a meal is street violence a which in the end I think\nTurns people off it's it's it's it's it's also a little scary because it says the exclusive crew when he was shot um you know if you're conservative and you're in public life there's a certain danger level now that is totally on American and that comes entirely from the left\nYou know the thing is that's missing and and you figure it out I mean I watch the whole process when you became speaker it didn't happen overnight it started with a series of videotapes about running to transform America and it was called renewing American civilization when did you first put those tapes out\nWe first began working on it in uh Ninety two and did the first wave of tapes in Ninety three and then the second wave after I was ...\nAnd it was all based on ideas culminating in a contract with America and I I think people forget because\nYou know we've had waves of conservatives maybe if you want to start with Gary Barry Goldwater that's one it wasn't successful but it was the beginning Reagan's victory in Nineteen eighty and then subsequently in eighty four that was another big victory and and obviously the Republicans taken over Congress for the first time in forty years with your contract\nAnd I'd argue Donald Trump is the fourth leg\nAnd that is a I had everything he is doing in terms of governance is conservative even even threatened trade wars they're not they're not materialized because that's never been as attention its intention to for better trade deals freer fairer deals\nYeah I think like I I think he has the fourth oh cycle if you will of moving back from a left wing of America and we've been gaining momentum and gaining clarity and there's often tell people you know we didn't have Leonard Leo and the federalist society\nWith so many good solid conservative lawyers that we could fill up all these judicial appointments uh and that that's just a huge advantage\nAnd they're all grows out of what is now if you go back to Goldwater of fifty four year movement um but I think it's also coming to a crisis because\nTrump so clearly articulate each a pro American pro work ethic pro patriotism policy that he drives the left crazy\nAnd I think as a result the left which has gotten more extreme they haven't modulated they haven't come back to the center they've decided that their job is to beat up and intimidate those of us who disagree with them and in the end I think that just further isolates come\nSo their agenda is pretty clear they get back the house they won in peach men they want the crumbs back the largest tax cutting history which is obviously having a big impact on the economy we you know all the record unemployment numbers\nThe varying demographic groups that are doing better than they've ever done um they also want open borders but John Podesta said don't talk about immigration\nThey want to eliminate ice they want to keep Obamacare\nI'm an endless investigation I Would add to that I don't hear one positive thing that's going to create one job or make this country one bit safer not nothing that they're running on just\nThat and we hate Trump that's it\nWell I think that's right and that's partly because I think if they tried to tell us honestly what they stand for there will be defeated so badly that they just they know that they can't afford to be honest but but I think I mentioned the send your TV show last night I think that we're about to be\nA magic moment in American history and I think the two words that captured in my mind are Kavanaugh and caravan I think Kevin all the way they treated him of the viciousness the smears\nThe character assassination to childish behavior by US Senators in Senate meetings I think all that came together to really really galvanized conservatives and I think this caravan coming up from Guatemala should be a major focus\nOf Republicans for the next couple of weeks\nBecause it makes clear the argument about whether or not we have a right to be a sovereign country or whether in the\nFeinstein below sea San Francisco Democrat tradition we have an obligation to open up our border to anybody who can get finance\nAnd remember these three thousand people I I agree with Laura Ingraham is asking the question who's paying for this these three thousand people will probably cost Twenty one million dollars to move\nFrom Guatemala highly four thousand people now grown too amid a spike among a U.S border crossings but you know Nancy Pelosi actually said we are not funding the border wall\nAnd that just is it seems to be an appendage to Donald Trump's manhood I mean you know imagine anything similar said about any woman by any Republican or conservative\nI mean it's outrageous the double standard and then so flagrant but\nYou know we're we're already have paid between healthcare education criminal justice we've already paid trillions of dollars for people that didn't respect our laws and sovereign states costs the American people a fortune and by the way the ... California now we're going to be paying for their health care for free no questions asked\nBy the way we have in Georgia a democratic nominee for governor Stacey Abrams a who are clearly favors allowing illegal immigrants to vote a says the show's on draw any distinction between the people who are American citizens and people who came here illegally\nUm and that's that's sort of typical Gavin Newsom candidate for governor of California\nWho openly says he wants to have government run health care and make it available to every illegal immigrant who can get to California I mean the Democratic party is becoming the party of the galaxy the party of breaking go all the point you made earlier and a party which\nBelieves that can't win with legal American votes and so it's kind of try to find some way\nTo turn around the system and it's an amazing thing to watch develop\nI was going to get Newt Gingrich has predicted Nineteen days till election day I'll also his take on the show Gabe looks like murder and who's responsible and how the president should handle this\nPage will join us as the deep state gate gets a little deeper eh my buddies de do see we're going to get a lot of your calls and we have the other news of the day and what do we do about the caravan Nineteen days out of election day we're in Palm Beach Florida Rush Limbaugh tonight for the full hour on Hannity as we continue\n\n\nThis is Ron St pure for Greg September is here that means that sample and pumpkin season once again the Greg's pumpkin pies back blend the pumpkin and spices baked up and tasty crushed and you're going to find delicious apple desserts piled high with\nApple slices blended with spices some favorites include being delicious apples brutal apple Crispin the award winning apple pie with over five pounds of fresh apples in each and every pie\nAnd while we're on the topic of Apple's how about the apple ... garden green stumped off with red onions cravings\nHunting maple wellness grilled chicken set of cheese and chopped green apples delicious combo also available in a rural up I have had both and they are absolutely delicious and if you're looking for beverages to compliment the season Greg's is offering a variety of hot apple ... pills pumpkin martinis shipyard pumpkin headed angry orchard rows and\nSam seasonal October fest to Greg's\nFor value for cleanliness and quality in Rhode Island tradition for closing in on forty five years and follow grace USA and Instagram and Twitter and Facebook\nOff or not bound by law or something to see what's going to need some cash\nNo matter what your credit score is just go to lend a genius dot com to get access to a quick cash alone in his little is one business day that's right Linda genius dot com is the new and smart way to get cash when you need cash fast\nLinda geniuses built to help you find alone regardless of your credit score just go to lend genius dot com now\nRadio nine twenty and what will for seven\nHere's what's happening wrote on his unemployment rate and I wonder if ... percent September right three point nine percent three of the suspects an investigation of drug dealing at a bar in France and being held without bail before suspected well as the nights filled puff on ... street were drug sales were allegedly being conducted\nReleased on personal reconnaissance President Trump's top economic adviser Larry Kudlow says China not responding favorably to trade talks with the United states in sports Red Sox can advance of the world series tonight with when or the defending champion Houston Astros skipped news twenty four seven on demand that news radio R.

just kept getting crazier and crazier every day I uh I think it just uh just this week we have the Saudis that are um owning up to various things that may have happened there and you know starting investigation\nAbout things that may have happened a couple of days or or he was within the last few weeks\nI mean this is something that as you know people I've been covering up here in the United

in providing oversight um you know God willing congressmen Munoz is going to return after this election\nHis work commission good last worked as a vital Congress to no longer buffalo anymore they've got to compel the testimony of these folks I think there's a real argument for a Fifth Amendment waiver from the public statements\nThat these folks make the American public demands transparency and
