seven ...\nI have been warning almost daily repeatedly someone is gonna get hurt or worse if these mobs don't stop what they're doing now and the moms in the cases I was talking about\nYou know let's through the prism of what we know today suspicious packages pipe bombs that had been sent to Obama and the Clintons apparently and\nAnd CNN and others um how many times yesterday on this program there was a story about George Soros apparently some divisive putting his mailbox and I\nListen what am I say about George Soros yesterday like they have it on tape let me see what I said yesterday when it broke when the short story broke apparently an explosive device was found near at George Soros his home in his mailbox the New York times reported\nBillionaire left this global list or George Soros doesn't like Sean Hannity any funds a lot of groups that will love this show to go away\nI Want to be clear with everybody this crap has got to stop this crap\nHas got to stop this is you know we we have an election and Thirteen Days and on almost ... you could see this building and building and building and building Rand Paul was very outspoken somebody is going to get killed\nI was the person saying during the Kavanaugh hearings hey we we got to clear the halls this so one of the senators is going to end up getting assaulted or worse\nYou got to clear the holes you can't let these activists you know getting in the faces spinning it Lindsey Graham holding up elevators screaming at Sanders ... when you can't let this continue but there's it's obvious but what's gonna happen to somebody\nAnd and I haven't heard any of my colleagues on the left warning that this was a bad thing I didn't hear a lot of people on the left all that upset that Sarah Sanders and her children\nWere run out of a restaurant and then they go to another restaurant and they were followed over there for crying out loud\nOr the video of secretary Nielsen ... sitting and eating a meal\nAnd these left wing lunatics screaming at secretary Nielsen till she has to get up and walk out of the restaurant we have the video up Pam Bondi who's going to a movie for crying out loud and what she had to go through with a left wing mob\nAnd then of course Senator Ted Cruz and his his wife\nId they go to sit down at a restaurant\nThere run out right and they get right in your grill right in your face\nYou know it's an amazing thing that they keep doing this to women or guys that are with their wives it culminated this weekend is now the fourth time that Senator McConnell has now had to deal with this he's just sitting in a restaurant with his wife Elaine Chao there just eating that's all there\nHe's not working is on his off time some guy comes literally right up to the table to bangs on the table\nAnd then ... rips off some of the food from the table opens the restaurant door which is adjacent to the scene where Mitch McConnell is and throws the guy's food out in the street\nAnd then starts screaming at the top of his lungs\nAnd then of course Kevin McCarthy's office gets it with a Boulder busting his office window\nAnd I didn't hear anybody condemning any of this certainly during the Kavanaugh hearings nobody on the left set a word about their leftist activists they love the pressure that they were putting on Jeff Flake and and other people there they didn't say paying Feinstein wasn't speaking out\nLindsey Graham getting spit on nobody speaking out these incidents that have happened to these conservative women's I don't see the coverage hour by hour second by second\nYou know but if Donald Trump calls the news media fake news and they do give you fake news\nThere is some truth to fake news and they just hate Trump twenty four seven you should have seen the yesterday the graphics because he said I'm not a global list I'm I'm an American first nationalist well does that mean that is or racist ...\nYou know is he a white nationalist no he said he's a nationalist\nAnd his policies are the irony is all of the failure and the disproportionate failure under Obama's policies towards African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans and women in the workplace they weren't just disproportionately impacted by the horrific\nPolicies are bronco bombing sat there for eight years did nothing to curb the violence even at his own home city\nWhere people are dying now you have a few famous people that have had these suspicious packages that had been sent and let me be very clear you know leading up to this I had been saying this is not going to end well\nSomebody's done and get hurt I don't want anybody hurt I don't want any Democrat hurt I don't want any Republican hurt I don't want any American her I don't want anyone in the caravan hurt\nIt ought not be crisis precipitated at the border because Mexico allows people to march you know three thousand miles up to the United states\nYou want to avoid confrontations like this if you can\nSo we had a pipe bomb suspicious packages sent to the Clintons home and ... similar package to Obama's home one to CNN New York headquarters\n... and apparently the one yesterday George Soros is home in Westchester New York suspicious packages center Debbie Wasserman Schultz says officer investigating one that might have gone to Maxine Waters\nOffice you\nKnow with all the rhetoric from Spartacus get in their face older kick them they go low we kick them\nHillary Clinton we can't be civil with them less of course we win\nYou know Maxine what did she say get a crowd if you see them you get a crowd you follow them in a restaurant sing department stores in gas stations and you tell them they're not wanted anywhere anymore\nAnd watching it happened to all these Republicans as any of this you know we don't know what the intentions are a lot of people are speculating what the intentions are\nUm you know let me be very clear I Know I Know first hand what all of this is like\nMy thoughts and prayers go out to anybody that has to deal with this today I've had similar incidences of security in my life you know Linda\n... you know somebody that we both care for very very dearly a girl that worked for us for years she's been on the radio occasionally\nYou know I remember when we had the white powder scent the Fox news and she literally had to spend an entire eight nine hours in isolation because we thought at the time it was anthrax that\nWas sent I don't get packages anymore my life uh and and far worse in terms of threats it's sad but if you're in the public eye this happens more than I Will disclose here it's not about me today\nBut I Know many other conservatives that have had the same thing happen if you go back just three weeks ago maybe people born is alarms that\nBut it was from the minute the news broke this morning the media's on Wall to wall with reports of suspicious packages and you know that were sent to the Clintons Obama Eric Holder is another one and you know I think it's a huge story I Do it's a scary story\nBut if you go back just three weeks ago how many ... do you even know that race in letters deadly rice and letters\nWere actually sent to President Trump's defense secretary James Mattis or FBI Director Christopher Wray our CIA director Gina Haspel and other top officials in fact\nThat story got so little coverage that I barely remembered it until I saw a report on one of the Web sites earlier today that it was only three weeks ago that that it happened here\nAnd then of course we can take it back to the ... the shooting\nWhen Steve skull east nearly lost his life and to this day he struggles and has had so many operations that barely were able to save this guy's life that day\nBut for the heroin hurt the heroism of to brave Capitol police officers that took on a guy with a rifle that well had cover and walked in the middle of a baseball field it's almost a suicide mission to defend people\nI I never saw such heroism it was amazing\nBut you think of the rhetoric that we've been hearing and the build up to all of this and everyone else has been silent\nThis isn't about left or right when when we found out that the that skill leases shooter happened to be a Bernie Sanders supporter Sean Hannity didn't go on the air and say see I blame burning I just I did the opposite\nI don't know how he can hold Bernie Sanders responsible\nFor the actions of of one of his ... supporters he's not responsible for that\nBut the media today and their their reaction to this\nIs so over the top so outrageous so disgusting leap partisan it just they're so quick to blame President Trump Fox\nNews talk radio\nYou got this NBC reporter saying that these packages shouldn't be written off as the work of an extremist fringe but rather mainstream Republican media outlets like Fox News and talk radio you know this jackass maybe needs to go back and hear my history because I've got the tapes when Obama was

bamboozled the people in the states\nI'm you know it's a one of the things that I Am I I'm not surprised that but it 'cause it's all too predictable and that is this rush to judgment now that we have\nThese the what looks like suspicious packages some powder maybe pipe bombs all this is going to be vetted out in the days to come the president has reacted very strongly today let off an opioid bill signing event at the White House\nAnd uh he was with the vice president he retweeted the vice president's comments on the emergency and condemning the bomb like incidents and online statements as\nMedia outlets left wing politicians you know around the country we've got to protect our politicians they getting suspicious packages in the mail um\nWe know that is this happened to Donald Trump's family we know recently happened to Don junior and his family we\nKnow that it has happened just rice in letters were sent to Trump in Madison ray and Haspel just three weeks ago and I frankly don't really remember any of the coverage in that particular case\nUm there is an assumption here because it is CNN and it is\nIt though Obama and holder and Debbie Wasserman Schultz and the Clintons the assumption is that this is political which by the way is\nProbably you know some fringe person out there somewhere or it could very well be and and obviously the temperatures been hot\nAs we've been hearing Democrats say they can't be civil and kick 'em and we watch mobs confronting Republicans all over the country every day and not one Democrat that I Know is spoken out and said stop attacking Sarah Sanders secretary Nielsen stopped confronting people like Pam Bondi\nStop confronting Henry Kissinger stop throwing boulders through the office of Kevin McCarthy\nMay have been watching this on a regular basis\nYou know it's a very scary thing for anybody to have to live through\nUm what's amazing again is to watch the professionalism of our law enforcement\nI mean I've known people on the bomb squad and on the NYPD they have their absolute finest in the country as they did their work today and and we've had no incident so far at all we don't know if they're alive we'll get updates from shore throughout the day\nNow the president says we cannot tolerate these cowardly act so strongly condemn all of those who choose violence first lady said as much as well\nThe president said the safety of the American people as my highest that absolute priority so the full weight of our government is being deployed to conduct this investigation and bring those responsible for these despicable act the justice we'll spare no resources or expense in this effort\nAnd I just want to tell you that in these times we have to unify we have to come together and we have to send

rice and letters were sent to the president and secretary of defense Mattis indoor FBI Director ray and to our CIA director Gina Haspel\nAnybody even hear about that I\nDidn't hear a lot of concern

condemning whoever is responsible for sending these items and even then he's getting criticized you know you would think listening to the media that it was him who sent them\nAnd meanwhile they been silent with all these public confrontations Bernie look\nI've lived in New York a long time um it's been a while I don't get mail anymore but I've had the white powder scare I had a an assistant a mind quarantine for about nine hours while they were testing out whether anthrax spores were in the package it turned out thankfully that was not the case\nWe saw that a lot after nine eleven\n[noise] you know what's on it this kind of reminds me of that because the after nine eleven I think it was the first month anniversary a after nine eleven we actually got anthrax or at city hall\nWe got a a a B C and D C I remember getting a call from Tom Brokaw cause producers I'm In and this is what that reminds me of however uh people have to keep in mind right now\nWe don't know these packages these devices are real um you don't know who sent ... what the purpose was\nUm we're going to hear about a lot of false alarms and the next two days perhaps um but I Would and and I think Dan may agree with me here [noise] I Would predict given that they found these devices says and they knock them without that they that\nUh I predict they're going to have somebody they're going to have a target suspect with the next two or three days what\nMakes you think that Bernie [noise] [noise] well ... when you get an aide to stuff but you know you blow to pieces gets harder to collect the evidence that you could\nSend to a ... a machine right so now you have a package it's so uh the mail or the the stamps were writing the device ... side they're going to break this stuff down wherever\nHow long it took to find the Unabomber I remember that case\nYeah but you know what Sean tons of different times of different technologies get for no mailing list of those different there's and there's so many packages lose a this is a benefit to law enforcement right now\nIn other words they have more packages and and look on the surface it would look like band bon gene okay it's going to Democrats it's going to a liberal CNN that might people might think well this might be right off the top of their head they're per suspect would be well might be some radical\nConservative but we don't know that we don't know anything right now\nYou know and and there's a lot of the way I wouldn't even call them as they wouldn't be a conservative they'd be an anarchist if they were\nYeah I mean this is going to be condemned as it should be by everybody I mean no one is that devices that no one on one with a straight face acceptable in polite conversation\nIncentive vices violence on public officials and anyone who does um is a moron and Savage I think there's a period hole stop there but with regard to the Unabomber thing Sean you're right it it it takes them a long time but remember what the Unabomber he was a little more tactically a strategically devious he would send those bombs\nAnd there'd be an extended period of time between each one where he actually develop a new kind of a ... that said ways to put those in construct those bombs together is very difficult [noise] waves is\nThey're basically you know ... ... nations whoever this was you may have done this so it's going to be really hard for them not to have left behind in any of these multiple devices any clues but there's a part of me that police shown that\nThis person or persons I'm wanting to be caught I mean some of the stuff is amateurish on I'll give you a quick example I mean one of these devices sent to CNN was addressed to John Brennan\nWho does that work at the end I mean it's hard to figure out you just go to the Internet and you could figure out the John Brennan and then you know it'd be the comet he's not a CNN\nCountry of this is just basic stuff I mean think about it if you were a enough of the Savage in an animal to want to hurt someone or hurt someone in the mail processing facility you think you do like basic homework like that so it's very amateurish the construction of it um from my experience in this this is amateurish as well and you\nKnow I agree with the a former commissioner that I I think it'll be a matter of a few days before someone or or a group of people are caught I Hope they are but\nEverybody hopes they are and you know usually these things come in rapid succession a commissioner and I would expect that that might be the case here although it seems to slow down so down at least for today\nWell listen you started on Monday was Soros\nRight and then you out a number of these things come in today we'll see what happens to borrow a like I said we're also going to hear a lot of false alarms in the aftermath of the anthrax attacks in New York City when you got ... courage just in New York city there were hundreds and hundreds of false alarms over the next two weeks\nSo we'll hear about that but um you know I I agree with that I think we can a couple of days um they're going to have a target or at least you know somebody there to look at because there's just way too much here um gets been captured\nWouldn't you first be looking for some radical fringe we often after these for example school shootings find that people telegraph what they're going to do ahead of time and\nI've got to assume here that maybe that would be the case as well that this was some type of radical extremists that that maybe doesn't like certain politicians or could have been Harris I mean you just don't know right\nNow given the right one your analysis of the school shooting is absolutely correct the secret service didn't exhaust their study on that Sean and that is exactly what they discovered that a lot of these people engaged in this targeted violence even political violence political assassination that's why the secret service ironically\nGot into analyzing school shootings through the national threat assessment center they found very similar patterns of behavior that telegraphing which you just described directly so\nSo it wouldn't surprise me again given what I see I used to have an obviously haven't analyze these devices but having seen what the press is put out\nAnd went to the media they seem to be a very amateurish devices that foremost somebody either you know what they were doing a march sophisticated enough thankfully I'm to successfully pull this off again thank God or\nThey somehow wanted to get caught like we saw on that bombing in in in Austin but you seem to be so ridiculously amateurish that they that they almost weren't even trying to hide it and it's just a very bizarre uh this whole cases very bizarre even looked Sean even look at something like the packaging\nI notice the oversized hyping the pictures the media is put out about these devices I mean you're basically telegraphing to anyone who's done this kind of stuff like me and the commissioner who has some experience in the space\nBook this package just suspicion here's this big oversized hyping it there's something about this\nWay with the orange commission and where where would you where would you start\nWell this is there's one other thing that that we haven't mentioned and that is or what if it's a hoax what is not one of these devices will what if they're not real at all and this person lunatic wherever it is I'm just wondering Mr commotion and intimidate\nUm why does a good possibility given uh what what Dan saying the the the amateur hour a look of the packages I Would uh you know I'd be skeptical and ah I wait on the the outcome of the forensics and the the ...\nI mean I may ask you do agree with that\nThe simple question\nHe goes no one answer because he hung up to harder question Craig you have thirty seconds Greg\nGo\nAhead Greg real quick oh hey Sean great cast to listen to ... big big honor um I was blessed enough to go to be a rally out here in Houston and it was just amazing to hear President Trump speaking person\nA it gave me so much hope because my sister brought my little nephew and a Thirteen year old kid hung on every single word that a President Trump had to say and joining read about\nThat because you get to see the energy in action so force of nature to help make this country better than it is\nNow ... what does that to be you could start with let's think of other things that starts wouldn't be a\nWho cares about the other thing is for you for that stuff that we can be

number three British send the phony fake bony fraud wire hypocrite from Tennessee you got Claire McCaskill the pony lying hypocrite manipulate trying to manipulate the voters in Missouri and Heidi Heitkamp will be a super liberal\nBut she's not going to tell you that until after the election anyway project beret toss it CEO founder James O'Keefe strikes again how are\nYou a showing great to be with you and yeah this is number three it's it's more of the same this Heidi Heitkamp director and\nWashington DC campaign office or speaking candidly about when she gets elected she's going to go really hard left she'll be quote super liberal unquote at that point so he's describing the bait and switch that once again the red state Democrats have to do in these battleground states to get elected\nWhat's so amazing is that consistency here is that is that they are telling their staff one thing they're saying things privately that they'll never say publicly\nIn the hopes that they came basically lie to bamboozled whatever term you want to use the voters in their state in the case of brightest and even calling the people at Tennessee ignorant in the hopes that they'll get that seat and then they'll they'll be a a basically a Chuck Schumer senator for the state\nYeah just so that your listeners if you haven't seen every video a video in Missouri we did where were they were talking about Obama's using Claire McCaskill's views and the staffer says Obama and the ... will have the same using everything but quote people just can't know that\nWell in this video this video released last night on your show Sean there's this another guy Gordon is his name he's the staffer in and Heidi Heitkamp Fargo North Dakota campaign office\nAnd we and we see an Obama poster in the office there's a big one of those are the Obama looks like the messiah on the wall this big poster\nBut then they took it down right before the press came so we asked why did you take the Obama poster down and the staffer says well because the presses here and and we take it down when the press comes is what Heidi Heitkamp staff the same\nSo it's more it's basically the same thing in each of these red states\nThey have to mislead they have to want to moderate voters and play the progressive base well we just have them on tape saying it and we all know that Heidi is is liberal but\nShe's going to be selling liberate once you get selected staffers are emphasizing it here and they also say that she's not going to run again so because this what Jesse overturned says in the studio quote she doesn't want to run again so she'll just do good work while she can which means that she'll do the things that she can't talk about right now\nIt's just so revealing but I I think this is really this is not an accident that you're getting very similar responses and every place you have now gone\nI mean these are three big huge massive Senate races and you have caught three major Senate candidates all admitting that they ... they're lying to the people of their state to get elected\nBut I Would argue that it ... represents the entirety of the Democratic party we now know what goes Maxine Waters told us that are parties told or they don't want me to say it they want me to stop saying it but I'm not going to stop saying it impeach forty five ... well that's it yeah but\nIt's ... it's particularly true in these red states there's a there's a kind of a story here that we found that were confirming suspicion is that if we do it very tossed we confirms suspicions\nAnd we've always known this to be true but my point is just have integrity\nDoes it it's not really left or right thing I was at the first time in conference with all these big hon chosen media who were ... you know very cheering and and hearing it may I suggest have integrity this is about just doing what you say you're going to I think it's more pronounced in the red states with these Democrats running because\nThey have to lie to the moderates they have to work with the moderates and ... and they can only make one choice one but he did not take a choice\nLying is this a purposeful misinformation and propaganda campaign 'cause they have no intention of doing what they say they're going to do they have a very different uh\nAnd the the people working for them know that they have a very different agenda and so they're really just lying manipulating I mean it is the worst of the worst in terms of politics\nBecause there's an open contempt hatred and a feeling of superiority that Claire McCaskill has that bill brightest and hasn't Heidi Heitkamp as towards the people of their state\nPenn well they do it so hateful Sean that Claire McCaskill has asked for a special prosecutor\nTo look into me he asked her opponent Josh Hawley who's the attorney general I've never met Josh I yeah I don't I don't he doesn't work for me I never talk to anybody in his staff but McCaskill asked should be a special prosecutor to investigate project Vera ties\nTo investigate hair on camera speaking her own words or are there any restrictions in the state of Missouri about filming people\nNo I Know and it it it turns out to the attorney general asking for me to be investigated his like someone telling you not to go on the radio and talk it's it's it's it's it's perfectly legal for me to do what I Do in\nMissouri there in Pennsylvania I Can't do it Illinois I Can't do it but thirty eight states I can record people as long as I'm In the room with them and I'm reporting and it and let me say something else Sean if it's wrong for me\nTo go Under Cover and record these folks and how wrong is it for them to mislead the voters if it's ... it's not fraud for me to record people\nBut it's certainly approaches fraud for her to misrepresent in such a awful way\nAnd and thank you Claire McCaskill for doing that and asking for me to be prosecuted because now every TV station and misery

Y. T. a PD bomb disposal truck when they were leaving I order when they were bringing the bomb out\nThe the pipe bomb or the suspicious package\nI was listening to the level of city block I mean it would probably blow somebody's face off\nA and and their fingers in hands off but if if it if it's a viable bomb and\nAnd authorities have said that leads to George Soros bomb was viable but now this was in the street I didn't rip it down but not this is real this is official or police or NYPD caution tape from the incident which I collected just a little while ago\nSo now I did say a couple of pictures those are on my Twitter feed again you ought to follow me on Twitter folks at Todd Smith\nMy Twitter is AT T O D the S. C. H. N. I. T. T. N. as in November Todd Schmidt at ... because I took several pictures of the media throngs and actually if you were watching cable news earlier\nThere was a bomb disposal truck that was parked in to a doorway into a an inference garage or that goes into the underground parking area in the service area of the time laughter center and I walked by that every day\nAnd that's where the bomb disposal truck was that side of the street is still blocked off but I was able to walk on the south side on fifty a street or on the uh the south side of the time Warner center and I took some pictures again I tweeted all these out and they're on my Twitter feed\nAt Todd ... at AT T O D day at the age and I teach the now I have phones already loaded we'll go to phones here and just a bit I Want to go over the facts as we know them I'm looking at\nThe the current rundown of who got suspicious packages now this goes back to yesterday and the George Soros story and I\nSaid flat out I said loud and clear on this show that I the poor in Georgia sources politics\nThe money he spends a the ideas he tries to a push and foment I don't like George Soros at all I don't want any injury or ill will or her to come to George Soros I can still be vehemently opposed to his political strategies and ideas and his\nActivism as funding but I don't want the guy blown up by a pipe bomb nor do I want any of his staff\nAnd that's why I was very clear on yesterday's program that there is no place known room whatsoever for whoever put this and George Soros his mailbox\nIn northern Westchester county in New York that I Hope that they are apprehended and brought to justice and then of course here we are twenty four hours later and we're discussing all these other pipe bombs which authorities believe that it's all related\nNow the interesting thing on the sorrows\nPipe bomb I came to mind none of these have detonated\nIncredible and you know as far as this ought to be a treasure trove of clues I mean even if they did explode there should be a ton of clues on these on detonated bombs in packages that hopefully authorities will be able to hone in on\nWhoever did this and we'll go over those details in just a second but with the Soros package there are numerous reports that they believe that that package might've been home delivered and place that his mailbox\nSo I mean that bring somebody maybe to the scene or is it a career was the actual bomb major was it some do that was just pain to deliver a package you know who knows but I hand delivered and then we have what happened today so the Soros a package that we have\nWas delivered to CNN which caused this huge evacuation of the CNN New York headquarters at Columbus Circle and a fifty eighth and fifty nights for\nA\n... this this this this building is a humongous building restaurants and shops there there's more there's a giant whole foods in the basement of the time Warner center which is a zoo I Would avoid that one at all costs by the way\nYou've got CNN with their studios it's just a a lot of activity you've got residential and the time Warner center so you got a hotel the or is it the Mandarin is is on me the north side of the places a gigantic complex they just to be the old New York coliseum\nWhich was abandoned in shuttered for years I used to walk by that\nWhen I used to work at W. P. O. J. radio back in Nineteen Ninety One and Nineteen Ninety two I used to live right down the street\nSo it's a beautiful complex so CNN or they get this package but the curious thing on the CNN package it was addressed to John Brennan\nFormer CIA director John Brennan very outspoken very critical of President Trump but the issue is here John Brennan does not work for CNN\nJohn Brennan is contracted to MSNBC and remember when he had a security clearance strip by President Obama or by uh by President Trump brother he had his security clearance that was a big story so it was intentional or what was this just a goof up\nSo to to send the pipe bomb to John Brennan chair of CNN at ten Columbus Circle New York New York one double o two three whenever the zip is over I you know that that was was it a goof\nThat was that a a mistake because if they were trying to set the John Brennan the trip and care of M. S. N. B. C. and not CNN also\nIn the pack and sent to CNN and John Brennan is also some kind of a white powder in an envelope so not only the explosive device but also some type of white powder that another package was sent\nTo Hillary Clinton an explosive device was sent to the Clinton residents in chapter ... also west Chester county not far from Soros\nAnd that was in throughout a intercepted by the secret service member rock Obama\nOr was sent to his Washington DC residents upper rock Obama was also the recipient\nOf one of these explosive devices as well on the latest now is Maxine Waters a package was intercepted at the congressional mail facility and that was apparently address the Maxine Waters are very outspoken we you know we don't need to go over a you know her issues and problems\nUh Eric Holder and this is where things get even more interesting\nThere was a report that Eric Holder got a suspicious package and Debbie Wasserman Schultz got a suspicious package here's the deal\n[noise] [noise] yeah the package was addressed to Eric Holder\nBut the package was attempted to be delivered to Eric Holder the address was not a good address and it was return to sender\nAnd whoever this little joker is that's doing these pipe bombs and packages\nThey put Debbie Wasserman Schultz is sunrise Florida congressional office as the return address that to suggest that Debbie Wasserman Schultz that the package they're called but no that wasn't the case\nSo the package goes back without a little added little joke kind of like the blues brothers and ah they gave the address of of ah Wrigley Field now you know ... whatever it was that the whole deal here with the the Debbie Wasserman Schultz\nReturn address so that gets the return 'cause it was on deliverable to the Eric Holder address\nAnd then it goes back to Wasserman Schultz that there was a report that Governor Andrew Cuomo in New York on a package that\nMrs runs St Peter coming up Thursday morning if I'm getting ready to swim in a sea of negativity between now and election day I'll explain well the U.

the Trump family I remember\nEarlier this year there was a Massachusetts man he was charged with sending in ... which was sent to Donald Trump junior\nAnd ah that's one that his wife and opened up\nAnd I I Believe there was a maybe some ... white powder and that but there was no one if I'm not mistaken that said ah you're getting what you deserve something to that effect but they've all received threats and and white powder Eric Trump has Donald Trump junior\nOr all kinds of threats against the president obviously so you know this this goes both ways I listen to it takes it to a whole new level if\nSomebody is mailing explosive devices and according to the authorities or at least with the the Soros device we heard yesterday and and this morning that the device sent to George Soros his house\nOr was potentially a viable explosive device but what's interesting here is that\nNone of these devices have detonated these that intentional or is that due to a clumsiness on the

this is yet to be determined if you're on hold hang on going to grab your calls in just a second this is going to be a pretty damn heavy topic as you know the series of rolling in\nAnd everyone's

irresponsible let's find out the facts and let the investigation proceed and hopefully they'll be in a raft of will figure out what kind of a a sick oh did this\n... year investigating but\nOne thing I disagree with you is that the idea that nothing that a Trump that I'm not saying Trump persuade encourage the person but Trump has permitted hatred Trump has permitted fear Trump liked him courses like a congressman tax reporter talks about attacking all during his rallies\nThere because you know as you said and means of American people journalist\nYou'll have to think this has nothing to do that\nI mean ... ... you're listening or is the president responsible enough I chastising of I ... as you know I voted for Trump I don't always agree with Trump\nAnd I'm not afraid on this show is the conservative American and a broadcast I'm not afraid to tell you when Trump is not knocking it under the park and when he's a striking out and I I Do both on a regular basis but ah you know Jerry a\nCouple of things as far as you know the the congressman in the body slamming I spoke out against that they have the gene forte rally in Montana\nAnd I I don't think that it's funny to make fun of that that was that was a battery and that's and that's not that's not funny but again I'm not willing to suggest that the the president because\nHe has been unconventional or he is a you know fomenting anger and riled up crowds\nAnd he's turned crimes against ah the opposite side or the media I'm not gonna even jump on the possibility yet that the Trump cause this individual to send these ah these pipe bombs in the mail or have them delivered Jerry thanks for the call let's go to Boise idaho\nAnd Frank Frank you're next on Schmidt hello\nHello Frank here yeah I I just wanted to make a point that none of these people's sorrows Obama Hillary Clinton none of these people when's the last time that they go get their own mail\nThere and walk they don't go out to their mailbox and pick up their male so this was a a worthless attempt at attention that's all I see from it and that's really all I have to say\nFrank and Frank was a good point because you're right on the source of going out to collect his mail order or the Clintons so if these devices went off most likely or it could have affected and hurt whatever help for employee they have\nUnless it was put in a pile and then the
