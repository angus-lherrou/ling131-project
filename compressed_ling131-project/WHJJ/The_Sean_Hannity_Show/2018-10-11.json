Fox News hurricane Michael leaving a trail of destruction in the Florida Panhandle making landfall this morning as a category ... storm uprooting trees and gown and power lines at least one person has died in the store\nWith the cat to a that is up across parts of Georgia came onshore one thirty here we are almost six hours later and we still have a cat two hurricane all the way inland across parts of Georgia and if you look at the statistics by when this is the fourth strongest we've ever soon make landfall in the U.S\nA roofing materials just seeing ... two by fours\nAnd uh a looming aluminum garnering all over the place that again a little lots of materials and debris in the water\nAnd we're seeing some of the some of the uh as far as the storm surge and again some of the purchase of nine to Thirteen feet or in some of the images I'm seeing every bit of that because we're seeing water\nOr up to the rules of houses water up I mean extreme severe flooding with this storm surge in Mexico beach or Florida\nOr so again I I'm just hoping that we're not going to be dealing with the heavy death toll the damage toll is going to be high folks\nI'm just hoping that again the storm surge is a killer it will drown you water is like a wall of concrete coming at you and an amazing speed and people say oh I'll I'll be\nA false water will hit you like a ton of bricks\n\nListen folks don't it'll flash flooding I mean you know unless they're out in a for instance of those that are out of the devil at the desert southwest you know those that are listening in Las Vegas right now when you when you head outside of Vegas you know you you guys have seen even in Vegas so it was some years ago the flash flooding that occurred there and the cars\nBeing swept off the roads and as you drive through the desert areas you'll you'll see some of the run all the areas where you have the flood zones you'll see the flood warnings and you'll see you know where where water can come in from the hills and and just completely annihilate\nAnd that's always a dangerous I think folks are hopefully have a grasp on the dangers of water now the other big story today is is Wall Street getting hammered\nOr the Dow fell even more uh we shot or our number one down about two minutes before the top of the hour or we are left with about a minute and a half left\nIn the trading day on Wall street and uh the numbers folks are they ain't pretty awful day on Wall street folks ah the total is that we have S. and P. down Ninety five points\nThe Dow Jones industrial average down eight hundred thirty one points\nAnd the NASDAQ down down a thirty one the NASDAQ down three Fifteen and the S. and pay down Ninety four point six the second I'm Sorry three Fifteen\nSo I'm not a doubt down a thirty one the\nNASDAQ down three Fifteen and the S. and P. down Ninety four\nPoint sixty six almost Ninety five so awful day\nWall Street and and what caused that storm well that's a pretty much you know tech stocks getting hammered the fears of rising interest rates\nAnd uh we're essentially and a decline now this is the biggest decline in a well he's got to be what six months or so uh I think the last big decline that we we saw I think you have to go back to march\n... so you know leave out on the stock market role here and uh we're we're looking at some numbers that certainly are are giving a traders and investors and and\nFour one K. holders a little bit of a little kitten their stomach today but almost Ninety five so awful day\nOn Wall street and and what caused that storm well that's a

the eye and that is now fully a on a shore the eye of the hurricane looks to be\nA looks about I don't know forty miles or so thirty miles or so to the north west of Tallahassee right now about to get him to south western Georgia\nAnd south western Georgia hasn't seen as he liked his folks you've got a lotta timber you've got a lot of pine trees\nYou have a lot of paper mills paper companies a road companies you know making two by fours and plywood and paper products there in that area you have a lot of forest so I Would imagine it's going to be a lot of pine trees down\nAs this storm still continues\nAlong this this path and ah\nYou know still with you know category three and and category for gusts folks ah this is just nasty and I just hope the folks in South western Georgia are prepared because I don't think they've seen anything like this in quite some time\nAnd the ice still looks are remarkably formed a because there's so much energy being sucked in from the the outer bans into this a storm because of the ... how big this is\nA so hey I'll go to phones here when we have a a moment here on Schmidt there's a lot of ground to cover ... Trump speaking to ABC News or there's some very interesting audio to process layer or that Saudi journalist or the Saudi journalist that is missing\nA there are reports that U.S intelligence knew\nThat he was going to be a target ... so I Want to drill into that coming up in just a bit and also we have some idiocy them to light and some of the moments today yes some more on the news and there's one that involves\nA squirrel on an airplane ya can't make this crop up folks and that's all on the way on Schmidt so I urge you to stand by on a very very busy Wednesday sponsor this\nHalf hour here on Schmidt is light streamed dot com and I've got a message I'm sure for many of the Schmidt listeners that are listening to the program now if you have\nCredit card debt\nIf you're carrying dead if you're making that minimum payment or um got maybe a little more every month\nMost of you are getting whacked with ridiculously high interest rates on the credit card debt that you're carrying\nBecause why do I noticed with the case because the average credit card interest rate is over Eighteen percent a PR that is ridiculous so\nThis week in Nineteen eighty eight pink Floyd the\nDark side of the moon finally left billboards ... two hundred album charts after record breaking seven hundred and forty one week this week in Nineteen Ninety any better flies from his home in San Diego to Seattle where he meets his Pearl Jam band mates for the first time it starts a week of recording to become the fault of their debut album can\nBetter was chosen based on vocals he added two or three songs instrumental demo that the ban may\nAnd if we can twenty twelve record label Boston him I recall the vinyl anniversary edition of the Beatles love after discovering they had accidentally printed version that included session musician Andy right playing drums and it brings us our copies of the desk featuring the wrong person for reportedly selling on ... ah\nThere's or look back at home\nIt may be hard to believe but people just like you are already saving money feeding the pig dot org makes it easy they're simple savings plans friends you gonna finish that grape men are one of my mouth\nYou don't need to stop buying the necessities what you're smelling is natural mosque you you don't need to be a medical test subject how do you see him\nWill [laughter] sometimes you don't need to get a second job in the ...

yo\n\n\n[noise]\nWas talking about climate today and\nWhat what's going on with this is hurricane and it's just nasty some of the video that is beginning to come in you know it's just sort of a parallel here 'cause we're dealing with\nWe're dealing with the climate and the hurricanes a current or here in the United states they'd been happening since the beginning of time folks\nAnd yet this on record to be the strongest hurricane to hit the panhandle uh or at least since Eighteen fifty one but I'm pretty confident that prior to record\nIt's being kept there have been many many years ago centuries ago hurricanes as strong or stronger that have hit the coast because they've always been around\nHurricanes have always been a threat to the obvious areas and ... and and typhoons et cetera so the obvious areas on the planet but you know it's in here we're talking about the climate to at least and the hurricane activity but also we have this political climate we have\nTorrential rain and wins in our political climate and\nSaw for instance a Rand Paul Rand Paul has said that in this political climate or somebody may get killed\nAnd I don't think Rand Paul is that far off let's look at the damages or his nut job neighbor did to him so I Want to get into that in just a bit but as far as the political climate\nAnd the fact that Democrats are vying they're making every possible uh attempt to take back the house of representatives and to make inroads or there is a pipe dream that the Democrats are hoping to take back\nThe Senate and of course was in the house in the Senate in the hands of the Democrats would certainly cripple a good deal of what President Trump wants to accomplish all is a good thing just in case that he's gotten a lot of cup was including two Supreme Court nominations by talking and\nSpeaking of the political climate that exists right now and I told you about President Trump or just a few minutes ago I I told you about his tweet that he is going to keep going to Pennsylvania for a rally in the Erie, Pennsylvania ear or area tonight\nOr as to as he pointed not disappoint the thousands of people that are already there and the thousands of people that will be coming\nBut the political climate\nWhen you look toward the U.S Senate\nOr there's something very important that we need to attach to this current hurricane\nAnd that is that there is a a a democratic seat in the Senate\nWhich is held by Senator Bill Nelson now and Bill Nelson is being challenged by the Florida governor Rick Scott now Rick Scott obviously leading up to this hurricane and in the aftermath\nHas been very visible he will be very visible he is in the past gotten very good marks or for some of the natural disasters in tropical activity in hurricane to the state of Florida during his a two term tenure as Florida governor however let me be very clear here\nWhat could make or break a governor Rick Scott in his quest\nTo take this scene away from the Democrat Bill Nelson in Florida for the U.S Senate or is going to be I think viewed through the lens of how the aftermath of this hurricane goes listen we're we're a month shy here of the midterm elections\nWe're right around a month shy so Rick Scott as governor of Florida is going to be judged and he's going to be put under an extreme microscope right now and this could be the make or break\nSo the way the state of Florida under the direction of Governor Scott handles the aftermath of this hurricane I think is going to have an amazing impact on weather and the polling has been a pretty close to ... do we what's the latest a a real clear politics average getting giving the latest\nSo I I feel the youngest is trying to you know how Milan\n... here in the sense that uh you know you're going to be accused of not standing with women\nWomen so as an accusation is made you just take that accusation that one hundred percent face value with out any type of proof\n'cause I Want any molester I Want any sexual assault or prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law\nBut again speaking of climate again you know here in this tough political climate and we know that it was already talked about to stop cabin on all costs\nAnd then we have this this uh this waterfall of accusations that come out and and a bunch of unsubstantiated claims\nOf course you need proof that's only fair that that there's proof so I thought for millennia hit the nail on my head\nI think I'm a lawyer Trump made a whole lot of sense so much sense that it's hard to figure out how anyone including the Democrats could argue any differently yes ah people should be heard but if you make the accusation there needs to be some proof\nNo there have been some high profile claims in the past that we're we're totally false you can look at the the uh the University of North Carolina lacrosse a story member that\nWhat propelled that embassy fill a Al Sharpton to prominence the to wanna Brawley story of the accusation made and completely false it was a total fabrication never happen\nNow of course there are many more examples of where things did happen and women were abused but you also have some of these high profile cases where it was complete fabrication and then there were lives\nSo I just don't know how you can [laughter] you'd be upset with the first lady\nAh in saying that hey you I Want to list all accusers here but you you need them some proof\n\nI I I think she was spot on but you've got the first lady here coming under attack\nBy doing that to me because sometimes\nI mean she's making a ton of sense\nAnd you can't go too far [laughter]\n[noise] so I'm a little more to this all want to play and we have more time more snow [noise]\nFollowing is not an actor but a real life

I Hope the people of Wisconsin finally remember that but we now have Walker one poll finally up by one but it's very very close a we have a Georgia governor race that's also closer than I Would like for comfort\nOr with the Republican camp up by two and so we're following that raised pretty closely um in some of the other races that were watching the president's approval rating now is doing very very well is that what fifty one percent and Rasmussen\nAnd so we'll watch that but I think if you look at Heidi Heitkamp I think she's going to be and should be defeated in North Dakota\nI Hope the people of Montana will pay attention and understand that\nBasically have Chuck Schumer junior because John tester always goes with Chuck Schumer\nAnd the people in Montana that can take back that state which is a red state then you've got other states like Indiana I think Joe Donnelly can be defeated in Indiana\nI think definitely Claire McCaskill she ought to be sent packing and I think Marsha Blackburn is going to be a phenomenal senator from the great state of Tennessee should have been a longtime friend of this program in recent polls now have her up as well\nAnd then we get to the all important house races I'm not going to spend the time here it's more of a visual thing that we're doing on television\nAnd we're picking ten important house races at night and we're identifying those specific districts that are gonna make\nA difference on election night in twenty six days and that will literally they these these districts were putting up hold the balance of power in the house of representatives\nI mean because of gerrymandering above big portion and percentage of seats\nI ended up being safe for both Republicans and Democrats so we'll find out for voters by the way Trump more help now to these candidates in the president's got what he's out for days this week and he's going to be campaigning for everybody and these tight races and an attempt to help them all out now am\nI honestly think that the Republicans would adapt just a little bit they don't have to take the style of Donald Trump\nBut if they go out and and passionately support making the tax cuts permanent if they passionately talk about ending the bureaucracy the way the president has been doing it\nIf they will sign on to building and fully funding the border wall if they will do the alternative health care solutions that we talk about all the time on this program like health savings accounts on health care cooperatives et cetera were just going to have a better country\nAnd and the more prosperous country you you cannot deny the success\nOf this president and the ... the the pure force of personality I mean Donald Trump is a force of nature and I know that he breaks dishes I Know he's an icon of class I Know he's a disruptor\nBut if he's not fighting then we're not winning\nAnd when he goes up even against our own allies and says you're not paying their fair share in NATO and we're paying the bulk of money for NATO and then you're stupid enough Chancellor Merkel to go make deals to help make Russia and Vladimir ... rich again well you're basically it's your counteract\nIn everything that NATO's trying to do which is prevent a hospital regime from ever having the power to turn off the ticket and turn off the white blood of western Europe's economy\nIs a simple basic things\nEver thought that the president would get along with little rocket man fire and fury apparently Mike Pompeo the secretary of state at a phenomenal meeting I talked to two sources a phenomenal meeting with little rocket man and now a little rocket man is dead he's serious\nAbout getting rid of any nuclear ambitions\nDenuclearization of the Korean Peninsula the guy that everybody in the media said was going to start World War three that guy is bringing peace to the Korean Peninsula you look at Seoul South Korea you know you look over the DMZ and what do you see thirty million people live there\nA nuclear armed North Korea is not something that the world needs if you care about human life\nAnd as a result I Would assume that you know markets would open up to North Korea the people of North Korea been suffering you might even see a reunification one day of north and South Korea Korea agree with that pay for the world and we got a president that's not dropping cargo planes full of cash and other currencies\nAnd on the on the tarmac for mullahs in Iran that hate us and chant death to America death to Israel that's not happening either you know I

when you when they go low you just kick 'em\nWell Michelle Obama said fears is not a proper motivator hope wins out and to think about how you want your kids to be raised how you want them to think

Beach Florida which took the brunt of this said that about two hundred eighty people decided to stay\nAnd we don't know the fate of two hundred eighty people that apparently elected to stay and ride this thing out\nYeah and and the problem is you know the communications are still down um you know and if they somehow did survive and we obviously hope that they did ah you know you deal with this ... you deal with the mental um after effects of it because let me tell you something if you survive a hundred and fifty five now in our hurricane\nOr you're thinking about her for a long time and it's just not only are you trying to survive physically but you're trying to survive the experience mentally and I can tell you anyone that's trying to ride out a hundred and fifty five gallon our storm or something they will never forget for the rest of their lives\nOne image and I'll let you go on a second there one image is made the biggest impact on you or that you saw role in from the various uh feeds the juicy\nYou can just see it's it's again it's how how how far inland more water goes um you know I've covered hurricane for covered it you go uh in in Myrtle Beach South Carolina\nAnd and I think I told me this story before you arrive and when the hurricane is ongoing you're just amazed at the water can make it in places that you never think of water is going to make it and I think that's the case with\nWith many hurricanes that make landfall the water really ends up in places that normally you would say it's too far away it can't make it here and it does and you're stuck I mean ... for us we just kept on going backwards and\nWe just kept on going inland about when you were in a in a home or a house and the wind's blowing the hundred and thirty miles an hour you just can't get out and walk down the street you're kinda stuck\nAlthough Donald chief meteorologist at Fox Thirteen and Tampa Bay with decades of hurricane experience all thanks a lot and I hope we're hope we're done with these conversations yeah\nAll right for the season poll thank you Bye bye so pulled only go Fox in Tampa you know full disclosure long time a personal friend of mine as well as a great a TV personality as well as a certified meteorologist AMA and all you know all the the seals and and everything\nAnd you know he's has a lot of experience you know when you see some of the details here in ... you hear from people along the Florida coast like Mexico beach and you know people that have been able to look in the description is it looks like an atomic bomb went off\nI mean that really does say at all and as you know uh what's already creeping into the conversation is look\nLook what climate change has done\nAt listen folks I'm not denying that the climate changes or the climate is always changed it's been hot or it's been colder I mean the planet has been hotter I mean you can look at the medieval warming period we you know geology is no we know that the planet has been warmer the plant it's been cooler\nYou know you've got a sunspot cycles you've got solar cycles obviously I mean there are a lot of factors\nNow with a ... or manmade activity I can apply to the heat it up yeah I'm sure the planet than does take on additional heat but I you know all these stores here and there was a story last week\nJust last week there was a story that we've got to the un ah with a new report out we've got Thirteen Years to stop the the climate warming or else we're doomed Thirteen Years what were they saying by the early twenties thirties\n[noise] we're going to be totally doomed\nWell didn't we hear this same scenario I mean Al Gore's movie won an inconvenient truth\nWe're just years the acting and that was a\nIt was almost one almost two decades ago that was two thousand three two thousand say whenever the inconvenient truth a movie came out from algal but we we've heard this before and I'm not a scientist I Know that there are some scientists that do subscribe to many do but\nYou know here we are we've got a hurricane activity which has always existed\nAnd now it's oh my God look what man made climate change is doing look at the the horrific\nEffects of hurricane Michael\nYou know you look at some of the stats and and this is where it doesn't quite dry as far as it's manmade or am federal project gets global warming and climate change you know members global warming that it became climate jays and we've talked about the politics of even the verbiage usage\nBut you know you look at some of the stats here\nAs you look at the ... the cable news coverage and some of these experts and getting on and they're talking about oh ... ... if if you don't believe in climate change now well\nYou're a lost cause but then you know then you look at the stats and the same cable channels that are putting up a in these experts that are saying oh this is clearly climate change that brought about the massive destruction and the the intensification\nOf hurricane Michael but then they put up you know graphics\nThat show that well Michael is only the strongest\nUh as far as windows\nIn fourth place so it's only the fourth strongest as far as wind and then as far as the barometric pressure Michael is in third place so the point is\nThe strongest when recorded was the Labor Day Nineteen thirty five hurricane before they even use names so Nineteen thirty five Labor Day strong a storm a is number one in the wind speed at one hundred eighty five mile per hour clocked wins\nThat was Labor Day Nineteen thirty five nights\nA Camille Nineteen sixty nine\nHundred and Seventy five mile an hour winds you at ... am drew a the which which at homestead Florida Ninety two uh Nineteen Ninety two hundred and sixty five mile an hour winds and then we have Michael in fourth place a just\nA yesterday with a hundred and fifty five miles per hour winds but then you look at the lowest barometric pressures Labor Day Nineteen thirty five is still the lowest barometric pressure recorded Nineteen thirty five\nAnd eight hundred Ninety two middleborns than Camille in sixty nine was nine ordered Michaels in third place at nine hundred Nineteen metal bar so it just shows that we've had storms from long ago and also the Eighteen fifty one storm I Believe was mentioned is a real devastating blow to the panhandle certainly not very populated back then\nBut it shows these hurricanes they ebb and flow in Tempe cities I'll get into a little bit more later on but again\nThis settled science argument to all its its man made climate change its it's global warming but then you look at stronger storms that was stronger back in the late sixties and in Nineteen thirty five in the midst of the great depression\nAnd
