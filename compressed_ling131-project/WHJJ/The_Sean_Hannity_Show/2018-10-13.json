this means folks this means that the Turkish\nHad this Saudi conflict bugs [laughter] I mean I can you figure any other way they they had cameras inside they edit audio listening devices inside so\nThey just kept their hair I Can't think of any other explanation for this claim to fame audio visual evidence you know there is video that the Saudi embassy had\n[noise] there's a closed circuit TV or you know security camera footage of Jamal to show the walking into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey back on October second\nSo they have walking in\nAnd wait a minute the Saudis than my daughter is going to say okay the show was the video of him walking out\nAnd I'm waiting for the Saudis then to give the exact same image on or give the exact same video\nAnd then just reverse it yeah just play the video backwards and you'll see the you'll see the uh the journalists that show again you'll see him walk backwards [laughter] take ... take a walk in video and they just run it backwards up look he left his right here look he left\nI mean it was just like Keystone cop is also earlier this week\nThe the Saudis let some journalism or photons into and reporters into the er the embassy or consulate and there were like you're going to take him for rooms at like opening up closets and saying look not near nope not at here look it was it was comical but this story folks is anything\nBut comical\nThis Jamal to show the Washington Post of late columnist very critical of the Saudi Government especially the crown prince Mohammed bin ... mom\n\nOh there's a lot of money and arms deals folks with us vendors or we'll get into that\nLindsey Graham by the way it has said this is a quote behavior like this is unacceptable violates every international norm it can't be condoned the way we deal with Saudi Arabia will be a message\nTo others\nBoth Republicans and Democrats have written a letter\nSome in Congress they want the arms deal stop there are calls for sanctions in a halt to about a hundred ten billion dollars\nIn arms sales some are calling for the cutting off of relations with Saudi Arabia I let's let's dive in just a little bit deeper here\nBecause I apparently feminine theory and now with alleged audio video proof and this gets pretty gruesome\nThe reports are that the\n[noise] the Turkish have the audio and video of him going in being interrogated him being beaten and then him being killed and there have been some reports that he was caught up inside the embassy\nYep and then we're going to have to target the Saudis with some type of sanctions somebody's got to be\nDone they can't get away with murder ring and this member rang a U.S permanent resident because they didn't like what he's writing in the Washington Post\nI don't want to see the Senate or you know I have a big fight with with Trump [noise]\nI mean the Senate I could try to shoot down the arm soon\nAnd ah [noise] [noise] [noise]\nYeah and also support understand that the Saudis need us more than we need them\nSo I think that the arms deal can be saved because there were so many cascading pieces and the Iran situation is important we can't allow the Iranians to get any stronger in the region and certainly arms sales to the Saudis a help keep that in check\nWhat we can allow [laughter] I used to murder people was just like we can't have you know the Russians have let them including killing his adversaries in poisoning people on British soil for instance\nThe Chinese also arresting the head of Interpol or you know the what the Saudis have apparently dime here you know Trump's own Party Republicans like Lindsey Graham now turning up the heat\nAnd this is very complicated and\nIt's going to be a very interesting thing to see how this thing unfold you know Trump's under a lot of scrutiny\nI he's no question how involved we need to get considering that the journalist is not an American citizen but he's a ... and his four children are American citizens\n[noise] [noise]\nI don't we can cut off relations I wouldn't cancel the arms deal but the Saudis got another you you can't do this there's got to be some kind of punishment some kind of sanctions he's so this is a a tight rope walk you know obviously\nI we just we can't leave that power vacuum for the Russians and the Chinese so I mean this is a very delicate walk here\nYou know I don't trust the Saudis Fifteen of Nineteen hijackers were Saudi I Do believe that uh there were a high level members of the Saudi royal family that knew\nWhat was going on or certainly had some

I mean the the Turkish they have ... airport video of the of these prior summer came in on a private jet and some came in commercially but you had essentially this Saturday hit\nSquad and

maybe should have at least on a fly over you know you don't have to hit the ground\nBut I think it's important to show and I and of course keep in mind that the president is important folks and don't don't shoot the messenger here\nThe president said that he don't want to disappoint the people up in Pennsylvania you know thousands of people waiting to see him in Pennsylvania earlier this week he don't want to disappoint but also keep in mind that the pan handle these areas that have been raped that's also big time from country as well\n[noise]\nUh you know the president was able to resurrect

resolute desk\nOr saying M. F. R. and B. S. and just the erotic crazy train a performance of the time yeah I I Would be a hypocrite\nAnd it it's just it's unbelievable that those that would all over Obama and his choice a are fine with Tonya in what he did it just folks that it's a double standard and it's hypocrisy and I don't want to part of that\nSo hopefully you know there are you understand where I'm coming from there are people folks and this is this is troubling you know while I support the bulk of Trump's policies and I keep a lot of praise and credit on what he's gotten accomplished and you know they even put out that list of\nTwo hundred eighty nine accomplishments in just twenty months and the administration has done some amazing things that I've given them a lot of credit on this program\nBut uh the tiny situation and you know those that will defend Trump you know when you should know that that time you think it was a mess in disrespectful and it was just it was a rabbit was it was nuts\nAnd\nI you know I Can't believe I mean I got to believe that Jared in the volcano Jared had invited kind in the first place it set up this lunch for a while ago which then turned into that photo op in the oval office and I got to believe that that ... Geron weren't just cringing\nAnd what transpired but what I find scary is you know listen well we can have tons of preys on Trump for the good things he's carrying out but he gets himself and messages and I talk about it because I'm honest and I'm a I'm fair intellectually honest on this program\nAnd it's just it would hypocritical if I didn't talk about the ups and downs\nBut the scary thing here is that some of the the all out blinded Trump supporters I truly believe the Kanye West could have pulled out his pants and desiccated on the desk in front of the media and President Trump and ah\nThe all out no problems ever Trump supporters would have said what does that old man that was great that was the best application I've ever seen in the oval office\nIt's incredible I mean that's [laughter]\nThat was a little nutty folks so ah [noise]\nWell ... was invited you know essentially to discuss prison reform there was not a hell of a lot about that yesterday [noise] not a lot of talk you know Jared Kushner's father\nWas incarcerated and rightfully so Jared of course and that's why that's why Chris Christie didn't get a gig because he was Chris Christie the put Jared Kushner's father away for all kinds of fraud\nI mean he was guilty\nBut they should have rescheduled Tanya crazy train should have pulled into the tracks or not right after the hurricane so I think that amplifies that the criticism as well you know Leslie stall from sixty minutes interviewed Trump yesterday\nSo I don't know did we find out whether a Trump was interviewed before or after ...\nA ...\nI don't know I I haven't seen confirmation but Leslie stall interviewed front but apparently that's going to be on sixty minutes\nOn Sunday so can you see if any if see CBS as a put out any of the collapse 'cause a lot of times they will\nHave to say I meant to do it earlier and I I didn't get a chance but if you can just check and see if CBS put out a any a taser clip the Trump interview on sixty minutes for the Sunday night I'd like to play that if they've posted that\nA lot of ground to cover I said I had a Taylor Swift update\nArnold Schwarzenegger this is a story that came out about two days ago but you know we were so slammed with the hurricane Michael situation uh Arnold Schwarzenegger de ... de ...

clearly a the Turkish have just a you know throw their hands on the table to say hey I have ... we had your conflict bugs ... where we had an audio and video listening in monitoring equipment inside your time thought\nI mean what how else how else with the the the Turkish have audio and video from inside unless somebody\nHad a camera phone or or or or or ... or somebody had you know some kind of video and then the the leaked it out to the Turkish official and that's the only other way but it happens to be really case seemed like they the place was bugged is something which that's an amazing revelation\nI mean hey we have the the Russians remember back in the eighties when we were building a new American embassy in Moscow and you remember that the place was so Laden with a security flaws and buggy we abandoned the damn thing it was so bad and we walked away from it\nAnd\nThat's that's in creed you baby we weren't that's that's that's espionage and counter espionage and spy versus spy if they really have this surveillance in their\nSaw what's gonna happen I mean if the if the Turkish government says we have proof on the killing of this Jamal ...\nA permanent us raise the debt not a citizen but a permanent us resident if the target and saying yeah we got we got the goods you they did it they kill them they come up they use the ball and saw the comment the little piece as\nWell as the odd thing was outside as he was going to get that centrally the marriage permits for him to marry her in Saudi Arabia\nI asked him the king of Saudi Arabia says no we know nothing about uh how's that going to work out who\nThe hell is President Trump's going to side with on this\nMan this is crazy\nYou know [noise] that must have vitamin ... member ... went off and he denied all of the hacking oh no interference we we didn't we didn't interfere nothing of course the Russians interfere with our lecture to me they hack\nTo like the Russians they denied that you know all the the the poisonings [noise] you know that\nThat uh that that chemical poisoning they you know the the father and daughter and then I mean there have been numerous events you know the the Russians they deny everything of course everything they deny they actually\nDid and then there's ... we don't even know about that they're not even died as whatever you know they did it yet and we probably wouldn't even find that have these things\nSo this is going to be fascinating to watch if the proof rolls out that Saudi assassination squad\nThat is their mission and along the way they brought with them\nThey're ascension teaching they the the ... are very clear that some of the watchers brought in various crafts and technologies with them they clearly taught humankind how to use various tools and and other implements but along the way they also\nAnd this was a big beef that the church has with the watchers they taught the secrets of heaven and the secrets of heaven are how humans can transform into angels\nRide the cosmic conduit and dwell in God's throne and that's the really big question right there George why would any why would the church have a problem with this why does the establishment church have a problem with a group of beings coming to earth\nAnd teaching humans to become angels you would think they would welcome that you would think they would welcome at the problem is is that\nYou cut out the church in the scenario you have no need for the pope send the priest and the whole church establishment because in fact the church doesn't teach you\nCan do it on your own right\nYou can do it on your own and that is the big question can humans [noise]\nTake it upon themselves to perfect themselves as the term to become more whole to become more holy to become more complete if you answer no then chase them as demons chase them as giants if you answer yes\nAnd you really you now you're you're getting into the innermost esoteric secrets of the most closely guarded secrets of all human kind the secrets that day whatever government or new world order type authority you subscribe to these are the secrets they do not want you to know about these are the secrets of the aluminum ... ultimately\nWell you mentioned something to is there any evil it all connected with the watchers\nWill there isn't in perception I mean the the the the scenes were absolutely clear and their writings that there are two currents or forces of the watchers one was represented by the arcane she'll Michael is also sometimes referred to as Mel ...\nWho is who established the priesthood of which she says was a member of the other current or force is led by ... who was referred to later as the anti Christ\nAnd they were they were all of the belief that these two forces are currents are active in our consciousness at all times this is kind of the Christian concept of the devil onto your ... on one shoulder and the angel on the other\nAnd it was all about harmonizing these forces and recognizing that through our the power of our own consciousness and our own thoughts\nWe can actually become angels\nWho sued amazing possibility or how did you uncovered this\nI've actually been on the trail of the watchers for some time I mean I've been of course on the on a knock you trail for Fifteen Years or so and then I started researching the Sarah from ... several years ago these are the highest order of angels and\nThey watch or guard God's throne and in fact during the Renee sound so it was a belief was developed that the Sarah from were actually humans\nWho would transform themselves into angels or perfected themselves that the book of papers described the the heavenly thrown up God referred to as ... and they tell us that it's inhabited it's an inhabited by joyful angels and the angels are the lord the watchers and just humans made perfect\nAnd I'm reading this I'm going well who are these people ... and ... what did they know how did they ... themselves how did they get to turn into angels and go and do well in God's throne and can I how can I and that's what started me on this real path of of trying to uncover the secrets of the watchers\n[noise]\nWell my my garden where early in my mind\nIn\nI'm Down by re enter the things that need to know now I can see them all\n\nTo\nWell you never knew that your main he was a high

have a car insurance for gasoline you don't have home owners insurance for long term care insurance just for the big things and we've tried to ensure everything top down and that's led to the last\nYou know really each ten years of insurance premiums that have doubled or tripled we need to do is insured less which is how every other insurance product works they keep it that is means doctors have to make more of the services they provide affordable\nAnd they can if they cut out the middleman and streamline than a simple\nMath and how big is your practice how many patients do you have in your facility the atlas empty and Wichita\nIn Wichita we have five doctors and over thirty two hundred patients\nUnbelievable and your age and you give concierge care at all I could pick up a phone and I'm getting a doctor at three in the morning that it's going to answer my call\nYou do you have and I can go down and see somebody at three AM in the morning\nIf you need stitches and it's an emergency you know a lot of history and phone calls or chest pain which we might send the E R but a lot of times to kid who's sick and a mom who's worried and\nUm you of if you can avoid the ER you can avoid a thousand or two thousand dollar bill that's how you get health care health insurance is a card in your wallet health care is access to your doctor yeah\nAll right and it happened and how many other practices around the country have you been able to to provide your model that they have duplicated how you've you've been out and about on a champion of this for a long time\nYet we've helped over five hundred and fifty doctors convert to this model in the last few years but there's about a thousand total there in forty eight states every state except north and South Dakota right now but we have one about to launch North Dakota [noise]\nUm and then it's even gotten a little bit international so um this is a a sound tried and true model\nNow and what do you do Dr growth in terms of your president of doc ah docks for a\nPatient care foundation you know now that we have alternatives that are working real life experiences seems to me that we ought to be able to duplicate it a lot more than we are\nAbsolutely a so doctor patient care foundation was er physician on health policy because doctors never seemed to be at the table when they were having conversations about health care so we put chicken\nIn the back and back to the table to have conversations personally I I also have a primary care practice much like that lets them here in southwest Florida a practice of any help our plus when he was\nYou know why are we using insurance to pay for health are for basic primary care services all it does is create obstacles blocks us when we were ... ... ... ... points as Dr Josh and we're seeing patients come to us\nFrom all over the state of Florida and even from outside of the country\n... medical tourism are and what we're finding is that you know not not the same thing about about health insurance we're just using it for all and you know when somebody is you know place twice the amount of money for a service because the ... what are we insuring it using insurance drives up the cost of the other products\nSo an MRI cash price Ross is two hundred and twenty dollars\nWhile using your your commercial insurance you know we go through all the the hoops ticket it authorized your co pay five hundred dollars or so we we see this time and again the more people are coming out of pocket to pay for health health care I'll let you signed up to ... more insurance seems to be becoming an optical\nI'm an ... solution so but I'm pleased to see the worst shifting the conversation was from a coverage for everyone who I'm Talking about reducing the cost of health care\nI think that the real close enough where I was about to testify on us some help committee on the ...\nWould it be a better idea I mean I'm watching for example they have this race out in California everybody's shock gather news and who is now offering free health care but everybody whether your pay our taxpayer whether you're in the ... the state legally or illegally\nEverybody's going to get free health care well I basically put a sign that says come to California but you get sick\nUm because people are going to go there now what's interesting to me is that a Republican is within striking distance and that gubernatorial race out in California because instinctively people no we can't afford to pay\nFor every illegal immigrant in the country but the reality is is that if I Lived in Wichita, Kansas I Would be a part of atlas them day and I would be your patient\nDr ... because I I think it's the best deal I liked the idea of being able to call my doctor whenever I'm sick or if I have a kid that sick every parent wants the ability to do that and your preserved for service provides it for fifty bucks a month now how much does the average in Wichita, Kansas catastrophic planet if for the big things heart attack\nA accident or cancer how much would one of those plans cost\nAbout five hundred dollars a family member dollars per year or a month a month\nShow and the current rates closer to you know a thousand twelve hundred a across the nation people are paying more for health insurance each month and they're paying for their mortgage\nIf the Trump tax cuts only put a hundred dollars per household per month in and they're being credited with the economic boom of your four point two percent GDP\nIf we fix health insurance we could put five hundred dollars back in the pocket of every household a the the real ... and the the politician there has in California is to send them on a ridge analogy\nThis throwing more money at the problem has never fixed it what we're doing is Dr Lee and ourselves and and a thousand other physicians is is innovating and saying how do we get ... cheaper how do we make it so patients don't have co pays how do we provide stitches for no cost because they're so affordable [noise]\nUm you know actually looking at ways it's fundamentally fixing the system that's what we need not just promises of more spending\nAnd if I could add up to that just a a ... you know as far as the cost of care you know people ask us as well how can I just get\nMajor medical you know we we can afford what what services the armor care practices providing but we just need something catastrophic well mama care made that illegal or so at the ... just brought by\n... get access to these major medical plan called ... short term medical plans and you know some would argue that these are actually true insurance they don't cover anything except for major medical expenses or Seventy five dollars a month or\nWhat it is this going to be implemented easily city by city town by town we can duplicate the model it already does take care of individuals with preexisting conditions if somebody wants to sign up for atlas MD and they have a preexisting condition a doctor or do you deny them service\nEverybody's welcome and everybody's price the same just based on age um we know we're going to work harder for some patients ... will not have to work as hard for other patients and we don't want to be judged by their illness\nHow did you get to who directly negotiate these prices with these pharmaceutical companies\n[noise] boy I Wish I could say was because we're so darn good at it um that the truth is it's so much more simple than that I\nHave a doctor's in forty four states are allowed to work directly with pharmaceutical wholesalers so just like you can go to Costco and get something for much cheaper because you pay a membership we do the same thing and we're able to\nGet the you know the actual cost of medicine might be at ten dollars for a thousand pills and because we don't have a staff of seven people per physician fighting insurance\nWe can lower the caution and pass the savings on directly to the patient [laughter] this is a win for everybody we we don't take care of of Republicans or Democrats we take care of people\nSo how does somebody had a group of doctors in New York say implement those because they're going to look at this and say fifty bucks a month I Can't make ten cents off of that\nWhat they're gonna have to move to New York because they don't make it easy but they could work with a pharmacist in New York state's one of the few states that make it a very difficult but then a pharmacist could say [noise] um if you do a five dollar a month membership with them then you get the medicine that cost that\nWould be an amazing model it it would cut down there\nRight let's take or do you work out of the equation or California out of the ... let's say any other state Louisiana Florida huh hum I don't know Missouri yeah how do they do it\nIt's as simple as signing up effect shopping on Amazon there's there's almost nothing to it um you know we have one supplier that makes it very easy overnight shipping and that's just it if I Want to buy a bottle of a hundred pills of blood pressure medicine I can if I Want to buy a thousand\nPills I Can't and it's about the same price um but it's fundamentally cheaper than\nWhat about Lindsey Graham is saying that what only block grant the money that we're already providing to individual states and let them come up with these innovative you know like centers of innovation all around the country and I think naturally people would move toward your system\nI I Would agree with the logic or the federal government's basically saying we've given your money with strings attached before and we haven't received full value for that because we've wage you down with regulatory burden so we're going to cut those strings and just give you the money and say go forth and do the best job that you can\nMake a quick break we'll come back more Dr Josh ... was empty and Dr Lee as grows president ah docks for a patient care foundation\n\nStreet fighter snakes on this than I had an animal that boy and powers you want us about conservative voices fighting fire\nTo say their dollars a month of your breast cancer and need breast cancer treatment as low as yes I mean as low as the Pentagon the chemotherapy or\nBut we've had patients who go you know we we find make the diagnosis send them the oncologist they say based on all of their tests and experience this is the best medicine for you [laughter] they take it to the pharmacy their quota six or seven hundred dollars a month they called us and said you can't you make it any better and we were shocked\nBut the wholesale cost of that medicine to six dollars so we are and fleeting the whole system with paperwork and ... me to streamline and in and innovate just like Silicon Valley does with anything else\nHow does this go for all the other cancers that are out there leukemia and about you know prostate cancer lung cancer\nSo shortly after a peace will come to some out of the country was part of our cats are\nUh are certain people in the Clinton would cost or other ... she came to us and a six month these uh uh and we get her surgery her her imaging every state and local people or ... thousand dollars low yeah so that's a a Ninety thousand dollar shaping\n... at a hundred thousand dollars a conversational she's going to die for ...\nA ... dollar the dollars that go to the church raise raise money in a bake sale\nA and you know considering that most people out of pocket expenses now for health insurance plans of eleven thousand dollars per year what do we ensure England that once in a lifetime catastrophic adults can be treated mature for less than ten dollars bingo\nUnbelievable well look I Hope everybody will pay attention because in twenty eight days Americans are going to go to the polls in Obamacare won't work and we know the left and the Democrats want to keep it in\nA I applaud you guys for what you're doing and the fact that you've been able to duplicate the model around the country speaks volumes about what your real mission is and that is saving people's lives in\nHis very inspiring thank you both think

in the Democratic party cried this Trump's rallies dating back to the two thousand sixteen campaign and do not doubt me on this either the Democrats in the media publicly\nActing on concerned on interest in and would always say a variation\nOf you can't judge voter interest on the basis or rallies you can't predict how people are going to vote simply because of the size of crowds at political rallies\nThese Trump rallies they're not telling us that it doesn't mean anything he's or just rabbit people upset with their lives and they think Trump is going to kick all the people out of the country they don't like it's not that it's not anywhere near representative\nOf the population is is what they all said that every\nTrump rally privately do not doubt me privately they were jealous if they can be and they were the thing\nBecause there's not a one of them on the Democratic side who could come anywhere close to ... that kind of excitement that kind of loyalty and knows sized crowds\nObama couldn't do it not in two thousand sixteen Hillary couldn't do it ever but certainly not in two thousand she couldn't she couldn't she couldn't draw flies there her book signing ceremonies\nHillary Clinton who couldn't draw crowd any weren't good people knew she might not be able to stand up for a full twenty five minutes\nWithout some aimed coming out the proper up by the elbows but seriously I guarantee you they were looking at\nThose crowds they were looking for those Trump rallies and they would never say so publicly but they were scared to death by him they would never say so publicly they would never admit it publicly they would say just the opposite but\nThey're human beings in any kind any anytime anybody in politics has that kind of popularity and that kind of loyalties that equals jealousy envy and anger and all things that attached to jealousy and that\nWould be they have the Trump to begin with and the fact that Trump was turning everything they believed it upside down the fact that Trump was being able to accomplish things they couldn't\nJust in terms of average Americans being interested in the campaign interested in the candidate to see

that Joe Biden would be the first guy that try to replicate this\nThen I thought maybe Michelle my bell Obama but then I thought no they've got too much to lose if it doesn't work\nMaybe Kamala Harris maybe some of these ... somebody's going to do this somebody's got to try if they've got\nTo be able to show the Democrats thinking they've got to show that there's as much excitement as much loyalty

political story\nReady British political race ratings than GOP house is crumbling here is the sub the headline Mr ...\nThere are now two hundred nine seats either family or leaning in the Democratic column only nine shy of the two hundred eight team needed to win control this is what you were just telling me right and it you've got Republicans telling you that they think this is true\n\nSome I'm not asking for names but you've got some elected Republicans are people their officers telling you they believe is okay\nSo political says the GOP house is crumbling it's falling apart\nThere are two hundred nine feet\nFirmly order Leming Democrat I guess this is according to polling data to hundred eight teams there's a number of seats you and me in for the majority in the house or four hundred and thirty five total numbers\nThere to eight teams the majority so\nTwo hundred nine seats firmly are leading Democrat I mean this if the Democrats [laughter] nine seats with this this\nIs a white by the Republican Party would have to be a party of for this to happen a party of Adolf Hitler's\nFor just the issues and yet they believe it now\nBut I don't have an insider information on this I don't know anybody with internal polling get I don't know I don't know beans I don't I don't really pay attention to that I never have but the people in Washington and live and die by their stuff I'm telling you\nIt is their blood and water and food polling data it's how they get through the day every day pulling anything\nAnd if the Democrats are publishing stories to each other that to nine seats are leading their way and if there is no blue wave I don't think there's gonna be an Alan some sanity anywhere to be found on the Democrats' side of the Iowa or in the media\nTo hundred nine feet firmly or leaning\nIn the Democratic column let me ask you a question what could be causing this let's let's assume for a moment just as a as a hypothetical exercise let's assume this is true\nCan you tell me what it is\nAnything one thing a series of things that have American voters [noise] so so ticked off at Republicans that they cannot wait to go out and vote Democrat\nSo that the Democrats run the house what is what the Republicans done or not done that would warrant this kind of nation wide ... with the party\nNow the left will tell you the answer the question is Trump that the people of this country despise Donald Trump\nAs a people in this country have been poised to send Trump packing ever since electrolytes two thousand sixteen they can't wait to get out there and showed their ... for Trump and the only way they can do it is to vote against Republicans\nAll right well as I say we're hypothetically protesting this is true what has Trump done the general\nRight

E. R. dot com Hi Michele I'm often\nWhite women all white women or women went for me white women went for Trump and look white\nWomen have been voting against Democrat presidential candidates for decades now the\nWhite vote has only then won twice didn't last sixty years my husband being one of the two Lyndon Johnson being there is not a surprise it's a disappointment that white women vote Republican and not for me but it is what it is\nAnd they're in Hillary Clinton stumbled Anna swerve into a truth\nExcept\nFor a very exceptional election year of Nineteen sixty four and which was following the JFK\nAssassination\nThe Democrats have not gotten more than fifty percent of the white vote in the presidential election since Nineteen thirty two\nNow when you look at it that way you can understand why in the Democratic party circles there's hatred for white people white people white women had been rejecting the white married suburban women had been rejecting them this is why the kind of Nazi movement sprang up this is why\n[laughter] ... the left has as it started contacting all different categories for non white suburban women to be plugged into\nSo that they can then be said to be Democrats constituents\nThis and by the way this is again why in Nineteen sixty five Ted Kennedy and the Democrats re opened the floodgates to immigration I Need to remind everybody again from about Nineteen Twenty one and Nineteen twenty three if you're Nineteen sixty five we shut down immigration I Would not to zero\nBut we put very strict limits on\nAnd the reason was to be able to assimilate all of the immigrants that come into the country the late Eighteen hundreds throughout the Nineteen early twenties assimilation was key to American immigration policy\nArriving immigrants all wanted to be citizens by the way and there were things they had to do to become citizens they had to learn a language and they had to learn the history of America they had to be able to pass questions about the history of America on a test\nAnd they had to swear and plan their loyalty and devotion to the United states and they were eager to do it and they were happy to do it now they they maintain their ethnicity\nThe Irish the Italians unit but they wanted to become Americans [noise] and they did and it took a number of years to assimilate them all\nWell Nineteen sixty five is when Ted Kennedy who led the charge to reopen the immigration floodgates which then of course when to once that happened illegal immigration ramped up in an uncontrollable way\nAnd\nThat wave of immigrants starting in Nineteen sixty five came from third world socialist countries Democrats\nRealized they could only when the White House if they changed the population of America they were losing presidential elections with the Native American population because they were losing\nWhite women and Mrs Clinton just admitted in here to Christian I'm poor up CNN it never occurred to them to change their policies what they have to do in order to attract white voters what they had to do\nChange America so back to Hillary she said what was done last night in the White House meeting Trump apologizing for the nation to Kavanaugh\nWhat was done in the White House last night she said was a political rally it further undermine the image and integrity of the court\nAnd that troubles me greatly crusty on poor it saddens me because our judicial system has been viewed as one of the main pillar of our constitution look to the AP's\nThe judicial system has been viewed by you as he lectured insurance the judicial system has been viewed by you and Mrs Clinton the rest of the Democrats as your private refuge\nYou have looked at the court as a place you can stock like minded the leftist activists to make sure things that you believe in which never could pass legislation somehow become law in America that's why they want the courts\nIf you want to really get frustrated you heard me say this in you've probably heard a lot of other people but stop and think about this\nOutside of Obamacare practically every liberal ... the steak every liberal idea and belief that now is the law in this country would not have become law in Congress because it never would have passed\nLiberalism and the Democratic party's ideas have never been mass popular the only way\nThat we have bastard ice pop culture laws in reality today is because Democrats activists judges have been essentially writing law when they take\nCases and interpret them and then pronounce decisions\nRoe versus Wade is the most sterling example of this but there are countless others the simple fact of the matter is the Democratic party has never been capable of winning\nLegislation to implement the ideas they believe in because most of the American people when they know what's at stake don't want them that's the value of judges and that's the value of courts to the Democrats wouldn't Mrs Clinton says that what happened in the White House the other night saddens her\nBecause our judicial system has been viewed as one of the main pillars of our constitutional ... B. S. not by you in fact to Hillary Clinton and people like are the Constitution's an obstacle is well it's certainly not something to revere\n... did you see any way even a conservative state college where I was speaking to yesterday said the only way to repair America is to try to get back to some civility to try to make it that even if we have political disagreements we're not going to go to war with each other we're not going to destroy each other\nHillary Clinton well certainly I Would love to see us returned to civility Christianity on poor listening to one another working on our differences\nThat is not the Republican Party that exist today that is certainly not the administration that we haven't power right now when the Republican Senate denied the right of President Obama to have his nominee for the Supreme Court Merrick Garland here we go off to the races again missed\nCharacterizing that you're blue in the face that's a Joe Biden rule the Democrats invented that rule that presidents don't get the name Supreme Court justices during vacancies\nThat happened in the last year of their term that's a Democrat inspired instituted rule\nAnd she knows\nWhat the Republicans didn't destroy Merrick Garland the Democrats didn't have to fight battles defending his character and his life because the Republicans were not trying to destroy them\nAs they did Kavanaugh anyway the upshot of this is that Hillary Clinton says it's ... it's a time for instability it is it time for this kind of extremism because that's what we're up against Steve skill lease\n[noise] who was shot by one of the believers of Hillary Clinton at that Republican baseball practice cannot believe that Bill Cassidy senator from Louisiana responded to Hillary at a time when the Republicans are being shot stabbed docks beaten\nRun out of restaurants and sent death threats Hillary Clinton or just Democrats to be even more uncivil what an irresponsible statement\nEvery Democrats just announced they're not going to denounce or they privately publicly encourage or by applauded they supported that is who they are this is the party by the way that has been railing against all this instability brought them all how long this is why\nI look at average American voters paying attention to this and I don't understand how any of them can want to side with what the Democratic Party is doing how they're doing it\nI Know what happens but it's it's a mystery to me my hope is my faith is that this incivility this insanity this on the ... Democrat behavior is negatively impacting the Democrats that\nThe Kavanaugh effect pro Republican I Know that's real the polling data indicates that that's real if you want to believe polling data but we're never going to get a poll\nOf people who this approve of Democratic Party tactics and techniques that Paul is never going to be run and if they did if somebody on the left did run that poll and the results came back then it was quite harmful as Democrats they wouldn't run the results\nThey would get hold of Democrat leaders the media was say look this is not work at you guys you better get hold of your people to dial back the problem is Democrats can't dial these people back the Democrats don't control these left wing radicals that's\nWhy you don't see any public statements of disapproval got to take a break we'll get started with fallen was right after we get\nNow where is this massive belief and supportive he's got this popularity and people can't wait to do what she says and express their support in why didn't the same people turn around and watch her show\nThat we're not supposed to ask the question to different things Russia camp extrapolate to voter registration drives an audience was for award show I can you people can make it up left and right I can probably mild analogies I can I ask these questions\n\nI'm happy to hear you say out there but that this stuff doesn't um intimidate you I think I think it has it intimidated\nAverage of Republican voters in a long time elected Republicans are a bit of a different story Dennis in a ... great to have used or how you doing\nWell thank you long time listener first time caller thank you\nSo it was just a wanting to comment on on the Hillary thing with Muslim due to last night and I can't quote it exactly but she said if you disagree or if if the party is destroying the things you believe in love\nYou should be a civil would that not apply to the Democratic party as well Republicans conservatives um being on civil to the likes of her\nShort would sure what I mean that's the standard if the party that you\nOppose is destroying your way of life and you must be an civil against\nBut [noise]\nAnd you know this in the Hillary Clinton Democratic Party world\nUh our world should be destroyed that is just is that\nIs what's called for conservatives and Republicans being destroyed that is the new

podcast like in the morning when he gets gets up at the White House and things like that would be the most efficient way\nI can honestly say that I Do not know if the president listens to the podcast now he's told me he listens to the program and it gets a chance and he is is that but\nYou know who knows but he's told me he does I I I've I'm very flattered by by your comment can I ask you a question before we go on I'm sure I'm just I Want people to hear it how do you\nGet the podcast everyday how have your range to receive it\nWell I have your app and I down\nYour pie calf\nRight it

few bucks which which are good the releases you fix were\nGood and we're constantly working on bug fixes we uh with the ... just a a new wave of them I've I've set up just the other day that the developer and and I said and get this fixed I'm tired of waiting on it\nYeah it used to be if you were in your car and you're listening to our one and then our one runs out it wouldn't go automatically to our kids\nNow that now that interestingly that was not exclusive to us that\nHappened to be the way they ended up being tagged and\nAnti we did have to change the way they got to have the download 'til you want to play back in the proper owner but that wasn't just\nOur podcast it was any number of people that originally it was an ... problem it was the way I tunes organize them ah we're we're eventually able to overcome that with our with our own ... did you use I tunes ... straight for the ap\nYeah I mean in fact I bought my first I thought yeah I didn't even know what it was right and I bought it because that's how you're cast\nWas right when is it doesn't want to people I hear this I Want to hear how easy it is and the prime cast is well how would you describe the podcast\nDebate what is it\nHow would I describe it yeah what is it what are you listening to when you listen to the podcast\nOh well I mean I'm listening for what you say that you know it's not

hour and a half to listen to the whole show our forty minutes\nI mean it's great 'cause like I listen to it on the way home from war\n'cause there are any commercials in the pod cast right it's just

all these people out there with their podcast these days cereal this and breakfast look that and all that we were at the front of the gang of people do it and podcasts\nYeah and I'm Glad I'm Glad I I get in some other cats but I don't know a lot about them and um so I just listened to yours right\nNow well it's up on a pod cast is is the is a transmission of uh of audio on what was an iPod pod cast is how it got his original name\nNow the I ... has been incorporated into the iPhone and the eye pad and even now downloadable on a laptop but just to name just held but it was related to being able to download audio content like songs and music on an I ... tense pod cast\n[noise] great thanks for explaining that to me as long as I can hear you that you know that's all I Need\nThat's that's awesome I I appreciate it but I just to answer your question are we can't divulge members I wouldn't\nTell them the buddy you're a member you know you never know who's going to\nDo what are we guard that information we promise a everybody that is a member but we're going to protect their identity and their privacy will work very hard at it by the way I mean not just from\nMayor told al magazines and her recollection of\nThe Thomas hearings and James yeah so having watched this before I knew the key issues would be whether the judge had a pattern of similar behaviors since that helps to stab me she was telling the truth when there's a standoff\nThere was a pattern this is amazing\nShe ran uncorroborated story to illustrate a pattern I\nI'm almost speechless in my attempt to explain this\nThe first story that was run about ... nobody could corroborate her story kept changing there was no evidence for it the New York times found that so bad that they wouldn't they wouldn't allude to it much less reprint aspects of it and so Jane Mayer and Ronan Farrow run a second story\nThat isn't true just to establish a pattern in other words we're going to lie twice we're going to run a false story first that has no backup and then we're going to run a second story to show a pattern\nBecause I remember that with Clarence Thomas other women came forward it showed a pattern and it helped us persuade people at Thomas was guilty and so we wanted to show a pattern of behavior when Kavanaugh a pattern\nA beat you couldn't even substantiate uh single allegation be it from both the Ford or be it for Ramirez or from ... client\nWas her name swept Nick I mean this is a flat out admitting yeah we made up a second story well didn't use those words but we wanted to show a pattern\nSo essentially they're saying we believe we can convince people that something happen just by writing a story alleging it and of course their buddies in the left will gladly accept an allegation is fact and an act on it yeah we needed to show a pattern\nHere's here's Kennan Oklahoma City we're back to the phones great to have your er Hi\nHey it's great to be on Russia or not only are you all rushed but but you are the lead voice with the mainstream media you should have the best that and podcast\nOr should have the ... and ... [laughter] hey my point is a today a\nWith Hillary's comments that are basically liberals don't need to be civil to conservatives anymore it reminded me\nOf a profound quote I came across ... years ago and maybe even you set it\nAh but here's the quote a society is either moving toward stability or barbarism and I see Trump trying to apply civil law and order to our society and it's apparent that the liberal left his embrace the farmer or something like that I just wanted to get your thoughts\nAre so the but the question is do I do I agree that uh our society has always trending toward a barber is what what barbarism in a\nSociety are ... they were trending one where we're not in the middle of the ... eater trending towards civility or barbarism\nOff the clocks\nAnd the oh it's a constant influx and so what what what what is your question more Trump isn't it\nWell it seems as if a Republican conservatives are taking the side of civility and working uh you know towards the law and order or restoring it and it seems like the Democrats have just outright embraced barbarism\nRight ah with all of their character assassination attempts on Trump Kavanaugh antifa violent shooting\nYeah there's no there's no question about that it's an active choice I mean Hillary Clinton's endorsing it\nYeah absolutely and uh it's it's sad to see because this is not the Democrat Party of my uh mother and father and I remember so well you know conservatism here in Oklahoma where I live uh in fact most of the states\nWell let me ask you know there was the Democratic party the Democratic party ... what was it when that was all gotten fine and dandy one more to them\nI think it was um before the Nineteen forties\nAnd know what ... what not when what why are they what were they like when the Democrats weren't a Democrat Party of your dad or your grandpa what they want but doing\nWell um the Democrats at at that time the basic uh issue was a labor laws and um when\nYou were what purpose\nMy point the Democratic party hasn't changed\nThat much is my point the Democratic party has always been rooted\nIn the modern era in our lifetimes of this century and the previous at the Democratic party has been rooted in an anti capitalism has been rooted in pro socialism in big government\nThey've just now a band in any pretense of moderation about that and have gone all in on the militants and violent socialism to achieve their means my point they're not\nThat different there just mass getting less today\nHere if you know read about it in the paper tomorrow ... be network news radio nine twenty and want to\nCyber criminals cyber bad guys could attack your laptop your tablet or smartphone without you even knowing\nOr they can steal your identity and you may not realize it until it's too late that's why lifelike identity theft protection now includes the power of Norton Security to help protect your identity and your devices\nLifelike uses proprietary technology to help detect a range of threats to your identity and Norton Security protects against on line threats\nLike ransomware or malware and if there is a problem lifelike Norton has agents\nWho will work to fix it now no one can prevent all identity theft or cyber crime or monitor transactions that all businesses but\nNew lifelike with Norton Security provides more detection and more protection against cyber threats go to life like dot com recall eight hundred for forty forty eight thirty three years to ... rush for an additional ten percent off your first year plus a twenty five dollar Amazon gift card with and you will that Roman terms applied\n[noise] little\nTerm elections I think the cabin on hearing says awoken people to just how vicious the Democratic party can be\nYeah I'll listen to the old tactics of the past with the Republican Party mature intimately familiar with where\nDemocrats lobby political grenade right onto the field usually some kind of a you go through the list every night or on your Fox or you know a racist besides you this you know the the phobic focal folk kind of stuff these identity politics grenades and Republicans would scatter\nWell they tried a new one with Kavanaugh they try to really disgusting one this rapists line which is one of the most important things I've ever seen in politics and for the first time shot in a long time\nWe had a president the White House who said we're not going to back down and cabinet we're not going to let you back down we're going to back you up and we won one and that when I Believe is really just and this is not a scientific sample I don't want to oversell it\nBut based on me just driving around in my town which is a fifty fifty Republican Democrat county Martin County Florida\nRepublicans could not be more ecstatic that we finally have a warrior and a fighter in the White House who is not going to flee the battlefield when that identity politics or disgusting label or comes in from the Democratic party and I think it's really\nA spice up the Republican base and I think we may have a we may have a a decent the election day\nWell I'm not sure I Can't read the tea leaves um I think it all comes down in these midterm elections always comes down to turn out and people are motivated like the Rasmussen poll says\nUh than it would happen I'm looking at the numbers that Republicans are more mad about the cabinet controversy than Democrats are and I'm more determined to vote in the upcoming elections this is a dramatic twenty five point shift in just the last six weeks Greg Jarrett so that would give hope to me and hopefully the American people that\nSomehow the Republicans can bucked the trend in and maintain power in the house and maybe pick up some Senate seats which I think are a distinct possibility\nWell I think you're right the only question is with twenty seven days remaining or does this trend that Republicans are motivated in energized devote\nHave legs will it last over the course of the next four weeks [noise]\nUm and you know we just don't know that but you're right the polling data does show that and I you know I think that there is a general anger among both men and women across America that this was a process\nOf the confirmation hearing that was a mass amount of fairness and the presumption of innocence and due process and that absent some corroborating evidence from a thirty six year old claim\nYou really can't ruin somebody's career and\nTheir lives and you know the reputation or ... that they built up in the goodwill and their families reputation\nSure I mean I Do think that there is a feeling across America that a lot of this is unfair now there are liberals and the media which is ... and uh who are show rabbit that they don't care about furnace today just care about their own political agenda\nHowever misplaced in wrong it may be and show you're never going to change their minds there is no reasoning with on reasonable people so we'll just have to wait and see it's up to the Republican Party I think and and the candidates and indeed President Trump\nTo maintain the momentum going forward over the next twenty seven days\nLook the hell out of great article today about what their agenda is and they the Democrats have big plans none of which will help the country or they want to shore up Obamacare which has been nothing short of a disaster for the American people\nThey want more Dodd Frank financial rules to protect quote dreamers and the integrity of elections in other words they want massive amnesty they want to aggressively probe any single thing they can they want this country locked down into endless investigation\nAnd likely the impeachment of Donald Trump\nThey you know Republicans celebrate the passage of the biggest tax cutting history they refer to as crumbs\nAnd they're saying it's time to take the crumbs back I guess the crumbs or the most delicious part of the meal so all of this is in jeopardy dam bond you know I don't see a waning in people's enthusiasm now I think they have they went so far in the cabin okay some frankly in the last two years what we have witnessed with the\nEnd you chronicled lives in your new book\nYou know the the attempt to sabotage of the president I think they see the fundamental unfairness and nothing they stand for is going to help the average American I have a better life\nAnd so on the media and Greg just nailed it by the way that you know the media and the Democrats ... ... it's it's it's symbiotic guy I mean it it's a host and a and a parasite at this point they're the same thing they have ...\nThe up this rage or not all of them but many of 'em against Donald Trump to such an intense for me think about the things showing that have come out I mean new lows in politics Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee called the rapist Donald Trump called the treat treat guilty of treason a crime literally punishable by death that's not hyperbolic\nHe'd been she's been called treasonous they've given up the base so much on that here's the problem the Democrats have created for themselves and the election\nThat in order to seem like the more anti Trump candidate to get that money in those volunteers for your twenty twenty presidential campaign or to get that money in the midterms what do you have to do you have to oppose the trader you have to oppose the train rapist or whatever it's thick name they call the capital\nSo that that's what's leading to this a psycho pathology on the left\nAnd I agree I I don't see this waning and I do see Republican voters saying listen when is enough enough you attack this this this American patriot and cabinet or you try to take down the Trump Administration weaponize and the government when is enough enough and I think they're going to show up I Hope I pray they do\nWell what do you think about Hillary's endorsement of ah the incitement of getting in people's space and you can't be ... basically calling for instability you you can't really civil with the political party\nThat wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about and then the other comments made by people like Maxine Waters and others getting their base\nFollow him into a grocery store is following the gas stations confront them chase them out of restaurants which we have seen going on and on a on a regular basis\nFor Republicans is absolutely wonderful you know they ought to send an early Christmas gift or Hillary Clinton Michael ... Maxine Waters Jerry Adler Nancy Pelosi many of those individuals are calling for\nA the investigation and teach men to Brett Kavanaugh which Americans realize you is wrong and preposterous I could certainly explain how in a legal basis\nImpeachment is not possible for Brett Kavanaugh but the more that these toxic individuals' and all of the ones I mentioned\nEspecially Hillary Clinton are toxic or the more that only drives Republican voters to the polls to make sure that these people are not ah in positions of power and will not be able to ruin the accomplishments\nOf Donald Trump which have been incredible you know in the course of two years he's accomplished more than Brock Obama did in eight years the greatest level of American economic growth and prosperity in modern American history and that is not\nJust made up there I mean the statistics demonstrate that and so if Americans want to\nMaintain that prosperity 'em and add you know money to their wallets into private\nAh from government officials who loved just squander hard earned money from American taxpayers are their choices easy\nWhile I did like Kevin McCarthy introduce which was a bill to fully fund the Trump border wall or the president has already spent about what three three and a half billion dollars you needs about twenty three billion dollars more to get the job done and I think that is certainly one of the big\nIssues that Americans would be motivated to go out and vote for and the other I think\nYou know the president rightly said he couldn't make as many as four more Supreme Court appointments that is a massive issue at this point at it it's a tipping point for the courts you know if you think of the age in the health of some of the justices that there is no doubt there will be vacancies in the in years to come in the near future\nYeah and don't forget shown that the circuits in the district court the Supreme Court gets all of the attention you know it's the sexy story the highest court in the land quite obviously\nBut his Greg can tell you most of these cases that are ... importance to American businesses American individuals moms and dads out there are settled that the circuit court level they don't even make it to the Supreme Court\nAnd Trump already has was uh twenty six appoint east of the circuit courts\nAnd there's a couple of more are getting ready to the to be confirmed as well so this is a really big deal now um we have of course the Ginsburg seat a you know they could come up and if Trump wins reelection bid may come up and I ... and I say that Sean I'm worried I mean I mean it I'm actually\nWorried what will happen to the country if that seat if Ginsburg decides to step down I mean look what we just witnessed with cabinet can you imagine what's gonna happen if that seat comes open has the potential\nSix three conservative majority and the courts\nI mean it is genuinely frightens me at it and again that's not melodramatic I worry for my kids what will happen\nA

as as I suspect he might\nUm he doesn't ah he's not looking at a fashion misleading statement of Congress he's not looking at perjury because he can always deny the conversations Dick ... remembers the which which is why this is so critically important\nWell they've got to do and they shot a subpoena him and they've got a demand to show up and they've got to put them under oath and these answers

David they get a ... a warrant signed by a career law enforcement person\nSwearing that what you are presenting to the court is true and that you know it to be true and affirmed it to be true well\nThat didn't work out with the third renewal by the application in the case of Carter Page\nA which is the fourth buys a warrant issued but the fourth one that was signed was signed by Rod Rosenstein\nAnd we all know that the bulk of information that was put in the ... and ... well that was based on the bone eight Clinton bought and paid for dot CA that not even Christopher Steele stands by to this day and that was never\nTerrified never corroborated and has turned out to be mostly debunked which is among the many other conflicts that Rod Rosenstein has of course he's the one that recommended firing Jim call me he's the one that signed the visor warrants he's the one that appointed Mueller\nAnd now he was scheduled to appear tomorrow under oath and a two sources now telling Fox News at this hour\nThat Rod Rosenstein scheduled the parents before the house Judiciary Committee is at an impasse\nOver the terms of the testimony\nAnd he doesn't want to have a transcribed interview under oath which is the standard for congressional taskforce interviews\nAnd those closed the Rosenstein say well he prefers a meeting or a briefing with the house Judiciary Committee chairman and other lawmakers where there's no paper trail where there's no under oath part well the question is why would he be afraid to go under oath\nWell here to weigh in on this and much more\nUh as as impasse continues Mark Meadows he is the Freedom Caucus chairman and congressman Jim Jordan of Ohio also a Freedom Caucus member a and by the way would be in the house Judiciary Committee\nInterview of Rod Rosenstein um we also have learned in the last three days Mark Meadows I'll start with you that\nWe now know that Lisa Page\nAndrew McCabe the deputy FBI directors under criminal investigation Lisa Page who is out at the FBI James Baker the top attorney the FBI they all are telling the same story that Rod Rosenstein said that he wanted to surreptitiously record the president of the United states\nIn the hopes of being able to get him to say something that would allow them to invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment so we there's a lot of questions were Rod Rosenstein at this moment\nWell there are a lot of questions I think probably the bigger question is why would Rod Rosenstein\nOr not be prepared to come to Congress tomorrow to clear his name\nAnd I think the reason for that is there there are credible witness is you know your lead in had Rod Rosenstein voice saying well you know the needs to be facts and we have the rule of law well we're willing to to consider him innocent until proven guilty\nHim not coming tomorrow indicates a that there is real credibility with these witnesses that suggested that he not only wanted to take the president but he wanted to use those tapes a to effectively have a de OJ coup on the president of United States\nWell he met with the president apparently earlier this week and blue on air force one does anyone know what the result of that meeting was\nWell I think the biggest thing is uh Shaun is is a let's don't read too much into a flight on air force one and I think it's the president trying to be reasonable and hear rod side of the story I think the president has been extremely measured", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Providence", "day": "13"}
