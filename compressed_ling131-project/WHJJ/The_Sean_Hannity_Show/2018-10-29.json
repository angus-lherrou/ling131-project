um we're letting getting to know a lot more about Robert Bowers and who he is he was a very ill and anti Semite\nHe was a huge critic of Donald Trump\nOr in a lot of ways um and the president you know she'll keep for saying what that means maybe and we've talked about this after school shootings and after other church shootings\nWhere the president said well maybe we need to have retired police and military it's a sad state of affairs\nBut um as a line of defense but that doesn't take away from the horror and the vicious evil\nThat took place here you look at the victims I mean it is heartbreaking to see the faces of those slain for their faith was the cover of the New York post today and as you read about the the lives of these people it is one heartbreaking story after another\nAre sadly too we watched the media do what they always do and that's rushed to blame and pulling out all the stops to blame Donald Trump for the Pittsburgh\nMassacre when in fact the prime minister of Israel Ron dorm or the ambassador of all said that the president's comments were welcomed unappreciated\nOn every front um we'll get into all those says we continue rose cannon I'm the

turn and those trying to cast blame against the president make this a campaign issue is just nauseating\nIt is shining you or so left in Pittsburgh as well as soon as I heard the story the news Saturday morning I mean my heart went out and I was almost afraid to hear that list of victims their names because\nThis community it's such a lovely place it's a very popular Pittsburgh neighborhood\nI go there to shop and to dying and in fact my son told me just about a month ago that's one of the neighborhood is considering moving too so we we love that community it's a tight knit

the two brothers\nThat perished on Saturday but there were so many people that have done so many great things in this community and the Pittsburgh area and it just it's heartbreaking it really is to see that this happened but as soon as I thought those things\nAnd immediately I got sick thinking that this is starting to become political and\nIt's like you can count the seconds there's an interesting side no there's no brothers to David I'm how democratic candidates increasingly turn against Israel\nAnd our mutual friend Alan Dershowitz you know I had a pretty powerful column that he put out linking the the mass of good at the Democratic party's tolerance for anti Semitism most recently we saw Bill Clinton two seats down from Louis Farrakhan\nI'd never ever get in a room with a vicious racist anti Semite like Louis Farrakhan or picture that emerged to with ... and Obama that was hidden from the public for eight years while he was president that existed that they had had a relationship\nUm and if you look at some of the the the most pro Israeli president I think we have had since the the forty eight partition plan un partition plan is a is Donald Trump\nMore recently making Jerusalem the capital of Israel which so many other presidents have promised that never had the courage to do\nThat any person who would suggest for a moment Donald Trump president as many bone in his body is that of their mind look in his family et cetera but you're absolutely right and what you pointed out ... ... if you believe that words matter then it goes much further than just a

have to have a zero tolerance policy President Obama meets with ... shame on him President Clinton sits on a platform with Farrakhan shame on him Keith Ellison joins Farrakhan was one of the greatest purveyor of anti Semitic hate he's right\nI'm just because he's black doesn't give him in the past four is anti Semitism in any liberal\nWas any positive association with Farrakhan as is part of the problem not the solution and you know just last week Farrakhan was making anti Semitic statements and it was only two months ago that Al Sharpton Jesse Jackson and Bill Clinton were all sitting next to each other with Farrakhan at a wreath of Franklin's funeral\nI Would not go to any funeral and even that I'm Sorry I just you draw the line\nAnd trying to find me here too and it's something I like your listeners to know because I I noticed a couple of headlines today on Sunday there was a letter that was published in written by eleven members\nAn anti Semite killed gee that was his goal those

many lives that they could and he regretted that he couldn't save more these are the real stories and this is the truth these are not accept the nation divided that's what the ones that could lead the media wants to believe\nThat we're a nation divided but we're not we're a nation or a community like this one like any other when we're faced with adversity when we come face to face with a madman we roll up our sleeves we face that evil with courage and the sacrifice\nAnd and and that is truly are as Americans and when they play the blame game on the media it just makes me sick because we missed what the true story is what the truth is and rabbi Myers I Love when he said he said that bullet holes or to numerous to count\nBut we will rebuild because we're tree of life we've been here one hundred and fifty four years you can cut off some branches that the tree will continue to grow we will be back\nSo that Sean is who we are and date as a nation I Know you agree that we are in the

eight hundred nine four one Sean if you want to be a part of the programs amazing the criticism that has been out there or what should be good coverage of the president President now sending up to five thousand troops to the border\nOr a significant display of solidarity for our sovereignty our borders the rule of law as he should\nWe saw about a week ago when at the Guatemala and Mexican border that\nLet people got to the border knocked download fence charged over the police and walk right through Mexico and we now have estimates as high as fourteen thousand people maybe less somewhere in there in around that area that are trying\nTo make it to the southern border the United states and the president and the secretary of homeland security of made it perfectly clear the vice president made it perfectly clear\nThat that's not going to be allowed to happen that we're a nation of laws to turn around\nThat to do it the right way to do with the legal way and in spite of that the marchers keep coming although the president of Mexico did make an offer for some of the migrants if they wanted would be given\nSpecial consideration to work in southern Mexico a but not many takers apparently according to what I read this weekend you know a lot of people have been asking well okay how did they get so organized to organize them\nAnd who's financing all of this\nUm there's been a lot of conspiracy theories that I've never believed that the only one that made any and then there's not a conspiracy I'd I'd when the vice president said last week\nThat he felt that some of the leadership\nAnd Honduras was responsible for promoting the caravan and some countries are from South America Venezuela particular we're we're helping to finance some of this that's the only\nBit of information that I found that was somewhat viable as a potential truth um anyway Sam Faddis is with us Sam Faddis he's a senior partner uh and former CIA operative with Thirty years of experience in conducting intelligence operations in the middle east South Asia Europe\nAnd he's worked against the most dangerous of terrorist organizations the planet has ever seen has extensive first hand experience with their methodology and tactics and a welcome to the program so glad you're with us thanks for serving your country\nThank you for having been a pleasure\nWhat so you're you wrote a column and night but I haven't read the whole column me up with my read of it is as you think that the vice president was probably right on the mark\nWithout question right on the mark I mean there's actually there's actually a great mystery here I mean the guys that organized this or for somebody party called ... which is a Honduran Marxist Party\nA number of years ago supportive of of of the president who basically tried to overthrow the constitution and they can solve all presidents for life here in bed with the Venezuelans\nAnd they have laid out in front of God and everybody all over the Internet there will and organizing a posted videos and pictures from the march\nSo again no great great mystery this is the work of guys allied with Venezuela Marxist and it is in effect a giant covert action campaign designed to make the American\nGovernment or bad in our allies look that\nWell I mean look the America doesn't have much of a of a choice and and this has to be obvious to people ... and\nI'm listening and watching the comments and some people sort of associating this with ... with anti immigrant sentiment or is he in a phobia or whatever the the charges it's not true all conservatives are saying we don't care where immigrants come from the president talked about a border wall\nWith a big door and that people should respect our laws\nAre constitutional republic\nAmerican sovereignty and come in and if you want to come in we just need to check out make sure that you don't come here with radical ideas and that you have the ability to sustain yourself\nAnd don't need our help and then we can let you in and you could become a part of our family to the extent that you want to go through the process of maybe become a citizen I don't think that's too much to ask that's called the legal wet\nYeah without question this doesn't have anything to do with a Smith ethnicity does not seem to do with race\nThat says yeah we're a nation of immigrants were also a nation of laws and according to legal immigration procedures period which don't simply to walk across the border I have always wondered\nBy the way those folks that are actively don't want to control the border why is it that only people who can walk here should be allowed to getting the status to get that's the principal\nWell when I'm married I'm I don't want anybody to get hurt because America the president means what he ... and if people rush across our border beat at a port of entry or along the border that is not fence and our military is on the border the military is going to be\nGiven the order to stop them now we don't want anybody hurt I don't want and I'm assuming Ninety nine point eight percent of the people coming here\nUh coming here because they come from impoverished countries and they want a better life for themselves and their family that's my guess\nBut nobody can vouch for every single person in that caravan\nAnd for the sake and safety of the American people we can't let that number of people rush across the border have no vetting of the people and sadly maybe amongst the fourteen thousand there's one or five people that come here with intentions to bring us harm\nI agree with the sun shine we don't want anybody hurt and also it is undoubtedly true\nBut most of these people are simply on being utilized by folks hostile to the U.S stuff probably been lied to the gun I'm told that when they get to the border will be allowed to cross\nOn so they are being caught in the in the middle of this I'm simply lose touch of really as human shields on Conan harder on the behalf of folks hostile to the United states that is a horrible tragedy because these are mostly just average people will be used\nNow look I Will tell you that you don't want I really feel sorry for people I've taken the time I think more than any other person and media in this country\nAnd I've been down to the border Thirteen times and horseback all terrain vehicle boats helicopters I've been there I've seen gang members arrested I've seen drug warehouses I've seen tunnels built um I I've been on the border spot one place in particular did have a wall and fencing and I can look across the fence\nAnd on the other side of Mexico I saw nothing but poverty\nI saw ... what we would almost describe homes built surrounding what looked like what we would describe as a junk yard even and then on the other side of the fence or you know million dollar half million dollar homes in San Diego\nAnd if I'm On that one side and all I see is poverty and and and ... I think I'd want to look across to the other side and I want to go over there is things looked dramatically different and better over here and I don't think Americans you know there were very open people\nBut we can't take in the world's population and we have to have the ability to control our borders and what we're asking is that people do it the right way\nAnd it really just keeps you know what's in our circular argument it's just what we have to do for our own safety\nThere without question of what you just described is most of the world all of sub Saharan Africa ... most of South Asia most of Latin America is the argument here on the people who control the border that\nWe are supposed to allow three to four billion people move here because that is what you were actually talking about if you're going to carry this to its ultimate logical conclusion and we obviously cannot do that we have to maintain control of horrible\nAll right we'll really really appreciate it Sam thank you eight hundred nine for one Sean is our number you want to be a part of the program we got to take a break up right so the biggest part of off year elections mid term elections or turn out that means you showing up\nAnd this election that we have coming up well it's the most important we have seen in decades why because your savings your tax savings that's on the ballot the American economy he's on the ballot America's comeback is on the ballot your jobs are on the ballot your kids\nIs on the ballot your wages your four oh one case that is also on the ballot and if you're a small business owner your tax cuts are on the ballot\nAnd here's the biggest issue on the ballot who is in charge of America's future politicians bureaucrats the socialist in DC or you you want to preserve the victories of the past two years\nOld get involved this election this November and go to big choice election dot com big choice election dot com\nIt just it's a disaster for us eight hundred dying for one Sean toll free telephone number [noise]\n\nEventually every seem to be retiring must have died should I go it alone working out before you make a decision called Jess Massey invest an hour of your time with\nPeople listen internally he learnt into a retirement strategy personalize the you know whether that's using investment or insurance or vote ... put it on paper you could take it home kick the tires talk\nIt over and you might cover just what you were looking for just done this for more than Thirty years for hundreds of ... you are like anyone else in your retirement strategy will reflect that\nFor your own personal retirement strategy Jess Massey\nWon three three three thousand four zero one three the three eight zero zero zero\nMandy and associate\nMore oh one three three three thousand\nFour zero one three three three thousand\nInvestment advisory services offered only by do the registered individual through the management of the\nGym Gagliardi news radio nine twenty four seven FM\nHere's what's happening all us to stay flags and wrote autumn lord ... until sunset Wednesday\nOf victims of the deadly shooting at a synagogue and Pittsburgh\nBrought on state larger fraternal order of police endorsing two Republican candidates in next week's elections Robert Flanders and Cranston mayor album song accused synagogue shooter Robert Bowers made an appearance in Pittsburgh courtroom today reporters inside the courthouse says ... hours only answered yes or yes sort of the judge's questions\nSeem calm when conversing with his attorney in sports Monday Night football the patriots visit the bills get news twenty four seven on demand and news radio alright\nDot com now you're storm team ten forecast powered by Dunkin' Donuts fall flavors try any ice coffee for only two dollars two to six PM well see just a few clouds around tonight with the low in the upper thirties mostly sunny Tuesday a high near fifty one mostly sunny for Halloween day behind you're sixty degrees\nBut dropping to the fifties into the upper forties for trick or treating mostly cloudy staying dry on Thursday and high near sixty six I'm storm team ... marks or all news radio nine twenty and one of four seven FM\nRadio nine twenty\nWell not if I was spent on your brief ... where you have to be Ninety five split ... ... you have to warn avenue Ninety five door slow between the resentment of the state offices ... busy after\nSmithfield out who don't pass the hospitals and then what happened to one forty six loan to Ninety five six ten back to Toby how busy between Ninety five and root six two Ninety five so busy\nAfter route six down towards the landfill north on your clear after route thirty seven if you do see problems because of Providence auto body traffic tip line one eight six six nine nine nine Seventy two hundred with your southern New England traffic I'm Jim Stearns\nNews I'm rich Dennis ...

thirty races now we have identified actually if you look at real clear politics they have they ever narrow this down to five races that they believe will be the tipping point it's actually thirty races kind of like what we have but\nThey they have a five seat race they've got the Republicans locked in a two hundred seats they got the Democrats locked in a two hundred and five seats\nAnd the remaining seats are up for grabs in other words they are toss ups in other words if we win the seats and that means that Republicans will retain the house control of the house of representatives now that would be the super when that you want to go for the Senate is looking better but don't take anything for granted I think will have pickups\nI think will hold Tennessee with Marsha Blackburn I think we can beat Claire McCaskill Heidi Heitkamp I think Joe Donnelly can be beaten these down in the polls I\nBelieve that Christians to send them out can be beaten as well how she was up at three in the latest polls beyond any imagination I have\nA poll has a dead heat exactly even type forty six all Nelson versus Rick Scott who's been a phenomenal governor for the great state of Florida Rhonda Santa's is coming back interesting John James Michigan is cut his\nThe latest habit now in half\nAnd it's only a six point race in Michigan where it was one twenty and so he's doing very well a

the night\nBoth West Virginia and New Jersey to states to watch for potential surprise not likely but potential uh one of the house races that are on our top thirty is Marty a no Stein is a gold medal

for having me on the show you know out campaigning hard every single day eating every quarter of this district and I got to tell you there's a lot of motivation out there right now I think people are starting to pay attention they understand what's at stake and they went to the Democrats in November six\nWell look the issue to me are simple but we have is we know what the Democrats agenda is to impeach trumpet don't say it open borders sanctuary cities sanctuary states but don't say it keep Obamacare but don't say that either just say work for great health care for all of making some wonderful just like\nYou know keep your doctor your plan and pay less that's their agenda and they want their crumbs back\nBeyond that it's let's hide and not tell people what we really stand for

Heitkamp will unveil another senator tonight all caught on tape all three campaigns\nSaying that they purposely running as moderates but they plan to govern as liberals and their offices are laughing
