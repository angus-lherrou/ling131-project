to get reelected and how would it be perceived by a their electric if they vote against Kavanaugh so there's a lot of interesting phase is at play here regarding the president if you're just tuning in there's a New York times bull last\nThe piece the New York times I just smack in the president and the last couple of hours the New York times out with a piece\nClaiming that the Trump has misled for years about how we made all his money that the ah the Trump but companies have engaged in tax fraud and especially in the state of his father the New York times I mean really just ...\nGoing after the president\nOr there's you know obviously no why shocker here are the New York times has consistently you know an attack this president uh you know some of the details I read some of the New York times piece last hour\nAnd you know I'd ask\nHey where the hell did all this documentation come from well uh you know and\nThere's plenty that we don't know exactly\nBut this is what they do say the New York times says the investigation also draws on tens of thousands of pages of confidential records bank statements financial on its accounting ledgers cash disbursement reports invoices and cancelled checks most notably the documents include more than two hundred tax returns from Fred Trump\nHis company's the various Trump partnerships in front of all the records do not include the president's personal tax returns and reveal little about his recent visit feelings at home and abroad\nDozens of corporate partnership and Trump's tax returns offer the first public accounting of the income here were seen for decades from various family enterprises\nAnd it says what emerges from this body of evidence is a financial biography of the forty fifth president fundamentally at odds with the story Mr Trump sold in his book says TV shows and his political life so the New York times here they're they're calling Trump an absolute liar\nThey're saying I and and back to the story and Mr crumbs version of how he got rich he was a master dealmaker who broke free of his father's tiny outer borough operation and parlay to single million dollar loan from his father\nAnd then in parentheses quote I had to pay him back within first into a ten billion dollar empire that would slap the Trump name on hotels high rises uh casinos airlines golf course of the world over and Mr Trump's version it was always his godson gumption that overcame setbacks\nFred Trump was simply a cheerleader\nSo their claim here is that Trump has vastly under sold the financial kick start that he'd gone from his father\n[noise] and then of course there's the allegations of all kinds of tax fraud and wheeling and dealing on his parents a state which they received a a billion dollars from and if they uh they ... the low allegedly shorted the governments are out\nOf the hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes with the New York times alleging a Trump tax scheme back in the Nineteen nineties\nThere are also reports that based on the New York times reporting here\nCNBC is now reporting that the New York State Department of revenue that they are now looking into the allegations made\nBy the New York times

whole oh you don't\nNeed to keep your tax returns past seven years and then I heard in recent years if you know for years uh but if there's fraud or that they can't go back a that's a you know the

I Want to get into what this all means I'll get into that at the bottom of the hour a little bit but what we do know now is\nThat obviously all the people that said we believe her long before we knew really anything about it\nThose that rush to judgment eliminated all due process all presumption of innocence that is the Democratic party today forgetting that of course they were against judge Kavanaugh before he ever got an ounce anyway and it didn't matter who Donald Trump\nNominated to the U.S Supreme Court they were going to be against but Democrats not caring about your rights\nFundamental rights that have made this a stronger country and I actually think the New York times by moving on to a Fifteen page\nA tax expos they on Donald Trump's father and well he might have gifted son money years ago when he was eight and\nTherefore he got as well from his father I mean it's it's totally seems to me that they moved on from any chance that have covering the Kavanaugh case 'cause it's probably already done\nWith the FBI investigation wrapped up wrapping up and now handing hand he goes over to the Senate I Want the American people to have a right to see this I think the American people now invested in this\nAnd I think the American people will have a right to know for sure what the FBI came up with remember they're not going to make conclusions they're not going to make recommendations they're just gonna say probably what the Senate investigative committee had found out already\nThat they in the case of professor Ford for example she didn't remember date a day of the week a location how she got to or from the location where the alleged crime took place she mentioned four witnesses for people that were at the event no corroborating evidence of any kind\nAnd no one backing up her story including the one person that she placed in the room during the alleged attack\nAnd Democrats you know they they thought this was enough to initiate yet another FBI background check and you know so now it's wrapping up in the mainstream media they've already made up their minds in fact in\nYou know then we learned about mystery mirrors and the New York times couldn't even print that story because when they called dozens of people they found out this Ramirez was actually\nNo she didn't know herself if it was professor I'm Sorry if it was judge Kavanaugh because she was asking former yell classmates I don't fully ... do you remember I'm not sure it was him know that kind of puts that case to rest\nAnd on top of the other things that she admitted that she had gaps in her memory and that she had been in ... braided rather quickly\nThat that particular event then the third claim the most outrageous claim from this woman named Julie sweat Nick represented by the anti Trump to sell it Mike eleven Ninety alleging that Kavanaugh was involved in the\nCereal drugging almost on a weekly basis all she says she went to ten of these parties but as he said almost on a weekend basis\nWhat happened where young boys in these prep schools would be drug in young girls teenage girls and lining up in the halls and raping them and then of course she gave for names to\nNBC News and well NBC News didn't find one person a backup or story one of the names was dead another name was somebody that I have no idea who this person is and they still ran the story\nAnd then of course backtracking on a on a variety of issues significant issues of the story that she just released a week a\nWeek prior how does that become news\nAnd yet that is what the media now does they were perfectly happy airing that interview and now she's saying well well they weren't exactly wind up in the hall um while he was in ... I saw him near the punch bowl and he was given out red solo cups too people\nThat's not drug in girls on a nearly weekend basis and lining up in the halls to gang raped women\nYoung girls and you'd have to believe that if that happens that regularly and was that well known there would be some core operation\nThat somebody would have told at the time or a law enforcement official a teacher a parent that this was happening or this happened or their drug in kids and and then lining up to rape young girls\nAnd it's gotten so absurd now that you have the senator from Hawaii wanting to investigate the ice throwing incident from Brett Kavanaugh apparently through ice in a bar when he was in college\nPolice documents that show that Brett Kavanaugh through ice in someone's face during a bar fight why he was in college do you feel that that is in any way just qualify for somebody in a Supreme Court\n[noise] and eat and has the Haitian because there are a lot of allegations as far as really are about how he behaves finance truck\n[noise] All right so we're at the end of this process now it's interesting that the Senator Grassley in a written declaration release late last night that we got a hold of at the Fox news channel an ex boyfriend of\nProfessor Ford's uh was the California professor accusing Brett cabin on that particular case anyway directly contradicting her testimony under oath to last week that she had never help anyone prepare for a polygraph examination\nFormer boyfriend whose name was redacted in the declaration also said the poured\nNeither mentioned Kavanaugh ... mentioned that she was a victim of sexual misconduct during the time that they were dating from around Ninety to Ninety eight\nAnd he said that he saw for going to great lengths to help a woman that he believed was a lifelong best friend prepare for a potential polygraph test and he added that the woman I had been interviewing for jobs with the FBI and the U.S attorney's office\nIn further claimed afford never voiced any fear of flying even while aboard a propeller plane that they were on seemingly having no problem living in a very small five hundred square foot apartment ... look\nThese are the small details to me I and I some of you may think this was all significant and at the end of the day\nShe said they were for people\nThat could corroborate her story none of them can corroborate her story most don't remember any party like this and the one eye witness that she placed in the room at the time of the alleged assault said it didn't happen\nSo at that point you've got to presume somebody's innocent\nYou don't know the place you don't know the time you have a date you don't have a location is nothing that the FBI can do except take your statement and assuming that the poor people that have already been interviewed again under penalty of a felony\nYou got to assume that they didn't commit perjury and commit a felony when the FBI came back to asked the same questions\nAnd if they did then okay that would be a pretty big deal there is no indication up to now based on reporting that has come out on all the people that have been spoken to a lot of people are making a big deal over the fact well they haven't spoken to professor Ford but I mean professor Ford is now told their story multiple times and I've got to\nAnd assume that they're they're thinking that well her story hasn't changed she just said it last week before the Senate Judiciary committee um you know it's just [noise] I I just there's there's so much at stake I I\nGet into what this all means\nBecause what it means matters you know at the end of the day what this means for the country for the future of the country all that matters\nLindsey Graham is saying Clinton sex accuses were treated a hell of a lot worse than professor Ford and I I think the the Republicans held the actually did something well\nI think they handled it with the level of seriousness a topic like this deserves and we'll see what happens in the next couple of days and who's going to vote which way a democratic protesters by the way of salt but a GOP congressmen in his Capitol office\nApparently congressman Andy Harris assaulted by protesters Tuesday Afternoon they they're gonna have to start kicking people out of the ... of these Senate buildings in ...

screaming at you\nIf you represent in the country\nMitch McConnell firing back at it an army of out of control you know democratic protesters threatening and trying to intimidate him and other Republican senators and\nSo we'll see what that means from his vantage point uh we also have Grassley saying the investigation now is almost done for complaining the FBI never contacted her but they

going to vote no because we have one party\nThat in every single case even though there's no core operation even though facts on the ground continue to shift didn't change where we don't know a data location people that are supposedly eyewitnesses to alleged\nActs of violence say it didn't happen\nAnd the stories change about well they're putting drugs in the in the punch and boys are lining up almost on a weekly weekend basis to rape girls are lining up in the halls while he was around the punch bowl and he gave out some red solo cups\nThat's what that evolved into you know at what point is there no shame here at what point do we not understand how deeply dangerous this is\nFor every American because we're throwing due process and the presumption of innocence literally out the window Newt Gingrich is with us\nA former speaker of the house with thirty four days away from an election best selling book Trump's America the truth about our nation's great comeback well I guess that's on the ballot and thirty four days how are you\nI'm doing well and I think you know you can't have shame if you're only interest is Rob power and that's where we've seen a Dianne Feinstein deliberately holding the letter was about raw power\nOr the fact that you have a democratic senator who says if you're for Kevin all your complicit with evil\nBest raw power or the kind of smearing dishonest questions and accusations that we've seen that raw power\nAnd that is what this election is about this election will decide what kind of country we are\nTo Iraq how ... how many Americans are really comfortable with this kind of character assassination dishonesty and all out effort to destroy decent people and I think that's gonna be in it that is truly on the ballot even if it's not on the ballot because all of us have now seen\nRight there on television and editing without distortion we've seen how bad these people are\nWell I just you know on a level that we've never seen before and I guess it really comes down there are five people but I think it really two of the Democrats that would've considered voting\nFor judge Kavanaugh will only do it I Believe in fact there's enough Republicans to get them over the finish line but it comes down to Susan Collins that comes down to Lisa Murkowski and Senator Jeff snowflake who is on his I Want to be president trip to New England this week ... most of the week\nAnd his media tour which is second to none so how does this end up\nWell I've been I think in the short run that I I'm an optimist I think that the the basic decency a judge Kavanaugh one of his family ah the sense that most Americans have that he has been a smear treated with a vicious personal attack all\nThose things I think mean that the Susan Collins the world is going to vote yes and he's going to be confirmed probably by Monday or Tuesday and Wednesday and he'll be on the court but to deeper underlying lesson that all of us should learn\nAbout who these people are how they operate how truly dishonest and vicious they are I Hope that that stage for very long time\nLet me ask you a thirty four days out of an election you were there as a strategist when Reagan became president but the first time in forty years you ran on something and you've got the entire caucus of Republicans house and Senate\nTo agree to nationalize an election and make promises to America you called it the contract with America\nAnd that you would you promised you would vote\nOn ten specific items in the first hundred days of what you did accomplish that pass and Republican for the most part with a few bumps pickups in the road\nHave been in power since um how to Republicans now I think the anger of the bases beyond anything I've seen in recent years rightly so over what's going on with the Kavanaugh hearings and the Democrats\nDemocrats don't have a vision for the future we had I ate horrible years of Obama we've had two very successful years of President Trump what is the pitch what what should these congressmen and women and senators be saying\nWell first of all the president has done a great job he watches various\nSuch as Mississippi opium Minnesota he's laying out the case that if you want results you have a team called Republicans\nAnd if you want resistance you've got a team called Democrats and he's been laying up and and you see it and the numbers than people realize the lowest unemployment for African Americans in history lowest unemployment for Latinos a continuous economic growth many good things that are happening thank the president has set the stage now to pit\nAnd spent the last five weeks telling us what's coming next we got this much damage you know ... I loved the vice President Pence and like you said America's coming back you know what I'm saying we're back yet because we're not push of a lot of work to do but we're coming back and now you have a chance for the president's leadership\nAnd I think this election ought to be about which kind of America do you want us to be we want us to keep coming back\nKeep creating jobs do you want us to control the border to save our children ... Thirteen gangs from France and all and promote people that are you prepared to be part of a team to one's\nConstitutional judges not radicals I think if we got campaign could be stunningly successful and we can have as much fun on election night as we had in two thousand seven\nWhite yeah I mean I heard your optimism in you that I look I'm going to be honest I don't quite share it I'm not there with you I think it can happen I Believe it's winnable\nI Believe the Republicans can keep the house I think that Rick Scott can win the Senate in Florida I think Republicans can defeat Joe Donnelly in Indiana a U.S a Joe Manchin of West Virginia\nA Claire McCaskill in Missouri I think they can beat Heidi Heitkamp I think Martha ... a great candidate out in Arizona I think Dean Heller can hold the same no matter but I think they're all tight races and then you've got then we've got about fifty competitive house races which could tip the balance of power there\nSome course that's probably have campaigns\nBut we've got we've got thirty five days out here to go out and when and and I remember it and you remember 'cause your air two thousand six two weeks out I Do an interview with Megan Kelly and she's telling me how we're going to lose so vain you are going to lose Michigan we're going to lose Wisconsin I just said to her we\nHave to alternative universes in my universe I Believe

trying to destroy Medicare\nThey're talking about destroying your health insurance they're talking about bankrupting the country\nAnd I think that we just have to go out and wage campaigning I must say\nPresident Trump is doing as good a job I'm getting out on the stump telling the truth laying it out as anybody I've ever seen and I I Believe in the American people my optimism grows out of a belief that the average hardworking decent American his disgusted\nBy what they just saw happened to Kevin all his is committed to a work ethic due to a better future and as the Democrats get more radical I think you're going to see the Republicans continue to move a you know for example a\nGovernment run health care means tax paid abortion well they're very few places in America where there's

it's crazy I mean I think they've gone down a road here the corner with long term because every\nGovernor out I I don't think so because it's so like when Harry Reid lied about Mitt Romney had to pay taxes then years and then he was asked after the election if he cared about lying about Mitt Romney's way there's no we won the election what's the difference and it's just I I the means providing the left\nSo believes conservatives are evil that they feel justified in whatever it is that they say that's right you know but the problem is here this is so serious an allegation\nAnd you know I'm not the biggest fan of the Republican Party I'm not a Republican I've been very critical when they're weak and timid and stupid\nAnd I would say they have handled this what the appropriate amount of serious this they have balance what is a fair system they've given every possibility shadow of a doubt and now it's time to vote\nNow the question is Kaylee where Susan Collins whereas Lisa Murkowski and where it's just snowflake vote\nIt down to three and he makes a con oh I see no real quick\nYou have to ... and I think that in a crap you're exactly right and they could we could go if we what if\nLike common or calcium or San I named him here that we might not error when you are and I say that not because I had any Democrat\nAt the high that they ... didn't mind you had Joe Manchin looking

hiking or match it or not vote for that nominee don't ever get out and people get their God that they might get out of their own political okay in\nA factory right well I mean yeah I mean high camp and and mentioned but\nI think I don't think they go that way a less\nCollins and Murkowski or a combination of of Collins and and flake or or Murkowski and play once the Republicans have the vote then they'll have the freedom to go and I don't think the Democratic leadership because of of flying hoot about their constituents in West Virginia Florida North Dakota\nIndiana Missouri because if they did they would say vote your conscience I mean Jeff Flake the hero of the Democratic party why because he admits season on principle man that would never vote the way he really felt\nBecause he's only doing this because he's he's lifted up the burden of having to face the horrible voters they get\nI mean that was a horrible admission on sixty minutes\nYeah yeah and I I mean [laughter] don't\nReal does wrong principle is a man that stands on values\nAnd it is a man who wrote a book mimicking Barry Goldwater's the conscience of the conservative ... and it you know if he is then now

you get your take on all those\nWell the new media standard is very very interesting at least for Republicans it's it's you can say John Smith rape somebody oh we can't prove that we don't have anybody else you don't have any witnesses so we're telling you you know what our problems are with our story but nevertheless\nJohn Smith rape somebody named that's that's what the media's going with Johnny I it's really important that your listeners know about what happens here in Washington when there's a high publicity investigation because I was involved in one in the Nineteen eighties with Ronald Reagan's\nUh the CIA director bill Casey\nAnd it was all over the the pay first how ... you know how soon we all forget about these things\nBut it I was with the Senate intelligence committee and we got fetch far ranging\nBizarre accusations about Casey Casey met me in a park and held me up with a gun bill Casey took all my stocks and sold them it's kept the money for himself I mean they were just radically out of a wild and that happens all the time in these investigations and you know what\nWe didn't make any of the public and even the Democrats back then\nDid not make them public and yet we have Kamala Harris\nI'm I'm told she's a lawyer she was the attorney general was California's she's supposed to know due process she released an anonymous chain do\nAccusation that's how the person signed it about Brett Kavanaugh of committing some lurid sex acts is there no decorum left in the U.S Senate anymore aren't going to sanction her in any way\nOh Alan Dershowitz was saying that isn't the case of Julie sweating that can particular that if in fact she you know she made the statements and they're\nProbably falls that he would want a full complete investigation into perjury allegations um you know Joe I I I don't know what the law enforcement should do I do know that is I Know that\nWe have now we examined every single case in every case there is no corroboration in every case there is multiple inconsistencies in the last case Julie sweating like there are so many inconsistencies in his mind numbing that NBC would ever aired that interview\nBut they are today anyway the eyewitnesses are the witnesses she mentioned one is dead one doesn't even know who she is and they can't get an answer from the other two and now the last minute 'cause they're desperate now they want the FBI investigating ice throwing incidence in high school\nYeah well I think um what has happened with Julie sweat Nick is that the Senate committee after the confirmation vote occurs needs to make a criminal referral\nTo the Justice Department or the U.S attorney for the district of Columbia to investigate her for obstruction of a congressional proceedings by submitted false affidavits and for perjury is written testimony very easy to investigate and it has to be done in order to send a signal\nTo everybody out there that you cannot simply make false statements to a congressional committee in a confirmation process to get yourself a publicity is very very important that ...\nBe investigated by a federal grand jury to act as a deterrent against others from making false accusations there is no substantiate for her story there is no substantial issues permits Ramirez story and I just want to say something that I Know\nUh probably showing you don't agree with she has repeatedly lied and liked her lawyers did not tell her that the committee was willing to come to California to interview her that is alive for lawyers did tell her that no good lawyer would never community\nShow I I got I got to tell you I don't think they told her if you remember in that moment when professor Ford was asked when I forgot maybe it was Lindsey Graham who or whoever it was said we offered to go to maybe Senator Grassley I think Senator Grassley and then she said\nOh I ... there was genuine surprise now remember Dianne Feinstein was working behind the scenes together a radical left wing activist a resistor as a lawyer this is Deborah cats\nCats by the way who said well Paula Jones only spend ten or twelve minutes with with Bill Clinton it wasn't a big deal that wouldn't constitute sexual harassment in the workplace\nAnd also defended and in the case of Al Franken but I I saw genuine shocking surprise and she goes well but I didn't know that but that was very nice do you if you offered that I didn't know why should\nThey should be referred to the D.C bar then for violation of professional world\nI I may I may very well come to conclude that eventually and I'm perfectly happy to accept that\nI can buy that and I'll tell you something that really bothers me about her story and as an old prosecutor who tried sex crimes cases here's the one thing about her story besides everything else we talked about that doesn't make any sense any victim in a situation like that goes to where people are\nFor safety now why is her story not include\nHer going to those people\nBecause if she had done that\nIf she ... literally if if what she says the Kurds and if she had gone to those people get what they would have remembered that in order for her to have a story that holds up without anybody knowing about it she had to leave the house\nI don't know though and look maybe you know because we're talking about the we all know that there are real evil predators there are people that do murder\nAnd rape innocent people there are people that will drug and rape people I eat look at the bill Cosby case\nWe know that and and this is why I think that the Republicans credit they took these allegations in charges seriously they handled it professionally they afford it every combination which was the right thing to do but for the Democrats they just they just now have pushed this so far\nInto a ... ... ... into any allegation no matter how many inconsistencies no matter no evidence no matter no cooperation whatsoever and we saw that they hated the guy from the beginning\nI don't I don't know what I don't know what victims remember or don't remember Joe and I don't know what how they act or react I Would assume was probably ... people react differently like you go to a funeral some people are crying some ...\nI was I was perfectly happy to accept anything that she had to say and I listen to her testimony carefully at the time and is and then I went back and I looked at it repeatedly and it may very well be that she believed everything she said\nThe problem is there's not a sin pillar of evidence to corroborated and convenient late enough everything that could have happened that would have made her story corroborate rubble is non existent there is nothing happened that just doesn't happen\nSean ... let me just say well you know we make our living trying to look at stories like this and taking them apart are supporting them\nThere's another problem with her story listen she said that they ... their music on an upstairs bedroom that's kind of weird because the party was downstairs that let's take it and they turned them music up so nobody could hear her and then she likes to south in the bathroom and she can hear them talking going downstairs what\nYou think these guys just turn the music ups and no one could hear it went over and then said let's turn it down I mean there are so many flaws in what she said\nI just don't know what look I I it's very hard I don't want to get into that whole aspect of it I got to take a break we'll come back more with Victoria Toensing Joe diGenova next\nAnd then your calls coming up final half hour we'll just do all calls eight hundred nine four one Sean hey listen if you have sunspots well our friends at Shawnee engineer so they came out with their brand new product

storm team tend to your all just marks or all news radio nine twenty four seven FM or\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n\nFrom a former for a friend of Dr Ford regarding a polygraph is very fascinating and then as soon as that came out [noise] now we have\n[noise] who is\nSaying that that no she denies the claim by the ex boyfriend with this polygraph claim and that ... this is fascinating and we'll get to that coming up in just a bit Iran Schmidt a phones already loaded uh you know my position is\nI log cabin ought to be confirmed I think you look at his record you look at the original American Bar association a thumbs up and the best possible rating because of his tenure as a federal judge and his decisions his opinions\nI mean that I just find that his judicial\nRecord is something that I have supported and I think he would make a great Supreme Court justice was as far as you know drinking habits and and juvenile things fed at sixteen and Seventeen years old and I I don't care I I really don't\nI and I'm just not buying and there's just not enough factual evidence to prove that Dr Ford's allegations are correct the issue again is the president I don't think needs to install any additional\nSpeed bumps or a obstacles hurdles to get a new way\nOf Brett Kavanaugh and that's why I don't think some of his comments in Mississippi last night I don't think they're actually helpful\nI thought I Can't sit here and say that the president didn't didn't openly for applause and laughs and Ken ... ended up a crowd and Mississippi didn't mock\nDr Ford now was the president wrong on most of the front snow factually the president was right and I brought up the same things on this program\nAbout her inconsistencies and not knowing this or that there's nothing wrong with the president could have done that it's just it's the mocking issue and today Sarah Huckabee Sanders held a White House press briefing a little after one o'clock this was the first briefing and in quite some time a couple of what three weeks or so I think since early September it's been a while\nAnd Sarah Huckabee's out what was it the attempt okay September attempts so you know a couple of three weeks or so so ah Sarah Sanders defended the president\nUh [noise]\nI I ... the facts were mostly right it was just the demeanor which I don't find helpful\nAnd again I don't need the president's ah alienating the votes that he needs again we've got three Republicans that are needed we've got Murkowski we have Susan Collins we have Jeff Flake\nAll three have now chastised the president for his tone last night I don't think it's helpful\nI mean this the mob mentality a torch caring yeah\nIt ... sometimes it's good sometimes it works but there are other times when\nIt does it you have to intelligently apply\nThat strategy I don't think last night was intelligently applied and all\nAnd then we have of course the the red state Democrats we've got Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota we have a Joe Manchin of West Virginia and again those are votes that could help push capital over the finish line as well so you know the question is\nIt before I go back to your phone calls here what is\nThe endgame here what is the president's goal\nAs far as getting Kavanaugh across the finish line\nBecause again the comments last night by the president will not helpful\nFor that particular goal so is it possible that the president has concluded that the fight over Kavanaugh is may be worth more in the midterms than actually having\nJudge Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court is that a possibility is there a chance that Trump and his advisors in strategists think that he can get some more mileage by filling up the base getting them out to vote in the midterms\nGoing um my biggest problem is mostly ... but they all do it uh is when they describe the lady testimony or become automatic oh she was so brave she came through and she told her truth\nThat's not even a thing you do not everybody don't get their own truth there's only one true you may never get to it but there's only one that's not even a thing I Wish they'd quit saying that there is no or truth is\nWell known so but

Nineteen eighty two incidents when in fact it's very muddled\nIt's very muddy and we just don't know what the details aren't she can't even remember all the details but everyone has presented her and they they they're putting her up on a pedestal like it is the absolute certified\nFat that everything you know as happened the way that she claims that I'm Sorry they're just do a lot of
