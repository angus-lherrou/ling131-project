Fox News as pressure mounts Saudi Arabian officials agree you're trying to find out what happened to a journalist who disappeared at the consulate in Turkey\nThat her mother says you know I think we all have\nA cat and say oh we have to do it ... you don't want to hear it in the arm because we're in the two generations of either it's unbelievable [laughter]\nGot some very very rarely the guys on ... tosses fan and editor and here are are they\nWay probably ... million dollars [noise] I don't want to say\nIf you take the test for the show here and there you know\nOkay [noise] a million dollars if you take the test the DNA test and it shows you an MBA and well first of all the results which she fully controlled with this bustamante I wouldn't want independent analysis\nI think there ought to be a secondary and tertiary test just a loss of like getting a second opinion but even\nIf she is at best\nOne thirty second which that's a stretch because the expert says that there's some ... with his expertise he's claiming that there is an American Indian blood DNA going back somewhere between six and ten generations\nAnd if it's ten generations that's where you get that she's only one and one thousandth perceptive actually one and one thousand twenty four percent Native American which is [laughter]\nAnd that's not very far outskirts of of the solar system folks I mean that's that's crazy and and let's do this and every line is jammed here but the question is I think it's a very good question\n[noise] with that for Trump\nHave to pay the million dollars even if there was a tiny thread or or should the benchmark or the threshold be that she has to be at least recognized as a Native American of that tribe based on the percentage that they require\nNow all tribes are different folks\nI could do the whole damn show others today 'cause there's so much and this story is so fascinating and what's made it even more fascinating is why the hell she thinks that this is a good thing when the evidence is so scant that it's a tiny little ... in the way the TPP believing fractured\nWhy she thinks that ruling saying that the documentary to find that have been a long documentary which I never get\nTo that audio yet I couple of things you and then we're going to go the phones but the question is should Trump have to pay a million bucks for as I was pointing out and grab a here we go and I'm not making this up is not this is not an joke from pow wows dot com\nI Swear I wasn't a power say Indian term so uh from Taos dot com\nWhich is a it's a Native American website with a whole change of information so it's run its a Native American website and\nUh on the website Native Americans are the people will consist of one of the more than five hundred distinguish tribes that endured till date as small sovereign states with the United states present geographic boundaries and it was a whole history here a certificate of degrees of Indian blood CDI bees\nAre issued by the bureau of Indian affairs the IRA an agency under the United States Department of the interior blah blah blah and then it just goes into a what is the tribal blood quantum requirements\n[noise] fifty percent you have to be fifty percent\nIn order to uh be from the the Nick of Suki try those are the the Florida\nIndians are they run a lot of the casinos hard rock so for instance silky a there's a Mississippi band of Chuck tall I don't know so I'm not going down the whole list here but you've got a in the in a groups that require fifty percent one half blood quantum meaning one of your parents\nUh is is a Native American then you've got a twenty five percent\nSo I'm looking for the tribes of which Elizabeth Warren claims to be of dissent and she has said Cherokee and Delaware\nSo looking here are looking for Cherokee and sharing key [noise]\nOkay I found Delaware so the Delaware Nation\nA which is a Delaware Nation Oklahoma which is one of the her claims you have to be twelve point five percent one a blood clot demeaning one great grandparent she doesn't even remotely qualify for a fact\nTwelve point five percent not even close\nSo then she also claims Cherokee now if I look down and I'm looking for Cherokee now for a Cherokee vat of political dissent I'm\nLooking for Cherokee on my list and I thought I had a highlight here we go uh Cherokee Nation\nIs six point two five percent or one sixteenth blood quantum I guess she doesn't even remotely qualify for a fact\n[laughter]\nYou got to hear this this is from Fox Report\nWarren might even be less Native American than the average European American is what I was mentioning this last hour that I read this or before the show Warren might even be less Native American than the average European American\nRepublican National committee spokesman Mike Reed set in a statement today Monday he also called a twenty four teams studying the ports warns claims in perspective\nThe study published by a team of scientists in late twenties fourteen and featured I'm In New York times amounted to the largest ever genetic profile of the U.S based on one hundred sixty thousand people\nThe study examined the average Native American ancestry four Americans including European African and Latino Americans according to the times report New York times failing newer talked\nAbout it but if Trump closest it won't be the failing New York times and according to the times report on the study which can be found on the national institutes of health website\nEuropean Americans had genomes that were on average Ninety eight point six percent European point nine percent African and point one eight percent Native American\nForeign Latino America's the average percentage of Native American ancestry was Eighteen percent well African Americans average was point eight percent\nSo if Warren is ten generations removed from Native American ancestor she would be no more Native American than point zero nine percent\nThan any of the group study the research so on the outs that there are actual Americans that\nAre more Native American that her claims that don't even remotely there knowing or even climate so she might be less nave American than the average American of European descent it might be more Native American in European American\nUh individuals or who descend from Europeans [laughter] [noise] [laughter] and they think is a good idea of going to tell this holy crap\nI let me grab some calls here 'cause phones are loaded I still have to get to the Native American DNA requirements some fascinating stuff came up and

saying oh really it's not like she's a quarter or an eighth sixteenth ... this is really big and there's a big in deep uh Rebecca is in Fort Myers Florida Rebecca you are on Schmidt welcome to the program\nThank you\nAnd Rebecca your thoughts are should Trump have to pay the million bucks to her favorite Germany\nThe whole thing is arguing Samantha if he said if you can prove that you are part Indian she's got him she pros get now for the rest of that\nAbsolutely ridiculous the small amount it shouldn't you know no affirmative action yes you have to be a certain percentage to get anything but he he said if you can prove that you are at all you know they can unseat any one what is in fact one thousand and twenty four\n[laughter] yeah I guess it's semantics\nShe got him he didn't he get his hey you have to qualify the euro tribes wherever he said you have to prove that you're Indian she proved ... he's got to pay up to her charity\nOh well it's burning but Rebecca let me come back at you with this\nShould there have to be an independent verification men\nWould probably be within his right to say okay so you use this this bustamante guy certainly he's got a very impressive resume and and the movie but if you don't mind we'd like to do two additional DNA tests and see how they come back\nTo it's like a second and third opinion if a million bucks is on the line\nDo you think that there ought to be a a a ... a control or should there be a at least verification from a different uh testing source\nI don't think there's anything wrong with going out and getting verification if she thinks she's Indian stand by it and what did she care how many tests are going to be done and then I was going to come out that she's a smart Gen that's all she needs that how he worried now that\nYou know I mean yeah try to get anything affirmative action and all that she doesn't qualify for any that that's ridiculous she probably as much American indian as I Am which is miniscule which is pretty much matter\nExcept so doesn't\nThat that that should be the way to do it right so if it's a million bucks and if one million divided by one thousand twenty four\nNo no no no not one time twenty four were taking a fraction of one and one thousand twenty four percent which comes out to a desk all of a point to own nine seven six five three to to to want whatever it is so [laughter] that that\nThat would come out to be it looks like Ninety grant\nBut it's a whole lot better than than a million dollars are so I\nThink I I think there would be great if you actually pay them off that you know whatever your mouth comes out to be an effort you know you could have had a million dollars but\nHere you know your Democrats want a shelter for air quotes ...\nAnd by the way my math is wrong

Fox News Saudi Arabia conducting its own investigation into the disappearance of journal is Jim ... who went missing three weeks ago at this Downey consulate in Turkey\nBut the Saudis apparently are going to admit\nThat they killed ... and they get to claim that they said this interrogation team in to interrogate him and that during the interrogation something winter rye something went very very wrong and remember\nThe Saudi admission allegedly is coming after the the king the Saudi king told President Trump in a phone call we had nothing to do with his disappearance of his death nothing so now they heat allied to Trump\nOr less the claim is going to be well uh uh the the king didn't know or the king is just found out since\nSo is it can get a cold front back and say oh never mind I'm Sorry yeah we kill the big big mistake just they got out of hand it was just said you know it was a good fellows type interrogation things that just went ... went bad it's just that day they took I took a bad turn\nOh my God uh\nYou know the you know the the reports last week there was some there were some reports that they that they called in a like a forensic eye doctor\nWho saw him up a again last week we had her are unconfirmed reports that yeah he was murdered inside the the Saudi conflict in Turkey in Istanbul and that they actually caught him up and removed him in pieces\nAnd they use the bones saw\nTo take them apart which meant that is that is gross that is disgusting\nSo one of the consequences biggest a President Trump said if they killed Jamal ... he said this on sixty minutes he said this on numerous occasions the last couple of days that if if they killed ... that ah there's going to be a heavy price to pay\nYou know the sun and the Saudis they came out like tough guys the Saudis over the weekend and you know this morning ...\nThey were rolling out essentially threats [noise] that hey if you pursue is if you're if you claim that we killed ... ah that we're gonna we're gonna a Jack up oil prices\nSo the Saudis have essentially they they threatened before now what what apparently is the mission which is coming and I can't wait to see how they actually handle this\nUh you know 'cause also President Trump and said that they were road killers potentially if Trump suggested that there might have been real killers responsible for what ever happened to ... the Washington Post columnist missing since October second\nYeah as as President Trump left the White House\nAll the way to tour of the devastated floor and a half panhandle parts are today\nAnd uh uh he did land obviously earlier today and at Eglin air force base for his uh aerial view which focuses on believe in fact I'm going to try to get a hold of some folks in the panhandle uh later this hour to get an update but President Trump on the way the Florida Panhandle today I said\nThat he had spoken to the king and the king firmly denied any knowledge\nHe says he doesn't want to get into king sol moms mine but says it sounded to me like maybe these could've been role killers\nSo is that they're going to more fed into the the rogue killers are these Saudi intel interrogators that ... that killed to show the inside the embassy is it it was an interrogation allegedly gone wrong\nIt was so wrong that I take them apart on a bone saw\nAnd a ... member humid and carrying them out in the end result spaces\nOh All right so I I Wonder what the administration what Trump is going to say uh and\nHow the Saudis are going to admit this how are they how and you know ... when does he has pump pale left yet or you know my palm pales going over so\nI you know is I mean ... I Believe is he's got to be a ... I thought\nThe president said he was on the way soon so I Would imagine ... en route to Saudi Arabia\nWanna mess that the Saudis they had no clue that this thing was going to explode like this that this was going to be an international incident mad that they miscalculated is now the question is do they plan on killing them or did something really go bad during the interrogation\n[noise] I'm guessing they gotta painted on one of the interrogators and there's going to be a scapegoat in someone's going to take the fall\nOr even if and I don't think it's out of the questions that they plan to take them out and make 'em disappear anyway thinking this would be just under the radar and nobody would do and not an international stories when it comes down to\nAn eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine also I think wants to play here is the Saudis are coming clean because\nThe Turkish must have some audio and video prove as they said last week\nAnd the whole claim and I'm not I don't have an apple watch uh I don't have an iPhone and Android guy bought last week\nYou know I was saying man you know it sounds like that the Saudis have the the conflict bug that they had audio and video a inside the consulate to capture this or that some videos taken and somebody leaked it whether\nThey have a spot and so on on the inside and then it came out oh no he transmitted his death by his apple watch and then the story came out that that's technically impossible\nThat you might be able to control your cell phone from your apple watch but you can't take video with the watch and then transmit that order or being that to the class so that that doesn't add up from a technological standpoint from what I understand\nI ain't hunger and James is an apple not my uh and James my a technical engineer a James as an apple watch analyze phone and he says he says I Am correct because apparently his phone his iPhone was left with his fiance outside of the conflict\n[noise] so uh\nYeah I and I think I think my first guess last week was wow you know what this means that the Turkish have bugs the Saudi conflict and and I I I don't think they want to admit it but that was my first\nGuess that was my first inkling last week when I talked about this and then the apple watch thing came out and apparently the technologically that whole story is falling apart by where an eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine oh now the wall Street Journal folks breaking news the wall Street Journal is now reporting the same thing is CNN\nSo the wall Street Journal I was reporting apparently that are independent reporting aside from CNN Wall Street journal is saying that yeah the Saudis they kill to show he uh and interrogation Don bad inside the constantly\nWow there's a thing as a\nGlee you don't want this is beyond ugly this is fun ...

Nation set in a statement released Monday\nSovereign tribal nations that their own legal requirements for citizenship and well DNA tests can be used to determine lineage such as paternity to an individual is not evidence of tribal affiliations and I I went over\nSome of the the tribal details or earlier in the program and how the different Native American tribes have different a threshold for actual percentages and some are just a a lineage\nOr they added using a DNA test to lay claim to any connection to the Cherokee Nation or any travel nation even vaguely is inappropriate and wrong

living in San Francisco when he became a San Francisco and he's written that city\nListen I you have a great Republican candidates out there John Cox he's a great businessman his his problem is simple math\nSort of like New York city although it's happened in New York City this even happened in New Jersey Chris Christie Christie Todd Whitman um and and then all the other occasions Tom Kaine is

care\nFor everybody in the world it's a ... you're basically our governor saying illegal or legal doesn't matter resident non or as it doesn't matter we're going to give you free health care\nNow if the average California is that is taxed at Thirteen and a half percent statewide on income if you're OK with that good luck to you because it is unsustainable it will bankrupt your state there's my prediction\nBut if people want to experiment with is that you know what ... what am I I'm not there to tell people\nCan't really have any and can't get on the way the thinking gotta get out of California you can't afford to pay taxes on this [noise]\nYeah I mean it's unbelievable look and why do you think there's a mass migration out of New York and New Jersey and Illinois to states like

governor Bredesen and Tennessee have Heidi Heitkamp was already down by double digits Joe Donnelly is in big trouble\nUh we now see Heller was very important state of Nevada he's now a by seven in the latest poll only state I'm really worried about right now is Florida and Rick Scott just has done an amazing job for the people of Florida\nWell yeah and and the hurricane obviously that that was devastating but but the response and that's to hurricanes I remember that that have hit there in the last year where we're Scott has really shown if you remember Shawn the two thousand twelve election\nRight here in Jersey a that for Hurricane Sandy hit and then President Obama had the advantage of\nActing like a commander in chief and going to the devastation while Mitt Romney has basically left helpless and they say that that hurricane may have tipped the scales back to Obama because member Romney at all the momentum in the world are going into that storm so yeah look a Jim Messina who was speaking of President Obama two thousand twelve he was the campaign manager\nA for Mr Obama at that time\nAnd he said yesterday I said why did Senator Warren have to do her announcement with her DNA\nNow he goes why can't Democrats ever stay focused and I think this all is with Warren\nRevelation or lack there of will only hurt the party further because I don't see how you could ever say many media outlets by the way Shawn said that this was definitive proof right I'll give you literally the the headlines\nThat feeling around her and she's Ninety six percent European I mean that that one one thousand twenty fourth she has perhaps maybe Native American ancestry of some type I mean but it is but her she literally personally change ourselves\nTo minority status when you pan and then at Harvard that she was billed as the first minority female professor there of Native American heritage that the Cherokee Nation has spoken out and said this is just outrageous they're out there outrage by it\nDry and that was a turning point right when they when they came out and said this is wrong this is inappropriate\nThis is a mockery then where are you going to say is attacking was with Warren is it still conservatives or does it actually Cherokee Nation but I mean that that the headlines yesterday\nAssociated Press Warren DNA shows I have Native American heritage a CNN Elizabeth Warren releases DNA tests with strong evidence of Native American ancestry ABC News Elizabeth Warren relieve reveals\nProof of Native American ancestry again what proof this so backfired on her ... particularly when ... nation got involved and and all the mockery that that ensued from there this is going to follow her I Know people think that she is a front runner\nBut the fact that she lied about our heritage to advance her career I could see the signs are already at Trump rallies and twenty twenty with one one thousand twenty fourth just written and that's it\nBecause now this defines her and this is not something you shake very easily and suddenly she's kind of morphed into Hillary Clinton where you can't really trust what she says and then on top of that she has no real economic message at outside of you didn't do that so\nYeah very interesting to see who the Democrats settle on right away and and twenty twenty because I think the left wing of the party is taking over and that's not the way you be President Trump\nOne of the things that I've been pointing out I don't know if you had a chance to look at the center for American Progress and it was a group formed by none other than John Podesta but they're\nRunning their reelection now ... very revealing the Maxine Waters says they keep telling me not to say it I keep saying I'm not a lot but I'm going to keep saying it anyway meaning impeach forty five\nSo they're hiding their agenda we learn that in this project ... with Claire McCaskill in her own words also\nBut now we know that they're being told directly not to talk about their immigration at all you know a sanctuary attacks pack up punch says the four page memorandum [laughter] I'm like yeah OK and anyway the New York times were obtained a copy of it and Democrats in strategist they're prepared the memos said\nThe Democrat you spend as little time as possible ever talking about immigration itself pivot\nTo a more fruitful issues like health care and taxation it's very difficult to win on immigration so nobody's talking about what they really are going to do their part Democrats too when they have to pretty much lie misrepresent\nCon be quiet about what it is they want to do how they govern\nAnd and the types of agenda items they really have that's not an enviable position to be I mean ... all the criticism Donald Trump takes he's pretty authentic he made promises and he keeps them\nThat's the thing I mean when you look at the record right everybody focuses on the rhetoric of the president too much right you look at the results and it's a completely different ballgame any president would kill to have a GDP above four percent unemployment below\nFour percent right there's something like seven point six million job openings that was that was reported by CNBC today I think in the country that's incredible we have Ninety eight percent of the ISIS caliphate\nEvaporated in Iraq and Syria when North Korea is no longer lobbing missiles over Japan threatening Guam and the United states these are all very substantial victories the trade deal he just did with Canada and Mexico I'm not sure leading here I'm Talking about the\nPillars of the presidency in terms of accomplishments Trump is winning right now he won with capital as well even the CNN did a\nSegment last week John Avalon where he says the president is on a winning streak and the polls are showing it he's back around forty four percent forty five percent among registered voters member that\n... was the most accurate and twenty sixteen has them at fifty one\nRight fifty one percent everything is trending upwards at the wrong time for Democrats when you go into this election because to your point they have no message like they had no message and twenty sixteen I don't know what Hillary Clinton's platform was outside of that guy is bad but for me so I can be the first woman president and I I Would say the same about Mitt Romney two thousand twelve I I think that\nI Can't remember what his platform was but I remember Joe Biden had bin Laden is dead and GM is alive hey that's easy to remember and it's a it was good enough right who was it will make America\nGreat again or keep America great again the Trump can run on his record and Democrats just go with personal attacks like they have a it it's going to be a long long election you know you're going to hear about how Trump some trouble like you did in two thousand sixteen but\nAgain a in till they have a message in ... Michigan Pennsylvania Wisconsin to win over those voters that see jobs coming back and companies coming back unless they put up a centrist fiery centrist candidate that can have a lot of problems on\nThe one poll that shocks me the most the latest one out of Wisconsin had Scott Walker who I think that a phenomenal job in the state of Wisconsin and now he's always had notoriously close elections he's always had all of these groups and millions and millions of dollars pouring in from outside of Wisconsin that he's had to deal with\nNot sure if the polls accurate but it has him down and that surprises me but I think especially when you look at the Senate I I could see the Republicans again with three weeks away I don't have a crystal ball\nI always tell everybody play like you're behind and you're losing and you got you got to make up ground and anything can happen between now and election day in Twenty one days but\nYou know I don't see Heidi Heitkamp making a recovery I think a Christian seminar is falling apart in Arizona I see a surge of just the right time for Dean Heller in Nevada which will help him\nUm I I look at the other races Donnelly now is beginning to fall back in Indiana Marsha Blackburn is emerging in Tennessee thank goodness Claire McCaskill I Believe this tape is absolutely going to help to feed her eye if the people in Missouri if this is widely disseminated 'cause it's outrageous\nAnd the only Democrat that might be safe at this point seems to be\nJoe mansion in the Senate yeah\nAnd and the Senate in order to win that back you had to go through this narrow paths if you're a Democrat through Arizona red state taxes red state Tennessee read stand\nBeside the way up I'm going to he's up by eight in the latest poll I'm actually going to be down during a town hall within this weekend around the Houston area I'll I'll give up that announcement later in the week\nOh there you go yeah and and remember better\nAnd he goes against the grain and thank you for a great job thanks so much quick break right back your calls on the other side of big candidates and I tell you about that and the minute including pastor Brunson\nIs going to

grandma's remains in cookies that were brought the school was that yes\nThere was a four of us the Asia Pacific Davis, California\nAnd the story is that a a student\nPossibly lead\nEast sugar cookies with the ashes of his grandma gave me about the classmates hey would you like some delicious sugar cookies but they possibly could have been much shit on grandma\nThis is according to CBS in Sacramento CBS local affiliate and a number of students ate the cookies at da Vinci high school and the story is in police are investigating and they suspect that the sugar cookies contained\nThe ashes of one of the students grandparents\n[noise] wow [noise] yeah I mean ... brownies cookies et cetera yeah ah all the marijuana edibles that are for sale these days and these recreationally legal marijuana states\n[noise] so the cops say they weren't sugar cookies sort of brought 'em in having them out to at least nine students\nThey uh\nDavis police lieutenant Paul Dora shop says this is the first they've never had anything like this he said this is a weird one I've not heard anyone getting sick\nOr anyone being harmed as far as physically but psychologically what I can be a whole different story folks so they weren't able to confirm that to high school students were part of this this plan this devious I mean this set go I mean really morbid plan\nTo have their fellow students eat the ashes of grandma\nSo there's a full blown investigation at this point [noise] the Davis join a union school district issued a statement saying that it couldn't comment on confidential student matters but there is an ongoing investigation\nA man can you imagine\nAnd I guess uh some students that tip offs are led to this investigation or how gross would that be you know they they mix in some uh grandma's ashes into the sugar cookies that's gross and what I say yes let's move on\nWater I say yesterday about this Elizabeth Warren thing I mean right\nOut of the gate I said this was a gigantic mistake what else did I point out from yesterday's show I pointed out that that for instance CNN CNN was going Gaga\nOh finally profiling civil war and the senator proves that she's got Indian blood that she is part Indian and it was just over the top even though the Boston Globe even though the globe\nAnd pointed out in their article that it couldn't be six to eight and a six to ten rather I don't want to short shrift then it could be six ten generations down the line which\nWould make the percentage of Indian DNA or blood in Elizabeth Warren it would make it tiny it would make it miniscule in fact and I pointed out on yesterday's program that the Boston Globe had to correct their math\nTwice yesterday not once I'm Sorry three times the ana correct their math or I think it was three times when only tell you why\nBecause and I have little correction notes because with the possibility of Senator Warren having Indian blood going back between six and ten generations in Tempe generation\nThat would've made her\nPercentage one one thousand twenty fourth one slash one thousand twenty four\nOriginally the Boston Globe had that at one five hundred twelve so they they had a double if they were wrong\nSo then they had at the six generational points the Boston Globe had senator Warren's Indian percentage at ... thirty second turns I guess what that\nAlso was wrong and\nThat update that to one sixty fourth so listen anywhere you slice it it's just a joke here and I pointed out yesterday a couple of things the CNN website they had a big screaming headlight or a headline\nIn headlights a big screaming headline that a Senator Warren uh shows that the Indian heritage\nAnd you know you had to get to the story to find out you know with the it was in the small print proverbial up in the proverbial small print that uh it was a six and had it was way remove way down the line and that was\nThat was sort of buried in the CNN story so on TV they were going to get any on their website they were all guinea well guess what now we have\nA Chris Cillizza the CNN editor at large and he does a lighter writing on their website a sill is also appears on a lot of the the CNN programs so he writes a piece\nTwenty four hours later a lizard Warren might eventually made things worse with her DNA gambling draw\nI haven't really uh you think\nI mean I we pointed this out immediately and many\nWhich are intellectually honest you know in my line of work on there is on the conservative commentary side and it wasn't just that actually some mainstream media also poop poop is that while she was making a big deal out of this you know the the video\nThe five minute and I think thirty seven second video that this campaign style little on many or a bio pic little documentary that she pulled out it was deceptive you know one of the terms that are my my wife loves to use she's an attorney she was a prosecutor for a bit until we\nHad kids and my wife always ah even with me or the kids if you don't give the whole story\nOr my wife wants to use the terminology this seat by own mission\nAnd you know I'll queuing up I'll play and after the break I'll play the audio but it was totally deceitful Emily Elizabeth Warren video when she has the DNA specialist is Dr bustamante Carlos Bustamante\nI consulted twenty three and me and an ancestry dot com and this guy has some good shops good bona fides but guess what\nWhen they show the scene all the big reveal so to speak\nLike some kind of TV reality show the big reveal the clip she's on the phone sitting down at a table in our house and he's in his office oh and I and he says that Oh yes you do have a Indian ancestry what they did point out was the fact that it could be back as far as ten\nGenerations\nMaking a tiny little Biddy fraction they eliminated that you know I'm gonna kill that up here and just a second because I I think it's very important for you to hear that to solidify the point I'm trying to make fun\nAgain we were all over this yesterday was she thinking she is she should've just stayed quiet she's made matters worse Democrats are saying well why the hell did you do this this close to the midterms and guess what this was not a slam dunk\nThis is not even up above base hit this is not even getting hit by a pitch\nThis I mean this was all full and as a total backfire an\nAbsolute complete backfire in fact earlier today CNN headline that all is with Warren a DNA than they did it backfire yes it did oh CNN glad you can join us twenty four hours later
