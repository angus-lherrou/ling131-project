[noise] I'm Liz well let's discuss\nThe president with two tweets this morning one and six fifty for this morning and then another tweet at nine fifty seven this morning\nAnd as long regarding a New York times report when Trump phones friends the Chinese and the Russians listen and learn and this was a a new article written by Matthew Rosenberg and Maggie Haberman over\nAt the New York times\nSo I'll give it to some of the nuts and bolts of this in just a moment first though the president tweeting and responding to this the first one this so called experts on Trump over at the New York times wrote a long and boring article on my cell phone usage that is so incorrect\nDo not have time of year to correct it I only use government phones and have only one seldom used governments cell phone\n\nStory is so\nWrong S. oh oh oh oh it looks like a all over the ... story is so wrong and that was before seven o'clock then just before ten o'clock this morning the president tweeted\nThe New York times has a new fake story\nThat now the Russians in Chinese in parentheses glad they finally out of China\nClosed parentheses are listening to all of my calls on cell phones except that I rarely use a cell phone and what I Do it's government authorized I like hard line just more made up fake news\nSo that's the president responding to what\nWell to this\nAnd essentially the or the cliff notes version here are the claim is Maggie Haberman from the New York times climbing the Trump has been repeatedly told and warned that the Chinese and the Russians are listening\nWhen he is on his cell phone\nAnd Chinese spies Russian Spies you know we've heard about\nThese weird a cell phone tower or emulate nations that are occurring in Washington\nOr the shark device and the shark too I think it is now\nAnd it's essentially the ability to in a vehicle or wherever you are to have the cell phone tower replicate or where cell phones think that they're connecting to a tower but they're actually connecting to a private device which intelligence agency\nA could operate they they're not cheap they cost several hundred thousand dollars these devices and then you could intercept the data the texts intercept the voice ah transmissions\nAnd well if you're a foreign government or foreign intelligence agency well could be a treasure trove and it's been a lot of concern that with members of Congress and senators and house of representatives members and and cabinet members all over D.C there have been that these reports are that there have been\nMysterious a essentially cell phone emulate is will replicate is that had been discovered in an urban around in their mobile they can come and go and disappear again I don't think we've heard everything I don't know if anything has been intercepted if they're in\nIn any confiscation or arrests or you know whether anything he's been kept secret but the technology is out there\nIn order to intercept and according to the New York times piece a speaking of Trump he's been warned repeatedly that the Chinese and the Russians are listening when he is on a cell phone\nWhether it is a personal iPhone\nOr are they continue using until last year and has held onto primarily because it has phone numbers lifted it\nBetty couldn't store in the new one\nOr whether it's the government won all they can do is strip it down as much as possible a government phone those are not secure or you can still listen to him he was warned that this was a problem and then he is often ignored the warnings\nIt came out of Kathy Griffin holding Trump severed head so I looked at the page and it's sad Republicans are Nazis vote early blue wave common let slip Florida\nThis this is says ours they are a Twitter pays you say\nFacebook Facebook page and then

a bunch of people like that too he's he follows people that the ... on his Twitter page the people listed as those he follows are a bunch of radical leftists\nHey look as I say I don't even want to I

here\nBut I I Do not have any doubts about things I think are totally possible here\n\nAnd just going to have to stick with me here in trust my my instincts on on being patient is going to be all kinds of time next week or whatever when this stuff continues to break and [noise]\nWhatever all happens um I I I appreciate the call and I know what you're saying a Susan over half of America gets more in a welfare than it pays in tax I should save this for next week you realize these this is the congressional budget office numbers more than half\nOf Americans receive more in some kind of government transfer\nPayment Medicare Medicaid food stamp Social Security then they pay in federal taxes more than half [noise] one thing that this explains why so many people don't think tax cuts are a big deal\nIf your life\nIs dependent on all kinds of government transfer payments welfare whatever you want to call it and tax cuts you think are going to lead to the government having less money than you're not going to be in favor of tax cuts so we've got half over half of America gets more and welfare than they pay in taxes\nThey're going to understand here that tax cuts and I remember all the news stories about how the Republican tax cut bill didn't end up being that big a boon for the Republicans\nIn polling that that's a major shift just since the Nineteen eighties there was a huge win win for Republicans back in the eighties and I think it still is to a certain extent but not as big Frank in uh in New Baltimore Welcome sir you're Nextel up\nA rash thanks for taking my call you bet\nJust real short here I think Mr ... dupe number one number two the fan was this set up period I think if there's anybody\nWhat do you mean or do what do you mean to do\nThat he was shut up by other people and or a ... there's other people that are helping to do all send all those things across the country which would be my last point\nIs that if there's anybody that thinks that man could have been initiated and follow through with all those mail bombs across the country on his own I think are delusional and\nThat that that ban was just just a a a shut up just to a so CNN and MSL s D could ah swallow it and they did hook line and sinker\nSo when you say when you said do do you mean that the Democrats or somebody found this guy and are sending him up and he doesn't have any idea what just happened to him or that he hasn't been can convince to play along and be a part of it which do you mean\n[noise] a little bit of both um we'll find out in the future I'm sure that\n... that

electric some type of electrical connection device director re described it here's a little bit of what he had to say\n\nIn that effort and getting those devices to our laugh from around the

known as energetic material which is essentially potential explosives in material they give off sheet an energy through a reaction to heat shock for friction [noise]\nSo we're still analyzing the devices in our laboratory these are not hoax devices [noise]\nI Want to focus for a moment on the amazing work of our folks at the guy left [noise]\nBased on their initial analysis they uncovered

also a possibility in a connection between samples collected\nPieces of two different\nHigh eighties mailed in separate envelopes sample previously\nCollected from say Iraq in connection with an earlier arrest down in Florida [noise]\nThis is phenomenal work with the greatest pressure on during incredibly tight timeframe we see unbelievable work like this on TV and all he would but to see it up close and reality is something to behold [noise] and we are so proud of our team at the lab\nFor their work and keeping people safe helping us to find the individual responsible [noise]\nLate last night we also turns to our partners in the Florida department of law enforcement for confirmation\nOf this DNA connection that we want to thank them in particular for they're very quick work [noise] I also want to thank the men and women of the FBI's counterterrorism division who remain on high alert\nEvery to try to keep the American people safe\nAnd move quickly and efficiently into action

million Americans\nTo turn the podium over the commissioner O'Neill from Iraq\nTo re are confirming that they believe they have the main suspect they're worried that there might still be some that have been recently mailed there on the lookout for that but it looks like they have DNA evidence now that ties to this one guy\nAnd uh they have analyzed it confirmed it and you know these guys are amazing what they do every day\nYou know the sad thing about all of this ... you know I Want to remind you\nBecause you know I've lived through some of this myself at all explain that in a minute but\nYou don't remember when Bernie Sanders it one of his supporters shot Steve ... shut up all these Republicans at a ball field a nearly killed Steve Scully so the fact is he's a walking miracle and I know because I knew what was what he was really going through the time was far worse than was reported\nAnd people wanted to blame Bernie Sanders says you can't blame Bernie Sanders for what one does listen\nNow I Am I'm not going to do what the left does here\nBernie Sanders is not responsible for what one of his stupid supporters have to say but his most Bernie Sanders supporters are not violent and not out there trying to kill Republicans and Bernie said he was sick and by the entire\nYou know anti GOP massacre here All right and I believe him\nAnd I said that\nAnd just like I said in the years gone by remember when the one guy broke into the White House\nWhen Obama was president and is it do they came up a number of times I have a number of tape saying that we've got to protect our politicians I'm no fan of Obama's policies but protecting our elected president is is job one for all of us as Americans is our elected leader whether you like it or not and he was when I said\nMr Speaker you're gonna have strong feelings about this we've now learned that this guy that broke into the White House not only did he get in the door but he knocked down the secret service agent went into the three different rooms or the White House and pass the stairs that would have gone right up to the the residents of of the Obamas\nThat is extraordinarily chilling to me huh yeah I mean ... you're talking about protecting the president of the United states of America and it's just there's no room for error\nYou've got to protect our president that that represents the free world\nSo they've got a very difficult job they've got to almost be perfect and any time any incident happens ah lately has become a pretty high profile and if we're not protecting our president we're not protecting our leaders we've got a big problem the rest of the world is watching this\nSo I said that many many times you know and I say this only because um\nThere's this idiot on fake news CNN his name I ... what's his name John Adams lawn somebody who's taken cheap shots of me a number of times over the years\nAnd I want to play for you what he said because he basically links the bombs sent to De Niro to me let's just played that part ... ... ... ... basically blaming me\nListen to this ... had and he said had a direct\n... may have we don't we don't know who it is we don't know the motive but what was fascinating is you see a direct patterns between the president's attacks on Twitter and and the stage and being echoed an amplified by Fox News and other folks in the conservative judge here which is not like the others right why Robert De Niro\nWell one of things I found was that October Fifteen Sean Hannity was doing a whole segment blessings in Europe for things he said on the Alec Baldwin show of all things and what she said that Trump allies will regret it because they made a deal with the devil so that all of a sudden becomes ... or the Robert De Niro I was calling the president devil an a devil worshippers in effect you know\nI'm used to play the victim card but at the top of mind ten days ago and the dishes and they say what is that when we find out who this is um because some of these figures are are more prominent on the on the campaign has been ...\nMe because the Niro got one of these packages well let's listen to the Niro and the things that I've been critical of De Niro about let's listen to what maybe I was talking about\nI mean he's so blatantly [noise] stupid he's a punk\nHis dog he's a big he's a con artist a mutt who doesn't know what he's talking about doesn't do his homework doesn't care they seized gaming society doesn't pay his taxes he's an idiot Colin Powell said it best he's a national disaster he's an embarrassment to this country\nIt makes me so angry that this country has gotten to this point that this fool this pose though has wound up where he has talked how he wants to punch people in the face well\nI'd like to punch him in the face today the world is suffering from the real Donald\nTrump [noise]\nThey've gone deep into the conspiracy theory of Trump Russia collusion with no evidence but ignore such collusion when we do have evidence as relates to Hillary\nThey fall into the all the Kavanaugh standard but only because he's a Republican or appointed by Republican but they're in love with the

yet on John Avalon or whatever his name is over at fake news CNN well didn't heroes not like the others why Robert De Niro about what I found is Sean Hannity was do we just\nHeard deniro and what the narrow was saying about the president our president De Niro saying that he wants to punch the president in the face that they do any research over there you know over and fake news CNN any at all\nYou see a pattern between the president's attacks on Twitter in and stage being echoed an amplified by Fox News why Robert De Niro Sean Hannity October fifteenth that old segment blasting deniro\nOh so that's why he got a package from this lunatic bomber because he must have heard Sean Hannity playing the narrows own words calling the president of punk a dog a pig a con a BS artist a mutt and saying that he wants to punch him out\nKnow the guy don't hold Al Gore responsible for the Unabomber because he had earth and the balancing has that little ... that he built out in the wilderness or the shooter as Steve squeezed blaming Bernie Sanders\nTo suggest any way that honest a vigorous debate and criticism\nIs the motivating force behind one fringe violent individual let me tell you what that is that is intellectual laziness and cheap attempt frankly to capitalize off a dangerous and serious incident\nIn light of the fact while others on TV have been utterly silent their silence has been deafening\nI haven't been the one saying something horrible is going to happen it needs to stop\nYou know do you face CNN sucks or CNN is fake news that is not a cry or an ad vacation of violence in any way shape or form it's a feeling people have when they see a ... abusive link bias news coverage\nIf you're American with us sold a shit transcend politics\nI deplore all violence of any kind but legitimate fair criticism of me that's fair game media criticism is fair game\nCalling out networks that have political agendas that's fair game one network spend every second minute an hour of the day hating on Donald Trump Donald Trump cured cancer they still hate him well I'm allowed to call that out that's not hate if there's any hate their it's their hatred of the president that they can't seem to get over\nYou know the bottom line is you're watching people trying to ... an attempt to exploit and politicize the actions of one unhinged lunatic and conflated with fair and wanted criticism\nAnd that for them as they're putting politics above all else and that's wrong for the country\nAnd anybody that has intimidated into stopping what they do because of this predictable attack I put it all up on Hannity dot com\nIt's called the less new low Hannity slams the media's total failure to report liberal calls for violence yeah\nWe've got it all chronicled with all we we put the tape and everything you need to one place\nAnd we're going to tweet that we're going to send that out to everybody weren't loving days away from election day and there's a lot at stake\nRight now Republicans you know what they're behind I think in Florida that means Rick Scott's behind that means the Santa says behind there's a lot at stake in Florida goes to Gillum in terms of governing the state of Florida it will be a disaster that was my prediction\nIt doesn't help that many have been displaced in the panhandle a very conservative part of Florida and I hope those people are able to get back and unable to vote before the election but I can tell you Marsha Blackburn can and should win in Tennessee if everybody goes out and vote\nAnd I think the Missouri can be flipped easily now that we know that Claire McCaskill just like the British sent in Tennessee has been lying through our teeth about who she really is she's talking about you know crazy Democrats\n... votes left on everything so I guess she's counting herself in that group\nI Know Dean Heller can win in Nevada and I certainly believe Martha ... he can beat the radical extremist Christian seminar cinema I think Jon Tester can be beaten to although he was a little bit up in the polls right now in Montana\nHeidi Heitkamp should lose in North Dakota Joe Donnelly if people don't split the ticket and vote libertarian he would lose easily to Braun in Indiana that would be another pick up\nThat was for far as the four hundred and thirty five members of Congress\nYou know we're going to go over some of the important racist believe it or not there in states like California Dana Rohrabacher\nYou know people like Darrell ISIS old seat you know a Duncan Hunter seat is in jeopardy gotta get him back in

are scary odds because of policy takes over the house you know she's going to have open borders you know she's going to want to raise taxes you know she don't want to kill jobs she'll put back in regulations and guess what they're going to try to impeach the president so\nYou've really got just over a week\nTo try to stop pull a few of the Democrats from winning and the Republicans really need to have a laser focus on that and run are very very hard contrast campaign and the worst thing is right now in Ninety percent there's a story I think Ninety percent of the congressional districts that are competitive\nThe Democrats are raising the Republicans and it's not by little amounts it's by big amounts so you have a congressional race where the Democrats are spending a other Republican two million to one million in Virginia ten were Barbara concepts running for reelection people were saying all your polls were wrong because you have a point that had\nAll the Democrats last friday put in for a million dollars in the last two weeks versus are two million between the Republican or groups in the center of town I mean Congress on contract so the Democrats are playing for keeps and the Republicans need to have that\nLooks like the Democrats have just seeded the Senate than in other words they're putting all their money into the house races just to get the one chamber absolutely so let's say that that what you're saying is true if the Democrats flows he becomes speaker and the Republicans hold on to the Senate and they pick up seats in the Senate so that would sort of be a split decision by I guess any measure right\nJust split decision except that the Democrats will have a focused they will control the house think of the committees that are going to change\nTo think of think of the intelligence committee incentive Devin Nunes running it you'll have Adam Schiff gets what's gonna happen with the\nWith the with all these investigations et cetera guess what's going to happen when the Judiciary Committee and their their there'll be relentless investigations of President Trump that he won't get anything done in the last two years and you know that talk about they'll go they'll\nGo check his taxes they'll link all this stuff and\nHe'll drive economy down one of the things that that you know us pollsters we get calls\nBefore the elections from hedge fund guys for major Wall Street guys what are you seeing in the in the election well you want to know why the market's been going down the last month because they're seen that the Democrats could take the house and they know what that means the economy the economy will stall out\nWhat do you think Doug shown to you in the same marry you said is getting very tight also\nI think John's analysis is exactly right I think the Democrats I actually wouldn't might even be a little bit more cautious I see between twenty five thirty see I think that um\nAnd if they get twenty three seats that means they win the house\nThat that is correct time could jak thing\nThey are saying that Democrats could win by little as two seats\nYeah I Am saying that I sit on your air or the other night it would be two to four I'm In the same range I think John's analysis is very very rare\nAnd I think he is right to say that the Democrats are mobilized and focus on the um on the house the exclusion of the Senate but the amount of money that's being spent on really the thirty races I think Sean butter on your website cannot be underestimated and\nYou know mid term elections tend to be referenda on the president and the incumbent party and there's one little dirty secret\nIt's not so much from Trump that is at risk if the Republicans in the house and Senate much lower ratings than the president and it is that is the soft underbelly of the Republican Party\nAt the ... one of the weaknesses as it relates to also to the Republican House is there's so many retirements what are their forty by a separate retirements incumbents\nAnd name recognition for a lot of people and a lot of these races negligible zero it takes years to build up name recognition in a district John\nAbsolutely and by the way that that ... top thirty most important races that you put on your website those are critical ... sets of Republicans really need to win and and the dog is it is I mean granted the Democrats should be listening to him but fortunately for us they don't listen to him too much for one Democrat that does listen to them is former Mayor Bloomberg in New York City\nWas a big superPAC and it's putting the resources into electing Democrats in the house now that he's gone back to being a registered Democrat and the Democrats really dug understands it they they\nThey're very smart they really understand how to how to win races and had to take power and the Republicans need to wake up I mean those of us who are older I remembered delivering a survey that Haley Barbour helped pay for it Nineteen Ninety\nFour and September that had we had the generic Republicans up seven and that was to house leadership and there was a soon to be Speaker Gingrich with Bob Michael I was presenting the numbers to him saying you're going to be the next speaker and\nWe just need to not compromise on Clinton care well Haley Barbour\nBorrowed ten million dollars to help when more seats and win that election the Republicans are raising record some say the orange she has out raised a has out raise the uh Democrats their National Committee two to one of\nThe ... that money needs to find his way into the into these top thirty races that you've outlined where the Democrats are an spending has virtually two to one and all those races this week and you've got to be able to put money into those races where there's digital LEDs a\nTV ads even nationally and saying stop below sea we've got to have an equal voice with the Democrats and uh uh\n... they've really they really are focused in on trying to take over the house and it's and it's their their shot at power\nWell fish out of power but remember you know those that have been saying the investigations into the deep state in I don't believe that's true because we have Senate committees that are just as capable of doing that as well and similarly if the Republicans were able to build their majority in the Senate any legislation that Nancy Pelosi and company wants to pass\nThat is going to be against what the Republicans want in the Senate is never going to get through it'll die there and we'll have divided government but I think you're most right and the fact that it's going to be\nBasically two more years like we've had and that is endless you know ridiculous absurd obscene investigations show trials by Adam Schiff Maxine Waters Gerald Gerald Nadler and company and\nIn other words the progress will will slow down dramatically now there is also the hope that Republicans in the lame duck session could actually get in there and pass the funding for the border wall and maybe repeal and replace Obamacare in the meantime\nLuck I think Sean that if that is John and I think folks are suggesting that more likely than not the Democrats when the house what we are looking at with almost great certainty is ... come critic block or two years\nI'd make is slightly different on a book on the way to work before I'm a Democrat I Know John is certainly knew Shaun I just hope we stop demonizing ... doing what Maxine Waters that saying\nTrump's responsible for ... for a set of uh uh sending that ten or twelve arms around or vice versa blame the Democrats can we focus on our national or it our borders and our future\nUp to five years and then when the financing celebrate\nIt actually is the host or helping out the Rhode Island

confirmed as they when they said they had powder I'm assuming that was some type of gun powder\nOr some type of explosive powder and it had shrapnel in it like a lot of charging a glass and you know we've got to get to know a little bit more about this guy short of the van that had a CNN sucks picture on it in a picture of Donald Trump it doesn't mean a thing and\nYou know by the way I remember when I when Bernie Sanders when one of his supporters shot up that baseball field I said at the time boy if this I'm not blaming Bernie nobody should blame Bernie Sanders he's not responsible for what one does and I said but boy if it was some supporter of Trump or any Republican oh they'd blame everybody\nWe know what I mean I'm not going to do what the left does here\nBernie Sanders is not responsible for what one of his stupid supporters have to say but his most Bernie Sanders supporters are not violent and not out there trying to kill Republicans and Bernie said he was sick and by the entire\nYou know anti GOP massacre here and I believe him\nWell it's a different tack then you hear from the media today right\nRight and you know what what concerns me and thank you for correcting me about the update on the um that bomb threat what concerned about is\nAs he mentioned the van with all this stickers okay perhaps that if somebody is on the far right\nBut I'm noticing what I'm hearing is the the stick to the jury as far as how they were placed how they with no you know issue with the ... south but the other thing I thought about was William Clyde ... who\nThreaten people with rice

guess what they robbed\nAnd doing all season long postseason long they're committed to this approach it\nOr you know I said going into the series um the only one it's it's almost obnoxious the amount of over managing that it's taking place\nIn this series on the part of both uh managers they Robert ... score with the fact that you know one will do something a pitch and change the other will respond with a pinch hitter and it it's it's it's overkill a little bit but\nIt's been made clear it's the way the series is going to go with how it's gone so far it's worked out for Boston at this point hopefully didn't used to\nAs we mentioned no da ... so that means JD Martinez if he's going to be in line to be asked to play the field is playing out again the ankle the honestly think we're going to see ...\nWell I Would have a I Know we've talked about this I Would have liked to I think the rest of approach that really puts the\nBest possible lineup out there for the red Sox and yeah you sacrifice maybe a little bit offensively but not a ton um you know ... is capable guy grew up playing second base but\nIt doesn't sound like we're going to answer your question Allan score spoke yesterday on the team arriving here in LA and was uh basically\nI I said in game three anyway that's not going to start at second base whether you will at any point or play there at any point during the series remains to be seen in court has been a bit unpredictable but as far as game one\nYou know the big question you alluded to it it really isn't ... Martinez is he going to play because\nHe wrote the ankle in game one we remember what he flipped on second base back when the conditions were so great at Fenway play through it and play well in game two college afterwards but it was so bothering them a little bit and then yesterday course that we'll see as far as whether\nHe will place so if he does clearly is right field book that goes over the
