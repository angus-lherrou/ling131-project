this for a long time now that I thought things were very a contentious and split during the Obama administration and the fact that that was a very divisive presidency you know this presidency has outpaced Obama I didn't think that can be done\nBut it has been done and it's a shame to see what's happening in the fracture and be the separation and the gap the giant Gulf that's growing among ideologies and then the various factions for instance\nYou know I I think what Trump is doing for this country the economy I think is phenomenal ah rearranging the awful NAFTA deal and getting agreements with Mexico and Canada we still have congressional hurdles but still I mean it's it's just a hundred percent strong there's so much\nThat this president is doing on a positive front\nThat

as a story develop yesterday testing positive for rice and and there's times where things have tested positive for rice and and it was confirmed that it was actually\nRice in or a deliberate derivative of the the castor bean but there have been times where there have been false positives and tested initially positive for rice and and then it tested negative I here's what we stand so far so the suspect\nIs a former navy sailor\nAnd that's what the government officials believe that it's a former navy sailor behind these multiple letters containing this suspicious substance which was sent to a well I'm a multitude or you've got Senator Ted Kennedy or is it Ted Kennedy [laughter]\nSenator Senator Ted Cruz or one of his officers in Texas as well as one addressed to the White House and most recently we had these two that were going to the Pentagon\nAnd of course a gym manage the defense secretary and then a a a top but maybe official so investigators say the one of the ... sent to the Pentagon\nActually had a return address leading back to this former navy sailor\nWho they have not publicly identified who the individual is\nMultiple letters which were mailed to the defense secretary James Mattis and this is a high ranking a naval operations officer of the chief of naval operations pretty high up ah his name John Richardson\nThat they initially tested positive for rice another White House\nAlso got a suspicious ... which was addressed to the president\nThat was intercepted by the secret service you know with the Pentagon and with the White House the male is not delivered directly to those buildings there are offsite facilities in order to scan mail\nFor any type of toxic substance radiation et cetera chemical biological and that's what they do well off site I mean you have individuals that are wearing a hazmat suits\nVeterans special rooms that go through mail\nTo to the sensitive destinations to make sure that something like this does not achieve the goal of reaching the individual or the building\nSo a White House temp that led officials to discover the oval office which were sent to the Pentagon because the white there was a it was at the White House mail facility and far off site where this initially\nI was the tip off and then of course that help with the Pentagon and the Pentagon [noise] a force protection agency than detected the suspicious substance during the screening at the remote facility that's according to the D O D the envelopes to still be analyzed by the FBI or\nYou had two people take the hospital after they were exposed to a suspicion a piece of mail center cruises Houston campaign headquarters and that piece of mail contain some kind of white powdery substance which is also being tested so that's what we

what do you think about the political divide in the country right now [noise] I have said my observation on this program on many occasions has been I don't think I've seen is this band [noise]\nIt was incredible divisive is during the Obama administration [noise] and I thought things were pretty rough at times in the fracture this split\nIn this country [noise] but I have seen it to grow exponentially [noise] ...\nThe divide in this country is unbelievably great and I I feel that at times were pulling ourselves the part that things have gotten so vitriolic\nGreater than anything we've anticipated in the past and a lot of it is just a pure hatred for Trump there is a lack of proper analysis and credit given for a lot of the good things that the Trump policies have done\nAnd it doesn't matter what's on the positive side he doesn't get enough media credit and also he doesn't get enough credit for those that can't look past the fact that they hate the guy's guts\nTo at least acknowledge that hey you know what this is working out pretty well economically you know getting countries to quit hosing over the United states as we've been screwed over for years\nOn the train front that is a lot of things are positive\nOr from his administration but listen I'm not a I'm not blinded by anything I Am on nobody's payroll and I've also made it very clear and I've been very vocal that the president says dumb things um on occasion\nA that he should act more presidential is I don't want to get into a a whole litany of my pros and cons we we do it regularly on the program because I'm honest it's called intellectually honest reason why I'm bringing this up\nIs there's research out which was conducted by Zachary Neal he's an associate professor of psychology and global urban studies at Michigan State university\nAnd\nHe is they say according to study finds dot org among the first to measure polarization not only by examining the frequency of parties working together but also by demonstrating how they've grown more distant than any other time in modern history\nAs a talk show host as someone that just observes from phone call her as the emails to tweets and just watching and following and processing just the general discourse\nI've made the statement and I don't have a doctorate degree of done no formal research but I don't think it takes a rocket surgeon to figure this out uh one he says\nIs that neither side is to blame for the growing rift regardless of the party that holds the majority in Congress or controls the White House the political divide has widened all the same what I found is the polarization has been steadily getting worse since the early Nineteen seventies\nHe explains this in a university released today we've hit the ceiling on polarization\nAt these levels that will be difficult to make any progress on social or economic policies\nSo he examined for the study the legislative networks of every US Senator representative between Seventy three and twenty six team\nAlso he reviewed bills presented before Congress during the period specifically looking for a bipartisan legislation that was co sponsored by members of both parties he founded won't polarization was still strong in the Nineteen seventies it continues to worsen particularly since the early Nineteen eighties\nAnd he says at this point it is the worst than it's ever been [noise] anybody want to\nAgree or disagree on that [noise]\nI think we're we're in some rough times and the sides have grown even further apart\nIt just doesn't appear to be any bipartisanship any longer on Capitol Hill [noise]\nHer twelve minutes he dropped his parents and said that really that's not a problem for Deborah cats\nAre defending Al Franken anyway we'll see in the political fallout of all of this now is Kavanaugh's now the president's approval rating is an all time high a fifty percent today and the president laying out the facts in this particular case we've got an election in thirty three days\nAnd every poll is now showing that the Senate races in the enthusiasm gap is heightened dramatically and significantly which is the right thing why because\nI think the American people learning a lot that this is the Democratic party playbook\nIs a party that doesn't believe in due process or presumption of innocence there's a party that regularly smears Flanders\nUses character assassination character blood ... all in the process to gain their own power is not one agenda item that you can cite any Democrat that they're running on in thirty three days that's going to make the country a better place\nThey don't seem to care at all at what they've done with judge Kavanaugh or when you look at the evidence and you look at the facts as the FBI did now they're attacking the FBI what do you find out is that there is zero corroboration to the claims of all three women and I'm not even including the\nCases of outright lying that were dismissed early on about judge Kavanaugh\nThey just dismiss it altogether but none of this would ever make it into any court of law and there might actually end up being significant legal consequences to Julie sweat Nick and some other people based on what Alan Dershowitz and others saying should happen\nBecause of the things that they said the backtracking that took place and perhaps even lying\nUnder the threat of a felony anyway news roundup information overload our Jonathan Gillum author or sheep no more than the L McLaughlin is with us um I don't know if this was going to impact the election and thirty three days but I think it certainly has energized\nEvery every part of the Republican coalition that recognizes this for the grave injustice that it's banned in the smear campaign that has been Jonathan\nKorea you know I think this has definitely caused um some good reactions and conservatives across this nation I'm also a free thinking or people who used to subscribe to the Democrats\nAre the Democrats' way of thinking are are now saying this is this isn't really oh ticks this is\nA kind of criminal behavior the way a wad of his stuff is playing out in ...\nIn DC right now or whether it be the dark thing that we've seen 'em or whether it be just the sheer way that the FBI has been used and\nI think what's happening is it's solidify and people that they don't want to play this game and people are starting to get on the same bandwagon I Do think it's going to have a huge outcome and the election I think that people are going to say they're tired of this nonsense it's on the west\nUm they may not agree with everything on the right but I think it's going to cause a backlash\nAre you going to defend Europe ... liberal democratic socialist party Danielle\nThat trying to get a show on on the could opt in any everybody excited to be here I I honestly I Want to tell you that there's going to be at stake backlash on the left as well you know um they are concerned about\nAh the nominee either a consensus from basic I wasn't\nDown cave but others say anyway hurdle we've heard all the allegations\nYou know that professor Ford's so called eye witness was contradicted her\nTestimony and her accusation\nWe know in the case of ... Ramirez the New York times wouldn't even public publish it because they discovered nobody that corroborate her story number one\nNumber two or own words that she was a neighbor ended quickly had gaps in her memory and the fact that we now know that you know so many different things that we didn't know before and that this ... was actually out there soliciting information from her fellow yo classmates the New York times reported that because she quote couldn't remember\nThen in the case of Julie sweat Nick we saw her backtrack dramatically from her original story and her claim that judge Kavanaugh was a serial\nDrug gr and rapist of teenage girls will give me the evidence in cooperation to any of these women story that's what I Want from your Danielle and don't duck and don't dodging don't hem and haw that I'm asking a tough question give me any cooperation you have\nI don't hit the cooperation because I'm not do and I and I come from wind ... and just getting this right and we talked about this last week wait a minute what everybody's talking wanted was a full and\nFair investigation getting married at twenty cooperating witnesses to the I think not asking the FBI added\nNo excuse me every\nMain person that was mentioned in the case of professor Ford and the case of miss for me or as the New York times tried to corroborated they spent an entire week interviewed dozens of people and then she herself was calling around to other yell classmate saying I don't I don't remember do you remember I'm not sure if it was him that exposed himself\nAnd then we all watched Julie sweat Nick all third shift\nAnd backtrack from her original allegation which was gang raping and systematic drugging of women so could you have any crop rotation for any of these incidents at all\nI'm not getting any education that I don't expect that you ... and I did\nBut I Know you're following you can't find any cooperation either can you as a matter of fact we're getting just the opposite occur operation people are saying those they don't recall those stories at all that it or that happened that way at all\nThe charges are college roommate in the ... the last twenty four hours at camp out at the judges trend can't honestly I I think this is horrendous for shy and the idea\nOf not answering my question I'm asking you if the people make serious claims allegations on a serious real topic\nBecause there are real evil horrible ... predators in this world and they mentioned that there are specific people have you interview them that they're going to tell you my story is true and it turns out to be the opposite don't you believe in the presumption of innocence Danielle McLaughlin yes or no\nOf course I Do show they found something\nOf course I Believe in the ... and the and the presumption of innocence I Believe that the FBI should've been allowed to do a full and fair and ... and that is why you're going to say I'm not a huge ... and I understand that this is energizing the geology hey\nI'm not talking one what was on a second I Want you interview\nLooking in the case of professor Ford before people she identified were at the party and none of the four have any recollection of the event and the one eye witness says it didn't happen\nWhat else are they supposed to do is we don't know where it happened we don't know when it happened we don't know the location she doesn't know how she got there I got home from their what else did the FBI to do they had already given sworn statements under the penalty of a felony\nAnd all they did is reiterate those statements to the FBI what else could they possibly do Danielle in that case\nAnd being on the opposite side of it ... at the FBI just\nDoes not else can they certainly do knowing the facts as we know that we don't know where we don't know when I don't know huh\nOK okay ... thanks the fact that she doesn't run into wearing out where and when exactly it's not ...\nDon't you know you're you're trying to trying to change it look follow the bounds of the ...\nIf there's four people that were eyewitnesses but we don't know where we don't know when we don't know how she got there we don't know how she got home we don't even know the house but she mentioned four people were there they for people under penalty of felony all said that didn't happen the way she said one\nWitness or didn't happen and my

saying that they are satisfied that the comprehensive investigation of the FBI Lisa Murkowski saying the hasn't had time to read it Democrats in an uproar angry upset lashing out at the FBI\nWhat were they supposed to do except to interview the people that was supposed to corroborate the stories of this\nThat's what they did they got what they wanted and it never ever going to be enough All right back to our phones as we pay high priced Brandon is in Colorado Brandon Hi how are you glad you called and welcome to the Sean Hannity show\nHey thanks Sean I grew up in spent most of my life in Arizona where my family's still it\nAnd I'm I'm actually a distant relative of Jeff Flake and I do think he is a decent man and I think he has a a good heart but I really feel like he's getting played here by the Democrats and the left and I just really really hope that uh but he'll make the right decision tomorrow or Saturday challenge\nSounds like after his comments today that that's more likely but uh it just you know I I Know there's a reason he's not running for reelection and it's just hard to see a secret people leave to Washington and come back a few years later and not be able to really recognize that I felt like that happened with McCain and I feel like it's kind of happening with just as well\nI think the most shocking statement that he made was on sixty minutes when he when he actually admitted\nWhen asked if he would be voting this way if he had to face the voters he hadn't solo not [laughter] I'm like oh so you're you're only stand on your principles when\nWhen you have to face the voters but that's not how you really feel it really sums up how I view a lot of politicians you know I\nI just look at a guy that can't doesn't know is old mind at times and doesn't right\nNow is the\nSame guy that wanted to be on the survivor show and you know ... you don't look at him and uh you'll find this funny Sean but we were actually related or I think it's our three or four generations back our great great something grandfather he was actually the founder of snowflake Arizona which I thought you would really love\nTo know somebody told me that yesterday I'm practically\nThere is a snowflake Arizona senator Snowe for like\nUm I Hope it goes the right thing\nIf any Republican senator now especially Murkowski Collins flake after they they got what they wanted they got their delight they got the FBI weighing in\nA Joe Biden said it would not going to offer recommendations\nAnd they're not going to offer opinions here and all they're going to do is give you a straight data and that's what was given and everybody seems pleased by that his comments Susan Collins comments seemed to satisfy that no core operation of any of these claims as we've been claiming\nAnd as we've been telling you and so the allegations have been problematic from the start it you know assuming assuming for a second here judge Kavanaugh where to get confirmed we we have got to have a deep analysis\nIn this country over where we want to go forward in terms of going forward because if we allow this to happen to good people it it it is so it's so dark I'm having a conversation with a friend of mine is religious\nAnd we were discussing you know look at the ten commandments why is one of the ten commandments\nNow shall not bear falls witness against the neighbor because it's\nDevastating for the rest of Brett Kavanaugh's life people know that this is what he's been accused of and yet in spite of the fact there's been no corroboration shifting stories and\nA media hysteria that's ... that's why\nTo the extent that people can literally destroy other people within your window falls uncorroborated claims a shocking to me they did it to Robert Bork they did it to Clarence Thomas they've been doing it to Brett Kavanaugh they do it to Republicans conservatives every two and four years they're racist or sexist\nThey want grandma to die all these things that they've come out as a matter of of course because that's their play book I don't know I um I I some house at some point we may need to examine libel laws at some point we may need to say\nFor the years that you put in to develop the steam adore you have right now we just talked to a hill and uh uh he is off to a great start as well as that defense is secondary but talk about as a a little bit of what it means to you 'cause he was here at the beginning as well\nOh thanks they've you know we're just my comment are very grateful to be associated with your eye you know it's been it's been a dream come true and are just are homeless are taking this is where we're going to be at a [noise] you know and like you said it's\nBeen with us since day one and uh\nIt's been a it's been a I Can't even imagine the things he's been through two to surge shoulder surgeries and still stuck it out and then uh you know he went out after the Harvard game last year I don't remember if that was game to game three and\nHe brings such a a calming influenced our secondary because he does really understand ... as well as I Do the things that we need coverage and now when you're on the sideline and making adjustments during ... and stuff he's handling that than I and and and it said in his his his worth to the defense is is some explainable\nAnd then we talked about the veteran status so you have back there at the DPJ spots you've got some guys that have been around with you for a while so guys that I'm sure at this point you can depend\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd here we are the delay the nearly weeks later we have the conclusion of the FBI investigation\nWe have the report now being viewed that listen if if I'm going to criticize something here and I think this is fair to criticize one element here is the fact that only one copy has been available for the senators to see both Republicans\nAnd Democrats and what has happened is a little bit of a log jam in the senators that want to go view this in this skiff this a sensitive information room or in a in in the Senate building\n[noise] it's uh\nI I Want to suggest have multiple copies inside the skiff\nSo there's one copy and there are some ... complains that the time slots to view have filled up and\nUh you know some of the center is might not even get to see it until tomorrow afternoon or whatever the story is I I think that I Would have provided multiple copies to get this and again not to leave the skiff and to have a full accountability for all of the pages\nSo nothing is take it as phony civil one of the senators were to steal information take it out or I mean I\nKnow it'd be so Loni is if I'm not mistaken so that would be one criticism should have been multiple copies to get this thing uh in the hands or in the eyes in the hands but you can't take it with you are in this a secret facility\nThe sensitive facility uh that's one thing I Would suggest ah oh this I thought this was a very and I brought up the voice of Dr Ford and I\nRelate to you on this program that I was pretty shocked that when Dr Ford\nShowed up one week ago today it was one week ago today\nThe doctor for came around to say uh that she testified in the capital of course was testifying right about now\nUh because we talk a lot of the testimony a lotta the questioning live here on the show so that was one week ago and then of course the FBI investigation which began a the supplemental investigation began a but we can go tomorrow on on friday so I got\nAn interesting email today and we've talked to my doctor Ford's voice that I was I was kind of shocked and I not only the sort of the baby is sounding voice that she had going on but also the vocal fry which I commented on immediately that ...\nDay and I want to know that that's called vocal fry that's the the sound

I mean we got complaints from that you know sweat Nick ... who give me a break a and then complaints also from the nearest as attorneys which I'm sure we'll get into later on uh I I mean [noise] I mean what what else the walk there's nothing there\nYou know and I think the most significant\nOf today's\nRevelations I think among the most significant is what came out from Susan Collins and you know Susan Collins a made a statement regarding after she saw the FBI report\nAnd then Jeff Flake so what the common say what the flight say and with what they have said after they view the FBI supplemental here\nSeems that they're going to be yes votes and if they're yes votes that means that Kavanaugh is going to be confirmed but\nWe live in some strange times folks are so I I don't count on anything these days but it looks like the boats are going to be there for the final vote on Saturday hold on we'll get into that I'll tell you exactly what ... said a\nColumn stunt rather I'll tell you exactly what columns I'll tell you one Murkowski said as well so I'll tell you what Collins said I'll tell you what ... and those those are very important Collins and like and then Murkowski\nA you know she's also she's also talking a little bit and we also know that one of the Democrats could have been a yes is now going to be a no a mansion still up in the hold on to those thoughts a lot of ground to cover\n...
