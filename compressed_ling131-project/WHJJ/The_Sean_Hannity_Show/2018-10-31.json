proved not to be true right and so they want to double down on health care Medicare for all sounds great but what does that do with the the deficit and debt and rationing health care it's risky for seniors because they should be the priority when there's Medicare and so there's a lot of scare tactics out there Sean\nAnd what I'm hearing on the ground is we have to keep the prosperity going the economy going the way it is we have two point five percent unemployment rate in Iowa shock\nAnd correcting the record with these lies and it's textbook cookie cutter messages\nFrom Nancy Pelosi across the country and that is scaring seniors regarding Social Security Medicare nobody's acted to cut that and then lying about their ... they're not being any protections for those with preexisting conditions and we asked those protections for layers of it in our Republican health care bill\nWild but listen lying is just a part of it the playbook of the Democrats is always the same I even think it's gotten worse in a look at this this horrible terrorist attack in the shooting took place in the Pittsburgh synagogue and\nWhat does the media but they're blaming Donald Trump port and meanwhile the the guy responsible for the shooting hated Trump in large part because of his strong support\nAnd we have an opportunity to vet them and make sure that they are coming for the right reasons they

eleven and every other bizarre thing she said about the people of Arizona which he calls the meth lab of democracy and the people are crazy\nI'm so I'm just hoping it happens that way and then on the outside you got tester on the bubble even I'm Joe Manchin on a bubble in West Virginia and Bob Menendez on a bubble\nYou know it's interesting I was looking at the different levels yeah Menendez on of Harry on state where the Democrats should be safe because his personal\nOr gals or when the Senate Ethics committee on a bipartisan unanimous majority find him guilty of a whole range of things and some very very unsavory rumors were built around all of that now so he said he's now in such bad shape\nMilk adding to pour millions of dollars that they'd like to go somewhere else but my point to get back in the New Jersey here's where you can really really good candidates\nWho is a great there see I'm very pharmaceutical company understands healthcare can help develop and sound practical working alternative to government run health care [noise] and um she may well\nBetween his only bringing people out to vote and the campaign convincing Democrats than there are so sick of\nMenendez and they just stay home\nThat may actually saved three or four house seats in in New Jersey that's the kind of dynamic where I frankly I Can't figure out of my own head when you go from state to state to state\nOr how these things that are involving right now 'cause they're they're very alive and ... it's very much in the air and there are I think people now know very rushed in West should assume\nThat this was over they can stay home and then they run out one voted\nTo end up not having voted by election day you're not doing anything else that day to vote who said that serious\nLet me let me ask you this because let's go with real clear politics and they have to wonder written for the number of house seats that they think are safe for the Democrats and about one Ninety nine for the Republicans\nOr where the with the Republicans have in the majority all of those toss ups put them on defense than you did have forty five retirements for the Republicans that's a big number in any election year\nUm the house is what I'm most worried about and you know the thought of Nancy Pelosi being speaker elect and then speaker of the house once again is a pretty frightening thought um\nWhere do you see the house going\nWhy not functionally ah I I my personal range is returning the bottom of about two oh one between policy where speaker and hiring them around to twenty to thirty which would mean that Kevin McCarthy I think would end up is speaking [noise] um\nAnd I can't I've been in all honesty is you know I've always been standard about these things I Can't give you a more accurate number I Can't say to you\nYeah I Can't either when I really can't I mean and I think now and and look the conventional wisdom is Republicans will hold the Senate pick up seats there and let them see below sea what when the house\nUm that's not a great case scenario but that would be sort of like a split decision by the American people also say one other thing is\nYou know some House Republicans have earned the wrath of their voters but it's really not about them it's about stopping an agenda that we know is going to be about impeachment endless investigation raising taxes they want their crumbs back\nA sanctuary cities open borders eliminating ice and keeping Obamacare\nCan anyone who does not bode hands actively voted for Nancy Pelosi the speaker no one should kids themselves if you want to have Nancy Pelosi\nAnd hard to have to house and people are like congresswoman waters in charge of the financial services committee which is you have just seen the phrase\nIt

Cuomo ends his show and then throws it to Don Lemon they do a little back\nAnd forth banter I guess I I don't watch call though I don't watch Donald Lebanon in fact uh I don't watch a lot of the the nighttime a fair I'm you know I'm having dinner with the family and we're watching some entertainment stuff you know I've been doing this all day long\nSo okay so thank you [laughter]\nSuicidal peanut gallery comment if I say it all the peanut allergies these days diamond said peanut gallery where's that offensive by going to get my wrists slapped paved now is the peanut free zone right so ah and I understand yes it's deadly for some and that you know the whole allergen thing really just kinda\nAccelerated rapidly over the last what ten Fifteen Years or so anyway back to Don Lemon and Chris called also almost toss it gets a lemon and this is what Don Lemon actually said on CNN this was Monday Night I'm\nSo we have to stop demonizing people and realize the biggest terror threat in this country is white\nMost of them radicalized for up to the right and we have to start doing something about them there is no travel ban on them\n[laughter] ... it's just kind of a real biggest terrorist ... what about most on the right what what about the maniac the shot up the baseball practice in northern Virginia where Steve ... was almost killed and we'll walk with a limp\nAnd a need for assistance with devices I Would imagine for a long time if not the rest of his life I mean really\nIt was a unless the he was a liberal targeting Republicans\nWas I'm not going to go down the list here and please Don Lemon that was an offensive\nIgnorant Rahm is comment that you made and I'm Wondering if he's going to address it or if he has addressed that uh to correct it said don't be stupid statement I I Want to get into another serious matter and you know the discourse in this country\n[noise] and I just want to tease those cars to get into this a little bit you know just following stuff but the discourse in this country is getting horrifically toxic\nI mean I Know I mean we get a lot of it here on the program you know some of the phone calls we get hey guess what folks I got a death threat today that's right I I got a death threat today\nSo I get a call from a management at our flagship station this morning someone called in and I'm gonna share this I was debating whether I was going to share this or not but but I but I Am going to share this morning at my local flagship station\nA call comes in during the morning show and some creepy sounding color says or something to the fact tonight\nTodd Schmidt is going to die\n\nAnd the the guy hung up and of course authorities were contacted in management\nAt our flagship in Tampa you know called authorities or talk to the the Tampa police department and you know their work around the case and we have you know engineering methods in and phone line tracing capability so a lesson\nI I was debating whether I was given mentioned it but I think it's important to mention because of the toxicity\nThat is occurring on so many levels whether it's talk radio whether it's television on on all sides I mean you've got Don Lemon calling white men the biggest terrorist threat in the United states\nThe what is happening here folks is a slow motion or medium motion unraveling\nOf American society and I don't want to watch this I don't want to witness this the environment is getting extremely toxic it has been for some time it's not getting better\nIt's getting worse you know what I'm ... I'm going to put the Halloween stuff on hold on to get to it later this hour well let me morph into this I was just going to tease it but you know I'm a stay with us for a second\nAnd one of the elements\nThat I read about a in a piece from wired I I like why is it a lot of tech website time I've got a book marked I visited I see links\nLike the website there's a story out today and wired\nThat talks about the the corrosive nasty environment which I've known about because I'm In the middle of receiving all of this information and all of this data\nAnd I have social media with active individual is we have phone lines we have email I Do a radio show where fielding we're feeling a lot of calls from a lot of normal people ... it's called the most of the people to call the program and the direct are normal Americans don't want the best for this country\nBut we do get our share of fringe wackos on both sides\nAnd it's these individuals that are being um you know ramped up there being rally by a lot of this information and the bonds that are helping to\nPropagate a lot of this false information and we know the Russians and the Chinese they are trying to take us down from within\nYou know these days folks it's not all about armies and pointing intercontinental ballistic missiles with with multiple mega tunnel warheads and that can destroy cities in white but millions of people instantaneously low\nIt's not the conventional warfare which still we need to protect against then there's a good chance that's going to happen at some point in the future conventional and hopefully not nuclear but you know conventional wars obviously still happen but what is happening behind the scenes is\nHas dangerous on on certain levels and that is trying to destroy us instead of attacking us\nHead on with a armament and proves there's an attack that's happening in this country\nOn an information level\nAnd the Russians the Chinese the box than you've heard about their sowing\nDiscord there's no doubt about it behind the scenes you know and it's not a single we know about the Russian but we know about the Facebook in the fake advertising and the fake accounts on Facebook Twitter and other social media site this isn't new we know about it but the then\nToo which is happening I don't think people really\nHave a grasp of and realize but countries like Russia and China they're trying to destroy us from within\nI think they're trying to create a civil war of sorts to shred and rip us apart and and tear the fabric of American unity\nAnd I'll tell you right now there is a level of success that's going on right now now there are some statistics regarding some of the bought activity that's driving some of this conversation\nAnd he had a my grade on to I'm a social media platform this gap which allowed essentially unfettered uncensored a nasty activity which is not tolerated by some of the mainstream sites although they kept police at all\nObviously so I've got this wired piece here and I've got a bunch of notes on the story and essentially it says you know social media has been absolutely steam rolled common dear to buy box and I'm Talking on Facebook on I'm Talking about Twitter here\nI'm again I'm not even talking about the extreme of sites that we've learned about the the gab site which is popular with white supremacist some anti Semite and a radical groups for instance a stream as racists\nThat Twitter Twitter has become a major major culprit here especially\nIn the handling of major news events [noise] go I'll give you an example on the caravan last week that the caravan the migrant caravan which is headed toward the United states dominated the national news on TV on radio in friends\nSocial media [noise]\nWhat do you actually know how much of an impact\nFor instance Twitter made with the propagation of that story hold on\nOh\nThis is a court ordered notice current and former foreign Lincoln and mercury

packed and so I get to try all the food that I'm going to be advertising a fairly shortly you know with a great Schmidt show offers so I'm\nGonna start cooking up stuff tonight it between trick or treaters a welcome back to ... eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine a nationwide number that's how you get on and so I'd love to know if you're a a big consumer of social media\nDo you have an understanding of how some of these ... most of them foreign driven\n[noise] or driving some of the vitriol and the conversation in this country I mean to me this is a stabbing again I've\nPrinted out this this why your a story that I saw it confirms what we've already pretty much no but I just don't know if people understand the depth and this was the number that's fascinating\nSo we have the president\nMaking the caravan of a big mid term election issue it was and I'm On the president's side with the caravan it's stress it's unacceptable that a group of thousands and thousands of people\nFrom a ... and whatever else was clinging on along the way a but mostly Hondurans it's unacceptable they think they can just get into a a big group of people a caravan is what it's called and decide to come into the United states were marching to the U.S or in some\nHe says the reports that they're being bussed that they're walking but then they're getting on buses and driven I I don't know to what extent that's occurring because you know there's still quite a way off I mean they're not going to be here for quite some time\nThe caravan the bulk of it apparently is still around a thousand miles away but the president has made this big mid term issue\nAnd listen I understand I mean it was the less they make their issues are election uh you know of a model tough cocktails as well they toss their their info bombs are as well as it happens on both sides of the aisle here but here's the issue\nThe discussion of the migrant caravans and the different opinions on the Caribbean and some are downright\nNasty a it turns out and this is what's astounding that last week sixty percent and this is the issue of social media\nLast week said and foreign interference sixty percent of the caravan conversation on Twitter was driven by bots sixty percent\nAnd I'm telling you right now that this is the kind of thing that the Russians have their hands all over it's finding these divisive wage issues to rip apart the fabric\nOf\nCamaraderie or a unity or you know what we believe in as Americans it's to drive this despite the steak and to to really separate us and social media is a platform to reach even deeper it's it's just another avenue\nAnd you have so many people they clean and are so into social media whether it is Facebook or Twitter or other social media sites that it's another tool that can be used to drive us apart and I'm telling you\nThey're trying to rip us apart from within and when I say they I'm I'm Talking about foreign governments like Russia and China there's no doubt about it you know even a few largely agree with the wave of the president is handling\nThe migrant caravans situation a fifty two hundred troops are sent to the border for support for instance\nUm\nYou still should be very concerned about the use of these bots which had been exposed a previously but I just don't know if people had an idea on the extent and of course the election interference and this is all part of that\nThat program of the Russians and the Chinese and the Chinese\nChinese or involving some really nefarious ban activity\nYou like being played you like being used\nAs a high percentage apparently is is occurring eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine and a nationwide number here on that will go to phones
