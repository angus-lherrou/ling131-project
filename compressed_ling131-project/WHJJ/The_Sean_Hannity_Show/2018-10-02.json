a friend of Doug whose mother\nWe're really beach this was Nineteen eighty two so I also find that interesting now while I'm younger than Kevin all by a year\n'cause I was I was born in sixty six he was born in sixty five I'm fifty two fifty three but again it's you know the ... with some of the allegations of parties and drinking and and and decisions that might not have been made a prop ...\nI can attest to the fact that this is my bad decision making so where in the van we've we've got to the soul funk we're moving into the the location where we need to transport\nAnd we're driving on Shore Drive in Virginia Beach and we are heading ah we're heading up I guess what are we were heading\nA trying to think of direction on Shore Drive it would've been east so we're heading east on Shore Drive toward the Atlantic ocean and we're coming over what is known as the lesson or bridge the luster bridge is over Lynn have an inland\nAnd as we crashed the less the bridge we then come down the bridge and then write one of the old Henry's seafood used to be there was a traffic light but they were merging some lanes over and then there are construction barriers there\nNever forget they were those numbers ... style horse barriers saw horse the ones that are you know fold out with the orange and white striped lines and then they had those little flash seeing\nA orange the lights with

eight of your barricades practice Nineteen eighty two I'd like to make amends it was pretty funny phone call but was it just goes back to the fact that I was sixteen I made a bad decision\nAnd I do agree that the male brain is not fully developed\nNow does that lead to sexual assault does that lead to a cabinet situation um you know in some cases maybe but if the history of Kavanaugh while he might have drank in high school and college it just uh the sexual assault it just doesn't fit\nAny remote possibility of disguise demeanor I'm Sorry you know even though there's all he was a sloppy

was a eight or ten year old boy now read this so again we can speculate or assume that a woman asked her\nEight or ten year old son about miss forward did did because they were watching this this you know Kevin\nHall or is this story roller where's the story coming from\nI got it on Facebook OK I learn the eight or ten years why what happened\n... anyway the the the young lady asks curse eight or ten year old\nSon and you know once again we can speculate we can assume but the the gist of it is is that\nThe lady Astor sun and\nThe son said to the lady you know his mother right now do you believe do you believe that that woman is telling the truth and he said no ma'am because she was telling the truth you wouldn't have to read the paper\nYou know but it in a setting like that you're testifying before the Senate Judiciary committee\nI you know Kavanaugh read off a paper in in in a statement that he had written\nI I don't that's not disqualify for me the fact that you're reading off a paper I think that when you are telling a story that you might be able to go from the paper to Ben from paper to memory and you know than running off the top of your head if you're trying to\nDiscuss and especially when when there were questions asked them you know those were not reading a answers per se\nBut to me a while I think that maybe something happen afford or it could be a repressed memory or an implanted there I don't know but something obviously is is worth insider and I still think it was Cavanaugh\nA that was involved here but to suggest that she's lying just because she was really a statement I don't think that that is necessarily the case I I just don't think it was Kevin ... roller thanks for the call ascribe Judy Judy is actually in St Louis Missouri

the Korean Peninsula is not being threatened\nJapan is not being threatened China's not being threatened he's dismantling now nuclear test sites getting along apparently famously what the president and his talking about denuclearization of the entire region\nAnd the everyone upset well the president is putting sanctions on Iran they're going to be mad at us I'm Sorry we're not bowing at the altar of radical Islamic mullahs in Iran that chant death to America death to Israel\nAnd that the sanctions now are resulting in a massive dramatic negative impact on the Iranian economy\nWhich may just a night and fuel a freedom revolution that perhaps would bring about change for the for the tyranny and oppression for the people of around one day and the same with China well president starting a trade war well we have a bad trade deal with China\nHow dare this president step up and tell our NATO allies to pay their fair share when we're paying Seventy cents of every dollar\nAnd Angela Merkel who's not paying her fair share in Germany is helping make provide a mere rich Gannon Russia rich again the hostile regime that that is in the hostile actor that he is\nBy giving billions of dollars to Russia for the life of the German economy and buying their energy from them why aren't they buying it from us\nBecause if they do it's it it weakens the one person the NATO alliance is supposed to be afraid of\nOr that the president is asking a European allies to step up with their unfair trade deals you know so now we've got an a brand new nobody thought it could happen if you don't demand and say okay we're not taking a one sided deal anymore\nOr the president now has gotten new deals with Mexico and Canada\nAnd we find out that it brings trade piece to North America just like we now have results nobody expected in North Korea and we now look at the deal and I was seeing the impact of the deal and to avoid tariffs Seventy five percent of car components have to be made right here in the U.S\nWell that's a pretty dramatic Fifteen Percent thirty percent of vehicles must be made by workers earning at least sixteen bucks an hour by twenty twenty forty percent by twenty twenty three Canada agreed to lift their barriers to our farmers\nWisconsin dairy farmers for infant formula skim milk powder milk protein concentrate they'd give us farmers access to\nAbout four percent of Canada sixteen billion dollar dairy market according to the dairy farmers of Canada us farmers also got more access to Canada's eggs and poultry markets or maybe it doesn't matter to you but it matters to those that are producing eggs and poultry\nThat had been shut out of Canada because we had an unfair deal us drug companies have ten years to sell their name brand products in Canada before they go generic well that's up two years that's billions of dollars in many cases\nThere is no increase protections on intellectual property there are no changes in US Steel and aluminum tariffs\nAnd the deal preserves a trade dispute settlement mechanism to Canada fought hard to maintain to protect their lumber industry and other sectors guess what a better deal better deals don't

book really an outstanding you\nAll right let me such get into this issue now I asked Lindsey Graham last night and I'll start with you David I said well what if you fall one vote short because now the the Democrats\nAnd the senator from Hawaii that once meant to shut up is now asking that they investigate and nice throwing incident from Nineteen eighty four and I'm thinking if this is what it now has come down to because the three big cases they want investigated\nIn every case there is no cooperation at all\nNone and and multiple changes in stories at least two of the three cases and yet this this goes on and this lander and the I mean I just described a story about what Julie sweat and they was claiming and now she has backtracked\nI don't even know why NBC whatever running interview like this but they did run it even saying that well she gave U.S foreign names to investigate one's dead and the other one has no idea who she is and the other two people never got back to us\nSo they can't corroborate any of this but they say they can and the lawyer keeps saying they can but she backed tracks on a story at what point does the man\nYou know how to Brett Kavanaugh to quote\nYou know infamously radon of one saying how do I get my good name back or famously saying you know how does this go office civil discourse in this country\n... ... ... okay you know I find it particularly appalling that some of these never Trump burst and\nAre these questions and then the entire democratic leftist apparatus had the audacity to make all these charges and slander and and destroy a Kavanaugh and his family\nAnd had the audacity to suggest that he shouldn't stand that independence out\nAnd that his doing so with passion indicates that he doesn't have the requisite judicial temperament this are on the United States Supreme court ... hair his righteous indignation his is to our a rant which was totally justifiable and necessary and back to\nPreserve his position right to they compare that to the twelve years on the bench when he had exemplary judicial temperament which is universally acclaimed I find their uh I find their analysis\nAbsurd on its face and shouldn't even be taken seriously this guy has grand you digital camera I Would hate to have that kind of\nInstrument guy I have always somebody suppose how was somebody supposed to act if they're accused of being a serial gang rapists who drug drug young girls as a matter of course on weekends in high school how I mean what is the proper response you supposed to go there and the guys I just didn't do that\nYeah ... ...\nWho were falsely accused to react exactly the way that Brett Kavanaugh did ah when you're a breach asleep wrong\nYou're angry and he expressed the appropriate to righteous indignation of an innocent man uh but the most important thing he said was I don't question that ah\nChristine Blasey Ford was it some time and at some place sexually assaulted it just wasn't me\nSo he's he's not calling her a liar or what he has a centrally doing is saying she is mistaken\nFor a variety of reasons she may have conflated to different uh individuals' or she may be projecting based on you know some\nUh for some reason that we don't understand a but this was a man who sounded like he was being falsely accused and to condemn him for being angry is to ignore human emotion\nAlmost ... gotten ... and contrast that with his\nResponse on the mark from a column interview and I was watching that very concerned I thought he was a flat out that he was very much to restrain and I said to myself and robotic if he doesn't quit\nHolding himself that nobody's gonna blade and then I'm telling you nobody would've believed him if he had done that same thing but he finally somebody a coach them and by ... somebody told him quit holding back or he called himself and he was masterful because no matter how many people said\nWhy she was ... she was initially label she was credible\nThey they believe that I can in multiples when he testified and he totally indicated itself it was a match or because I think it was thought that it\n... where does it go from here because um I have no I mean Jeff snowflake is Jeff snowflake who knows what he's running for president now and and headed up to Massachusetts New Hampshire I guess he thinks he's going to beat Donald Trump I I don't think this guy could get Fifteen votes at this point\nThen you have what Susan Collins we have no idea where she's coming down on this although she rightly said when Dianne Feinstein did is\nTo everybody in the process and then you've got Lisa Murkowski I mean she was a a no vote when she was needed on numerous occasions\nYou know I to me there's only one answer and the answers thirty five days from now and that's when the American people have an opportunity to add more senators from West Virginia from Indiana from North Dakota from Missouri from Florida\nI'm from Arizona Nevada and but until then you know I don't know what happens I have no faith\nThat anybody really gives a rip that this man's life as been bludgeoned this family has been bludgeoned then there's there's no corroborating evidence for any of it\nBut I think we have to wait to see what happens or in the FBI's report if the investigation finds no plausible evidence against Kavanaugh this will not only helped to restore his reputation and solidify the integrity of the United States Supreme court at large\nBut it will also give a valid reason\nSenators like Murkowski in Collins a and Jeff Flake and somebody like Joe mansion and and perhaps a couple of others are who are Democrats to vote in favor of Kavanaugh but I find it\nTo me or that we're holding Kavanaugh to an unfair\nA standard of his behavior in high school and college as a lead shift I doubt very many Democrats in the United States Senate could could meet\nThat standard in some of these allegations Julie sweat Nick are preposterous on their faces you point out she's now backtracking NBC issued a statement\nSaying that uh we can't confirm any of what she's saying and in fact she's deviated now from her sworn affidavit or in her most recent interview with NBC News so you know that a claim\nDo you think of the view which again this statement only come out a week prior and multiple mold I mean she backtrack dramatically on very key points\nAnd when you think of the seriousness of drugging girls in gang raping them and now she well he was near the punch bowl and well he wasn't lined up for the I saw him in the hall and nobody else\nI mean she was saying this was done as a matter of course on weekends at the time or we believe that no girl that was raped no boys that saw the drug gang of girls ever told the teacher a parent

recall a Julie sweating it another of the French she named is deceased we've reached out to the other two it hasn't turned back\nRight twenty five now so the top of the hour there's NBC News going forward with\nNothing after all this was was absolute ... how does this past spring news story\nWhen on top of everything they even admit there's massive inconsistencies from the statement she released just a week ago you would think she can stay consistent in a week and the people that she says what corroborate remember she's charging here that there was a ... a systemic\nParty culture where almost every weekend that women girls young girls were being drugged\nWith ... and and ... forced to be an ... and young boys would then lined up outside the rule waiting to gang rape\nWomen and girls and that just happened thirty six years ago and nobody ever ever ever told a parent told a teacher told law enforcement and she gets the names just like in the case of professor Ford of individuals that would quote\nCorroborate this story and it's not corroborated just the opposite while this guy is dead and on top of that then we've got oh this one doesn't even know who you are how does this\nHow do you where it is the news standard in any capacity here\nTo put this on the air Byron York is joining us he's been running as a lotta columns about there's not the least of which is how high the bar\nHas risen in the goalposts we've come a long way from oh it's going to be very limited in terms of the FBI investigation it's only going to be maximum a week and they'll get the job done and will move forward with a vote now you see that a Camille Harris she is now coming out with another allegation just today\nMyron hey Sean listen on this on his NBC thing I think everybody's got to be in two minds about it\nA war on on the basis of the lack of evidence and\nAh there's no way the story should ever had been reported publicly just shouldn't have bad but it was given in part a but due to the news networks um thing about Michael I have an anti her lawyer\nSo once it was all out there the fact that NBC has reported this is probably a good corrective or at least where you can see what I think what it was a parent to a lot of people are there was nothing to this story [noise]\nAnd when she offered a witnesses who could corroborate the stories you just played a one had no idea who she was\nOn the other was deceased and two hours didn't answer the phone so I'm the story is already out there and has already done the damage it is a good thing to knock it out\nAll right so let's go through all three cases that the the Democrats now want to expand the investigation they they never wanted a limited investigation they wanted to know floods investigation is now being the seventh\nFrom every indication at all I'm reading though that the FBI is moving expeditiously and it seems like they're very close to probably completing their work\nBut if we start with professor Ford professor Ford claimed that these four people were at the party nobody remembers any such party that she describes and the one person that was supposedly was an eye witness\nTo the alleged abuse in her case was mark judge and he said absolutely it didn't happen and then if you look at the ... if you look at the ... case this was in the New Yorker\nWell the New York times couldn't print the story and and they actually brought up the fact that after calling dozens and dozens of people to corroborate they discovered that missile Ramirez was calling former yell classmates and asking them if

I'm here or whatever you want to call her but she said it but she's not credible and that goes to abide by the expert opinion of a prosecutor as a specialist in this field prosecutor Mitchell says that this wouldn't even make the minimum requirements to get a warrant let alone presented in court\nWas an I don't really have anything I I I think this is such a serious topic I I literally of nothing\nAt all bad to say about professor Ford I don't like that Dianne Feinstein hooked up with a a radical left wing attorney who's known for going after the Paula Jones well it was only ten or twelve minutes um that's Bill Clinton\nThen attorney general of Arkansas exposing his pain is insane kiss it uh that ten or twelve minutes she says doesn't meet the definition of sexual harassment in the workplace so you got a political operative all arranged by the Democrats they perfectly the purposely hid this from the Republicans\nAnd as he has now been heard but it doesn't the story not\nCorroborated by the very people she said would corroborate the stories including ace they allege die witness to the alleged incident that's problematic for her at that point it becomes he said he said she said and there's no evidence\nUm and that's why the Senate should move forward at this point\nAll right we'll take a quick break we'll come back we'll continue Lindsey Graham who's been in the forefront of all this will join us next [noise]\n\nGood news you are not stuck with your health care plan really you have a choice and it's a great when it's called meta share and if you've heard about it and wondered what exactly it is it's a way that people share their health care bills\nAnd these are people who have a common face you want to be part of something beautiful and it's people who love to save money\nBig time Medicare members typically save\nFive hundred dollars a month per family on their health care costs that is a life change for people so this could be for you a way to pay health care bills to not only very smart financially but it's even profound Medicare is a nonprofit with four hundred thousand members nationwide or pray for and share with each other\nSo yes you're not stuck there is another way and it could save you a lot\nCall star star to six nine to receive a tax and be connected to them at a sheriff and find out how much you can save on your healthcare messaging data rates may apply cost star star to six nine that star star to ...\nFind can't stop drinking three drinks mounts scares me\nDon't have the money to see a counselor or a therapist about it right now might think about my ... much like honey and found them smart and for many ... when he drinks I don't even know friend of mine suggested I Try to non family credit for the government ...\nAnything ... their fees for nine nations are completely voluntary [noise] sorry I was afraid to go down on it like a fool to care about somebody who can can earn on how a lot [noise]\nYou never know how I feel like I'm not\nTotally out of control [noise] ...

Providence and I aren't radio station\nAnd Senator Graham of South Carolina joined us right now he's on the Senate Judiciary committee\nA senator good to talk to you thank you for joining us there's a lot going on Mitch McConnell just earlier said that the FBI report will be finished and we will have a boat on Capitol and uh I assume what's gonna happen at some point this week the way up any any timetable idea\n... I don't know yet but uh I think that's correct so here was the agreement with our colleagues\nAnd Chris Coons was never part of the agreement he's a Democrat from Delaware Chris but he was never part of this agreement what compromise has been reached for Chris Coons is voting no\nHe's asking for the investigation to continue our around whether or not he's been honest about it as drinking habits to Chris Coons is a non factor here Lisa Murkowski Susan Collins and Jeff Flake expressed a desire for the FBI\nTo talk to the witnesses around the Ford allegation and ... and the fall and incredibly any credible lead within a week\nI think the FBI is about finished everybody can look that report for themselves and safe is changed anything I Hope we don't move the goalpost Geoff oh did you sing committee with the understanding that he wanted to see what the FBI found about these accusations and hopefully get this done this week\nAll right let's talk about this agreement because it was supposed to be limited and the scope and now it is expanded out further we now\nSee the ... ah your your colleague on the Senate Judiciary committee the great senator from the state of Hawaii he wants men by the way to sit down and shut up\nWhich was pretty outrageous statement but anyway a senator Hirono now is saying she wants to nip FBI investigation into the quote I throwing report yeah\nYeah that's where we are so my dad owns a bar\nAnd so a throwing ice is like a good day in a bar so the bottom line is that solve a bunch of BS and she's not part of the agreement she voted and she's the one that said the goal was to take away\nA the hearing long enough to get into the mid term soon and I have a Democrat replace a Justice Kennedy in twenty twenty she said that not one media outlets fed ask her what did you mean but they're agreement I just outlined it was a the three witnesses that Dr Ford named mess for marriage as isn't there any\nA credible leads within that world of FBI will follow 'em and that's it and we're going to vote this week\nOkay let's talk a little bit about your on the program last night on on Hannity and I thought you dropped\nA huge bomb shell and I was asking you look I have no idea how Jeff Flake is going to end up voting in this I have no idea what Lisa Murkowski is going to do I have no idea what Susan Collins is going to do a there your colleagues maybe you up some more insight than I have but\nTo me they're the ones that met privately with Joe Manchin and they decided on this course now that it's an FBI investigation but we're going to be limited in scope is now expanded out into other allegations but\nIt'd be a fall one vote short you came up with a pretty\nInteresting and thoughtful idea that I kind of like\n[noise] well I think we've got the votes and then some but here's the question does the Republican Party abandon Brett Kavanaugh delay legitimize the\nWay he was treated at the Senate is it forty nine what I Would like to see happen is to appeal the verdict of the Senate and the November election and take it to some of the states and see if the people in those states agree with their senator about Brett Kavanaugh the swap\nWould abandon Kavanaugh the traditional way of doing business is if they fail one vote short just pull the plug\nHe's never quit I don't want to quit on him so I think Trump might be different I think Trump with say listen this man it's been abused I'm not given up on him less having an election to see if the vote in the Senate really represented the Trump states were Democrats a rain\nWell I mean this is the thing I mean we have people like Joe Donnelly he's a no he said already Claire McCaskill's know already as a matter of fact that most Democrats wouldn't know no matter who Donald Trump ... they've already against score six yeah All right so now what's gonna happen to Bill Nelson of Florida and Joe Manchin and\nHeidi Heitkamp and Joe Donnelly and\nWell I'm a smart question Martha\n... a great candidate for the Republicans in Arizona most served their country with honor and distinction I Hope she wins um we certainly could use a win out in Nevada or do you think this impacts the race and do you actually think you're going to get the votes and why do you think you'd get the votes\nWell number one I think we're going to get the votes because Jeff voted in committee yes I don't believe the FBI is going to find anything\nA relevant to this limited investigation that would show that\nThat are ... force planes are more credible and that there's anything new about Brett Kavanaugh in terms of the investigation I Would hope they would stay consistent with this vote I think the other two Collins and Murkowski or friends they're wanting to FBI to check the committee's homework I get that\nThat will be done here shortly but you're asking me a hypothetical\nI Can't imagine how we would explain to the Republican Party that we gave up on Brett Kavanaugh because for one vote short when a lot of the states that led to that vote being short Trump won I Do not believe North Dakota wants a Heidi Heitkamp to vote no\nI agree with you\nI Am so this is why you have an election appeal the verdict of the Senate if we have to to the people of of the country and November\nLet me ask you if you'd spoken to the red state Trump state Democrats that are up for reelection if you talk to any of\nThem doing it right now uh\nSo you mean you're you're communicating Hannah I'm not sure if they're all Hannity listeners and viewers are beyond that\nI doubt if they're lifting I think we're fine but here's the dilemma that you that this process has put us in this is about the teacher the judiciary\nThe states couldn't be higher this about the reputation of one of the finest man I Know it's about who would come forward after this debacle is about sending a tone and the standard that will destroy the ...\nAnd eat the Senate alive\nSo I Know President Trump pretty well\nThink we've got the votes and then some but I think he's a different kind of politician that he wouldn't let the system get off the hook that if we had to as a last resort where one vote short list they have ... we would take this issue to the ballot box in about thirty something days thirty five we\nCan I find that extra vote that way we would have a good nominee or have a light salvaged have a process uh fate and the people finally get to speak up here I think we're fine but you asked me a question and I thought about this yesterday\nAnd said if Brett Kavanaugh is on the ballot in some of the states I think it changes the election use in North Dakota there's a poll out today the number one issue in North Dakota is a Brett Kavanaugh's nomination is far ahead of anything else sixty to twenty eight people in North Dakota North Dakota support Brett Kavanaugh\nOh it's fascinating to me that the Democratic leadership is showing no support or comprehension or understanding\nOf what their colleagues from states that are not New York and California have to go through\nIn terms of reelection but the reality is that I Would even argue that if they do vote for Kavanaugh it's only an election year conversion and there were only doing it because if they don't the people in their state will throw him out but they'll probably go right back to to being a party line vote would Schumer at the end of the\nDay [laughter] well you know I'm I'm not a psychologist or political scientist\nI don't care is like you know I'm a bad this I don't care how you find Jesus as long as you do you know if you can figure out that Brett Kavanaugh was highly qualified and these accusations have crumbled\nAre good for you and now here's the point this has become the most despicable thing I've seen in Washington and as saying a lot it would change the face of the judiciary forever if we condone it so it's just not a complicated issue for me\nIf we follow vote short a less take this to the ballot box and see what happens\nLet me ask you about this whole process now we've gone through and and I do think the Republicans and you know I'm pretty honest broker I'm pretty critical of Republicans when they're wrong I Do think that they they have handled this with the seriousness the charge deserves\nA them ... [noise] yes no I think they handled properly because these are serious allegations but she identified in and look I won't go through the ... the entire\nWe don't need to we don't need to reach try this case I made I don't mind you've made up your mind there five accusations that have are are are not verified or just made up not true outrageous so it's not about Kevin ...\nThose are the

C. H.\nM. I. T. T. at Todd Schmidt with an M. S. C. H. M. I. T. T. and I'm the only one that touches his account no one else does it's me it's me only a tweet from earlier today seems to be getting a lot of response that I pulled out and that just a you know a small\nWell not really a correlation per se but just an observation\nThe allegation that Brett Kavanaugh through ice in a bar after a you'll be forty concert in Nineteen eighty five is clearly disqualifying absolutely\nSenator Ted Kennedy letting Mary Jo ... proud of Chappaquiddick and not so much no folks have chemistry work because you see the camera on ...\nSo that's a that's a solid we're dealing with water is a solid versus a with the Kennedy incident water as a liquid\nSo or you can say that that's a clearly on the big difference here I just think about that for a minute I I mean really you know Ted Kennedy I don't get me started on this phone calls in a minute or my beef with NBC News here\nAnd again there were some disclaimer is or there there was more to NBC's report on MSNBC this is Kate Snow Kate Snow national correspondent\nFor NBC News and she anchors one of the weekend shows I think the Sunday NBC nightly news ah from New York\nAnd she had to sit down with his Julie sweating ... who ah apparently the FBI if I could even mess with sweat ... yes [laughter] I mean each some Democrats have asked for the interview her but you know we know that the FBI is interviewed for we'll get to that and just a bit here but says sweating it has massive credibility problems now\nNBC News they play an excerpt of the interview during the NBC nightly news or a portion of what ran a longer interview on MSNBC the deal is though is that millions of more people will watch the NBC nightly news\nInterview and that pack in that clip on the NBC television network them a watch on MSNBC on cable\nSo while they might have asked some questions or had some disclaimer is on MSNBC they didn't do the same with the clip the theme ran\nOn the NBC nightly news last night first of all my question for NBC News is why the hell would you give is sweating at the time of day anyway\nYou have other mainstream outlets that I think that this woman is squarely she has a host of legal issues a restraining order from an ax she's been accused of defamation I mean she's had a bunch of legal issues\nApparently and a lot of other outlets are staying away from this uh this woman uh CNN they had a avid Audi on a\n... to discuss the issues that I if I have time I'll get into that but ah before I go to phones here from the NBC story you know she was backing away\nShe's she's she's not backing away from some of the claims she initially made\nWhen ... first came out with that big reveal of this new third individual accusing Brett Kavanaugh and she's she's backed off of some of these claims so NBC News Cape snow they said they couldn't be shore\nOr that they reported that that this sweating it couldn't be sure that Kavanaugh was one of the boys who assaulted during a party in the Nineteen eighties so that that's a back off [laughter]\nThat's that's a change in the story\nSo remember this this sworn affidavit that came out last week from this this Julie sweat Mick\nHey tired how's it going all's well\nI have a\nCouple of points I'd like to make about Christine Ford um my theory is that that for her this was like get rich quick schemes because\nShe likes to travel we know that she lied about her fear of flying and she likes to fly all over the world and go to on vacation and all this kind of stuff I'm\nLike one of the reasons I Believe that is because she was on the verge\nShaming Leo crying I'm through the entire testimony with her little mousy voice and\nShy or by the way I talked about the boys last week and the vocal fry and can the card dashing sandwich I I mean I think we were all shocked last week when we heard opener amounts go ahead sorry\nSo she did not have one tier string down her cheek through the entire testimony what five hours or something like that\nAnd ... and I\nThink she stands to make a heck of a lot of money and her or go funny is up you know over seven hundred thousand dollars\nYeah I stopped watching when I when I heard it was over seven hundred grand I stop loving listen there are some times where she did get emotional you're suggesting it's a money making screen scheme or maybe she wants to add a third front door to her house I don't know Steve thanks for the call Priscilla in gasoline South Carolina Priscilla one minute go it's all yours\n[noise] yes I Do I just want to say I think it's absolutely ridiculous the way these women are acting and they portray themselves and they don't they were not actually\nHurt and they were not physically something did not actually happened to him they make real victims not credible\nAnd he's just appalling how really liked that lasted almonds had the one did not actually really crying she did not have real tears you know he is every east and put in the world and I kept falling airplane yeah okay yeah right now last woman\nDuring that on MSN they the interview you know sweating a yeah she is smiling regarding to gang right\nYeah you know what I I didn't ... I don't find a credible I didn't find a credible with the NBC interview thanks for the call back\nIn\nThe following is not an actor but a real life story from trinity debt management\nAnd I have a lot of credit card debt and I have my ...
