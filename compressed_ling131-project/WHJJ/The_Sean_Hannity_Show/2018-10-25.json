[laughter] which will get two and a lot of loose ends but you know when news breaks or it changes the course of this program and\nYou know we we have no problem a pivoting with breaking news media oh you know what let me grab a call here quickly in Las Vegas Nevada we have a Vegas listener and its Jerry Jerry is a retired ATF agent\nJerry welcome to Schmidt Hi Geri thanks for phoning in\nThere yeah Jerry go ahead can you hear me okay perfect don't retiree year ago and I was\nI investigated like the bombing of the Uss cole I'm the uh\nBoston mom earned anyway\nOh look parents are a lot of questions I find it interesting that some of your callers knew that there wasn't a a detonator is on any of the bombs that they found out that some of my college back BC but this was really sloppy this is like\nThe these are the mailings and everything is just beyond slot they will have an arrest within twenty four forty dollars\nA year or even getting quicker than I Am because I guess we'd have a way I I guess a\nLake or they can do a little forensic evidence off the stamps I'm from ... for one I'm understanding from some of my colleagues every one of these arms were exactly the same same wiring\nSt pipes um you know it may not be one person it may be a group but you're saying some Republicans are the Democrats and you know and then I heard somebody say about the guy couldn't spell\nI from what I understand some of my colleagues all the paper uh for for the address labels and stuff it was all the same um but I got one or two people involved they're going to figure it out very quick\nYeah I really was I I Know that Gary that sometimes what laser printers leave a a signature ... because it looks like they use the laser printer or an e ink jet to print the labels on copy machine paper then cut it out and scotch taped it to these\nPackages you know there's there's a lot of areas that I'm not a parole but uh and you know and you being a you know with the ATF e for for years I Would imagine and just retired I mean the aspect of what they're going to look at they're going to look at all the components begin to see if there's any potential DNA\nLooking into that in order to ... or why they put a bomb in the end if there was no detonate I\nI find it interesting that you put out there that there is no detonator but um you know that they put it in their armored car in the eye and my my my crew in their ATF and they've already in that in that bomb squad or than it already tearing up on parks\nAnd they they weren't going very far and they were going to end YPG office again they'll have or FBI and ATF go through that but every automaker has a signature\nYou don't treat each bomb that they make so but this guy is just act I mean from what I'm hearing it's it's just kind of a mishmash it you know there's there are so caught comments made her body couldn't spell\nI'm investigator some bombings where they do that to throw you off that they want to make it seem like you're somebody else or or something but but say the Republicans are the Democrats did this as a somewhat out hack\nYeah and those are generally and I I've taken opposition and I've heard the callers make their comments and have the series but I've been very clear from the beginning of the show today\nJust wait for the investigation whether it's a DNA left on the stamps or a a trace of a fingerprint or ... ends I got the Jerry Jerry something stuck to the scotch tape or um even told that the way they ... the wires that\nThey'll look at the needle nose pliers invitations to see if they can find out what tools they use then you know they\nThey are there are so many angles that we probably don't even think of on on how they're investigating this and I tell me if\nI'm guessing that when that pipe bomb was removed from CNN put in the NYPD bomb disposal truck and taken to the Bronx I'm guessing they probably the ATF was right there and the FBI with them I'm guessing they probably didn't detonate that they probably want to take that apart intact ripe\nThat future it apart in the ban\nOh yeah ... again and I I work twenty seven years straight yeah ... that was just a symbol and they're looking at wiring they're looking at the I I'm from ... from one of my colleagues you're telling me that there was the shrapnel salaries arms but no no way that made up\nA bill so they may put some power and there's some shrapnel\nMales and what what have you but ah you know no detonator so just act I mean seriously what you don't have any clue what their political affiliation is when you're doing these investigations you have to investigate it that way\nWell Jerry thanks for the insight you know a retired ATF agent you know falling in with what all of a Thirty Years' experience I certainly a cold and I like to get from uh Las Vegas hopefully you're enjoying your retirement\nOr in Vegas appreciated folks it's eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine and

the hour only twelve days until the important mid term elections\nYou know it had been and even I fall into this even though I tell you don't fall into this I had been reading the polls and I kept seeing a mansion is up by ten I don't see the seat and play and\nObviously an election year conversion he votes for Kavanaugh which was a good vote with the right thing to do um but with that had um now it is a to point raised two polls I've looked at\nOne with mansion up and the other with his opponent the attorney general of West Virginia Patrick Morrisey up and that means that West Virginia is now in play that means that Joe Manchin can be replaced\nA joining us now is the attorney general from the great state of West Virginia Patrick Morrisey sir congratulations there seems to be a very big comeback I'm early polls didn't look good in the beginning but I guess maybe we're getting more accurate polling as we get closer to a\nElection day well Shawn thanks so much for having me on and\nI think what you're seeing in West Virginia is it Reuters are really focusing on the differences between the candidates as you can see from my ads I'm a conservative fighter well advanced the Trump jobs agenda and matches or dishonest Washington liberal\nThe more and more people drilled down on may ... he's starting to lose support so we feel very good and we're going to win on election day we just have to keep out working on the way we out\nKnow I was really worried during the Obama years about our friends in West Virginia because of the the burdensome regulation driving coal miners out of business\nYou know it was one of our our best resources that we have clean coal and we have you know people brave enough to go in the minds I have great admiration for anybody that does that because frankly you know\nSo so deep into the ground and it's dangerous work but it's but energy in the life a lot of our economy and once Donald Trump got elected which by the way would've never happened to Joe mansion on his way 'cause he supported Hillary Clinton um you know look at what happened at the state of West Virginia all those coal mining jobs are coming back thank God\nFor well thank goodness for President Trump and I have to tell you I spent a lot of the last six years suing the Obama administration uh Shaun we were the office that took the lead nationally to go against the Obama power plant one that very big victory at the U.S Supreme Court\nAnd you look at Joe mansion Joe Manchin supported Hillary Clinton even after\nShe said we're going to put a lot of coal miners in coal companies out of work so on the issue of coal on the issue of life on the second amendment there couldn't be a bigger contrast in America that between two candidates and\nThe more people are hearing about that the better off we are and I basically have help serve as a bridge to President Trump's\nReally strong policies that West Virginians really appreciate and so that's one of the president's coming very strongly behind me he knows I'm going to be a staunch advocate for his agenda because it's good for West Virginia\nYou would know better than I probably should have looked at before having you on today uh I meant to actually at one point what percentage of the time those Joe Manchin boat with Chuck Schumer and the Democratic party\nWhile he votes with him when it counts so you know I don't like to count on naming of post offices a procedural vote\nMy uh my you know you don't have to be there are some of them all to retire with financial services [noise] call now for

number Paul is in Ohio Paul you're on the Sean Hannity show glad you called sir\nSir I thank you for taking my call what's going on how are you a good good I at first of all I Want to thank you for your exposure to the left too liberal for you know who they really are\nAnd uh uh the reason I'm calling today is concerning a repeal and replace Obamacare or a no other stories or you know kind of tell you the lead\nNow but we really don't share a whole bunch about a repeal or replace much anymore [noise] it was just wondering if you could give us an update about a month for losses are doing\nIf if we in two weeks we'll have a more Republican senators which I think is very very possible and\nWest Virginia being in play is huge if we can hold on to the house you know it doesn't matter what the margin will you hold on which is far more difficult I'm worried more about the house races than the Senate races\nIf we can get those two victories I guarantee you that Obamacare will be repealed and replaced and then we're going to have it by the way preexisting conditions the big lie that's being told all over the country or the Republican bill dealt with preexisting conditions nobody\nIs going to be denied coverage because they have a preexisting condition but\nYou know innovative solutions like we've been talking about I've been able to get Dr Josh amber outlets Seventy in front of a lot of politicians that all love the paradigm he's created in Wichita he's duplicated in and close to five hundred cities now and that is fifty bucks a month the unlimited concierge care for adults Ninety\nFive percent reductions in in pharmaceuticals\nOr even breast cancer medicine certain medicines you get in for six bucks a treatment for people and you couple that with catastrophic care which is very inexpensive in case you have a heart attack cancer or a bad car accident and you have the best concierge chair you ever dreamed up twenty four hour access to a doctor or\nYour primary care doctor you get your check ups every year you get great reduction as of pharmaceuticals and if something really really bad happens you have the hospital care at a very reduced rate because it's it's catastrophic it's only for the worst case scenario\nAnd it's much less expensive so I think all of that health savings accounts there on the table and I'd love to see that for every American imagine\nConcierge below ... concierge medical treatment for every American we can do that but it's not going to happen top down from the government you know or if you block grant the money to the states where you have you know fifty states have been of Asian\nLet me tell you what's going to rise to the top those they're going to want to turn over every nickel in those states to make it work for the people of those states or they're not going to be in power and I think that is far more economically efficient so there are a lot of good ideas I was disappointed with the Republicans last time we know John McCain had a chance to to fix this and decided against that last minute\nBut the the president's not done the individual mandate is done thankfully thanks to the tax bill that was passed\nUm but we've got a lot more work to do on it absolutely just like you need to fund the border wall that's also something that'll get done if we hold the house and Senate in in twelve days are but I'm focused on these house races all say it again\nEvery single house race matters some more important than others we put up the most important on my website Hannity dot com\nAnd the top races that I've got a tip the balance of power in the house of representatives but you know if you don't get out and vote in every ... we have four hundred and thirty five house races in play here even if you think your guy said go vote even if your guys behind go vote\nDon't take the whole leave it to chance Democrats are going to come out as soon as we have history working against us\nBut I Do believe that we can pick up the Senate seats look I think we can win Florida real little behind them Florida with Nelson and with the Centers for governor Marsha Blackburn who's going to join us later she can and should wait in Tennessee\nClaire McCaskill should lose the Josh Hawley a Dean Heller needs to hang on in about a we definitely need more than ... Sally war hero against this radical Kristin seminars now no problems with Americans joining\nJihad to use and and joining the Taliban then of course we've got Montana tester has a lead at this point but that still and play a Heidi Heitkamp is down by double digits\nAre and in Joe Donnelly his case he should be removed and we've got a good candidate brought against him but people can't waste their vote on the libertarian candidate in Indiana or else that's going to be a problem Bob\nMenendez can be beaten in New Jersey he's only up three Bob Menendez could be the big surprise of the night second big surprise of the night is Joe Manchin losing in West Virginia you know just to stay on most worried about to be very honest is Florida [noise]\nBecause this guy Gillum is a radical socialist leftist if elected governor is going to ruin this great state [noise]\nAnd you're going to see all the prosperity and all the money that has been flowing in Florida I\nStart dissipating almost immediately and you're gonna businesses packing up and leaving in anticipation of what Gillum would do to this day not a good idea I we got to take a break we'll come back eight hundred nine four one Shawn Otto free telephone number you want to be a part of the program\nMarsha Blackburn um when you saw the tape of a British ... staff calling the people of Tennessee ignorant what was your reaction\nI looked at it and I said well of course I really think and this is typical liberal state try to hide and then somebody figures out exactly what it is that they are saying so there you go now you know\nMade a decision about a Supreme Court judge justice for political reasons that was it\nTo Gail I'm looking I'm surveying the country right now this is how I see the Democratic party they\nThey only want to talk about Russia collusion if it's Donald Trump they don't care at all the Hillary we now know bought and paid for Russian wise to disseminate to the American people before the election that those lives where the the bulk of information to secure\nPfizer warrants against the Trump campaign associate they lied and committed fraud before the court and then they used to set up a special counsel by leaking that information they leak media league strategy but does that apparently was their\nTheir insurance policy when people like Peter Struck a saying that Hillary should win a hundred million is zero\nAnd I'm Wondering why don't they care about Hillary's Russian allies why do they not care about Keith Ellison ...\nYou know charges against him nobody is asking for FBI investigation into him and in that case we have tape syntax and doctors' reports or in the recent charges against Spartacus a Cory Booker\nUm and it's the same on every other issue you know all the you know we have all these Democrats talking violently about the president Republicans on these mobs and most of the Democrats have been silent\nWell you're right but they always go at things which a double standard and it doesn't matter if on the issue is whether it's something the legislative slaves that were working on or something that is political and Sean what they want to do is say look our\nOur outcome our ends justifies the means that we're using to go about this to get to where we want to go and that is not the way Tennessee I'm ... I Want to see ... tennis fans want to\nSay fairness and trees and respect for others and respect for differing opinions and it takes on sheep respect for the rule of law and a ... by the constitution and what we have\nA fish are resistant should face and focus Democrat Party is oh well that ends will justify whatever means sit where we're using and people are appalled at how they are conducting themselves\nI saw the British ... first reaction to the tape of ah his staff calling people of the people of Tennessee ignorant and by the way Tennessee happens to be one of my favorite states Nashville like right at the my top three cities in the country and I\nWell that's because now they love you in Nashville, Tennessee you\nWell I mean even bigger I live ... miles south of Nashville are just off a sixty five\nAnd I used to go up to Nashville all the time I ... I Love music city and I love the people of Nashville and I've got to imagine they were pretty insulted a and a little bit shocked that somebody would be that duplicitous behind the scenes and then when he he said well those are just college kids volunteers and we find out no that's a full time staff\nAre I'm sure that ah he was embarrassed again\nI'm certain that they should have been embarrassed whether or not but of course he didn't they start saying\nWell it it ... it was our campaign my campaign that put somebody in there which is not this was a project maritime project but they started saying well all these other excuses but the point as they got caught and they got caught saying we made this decision\nBecause we want to go fool people about where he is don't worry he's got to be a Democrat when he gets there\nSo you got to say this that and the other in order to get him there and it's\nLike as a parent I mean when when your kids do something wrong my kids do something wrong\nWhich rarely happens ah kidding but you know what it's not I'm I'm never is mad at what they did but if they try to lie to me about it then they're in big trouble\nNot a little trouble I don't care what it is I can deal with a mistake I Can't deal with you lying to me in looking in my eyes and just outright lying to me and my lines of my kids is\nYou know I I'm not stupid stop treating me like I Am stupid\nUm rise it frustrates frustrated I Swear to God I Swear and when you know darn well they did it that\nWell that is true and in any of our relationships whether it's family members are gathered that we work\nWhen I saw where in church organizations which we expect them to tell us the choice to have that integrity [noise] ah to speak the truth and when you don't then it causes a raft and that is what you're seeing with the practice and campaign\nIs people are saying well if she didn't mean it probably did you say and what people know about me\nIs that they may not always agree with me but they are always going to now where I stand and that that is has been central to me as a part of my public service and people expect that and I\nKnow knew a long time\nSo Congress woman and I know you'd make a great senator and I hope the people of Tennessee understand that um what are the issues because the economy's doing very well and Tennessee\nThings are looking up we've had two years of great economic growth since Donald Trump's been president out of the people of Tennessee feel about the president's policies and and the important vote the boats that you will be casting that if you become the next grade senator from Tennessee\nIf people are so supportive of president Donald Trump\nAnd say look to see his policies six said they want to give my singer he's going to be a conservative and it's going to support President Trump and his policies said well lord constitutional Supreme Court justices and federal judges they want to keep their tax cuts the economy\nSo getting ... it has the fastest growing median household income and the southeast\nAnd I saw some battered for you know that they deserve trade\nYes absolutely and I tell you something down the ... the walls securing that southern border and it's just caravan marching through Guatemala and Mexico people are saying\nLook secure that border there's a right way and a wrong light to come to the United states we want people to come to the right way respect the rule of law\nYou know what Congress owner that wall was up I'm very concerned because we have to protect our word constitutional republic we've got we're based on the rule of law we have borders sovereignty issues here if they ever get we had the wall up nobody would be marching they would be following the\nLaw and the proper process and necessary betting if they want to come and visit or maybe even come and say we don't care where you come from we just need to know you you are somebody that accepts our values wants to be a part of our family and doesn't\nHave any intentions to cause any harm or doesn't need assistance the minute you get here\n[noise] that's right and then in Paris, Tennessee today and ... and I'm telling you Sean that is what people say that's just fine with me that while this is why we need to make sure that sanctuary city policies are in that because\nAll right thanks so much and I hope the people Tennessee understand how important the seat is it is pivotal you can have a good night ...

station news radio nine twenty had ...\nWhen you're waiting\nI heard a radio station\nSearch narrowing I'm Lisa ... Fox News Florida so called reach the interest as federal and local investigators ... for those responsible in the series of package bombs into high profile Democrats and other\nThursday today [noise] [noise] so Florida\nI'm Wondering if they've narrowed down I I was trying to think what what point does it I mean could it be post marks because of some of the package as you could see a post mark or a partial post Mark I'm wondering if they have enough of a post Marc people to see the ZIP Code of origin nation where it was canceled a et cetera but I'm Wondering if\nIf anything\nAs far as the return address to Debbie Wasserman Schultz if that some kind of clue there on how quickly she got the package where it was male for I don't know\nJust wondering how they've decided on Florida is a potential lead on where these packages could have been male as it doesn't mean that the bombers from Florida bummer can be from\nSomewhere else build the bombs in driving and mail them from a location I mean all these are tricks to try to throw people off the trail\nI was there is a lot to talk about today eight hundred three eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine gets you on the program radio listeners TV viewers wherever you are would love to have you on the program eight hundred eight zero one\nEighty nine Ninety nine that we can talk about the conspiracy theories we can talk about you know the the false flag suggestions which again I'm not subscribing to any of this\nI'm going to wait for the investigation there is going to be a troll vague treasure trove of details and information and evidence you know we talk yesterday about as simple as\nThe scotch tape the scotch tape that was used to fix these\nLaser printer or a check in the jet print addresses and return addresses looked like it was printed on you know normal you know copy bond and then you know cut out ... and to our rectangles and then placed on to the manila padded novel ups and then just taped\nMe any game\nA finger nail a skim pieces hair\nOr you can be DNA evidence under the tape on the forever stamps which I pointed out yesterday that those look like those are American flag forever stamps\nOr who knows fingerprints any kind of DNA um components I mean if if ten bombs were sent you've got for instance ten of these digital clock timers\nWhere does someone get Kennedy or the all the same so all the components if there was repetition components\nIs someone gonna be able to say Oh yes some guy bought nine of these are Kennedys were twelve or these clocks in at a hardware store electronics place or a ordered online yeah there's just so many avenues of investigation I Can't even think of all the possible avenues but I think that they're going to figure out\nWho this is\nFairly shortly that's my guess I see already on hold we have a caller that says that he thinks I'm wrong that the purpose is going to be found All right hey I I Want to get into all of this a lot of detail here I'll give you the the ten bombs now there are two new recipients\nAre confirmed today that receive the these bomb packages I'll get to that momentarily I've got all the way I Want to play President Trump at the rally last night is getting some attention speaking of the president the president tweeted out\nOr not about the bombing something unrelated decision regarding the caravan and then I just want to give you a little breaking caravan news and then we'll go back to the the the package bombs being sent\nThe president tweeted out\nLiterally a forty minutes ago\nAt two thirty one pm eastern time today the twenty fifth of October\nOr from at real Donald Trump's Twitter account the president tweeted\nTo vote was the um the caravan turn around we are not letting people into the United states illegally go back to your country and if you want to apply for citizenship like millions of others are doing\nExclamation point\nI don't have a problem with this tweet this queen is [noise]\nOn the money what what is wrong with this to those and they can then turn around we're not letting you and you're not coming into the country illegally what is wrong with this week I Want any President Obama was we played that Obama audio from when he was a senator\nTalking about we won't tolerate the illegal ah migrations into this country and you know come to this country the correct way we have the bond and a Trump that green tweeted this Obama audio from 'em before he was president so when he was a senator what oh six oh seven whatever was [noise]\nAnd at the president's a hundred percent right [noise]\nWith this particular tweet also we have a\nDetails about James Mattis\nTo send troops to Mexico border over immigrant the caravan\nOf the latest now on this from ah various wire services has at least eight hundred US troops\nWill be sent to the U.S Mexico border\nIn response to this caravan which\nLets them some reports have the caravan of fourteen thousand now as it's it's like one of those cartoons snowballs going downhill we got all kinds of boulders and houses and arms and legs hanging out and there's things that the second migrant caravan was over a thousand strong we heard about you know a traipsing through um a Guatemala\nSo took care of ads that they could burn to make us so far caravan\nSo uh we'll get into more detail on this later on during the course of the program the bombs [noise]\nWe have ten devices at this point\nSo we know about the Clintons got a device in chapel claw in Westchester County New York and a\nFairly bill was home Hillary was not there I don't think they spend too much tied together a\nSo one bomb to the Clintons the Obamas got the bomb and the device at the end of course the Clinton package was intercepted the Obamas a package was sent to the Washington home also intercepted so Clinton's Obama's Maxine Waters\nUh she received two packages or they want to dress to her Maxine Waters one was intercepted at the Capitol Hill a congressional mail center a that was in Capitol heights Maryland so far off campus for them\nAnd also in Los Angeles oh Maxine Waters recipient of two we had of course the Eric Holder package which then was on deliverable and apparently I I think that was due to insufficient postage\nOr miss address one of them and insufficient postage and I and I have a picture of that or so and that package to Eric Holder was then sent back to the center which the bogus a spoof a return to sender and turned out to be a Debbie Wasserman Schultz I'm Sorry Schultz a\nAnd her sunrise Florida office we know that the original package went to George Soros his house they believe that was handled liver and they find a courier find out who drop this thing off a we have of course the John Brennan\nAddressed package which tend to was delivered to CNN they also think that was courier over and then of course cause the evacuation of uh the CNN New York headquarters in the old time Warner center and that was the big mess yesterday and then the two new packages are as follows Robert Deniro\nGot a package at his uh try Becca film productions office in try Becca lower Manhattan just you know below canal tried that can mean the triangle below canal so that's where that package went and\nUh one of his security person a founded suspicious and cold and YPG early this morning like five AM and they responded and then a Joe Biden the recipient or addressed\nThe Joe Biden to packages and one package was intercepted in Wilmington, Delaware the other package in New castle Delaware so that makes a total of ten how many more are out there that's the question\nNow again there's just so many little details that I find fascinating and interesting we'll get into those so why a\nRobert Deniro could be at some of the nasty remarks\nThat Robert De Niro made regarding President Trump because it appears that you have a lot of these people are clinics were outspoken against the president\nAnd it is is is it a right wing you know not that sending these or is it a Democrat sending it to Democrats to make it seem like who knows again I'm not sure if the guinea conclusions but we do know that the people that are vocally against Trump\nSome of these people have received these packages and that brings me to Robert De Niro and some of his audio ... I've got to audio bites on deniro that I Want to play which uh there was a red just before the election which we have to bleep\nUh and then we have of course are at the uh Tony Awards\nOr what the narrow set of having all these audio by so you want a refresher I'll get to those next and your phone calls coming up on Schmidt eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine here on Schmidt's a standby if you haven't tried Harry's yet Harry dot com\nThe absolute best when it comes to shaving and price is quality meats and incredible value that's Harry's you know simply point the ah cartridges you know the big name brand the big drug store brand those cartridges or twice the price\nYou're listening to the show [noise]\nRobert de narrows film office in New York City and fried back in lower\nGot one of these packages and it was discovered early this morning bomb squad took it away pads habit obviously and why was the near on the list as well [noise] deniro put out this video\nBack in August of sixteen and\nThis was prior to the election the presidential election\nI mean he's so blatantly stupid [noise]\nUses dog\nHe's a big speaking about Donald Trump sees a con artist a mutt who doesn't know what he's talking about doesn't do his homework doesn't care thinks he's gaming society doesn't pay his taxes he's an idiot Colin Powell said it best he's a national disaster is an embarrassment to this country\nIt makes me so angry that this country has gotten to this point that this fool disposal\nAs wound up where he has talked how he wants to punch people\nIn the face [noise]\nI'd like to punch him in the face [noise]\nThis is somebody that we want for president I don't think so\nWhat I care about is the direction of this country [noise] and what I'm very very worried about is that it might go in the wrong direction with someone like Donald Trump [noise] if you care about your future vote for him [noise]\nSo that was deniro and then of course that the Tony Award the or add a string of expletives or not whether you call the more coming up yeah\nThe following is not an actor but a real life story from trinity debt management\nAnd I had a lot of credit card debt and I couldn't pay I ...

pointing fingers at President Trump that always his rhetoric gets his style it's his bashing of the news media and a bashing of some of these critics of his that's a foment did this or this violence or the the mailing of these packages come on\nLike the first of all I Am I happy with all of Trump's rhetoric and when he gets in to bully mode I'm not happy I I tell you about it on the program\nI'm happy with a lot of the components of the job he's doing but not always you know the the rally mentality and and you know the seeming to\nPut a stamp of approval on the body slamming instead of a gene for the ... and ... and then the reporter the the congressional I as a candidate ... up in Montana I I don't think that's helpful\nI Wish that the president I Wish Trump would refrain I'm Sorry I don't give a seal of approval to everything President Trump says it does\nI like a lot of what he's doing but I tell you when he's crossed the line here but let me be very clear even with his ramped up rhetoric there is only one person to blame for these packages and is not bomber\nIt is well practically no bombs exploded so are they a bomber or just the bomb manufacturing a a lame bomb manufacturer or is it intangible who knows there are so many questions to be answered but again this is not Donald Trump's fault\nThis is the bombers fold must be one hundred percent clear the only person responsible is whoever is assembling and mailing and targeting these individuals with\nThese packages done that's it\nWith that said what I like the president to be more civil and delivery of course I Want but it's all the way around it so the president it's the pundits it's the rhetoric gets the media it's it's it's everything but it doesn't justify somewhat mailing out ten packages at this point and the big question is how many more remain\nHow many more of these packages are still floating around\nSetting somewhere in a pile of male or a I Would imagine that the postal workers are now or I got to believe that there are pictures of what these packages that look like and mail facilities all over the u._s. to alert people to look out for this particular package\nI'm the president
