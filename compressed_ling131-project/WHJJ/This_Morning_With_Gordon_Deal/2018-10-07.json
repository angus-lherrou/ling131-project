smaller on college campuses about Ninety percent of victims do not report on college campuses\nAll right Elizabeth let's talk about some of the specifics of what are some of the factors you found in your research about why people are not coming forward\nVery complex so many many reasons why somebody might not report on a on a fault or rape or it can be read traumatizing to revisit that to help people and go over the details again a and once you once you tell somebody wants to law enforcement system takes over\nLose control and this is a primary issue of why the rape or the assault itself was so traumatized and you've lost control of your body right so now you you send it out there on your telling people justice system is taking over you've lost control of that again and that that also can be reached traumatizing\nElizabeth why do so many victims blame themselves\nWell we we are in this longstanding culture of sort of blaming the victim and unfortunately victims noted that since so are there is a deep amount of shame often you know ... people were in a position I'm not often that sometimes there somewhere or they feel that they they did something wrong\nI went to that party I had too many drinks I walked down the street that with dark or they should be things that anybody can do and still be safe you should be safe in this world right in a perfect world but we're not and so there is a self blame like how did I not protect myself\nWe're speaking with Elizabeth Bernstein of the wall Street Journal Elizabeth your article I thought it was interesting that people are more willing to come forward if there's some evidence of physical harm why is that\nLike it then they face feels like they will people eat for the huge fear is that I Am going to put myself out and I'm going to relive my trauma and no one's going to do it publicly people now know de shameful details it's you know facts as a private thing to begin with even when it's consensual and nice\nAnd people are going to know these horrible details in my life and no one's going to believe me right so these these physical injuries that somebody has or at least a physical ... they're visible press that something happened to me\nLet's talk about um the victims who actually know the person which seems to\nThe somewhat often if that person is a friend of relatives ... like that does that make it that much more complicated\nGas especially for young people you're on a college campus are high school you see this person in the hall you see this person around the country club wherever you are and so um you're you're scared aid that they will get angry at you and there'll be some retaliation and um but you're also scared of being ostracized ostracized so\nI you know well people again in this victim blaming society will people say that you know you you should be quiet and here's the thing I'm there's something called cognitive dissonance when something we can get our mind around some things that we look for someone says hey this person you know\nUltimately what if we know that person to be a really good person and I can't get might just sit by and I can't get my mind around the idea that this person that I Know to be upstanding and the community suddenly something horrible is being said he did\nAnd so I Can't get my mind around at the way I Try to try that is this these must be live this must be an exaggeration are made up\nIt could swim in it under those circumstances\nAre the phones are more durable than they've been or is this the standard we've been carrying around on\nWell we've

are reported no problem there were a couple of ... marks a couple of people I talk to\nAgain apple claims that it's the most horrible but it doesn't necessarily mean shatter proof so you know again my

we're in a debt bubble car to me at all bubbles eventually burst you cannot keep going uh currently can't keep going by adding more debt faster than the economy is growing and that's exactly what

and you've lost control of your body right so now you send it out there on your telling people justice system is taking over you've lost control of that again and that that also can be read traumatizing\nElizabeth why do so many victims blame themselves\n[noise] well we we're in this longstanding culture of sort of blaming the victim and unfortunately victims noted that since so are there is a deep amount of shame often you know ... people were in a position I'm not often that sometimes there somewhere or they feel that they they did something wrong I went to that party\nAnd guess what it work for the phone I mean the phone continue to work after each each bell\nWhat what did you find that there were any kind of limits to this [laughter]\nNot really I mean I mean technically there are limits I mean you know there's something called ... which is basically a standard which which basically means that ... that are shown that meets that standard could be submerged in freshwater for up to two leaders for up to half hour\nNow you know we didn't keep the iPhone and the coke for example the beer for more than a couple of minutes [laughter] really not even that I'm so in that sense I guess\nYou know you do anything about it and real world terms but if you are sitting on your desk and east or coffee on it you know what are you gonna do you're going to dry it off immediately and that's what you're supposed to do by the way for\nSpeaking with it may get us H J he drowned the iPhone and a bunch of liquid to see how it would hold up it's an important distinction to make because water resistant does not mean waterproof\nCorrect correct and technically you're not supposed to swim with these I Do know people who do and they've come out fine but you know apple will will not tell you to do that and I'm certainly not telling you to do that I mean the idea Israeli to prevent ... you know you drop it in a pot or or\nYou know or you you know by the seashore and certainly a big wave comes in ...\nIt's that kind of thing you're not meant to swim with it though the shed technically you can keep the phone and least standard ... you can keep the phone and fresh water for up to about two meters for a half hour or so I guess you could swim in it under those circumstances\nAre the phones I'm more durable than they've been or is this the standard we've been carrying\nAround on a well we've heard it before but apple says yes indeed that um you know this is the most durable clash they've ever put on an iPhone I did not do drop trash or I Know a couple of people who did and some people are reported no problems there were a couple of ... a couple of people I talk to\nAgain apple claims it's it's the most horrible but it doesn't necessarily mean shatter proof so you know again my advice is don't push it to the limit\nYeah when you're trying to figure out um\nI mean is it best to\nStand it up right so maybe any or sideways though that we can leak out of whatever buttons are holes may be in it\nUm I don't know if there's a standard way to dry it I mean I literally just took a paper towel and dry dry it that way I didn't do anything in particular the scientific here but and again it was fine and we did ... saying you know there's pictures if you [noise]\nYou know direct people to the article at USA Today dot com slash tech you'll you'll see the video and your of what we did and you'll see that you know it was fully Dallas can these very slick rich but we tried at just the old fashioned way with a paper towel\nThat big USA Today personal technology columnist by the way he says you know if you read the fine print liquid damages not covered under apples warranty so\nRepeat that test that he did it your own peril especially since you spent a grand more to get the phone is there's also your own does get wet wipe it dry immediately and don't try to charge it before it's dry\nThirty minutes after the hour on this weekend\n\n\n\nCamp

rising life is good right but could it be too good yes so Stanford con economic business trends analyst he shakes his head of the amount of debt that we've accumulated he's based in Long Beach California ... what kind of economy are we looking at\nWhat we're looking at it or a comment that's doing well I Can't argue with the numbers this doing well but we're in a debt bubble car to me and all bubbles eventually burst you cannot keep going economy can't keep going by adding more debt faster than the economy is growing and that's exactly what we're doing and the quality of the debt now\nIs actually worse than it was at the peak in two thousand seven right before we had the financial crisis\nSo we got a real problem now you got a dead induce financial bubble that outlook you think this is going to go on forever course got no bubbles go on forever they are actually they all burst I Can't tell you when but no one could tell you where rats with\nThe debt it's a government and consumers are we just talking about bad can so hard that you know\nIt's it's both I'll give you an example um all that both from municipalities and corporations are the debt now\nOver a little over fifty percent of the debt from is a power these that'd be like a couple of government states and uh incorporation corporate that\nLittle over fifty percent is rated junk or one notch above junk when to me that's all junk in two thousand seven about twenty seven percent of that that was raided junk or one notch above jock\nSo you know you take if you take your pick a we're worse off now than we weren't two thousand seven\nAnd those people get into bond funds better be careful about the radio and those bonds because all those bonds are very\nLow rate it they could be junk or a little bit above jock and there are a little bit above junk they're called investment grade but to me if you're a little bit above junk it's joke\n[laughter] how did we find these new depths what happened\nAfter we climbed these new debt what was the question again\nHow did we find them well how do how do we get back to worse than we weren't oh seven\n... because a friend that fed lowers interest rates near zero for a long for a number of years so people went out on borrowed money like mad they issued debt and they just had a dead end is financial bubble and the economy did grow in a work\nBut all all trends come to an end they don't go on forever and now the fed is reversing itself\nAnd guess what interest rates are going up the ten year treasury note went above three percent it still is about three percent if it starts climbing higher\nWell God you people borrowed money at low interest rates lower rates going up that that will ... the financial bubble especially if the year when the ten year treasury note goes about three and a quarter percent and it's that's going to four percent the game is over that's it the gate all financial gains come to an end\nAnd this one eventually come to an end to this is a matter of whether you're going to be caught in the middle\nSo start preparing for yourself now because this thing will not last forever\nSanford Sanford John economic business
