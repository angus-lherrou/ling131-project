know\nAnd I came back with six hundred at least six hundred school districts\nAre doing this in at least twenty two states and just a decade ago that number was about a hundred and twenty school districts so it's really growing it's getting more and more popular and it you know it's been really on the western side of the map but now it's going east\nWhy has it been mostly in the western part of the state so far\nYou know I Know that's a really good question and where I'm from just talking to different educators it looks like it's more of a geographical situation there where you have you know more district spread out more rural districts because this is something that started in ...\nDistricts in is still very dominant in rural districts and um there's just a lot of lot more rural districts out west\nTo now why did the rural districts decided to go to the four day week\nIt all goes to saving money and when you're in a rural district in early spread out east you can spend a good chunk of your budget on transportation because everybody's really spread out [noise]\nAnd um so initially it's always about saving money and then they started noticing other benefits like wow you know teachers are really attracted to having a three day weekend despite what recruiting and some of the rural areas sometimes it's hard to recruit teachers out there\nI also wanted the benefits and your story as you were absences that would be a huge one\nYes and that's it now they're unexpected benefits that some of these districts initially going into it to save money or is that why you know what it really does help for the kids to get three day weekends and you know they're showing up in the same thing with teachers you know their notice and fewer teacher apps and says\nWe're speaking with financial hub through the wall Street Journal now if you're a shrinking the week to four days do you add hours to the other days\nYes that's what they're doing there at an hours and you know and some of these districts they had already met the minimum uh required hours for instruction\nSo you know they might add anywhere from Fifteen minutes a day to Ninety minutes a day it just depends on where they were at when they started when they when they were all five days if they were already exceeding the hours there is just\nBasically add in time at the end of that day\nThat each state decide its own hours and or days I Know here in New Jersey kids have to be in school a certain number of days not ours\n[laughter] yes and and exactly and that I'm\n... and it's easier for states and Iran each state does decide you know how many hours kids are going to be in school and I noticed that the states that have the four days are those states that basically look at ours they don't care\nYou know how many days you're in school they just want you you know the the you know to be in a school for the year for a thousand eighty hours or whatever\nAnd there are some states that still do base it on how many days you're in school and those are the states that it's a bit harder to go to for a day on those states because they look at days instead of ours [laughter] the ones that look at ours has you know we don't care what your schedule is just make sure your kids you know\nHave this many hours of instruction for the year\nA recent report from the data analysis sperm price ... marketwatch reporter Jake capacity has been looking at this report Jacob what are we learning\nThey basically looked at you know the price of\nMarijuana in different cities across the U.S and Canada and compared it and what they found is that a candidate says about thirty percent cheaper\nAnd Canada than it is in the U.S and that was before it was legalized so what the report basically said was because campus was more widely available in Canada because it's been legal for medical uses\nA for many years now and so there's a wider range of dispensaries there's a wider range of producers in Canada than there is here in the U.S [noise]\nUm and so they the the researchers basically said because of that\nUm that wider range of production [noise] ah you know in Canada they can supply it more cheaply you know whereas here in the U.S uh you know except for the states where it's legal or illegal at the federal level [noise] and so uh that drives up the cost here in the U.S\nAre so at the medical marijuana been around a long time they can to correct\n[noise] yeah it's been around since two thousand one so you know\nThey have a very large legal cannabis industry in Canada and you know that industry with pre easily able to you know kind of transition to white or legality in Canada so you know because they already had that kind of foundation for legal cannabis you know it may make things easier and [noise]\nAnd you know if you if you work at the videos and stuff coming in from candidate folks are you know kind of easily able to go in and out of the dispensaries and and and pick up what they want\nSpeaking with chicken ... personal finance reporter at marketwatch he's written a piece titled why Americans pay more for weed then Canadians what's the what's the cost breakdown is it done done by adults I guess\nYeah so in Canada it's about twenty eight dollars per is up and down on that but the measurement they use [noise] whereas here in the U.S it's about forty dollars for an eighth of an out so you know for a full out you know multiply that out to be about like three hundred and twenty dollars\nA year and the U.S for that various you know from from city to city um and surprisingly\nWhere it was most expensive was in San Francisco medical marijuana is legal in California but nevertheless you know that there are you in the U. S. where where marijuana is legal you know a lot of states are still having to set up a dispensary if they're still having to you know set up a whole [noise]\nYou know kind of ecosystem for the industry because you know they have to do it within that state they can't cross state lines because the legal at the federal level and for that make things harder and drives up the costs\nIf let's say the U.S were to legalize it on the federal level and ... ... we're all fifty states followed suit and legalize marijuana does that change perhaps the pricing structure supply and demand things like that and we we could be more with Canada\nYou know so if if you know if it was made legal at the federal level you know you could expect the costs to go down pretty quickly because it would be much easier to produce in the states that already have legalized it at the state level [noise] um you know they'd be able to ship it across state lines so that would drop prices in other states\nI mean we could we could you know get it from Canada where there is this you know very robust cannabis industry already in place\nAnd they stick market watch personal finance reporter Jacob ... thirty minutes

so much of the drama\nWe saw on television which\nDamaged both participants significantly I could have been done at a time and then the decision could be reached a with regard to whether or not the candidate or they complain complain that was Bible about doing so much damage so we pretty much get the same outcome\nUm but but the damage to both parties would be added that ended the appearance of the court\nWould have been or what have been through a stage they reduce them and that's what I was really for it it it helps you get to the meat of a problem provide you with advice on how to resolve the problem and does show was out this massive amount of drama we seem to be an during um pretty much every major decision\nRight so how could it potentially handle do accusations from the Nineteen eighties\nWell I I I think that that that what it would do is do we go again in the end and certainly would take the evidence that was presented and would determine whether that evidence reached the threshold of\nA of a decision so in other words if if there was a it looks like this particular case we had a complaint and said that there was an assault attempted rape\nBut no rape jet no location no time no all the things that would fill out a case even on the next day had had happened the day before that would allow prosecutor to bring the ... the case for\nWas named existence and so I Would likely come back very quickly and say okay we we need these elements otherwise there's no point in proceeding because there's no\nThere's nothing there's no substance here and so it would allow they went dead at Senator Feinstein got the initial no way back in July it would say okay this doesn't meet the threshold you're going to need these five things you're going to need to go out and get these five things before this has to pursue their horses we saw none of those things\nHad been achieved by the time it finally went on to television and so you're eater reached the threshold certainly still go forward and and tried to disrupt these people's lives but if you want to be successful while you to prioritize your resources\nTo see if you could find these other elements in and and make a case rather than just get everybody angry\nAnd we're speaking with analyst Rob Enderle a principal and founder of the ... group he's written a piece about how artificial intelligence could help clean up something like the Senate confirmation process for a Supreme Court justice um I guess too though\nThere could be accusations of bias in how the AI was programs right or how data was input\nAlways the case that's one of the reasons why point IBM and the peace because I get my early on as popped up with a series of procedures\nAnd practices that allow you to ... I I that's unbiased and and realize a biased AI as problematic on a whole bunch of fun because we're increasingly going to be depending on how to drive our cars or make financial decisions for us make medical decisions for us and so if you if you if you don't\nWe can clearly saying you know with Elvis Presley did not die of any sort of heart related uh um affliction\n[laughter] now as for FDR or he was sixty three and I mentioned you know that was pretty good age for Nineteen forty five today that's fairly young uh by just because he he surpassed the average lifespan I don't think it was his lowest forty nine\nMax and but I mean George Washington you know live to be in ...

End Days ran down nice guy that I never have no idea how the relatives out well hey can be\nYou have a clue as to how they made their money ranching right\nWell I Know that I I yeah I Do\nActually and the tour guide at the Roosevelt mansion mentioned this they were actually in the timber business so I was told 'em and they were dealing with timber in a in the United states and they also we're dealing with similar in South America so that's\nWhere allegedly there and when they came from and if I'm proven wrong then so be it that's what I was told uh at the Roosevelt mansion and they were very good at manipulating the stock market just like the Kennedys were\nSo I mean you're dealing with the stock market was not as big as it is today\nAnd there are only a handful of major players back then you know in today you know the world is on our stock market other countries are in the New York stock exchange back then it really wasn't that way so a handful of players could really influenced things they create the peaks and valleys in the market\nSo when you have the money to start with and you can you can influence where the bottom is and you know what the topic is you can make a fortune pretty quickly and Joe Kennedy did the same thing this is why when a after they made their money they shut the door so no one else could do that and they started the you actually see the security Exchange Commission\nAnd FDR actually put Joe Kennedy in charge of it because according to FDR quote unquote effects accrue to crush across\n[laughter] really interesting stuff so that's what I Know about that I mean if there's more information author I'd love to hear it but their their their money came from Denver\nA and also I Would I Would imagine I'm you know it's an old it's an old east coast family uh probably it's old money so you know just kind of keep the Toomey elation of wells over generations compound interest um that sort of thing when you handle money\nI'd also hurt and I don't know if this is true but the the um that's FDR's mother the Delano side of the family\nHad made their money during the opium wars as well so I'm sure there was a lot of a lot of those they used to call them the Boston brain than those very wealthy east coast families\nAnd I think a lot of them were involved in the east India company a and a lot of that was the opium trade so there may be on that as well [noise]\n[noise] yeah I had heard that about the Delano family as well there is so much information out there I mean I spent so much time digging and digging and these guys are never written a book let me tell you what if I was paid a penny an hour\nI'd be lucky [laughter] by the time you research and dig and dig and dig because if you ask your name so he wants to be as best they

six hundred school districts are doing this in at least twenty two states and just a decade ago that number was about a hundred and twenty school districts so it's really growing it's getting more and more popular and it's you know it's been really on the western side of the map but now it's going east\nWhy has it been mostly in the western part of the states so far\nYou know I Know that's a really good question and what a from just talking to different educators it looks like it's more of a geographical a situation there where you have\nYou know more districts spread out more rural districts because this is something that started in rural districts in is still very dominant role districts and um there's just a lot of lot more rural districts out west\nTurnout why did the rural districts decided to go to the four day week\nIt all goes to saving money and when you're in a rural district and you're really spread out east you can spend a good chunk of your budget on transportation because everybody's really spread out\nAnd I'm so initially it's always about saving money and then they started noticing other benefits like wow you know teachers are really attracted to having a three day weekend despite what recruiting and some of the rural areas sometimes it's hard to recruit teachers out there\nI also saw one of the benefits and your story as you were apps and says that would be a huge one\nYes and that's it now they're unexpected benefits that some of these districts initially going into it to save money or is that while you know what it really does help for the kids to get three day weekends and you know they're showing up in the same thing with teachers you know they're noticed and fewer teacher absence is\nWe're speaking with Panetta hubs of the wall Street Journal now if you're a shrinking the week to four days do you add hours to the other days\nYes that's what they're doing there at an hours\nAnd you know and some of these districts they had already met the minimum uh required hours for instruction so you know they might add anywhere from Fifteen minutes a day to Ninety minutes a day it just depends on where they were at\nWhen they started when they when they were all five days if they were already seat in the hours there it's just\nBasically add in time at the end of that day\nThat does each state decide its own hours and days I Know here in New Jersey kids have to be in school at certain number of days not ours\nYes and and exactly and that I'm ... and it's easier for states and Iran each state does decide you know how many hours kids are going to be in school\nAnd I noticed that the states that have the four days are those states that basically look at ours they don't care\nYou know how many days you're in school they just want you you know the the you know to be in a school for the air for a thousand eighty hours or whatever and there are some states that still\nDo base it on how many days you're in school and those are the states that it's a bit harder to go to for a day on those states because they look at days instead of ours [laughter] the ones that look at ours has you know we don't care what your schedule is just make sure your kids you know\nHave this many hours of instruction for the year\nI Would think that there would be some opposition to this plan from parents who have to scramble around to find care for their kid on that and the day\n[laughter] yeah and that's always the big issue daycare daycare on that day and what I found is a lot of these districts that go to a four day\nA for many years now and so there's a wider range of dispensaries there's a wider range of producers in Canada and there is here in the U.S [noise]\nUm and so they the the researchers basically said because of that um that wider range of production ah you know in Canada they can supply it more cheaply whereas here in the U.S side you know except for the states where it's legal or illegal at the federal level\nAnd so uh that drives up the cost here in the U.S\nArts so at the medical marijuana been around a long time and again the correct\n[noise] yeah it's been around since two thousand one so you know they have a very large legal cannabis industry in Canada and you know that industry with pre easily able to you know kind of transition to white or legality in Canada so\nYou know because they already had that kind of foundation for legal cannabis you know it may make things easier and\nAnd you know if you if you work at the videos and stuff coming in from Canada folks are kind of easily able to go in and out of the dispensary isn't and and pick up what they want\nSpeaking with chicken ... personal finance reporter at marketwatch she's written a piece titled why Americans pay more for weed then Canadians what's the what's it costs breakdown is it done it done by al so I guess\nYeah so in Canada it's about twenty eight dollars per eighth of announced that but the measurement they use [noise] whereas here in the U.S it's about forty dollars for an eighth of an out so you know for full out and kill multiply that out be about like three hundred and twenty dollars\nA year and the U.S I'm various you know from from city to city and surprisingly where was the most expensive was\nIn San Francisco medical marijuana is legal in California but never the last you know that there are you in the U. S. where where marijuana is legal you know a lot of states are still having to set up a dispensary if they're still having to you know set up a whole\nYou know kind of ecosystem for the industry because you know they have to do it within that state they can't cross state lines\nBecause the legal at the federal level and so that make things harder and drives up costs\nIf let's say the U.S were to legalize it on the federal level ... let's say we're all fifty states followed suit and legalize marijuana that changed perhaps the pricing structure supply and demand things like that and we we could be more with Canada\nYou know so if if you know if it was made legal at the federal level you know you could expect the costs to go down pretty quickly because it would be much easier to produce in the states that already have legalized it at the state level [noise] um you know they'd be able to ship it across state lines so that would drop prices and other states\nI mean we could we could you know get it from Canada where there is this very robust cannabis industry already in place\nRestricted marketwatch personal finance reporter Jacob ... thirty minutes after the hour on this

accusations from the Nineteen eighties\nWell I I I think that that that what it would do is it would go again in the end and certainly would take the evidence that was presented and would determine whether that evidence reached the threshold of\nI'm about his age and so in other words if if there was a it looks like this particular case we had a complaint and said that there was an assault
