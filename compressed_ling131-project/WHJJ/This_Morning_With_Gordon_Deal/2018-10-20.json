with us this morning and Michael is things certainly has a lot of tentacles attached to it when it comes to well diplomatic efforts I Would say\nYeah that's certainly a big portion of this running

states needs to get the Saudis a few more days to investigate the fate of Joe ... show again but that said there were reports and then Mike Pompeo denying this morning that he had heard any alleged recording\nThat the Turks said that they do have in regards to the murder 'cause she'll get now\nA turkey is officially denying that they played any of that audio for my palm so one Turkish officials

said we do know that whatever information Pompeo shared with President Trump it's kind of change President Trump's mind on things where he had been very defensive about Saudi Arabia he's now poll treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin from the large investment conference it was going to be held by the crown prince\nAnd frankly you've got President Trump saying unless it's the miracle of all miracles happening he is acknowledging that it would seem that show was indeed dead\nAll right ... and with the latest on this particular story which seems to change by the hour by the way think Michael gotta run emigrate morning\nYeah because of the single fact and this that changed my life seven years ago when I was researching vitamin D I came across a number of studies that showed\nThat if you put on your bathing suit and go outside in the summertime for about twenty minutes you make between ten thousand and twenty thousand units of vitamin D in twenty minutes now\nThat's incredible I thought about that and I thought about that why would nature devise a system that made that much vitamin D that quickly and if you look at levels that people like lifeguards or roofers gardeners or something they're levels or fifty or sixty or Seventy\nSo that's a natural level and studies very clearly show if you want your level to be ideal your blood levels to be fifty or sixty you have to take five thousand units a day two thousand units a day we'll get your blood level up till maybe thirty two but five thousand units a day we'll get your blood level up to fifty and if you take less than that\nYou'll get some benefits of vitamin D but you will not get the full benefits\nHow do I know if I'm vitamin D deficient I mean other than there is a blood test right\nRight there is a blood test and luckily more and more doctors are ordering tests the problem with getting a blood test this first you have to get your doctor to agree to it and then your doctor has to know something about vitamin D and many of them are really too busy to read the current research right and you have to go and have the blood test on\nThere is there an easier way are their symptoms I could look for that when you tell me pat you're probably I'm not a lifeguard so chances are right and I'm not a not a roofer so probably gonna be vitamin D deficient but other symptoms I can look for yes\nNot having enough energy is a common one aches and pains that doctors can't diagnose interest only in another is your muscular skeletal system how kind of ready you feel even your performance on the athletic field will talk about that later\nHow sharp you feel mentally whether whether sometimes you're in a fog it seems like you're\nJust not thinking straight vitamin D is crucial for brain how those are the most common symptoms but it's important to understand that most people who are vitamin D deficient won't have any way of knowing it because they'd been deficient for so long they think the way they feel and the way they think and then we'll move is normal\nYeah now you've written that vitamin D deficiency is probably the single most overlooked problem we face when it comes to to our health how can you see something that's wrong I mean what what's the scope of the problem here in the U.S [noise]\nWell more and more studies are showing virtually everybody is vitamin D deficient course it all depends upon how you define that I mean if you define vitamin D deficiency as anybody less than thirty\nThen about a half of Americans are vitamin D deficient but but many people many scientists now thinking the ideal level is forty and many of us now think actually the ideal level is closer to fifty and\nIf you use the cut off the fifty than Ninety seven percent of Americans are vitamin D deficient\nLet me ask you this when when people started supplementing properly supplementing vitamin D was the product like dirty products getting that five thousand high use per day what kind of a difference they gonna knows he's going to make them feel better\n[laughter] yeah that's probably the first thing that they'll notice as an effect on their feelings of wellbeing and moved by well being I mean this feeling that\nYou know you want to live and the clues that we had a sort of interesting the clues we had to move to a very similar to the close we had for heart healthy are going to talk about that later but\nBut people who live the closer you live to the equator the better your mood the higher you live closer to the sun so the higher the altitude you look at the better your mode\nAnd mood improved in the summertime now those were clues that vitamin D was somehow involved but just recently there have been a number of studies listen to this pot and the American Journal of geriatric psychiatry they looked at hundreds of people this is what they found they found that people with the lowest vitamin D levels\nWere eleven time eleven times more likely to have a low mood and then professor Reinhold ... at the University of Toronto actually did an intervention will study where he gave about three hundred patients four thousand units of vitamin D for a year or so and what stood out was their feelings of wellbeing and ...\nAnd they can feel a difference when they start to supplement the proper lowest she takes about a month I let me let me get this special offer 'cause I'm watching the clock here purity has put together fantastic offer you got the vitamin D the recommended dosage the five thousand I use per day\nYou've also asked them to combine it with their omega
