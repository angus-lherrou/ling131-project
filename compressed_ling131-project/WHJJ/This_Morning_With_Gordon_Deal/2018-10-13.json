I've been deeply involved with tumor researchers in India and seeing all of that and with resume or a trial I've worked with scientists\nIn Europe and also in California and she'll lay in South Africa all of which are major red wine producing areas so I've had the opportunity to investigate these things in the field meet with the top scientist than my conclusion is that\nGreen tea Kirk human from to recruit and resveratrol from red wine are remarkable health financing agent that everybody can benefit from the very very substantial way\nNow of course let's talk about these big three and it's interesting that they're all found in our diet and all are considered super ...\nThe green tea human different spiritual why did you want to combine just read there's always a message to your your madness if I can see it that way because you combine these things together because they have a synergistic effect they make each other work better you know in a real game changer\nWell you know when I look at the is there actually isn't a reason path to\nPut them all in separate product they do go very well together as you said they're all food derives so it's kind of like\nYou can make a salad if you choose out of many vegetables you don't just have to have a bowl of lettuce or a bowl of cucumbers and well that's a little bit simplistic the fact is that all of these are\nVery very rich in groups of protective compounds that are both antioxidant so they actually retired the aging process of the cells in our bodies\nAnd protect our organ systems till they maintain a healthy inflammatory status in the body and this is really a big breakthrough I also like the idea that people can get a concentrated supplement of green tea extract curriculum and extracting ... Vera trial\nIn one product with truly meaningful amounts of each one and not have to go out and basically by a shopping cart full of stuff\nInto the headlines in the research especially on the green tea because it's absolutely amazing\nI nobody should they be using it for thousands of years for healthy aging but what are you seeing recently in the ... you know you told me the nutrition research journal is July twenty twelve issue revealed the green tea significantly increased\nPlasma anti oxygen activity in whole blood you'd assign you recap\nSome of these headlines and tell me why you're such a green tea advocates\nOkay what you just said about increasing plasma antioxidant activity is really critical there are many antioxidants that people consume but don't actually wind up in the body or they don't wind up in the body in any significant amount\nGreen tea antioxidants which we know are among the most highly beneficial antioxidants in the entire world are very well absorbed\nThey improve plasma antioxidant activity that is the blood concentration of antioxidants so what happens is\nYou get this great concentration of antioxidants substances which a protective compounds floating around in the body and protecting the cells\nOf your body your organs every part of your body from premature destruction due to exposure to environmental pollutants and things in the diet with regard to the whole blood glue to fire\nOn when we take in\nThe right antioxidants and not all antioxidant compounds are the right antioxidants our bodies produce more of its own super protective compound called\nGlue to ... so you've taken the green tea extract\nYou build the antioxidant activity in your blood and you also cause your body to produce this enormously beneficial very well studied very powerful protective substance called blue to thigh on so\nIt is remarkable this isn't something that most high antioxidant foods or supplement ingredients do but it does happen with a concentrated properly made green tea extract\nAll right let's switch gears and talk about this for human which is number two on your list by the way these three ingredients are all found in the new green tea combo formula really offering free bought on a few minutes but talk to me about the human which is spelled C.
