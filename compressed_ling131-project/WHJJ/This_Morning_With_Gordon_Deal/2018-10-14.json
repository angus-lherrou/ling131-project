come up when you're talking with your colleagues even if you prefer for politics to stay out of it\nAnd I thought it was interesting too I think it was um a PR group in a like New York and San Francisco and there's actually a memo that went out reminding employees that they had like a handful of free counseling sessions or something right\nThat's right this is just the company is called abatement group an ape offices in New York and San Francisco and what part of the company sent out a memo early last week just outlining the resources and benefit to the company had to deal with this uh and and what I thought was interesting that that particular company is that they set up a slacker them they'd had had to set up for the past year\nBut the flack room was called ... resistance and it was a police for workers there\nTo really engage in these conversations without talking out loud so if people want to have political conversations at work they could do it in this specific slack

was happening and this was a good form for them to do it\nOut that while we're speaking with just cut her Wall Street journal reporter he's written a piece titled the capital effect political debates shake up the work place I can imagine to some managers uno may not be versed in having to deal with politics of this type of a passion\nThat's right I think some manager said that they felt that there was just no place for politics at work I spoke with someone he's the CEO and president of a wealth management company near Philadelphia and he said that he had to tell his his small team that there really is just no place for political bickering network\nSo he's often telling them hey Mr Smith is on the phone he could take care of him he's the one who pays for salary enough talk about politics here so some have taken kind of hard line approach like that\nUm I think others are a little bit more unsure about what to do some I spoke with said for instance if they're going to see\nWhat happens this week to determine how they responded to want to see how their employees feel before they determine the next steps um but but one one executive I spoke with said that she found the best policy to be just having an open door just try and she said it's important for\nCorporate leaders to have an open open open door open ears open heart she wanted them to just listen to employees to be there if

they were having those conversations so I think it really cross gender lines across guy economic lines it was something that this was a very personal debate for a lot of people and and it of course

I have a guy about people who\nAre sensitive and started running but they take on too much and that's what happens and it's kind of accident and horrific situations where they take too much on in their body and they go to bed they become exhausted are anxious to crash and so it's really important to learn how to set back\nAnd the center yourself and realize that you're not them but your heart and go out to them but it's not healthy to take on other people's anguish\nWhat is the nature that they take on this dress\nWell it's interesting it's and I've done some research on this and they think that it's a hyperactive mirror neurons system and the mirror neurons are the\nCompassion neurons in the brain where I'm at a path to that's why it's such a an interest in another ... standing impact and thought that the mirror neurons the compassion neurons go on overdrive\nAnd when you know for instance if someone is honor the scan and in that you love and they're getting ... with a needle your mirror neurons get activated but much more show and highly empathic people\n... so how do you begin to set boundaries than if you realize that when you see something or ... something tragic in the news you know is going to affect you because you're an impasse how to begin to set those boundaries\nWell one thing I suggest all night and pass patience is to take notice fast and not become addicted to the news because if you have that constant onslaught of stress and negative news it's just too much for anyone system and people become addicted to it so just take many fast go out in nature\nUm meditate exercise ... friend and laugh so that's one tool\nBut also just notice if past traumas um trigger it for instance you know if you lost your father\nAnd you know I'm a man was lost in this current accident now you're paying about losing your father is triggers so you have to know that different now that could make a big difference to know that you know I'm dealing with this in addition to the current\nSituation [noise] um and also do a lot to nurture\nYou know do something really kind to yourself if you're you know taking on too much of what you hear in the news\nNow be able to meditate go outside um learn you know is a complete sentence with paper because then passed don't know how to set boundaries with what I call energy vampires people who are draining\nAnd so if you're not able to say no no I'm Sorry I Can't do that or no\nYou know it doesn't feel good if you're criticizing me you know whatever you have the types of energy vampires are that criticizes the blame or as you know that can make all of this worse you know you want to be around loving supportive people when you hear horrific things in the news\nYou don't want to be around energy vampires will I write about who destroying your energy\nSingle newspaper um they have all kinds of candy and snacks and cookies and um drinks you can buy 'em ear buds you can buy lottery tickets they can buy lots of different kinds of cigarettes\nA week and by hand sanitizer you can often by in times square they had all kinds of like Donald Trump magnets in NYPD I'm snow globe you name it anything but a newspaper\nWhat laws govern what can be sold are there any laws that say you can sell this or not that\nBad stands um [noise] were first coming up ... and these are just the sidewalk newsstands are governed by these laws not storefront newsstands 'em a fan's veterans city property you could only sell news and\nUm and even then it was kind of hard to make a living that way so in the sixties the said he agreed to let them sell cigarettes and then in the Nineteen seventies integrate them to let them sound like pre packaged food and\nItems that costs less than five dollars and now the console just about anything kind of food and beverage wise as long as that's packaged and any kind of like ... and a lot of his under ten dollars [laughter] they can't sell things like clothes um purses handbags because\nI think they want to keep them in his hands from competing with for front retailers for good reason [noise]\nUm and then the city does have a law that if you're going to stand you have to sell me and they actually said he told me they send out people to live forever force that last but it's a very vague law says if they have to sell newspapers magazines or periodicals and from what I've seen some new standards will\nYou know they'll offer a few newspapers in the morning and then the papers all fell out and they don't really want to devote a lot of time or well a lot of space too I'm telling the newspapers because the margins are super low and they don't sound very much I'd rather have the space in the front dedicated the candy and and sell it at ... you know much higher margins\nAre sticking with and get out of the wall Street Journal and you mentioned all those other products not competing with stories I Would think some of the stories in the area would not be too thrilled about some of the things that the new stance or selling\nA gym that you're right but this has been kind of an old tradition some of these fans have been there for you know going\nWay back ... a long time before like you know ... came in so I think even though\nUsually that the retailers olive fight tooth and nail and then in his fans come forward and say hey we want to start adding these products or this kind of thing there's kind of a lot of nostalgia in the city and a lot of action so I think the city will probably do it it can to keep them going\nUm another reason is that the newsstands officer to um [noise]\nThere is kind of billboards for advertising sales in the city makes about fifty five million a year from the company that um rents out the sides and backs of the standard for\nFor um selling advertising for the city wants to make sure that the newsstands can keep going has an interest in making sure that they all start folding they want to keep us alive to

flourish in others did simply didn't hurt the way one might have expected steep psychiatric shut the Washington Post who covers the business of entertainment says either way rival producers should be paying attention Steve how do you see it\nWell I mean the case of you know a movie star war in which you know in retrospect seems like a membrane of a big hit of course Bradley Cooper directing it directly himself as Lady Gaga did a sort of buffalo business over the weekend I think we'll continue to do that\nAnd we'll probably have a lot of success of the ... and he offers and and the road shows\nOn the line but it's interesting about the film and about the project is that uh there's really not a lot of reading with English would work I mean for one from the studios will make you got to the movies in the war movies for grown ups movies that are in about franchising superheroes for another they movie that's been made three times before\nAdmittedly last time back in the seventies but with a lot of success before\nYou lose your boat that we make a movie with didn't do well in the past because if you're going to get compared unfavorably to that earlier version and again they bumped up a little too low during the sort of convention liberate the side and um ended up ... up to ...\nYou know that was interesting an interesting point about not re making a movie that's already done well on debt that high bar right you do think you should be pick a movie that didn't do well because there's only room to grow or do it better\nWell let's ask or the last few years maybe more than a decade now that it it was just got on the remake band and we're seeing him out of course I'm television as well you know I feel this way all of us have a lot of people do is go see the thing that would come back but if if you're bringing back to class\nOr if they don't look right unless it's ... like maybe a little beep and been kind of a were were ... versions of those earlier I think mainly
