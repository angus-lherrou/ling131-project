is going to be wiped out by the Medicare part B increased yeah but you know at least as something folk so I just wanted to give you that's more of a an F. Y. segment if you will yeah\nAnd you know if you think about that two hundred and Seventy five thousand I think you said the average person will spend on those healthcare costs\nEven if you are in a more reasonable nursing home ... and it's ten thousand dollars a month and I'm only taken that number because it's easy math for me right you know what their you've seen them as high as sixteen grand a month here in Massachusetts so\nAt a hundred and twenty thousand plus per year how quickly are your assets going to be wiped out if you and your spouse\nOr go into a nursing home or you or your spouse we had we do certainly do have clients were both by the have ended up\nHere and it's it's not it's not on it but it can happen but I don't have to be the same time it could be one and then another Clinton lead to plan for both and you know what a lot of people don't do their planning in advance and maybe we can just kind of remind folks Todd that\nWhat we mean when we talk about doing advanced planning which is what's outlined in this guide in terms of timelines\nShore well if you're going to do your advanced planning it's still the five year old and it's good to bring that up occasionally because I'm Still getting people out there who will tell me oh I heard it's going to be seven I I heard it's going to be ten yeah\nYou know I haven't heard that lately folks I Know there was a bill many years ago where they propose that I'm pretty sure it's dead in committee and I'm not trying to scare people but five years is still five years mhm and and I would hurry I Would get my ball rolling\nWhat we're talking about putting in the ...\nTrust when we talk about funding the trust I mean your your primary residence as a no brainer but their assets that can't be protected right in the ...\nThat's true and so what you're not going to put in these trust would be things like IRAs four oh one case\nAny kind of a retirement account that requires minimum distributions to come out or that is not taxed yet ... and the reason is you can't put them in because if you reach in to pull them out\nYou have an income taxable event ... so you're not going to take five hundred thousand dollars out of your I run put it in a trust and give the government forty percent right you just won't do it so that's money you live on first\nAnd that you spend down for us because that money is going to be continued to be at risk and expensive\nTo live on it that's why it's there that's why you saved it put the other assets in the real estate the vacation home the rental property your taxable investment accounts put those in the trust and and I think that's important in in um are these the kinds of things that we we talk about right not just how to crawl around his\nStuff is in the guy but I don't really find your options how to fund the trust what type of assets go in there what type of acids don't go in there you know there is there's a whole there's a couple of pages

Love ... I like for months pretty this time of year for sure\nIn fact of the Seventeen election years twelve of them ended with a positive stock market return you're taking this a bit further mid term elections seem to be a positive indicator for the stock market over the next three quarters the nine months stretch from October before mid term election in June after the election is produced average returns of twenty point four percent of the doubt\nAnd Twenty one point one percent for the S. and P. five hundred that goes straight back to Nineteen forty nine so we all know the past performance can be used to predict future results but I Would pump the brakes if you associate October with only negative market returns produce history does tell us otherwise\nThanks like folks if you have questions about the markets the economy or your portfolio please visit us that Armstrong advisory group dot com\nYou've been listening to Wall Street we can review with Michael Armstrong no back to the legal exchange with ... and Susan ... hours\nTo the legal exchange and it's time for us when we're done we'll answer your questions about anything and everything that's included in the estate blaming the once again here's a lesbian Susan followers\nTo I have a few questions from listeners for you first question comes from David in Framingham mass in David writes my father has been in in ... in a nursing home in on Medicaid for the past year and I'd been maintaining his home by paying the taxes utilities and maintenance swimming houses in his name\nAnd dad's name I guess last pay ya I don't want to do anything to jeopardize his Medicaid eligibility but I cannot afford to keep doing this in the house is worth around five hundred thousand what am I options\n[noise] wow [noise] that's a that's a nice size house I'm well here you go folks let's let's explain let's delve into this a question a little deeper\nAh first of all you know the the first thing that comes to my mind is you know how did that get eligible for Medicaid when he has a house right\nRemember folks own past shows we have spoken about how a home is a non accountable asset as long as is located in math and you're single and check the box that I intend to return home\nAnd it's under eight hundred and fifty roughly eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars of assets of value mhm he's there so folks that's a message to all of us to how he's on Medicaid even though he has this home so for all of you who have not done planning\nA that is at least a way of still getting on Medicaid so I I\nI get that he's also absolutely right that have as a single person\nSomebody's got to pay the maintenance and upkeep of that house right keep the heat on well that's the kids mhm all kids I I don't know what your financial options are but let me give you a little motivate motivate motivation here and that would be\nIf she passes away\nAnd you get the house you're gonna have a five hundred thousand dollar home with no mortgage right and with a step up and basis so you could actually sell this for five hundred thousand dollars in have zero\nZero capital gains tax and zero estate tax ... federal and state so it is a big win right even if I had to get a mortgage now or a home equity line of credit just to pay a little bit so sometimes you need to understand that I can take out a he lock on my own home get a tax deduction\nAnd use this money in and set it in a in a bucket just to make these you know what does it cost to maintain that house ten grand a year I don't know\nBetween taxes depending on where it is yeah taxes and keep the tail and he's on and so that's probably high so so that's one option that is one mortgage out on his own home so that he can pay\nYeah the ... the only other option and that's the one I'm leaning towards the only other option here folks would be to sell the house which you absolutely can do and if you sell the house or you could\nYou could take the money or probably get there might be attacked from a vacation number one cause if you sell it and dad gets a two hundred and fifty thousand dollar capital gains exclusion there might be more than two hundred and fifty thousand of gain built into the house right so you might have a capital gains tax liability don't know how to run those numbers\nSaid even at that though Todd now dad's got a big bucket calf\nShe's going to be booted off Medicaid unless they can either by a medicated knew what are your throat into a pool trust mhm so not a great option right Alan keep it\nHow else could you keep it you could rent it okay so if you rent it out now you'll have the money you need\nTo pay the bills because while that will be rental income for dad yeah income is treated differently than an asset so renting it is not going to cause him to come off Medicaid\nAnd let's say you rent it you get to use the rent dad gets to use the rent to pay all the bills and only the excess rent\nWould end up going to the nursing home and you don't care because that somebody else's money right and now the child the child's ability to borrow or pay for this property\nIs gone mhm it will be maintained especially with no debt right you know it will be maintained by the rent mhm you would definitely be able to generate enough rent\nTo maintain the property with access rent going to the nursing home to pay a bill\nAnd that will help to reduce the amount of the leaned it's been placed on that home 'cause it's he's qualify for Medicaid so that will help you in the end as well so\nGood point Susan what Susan's talking about there is that even though this house for a single person is non accountable\nIs Lena bull ... so that means whatever amount of money the state is paying\nOn behalf of dad in this case is a lean on the house and so if we have Social Security of two thousand going to the nursing home\nAnd now we can pick up a thousand a month extra on the rent yeah the net rent mhm now there's three thousand dollars a month going so the amount the state is paying drops from four to three right and so the lean is less I say four to three because full pay on Medicaid is about six\nMhm so that's a great that's a ... I mean what I Would do or here or rent it David\nSo rent that out by the way to guys folks if you would like to not have to worry about this last minute ... that you have to do with your assets you're planning in advance\nTodd has written a guide for all of you it's designing an income on your income only ... trust and it is the type of trust you need if you want to protect those assets from those long term care expenses\nGet your free copy right now by calling eight six six eight for eight five six nine nine that's eight six six\nEight for eight five six nine nine or visit our website legal exchange showed dot com or you can download your free copy Todd our last question comes from Brian in ... with math and Brian writes my father died in a nursing home and twenty Seventeen while receiving medicate mistake contacts\nMe with a bill for his nursing home care can they make me pay the bill he gave me is home seven years before he went into a nursing home and only held the life a state other than that he didn't own anything the bill was around sixty five thousand do I need to pay this\nYou know this is a great question and folks what they're driving at here and what\nBrian is sort of bringing to the forefront is\nThis thing called a state recovery mhm right ... we just talked about how they could have been a lean on a person's house right and when he died the state would say okay kids you're going to get a bill for what we paid on behalf of\nThe person who was in the nursing home that being said they're going to say you need to pay us because we have a lean on your dad's house because dad in that previous example owned it in his name\nAgain d'alene was a friend that was still way less than it would be do and you got to keep the house um so you know take out a mortgage and pay it or sell it and pay it either way a note taxable event\nIn this case this was the same thing so she had been in a nursing home and they'd been paying and now they're looking to say is there anything available for a state recovery to reimburse the state for the money paid on behalf of a of data in this case [noise]\nDancer the good news is in Massachusetts the answer looks like it's going to be no they no meaning there's no assets available for state recovery and no Brian they can't make you pay it ... you are not personally liable for that debt\nNow why in Massachusetts they can only recover from the probate estate knock the gross estate so what that means is\nOnly assets dad died owning in his own name with no beneficiary designation\nPeriod well in this case it appears that that only had a life a state in a house which means ... years ago he had given the house to the kids and reserved a life a state\n[noise] well\nThe life a state expires\nOn death mhm and like magic it avoids probate and the kids are automatically one hundred percent owners was a step up and basis and it was protected from the nursing home so while there was a lifetime lean on the property", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Legal Exchange", "city": "Providence", "day": "06"}
