Massachusetts state line will be ineffective so six AM on Monday the state department of transportation says the changes are necessary to continue to most parts of these structurally deficient Horton farm bridge\nDo them as a matter of course right we look at the clients assets that type of assets the dollar value of the assets the age of the client and the family dynamics of the clients and all of that factors into whether or not\nThe recommendation of an irrevocably trust might be there\nBecause I Know when you sit down people Todd you go through all of their objectives my NF nursing home planning and protection isn't one of them you don't discuss the Gulf will try\nAnd I think you're right Susan when you said they're object 'cause I I use the word recommendation and and we don't really tell people whether they should protect us from nursing right they need to decide if that's important to them so I went through this with this particular client and they did seem to want to protect us from the nursing home\nWhen I looked at the numbers they were worth about six million mhm not never mind the six million isn't worth putting me off four point five million of it was in an Ira wow I said\nI Can't do Medicaid planning for you was for a million dollars in an IRA ... and I explained to them\nI even if you wanted to protect the other two property such\nA hat and some others money which we could do you'll never be eligible for Medicaid mhm because of the Ira ... and even if I was to try to do the Ira last minute planning which is the only thing we can do for IRAs and we've explained that on the show we can do last minute planning for an Ira\nBut in this case it was his and if he got sick and went in the nursing home in order for me to a movie Ira permissible early to the healthy spouse\nI'd have to cash it out oh and think about that tax bill if for millions island point four million I ran over as I said there's no way we're going to write a check for one point four million just so I can get you his Ira start paying the nursing home because even if he lives three years at fourteen thousand a pop it's like four fifty\nYeah I Can't stomach one point four million in tax and you know and then can you imagine if you made the transfer thinking he's going to live a while and six months later he has some catastrophic something happens in the nursing home and he dies right now you spent one point four million in taxes when you would not have needed to do that\nRight and that money coming out of the IRA although normally it's taxable completely when you take that money out of the IRA in this case if their private private pay with IRA money tax benefit\nAs right Susan you'll get adoption for the uh for the money you're using just spend on the nursing home so you're actually bleeding it out almost not quite tax free but now it's about yeah get a bit deduction\nFor your ah medical expense so yes I think we educate we don't advocate one over the other it's very important that you come in and see where you're at\nSo we know that you can't put those IRA acids whether it's traditional area\nRoth IRA although you don't have the tax implication of Iraq I re but anything that's still in that IRA rapper\nCannot go into that tries not not in advance know what else would you put into the trust while you're going through this process for someone who is in heavy on the IRA side they decide they want to do their evoke about transplanting what kind of assets would you actually transfer into that this\nThis well when now let's go to someone who who's more of the everyday client right you you got three million unless you're likely to be there's really no question you you'll probably concerned about nursing home care right and so now you've got that vacation home your primary residence those are two usually big assets that people want to protect\nThey can go in and write and usually they're there's also maybe an investment portfolio\nThey would want to put some of that and that can go in ... not the Ira but the taxable investment portfolio or even a or even a rental property 'cause remember when you put the rental property and you still get the right to the income right so it's still yours you haven't given it away in that regard and so yeah they can put the rental property in\nAnd and get that protected so\nPretty much anything you want to protect others and the Iraq and put in which\nIs great so you you have that flexibility get that clock start and you know what it's it's really about education this whole process tied everything that we do on this show is to educate people even if it's when they go and sit down with someone else another attorney to get their ... their documents drafted\nIn the back of their mind they can be thinking\nHuh I don't think that's what Todd said oh no we're able to do so we know that there's a lot of bad legal advice out there yet and lay and I think\nPart of the reason we this this than we do this article this way is it it does provide you with some of that information about how to begin\nThe process how to decide what belongs in what doesn't belong in things like that\nSo ... and how to to know when to do it right I had a forty nine year old couple come in now they got young kids miners you know this is not yeah not ready for that yet you need to do regular estate planning and they did need to do it you know and and I'm certain that they will but ah but\nSo yeah it's not it's not for everybody but if you're gonna do it you really need to understand how to draft a document you

you a nice foundation of education if you're thinking about starting the process of creating your trust\nTime now for Wall Street we can move you look back at the markets performance last week here's Susan Powers and Michael Armstrong\nMy currently interest rates are on the rise in in the past three weeks alone the ten year treasury has jumped from two point nine nine percent to three point to three percent now we've kind of settled back down around three point one five percent do you think this is a sign for investors to pull out of the stock market\nYou know you're right in the streets are on the rise but it's really not being out of the norm or yoga three two three is actually below historical average for the ten year treasury but you know thanks to a decade a very low interest rates following the Oneida financial crisis the economy has become accustomed to these low rates which is why we saw the large sell off in\nThe stock market the last couple of weeks contrary to popular belief stocks don't always fall when interest rates rise rates typically rising the economy's strong which is also the main driver of equity returns according to parents have been\nFifteen periods in the past sixty five years when rates have risen in stocks have gained with average gains reaching twelve and a half percent and there are only been three instances and those rising rate environments when stocks have actually fallen\nSo what sector is can we invest in that could actually benefit from a rising interest rate environment\nWell I mean one sector that benefits typically from rising and straight as financial or banks make money by you know buying deposits cheaply and then selling them for higher prices while higher interest rates will force them to pay more for deposits interest rates on savings accounts and other consumer products typically rise much slower\nThan interest rates on loans you know the average rate on a one year CD for instance climbed from point to seven to point seven eight and started sixteen whereas the home equity line of credit rate went from four six nine six point one nine percent\nThanks my folks if you have questions about the market about the economy or about your portfolio please visit us it Armstrong advisory group dot com\nYou've been listening to Wall Street we can review with Michael Armstrong no back to the legal exchange with time ... and Susan ... hours\nListening to the legal exchange and it's done for us when we're done we'll answer your questions about anything and everything but because they blaming the once again here's Doug loves the Susan\nKind of a few questions from listeners for you\nFirst question comes from Bob in Boston mass imbibe rights I'm interested in protecting my sons inherited his inheritance from creditors however if he remains married and then ... says his wife\nHow can I include her and my plan so that she would receive something after he dies but keep the majority of the assets interest from my grandkids so he wants to include the daughter in law and his plan\nThis is very strange [laughter] well um I I said I don't think it really feels the same way yeah [laughter] but\nYou know I mean I I Do understand it you know ... you think\nYou know that you want to you know you you love your in laws and and even though you're really only think your love your in laws are but it\nAnd you want to try to take care of and it's kind of hard to have your cake and eat it too though [laughter] so what I Would what I Would think you would have to do is you would just have to say that you know upon I think in in the trust Bob you create you would say upon my death\nYou know if my\nSon is married ... make sure they're married on the day of death right so if my son is married to acts on the date of death then I Want to carve out you know\nA percentage some percentage to mhm her just give it to her you know a little piece and even even if the sun's living 'cause they'll share together mhm right if if\nIf it's something you want her to have yeah and you ... and since you want her to have it you really don't care about it being\n... the divorce comes or not you don't care 'cause you're giving it to her then then then give it to her and then her and even if the sun's living they can enjoy it together yeah\nI just I get a divorce or whatever you gave to your daughter in law would be subject to the divorce which means your son would get half\nAnd she would get half so it's not horrific ... as long as you put a percentage on the amount you want to go to her\nAnd then you say the balance of the assets so say I carve out ten percent of my state mhm I Want you know ten maybe even five percent I Want five percent of my assets are and and maybe you would have unlimited you might not want real estate to get involved here so you might say I want five percent of my non\nA real estate trust assets yeah\nTo go to a share for the benefit of my uh daughter in law provided she is married to my son on the date of my death ...\nUh and that share can be paid out directly to her again\n... if they're married in son's living than they have it together so it's kinda like gave it to your son right no different than if you paid it out to your Sunday would share it yep same idea okay so that's off the table then the balance of the trust assets Ninety five percent of what's left ... would be held in this\nTrust\nDesigned for future creditor protection divorces and bloodline planning down to the grand kids which is what he's asking about here so I think Bob you're gonna have to get the lawyer to get some creative drafting\n[noise] but I have yet to come across the situation that we could not accomplish one way or another you just have to understand the pros and cons of doing it\nI Would not want to put it all in the divorce proof language trust where it's supposed to pay out in the trustees discretion for the don't or or for the children and the grandchildren and the spouse of the\nSun to me that just smells really bad mhm I mean if the divorce comes later and\nShe says her attorney takes a look at that language right and she says you know I'd like half of what's in that trust that Bob put together yup right and\nBob says well it's not mine or ours we always have to ask the disinterested trust the for the distribution I suppose the disinterested trustee could say no even though it's\nRight for ... but but\nCause it's for one of the beneficiaries the right dose right I just don't I don't like it I don't like how it feels\nI Would think that he could then are you to say wait a minute she\nNPR both beneficiaries of this divorce prove bucket this kind of who's so yeah I get that plane\nYeah but I still think that to disinterested trust the ultimately could say no I don't have to give it to anybody if I don't want to rent and and it would probably work out but if it were me I cut to make him lean I'd cut it off I'd say you know what\nWhatever piece you want her to have give it to her and put the rest in the divorce proof crushed for children grandchildren spouses are out okay\nGood advice there folks Todd has put a lot of good advice in writing for you with his guide designing an income only ... trust he has written this guide for the month of October ... gives you a great foundation of knowledge when you were starting out in the process of having your trust drafted a clue that's\nThe important information that must be in your trust in sixteen troublesome provisions that absolutely should not be in your trust\nYou can request you're free copy\nOf Todd's designing your ... trust guide right now by calling eight six six eight for eight five six nine nine that's eight six six eight for eight five six nine nine or download your free copy on our website legal exchange show\nDot com taught our last question comes from Janice in Milton massing Janice writes I Am I on the power of attorney and she is now in a nursing home we are private paying at twelve thousand dollars per month\nShe only has a home and we're in the process of selling it because I can no longer maintain it and I'm not in a position to be able to rent it is there anything that can be done last minute to protect the two hundred and fifty thousand that we will receiving proceeds from the sale of the house [noise]\nYeah that's too bad I'm I'm going to spend just a few minutes on the part that they said they can't do and and really explore that you know I Know clients say they can't rent it or you know they're not in a position I mean to me\nRent it you're always better off keeping the house\nI think mhm than selling it\nIn a house ... especially a primary residence when you're dealing with last minute planning techniques\n... a primary residence is non ... just because of what it is mhm so I don't have to do anything fancy ... accountable I get it for a single person like in this case\nThey'll put a lean on it yep but at least for beyond the Medicaid rate versus the private pay rate much slower much lower than private pain we won't be a twelve thousand will be at six thousand a month so so keeping it as always in your best interest\nUh and and even if you don't rent it\n'cause they said they're not in a position to rent it if it's the primary residence just keeping it ... ... you don't have to rent\nThe downside would not renting it is someone's got to pay the heat the electric to taxes maintain it and the kids might not want to do that ... although I still think it's a home run to do that [noise]", "year":
