can submit your questions\nAre tied to answer on the air and hopefully his answer will stop you from being one of his next real life stories\nTodd when we talk about funding the trust or talk about actually\nTransferring the ownership and transferring the assets into the name of your ... great great question which is feels kind of life for a lot of people giving your assets away so if you were to give your assets away whether it's to another person or an area vocal trust do you have to pay gift tax when that happens\nSo ... is the first question if you're given outright to the kids\nIs that what you're asking if you give it outright or if I give us to want to know it all so if we give it to the children and we want to compare the two giving it to the children will in fact result in a completed gift for gift tax purposes and so yes\nYou would have to fill out forms seven or ... or ... do the same time your income tax return is do every year or so in April\nAnd the seven o nine would be acknowledging that you made let's say a hundred thousand dollar gift to the kids of a portfolio or five hundred thousand dollar home if you gave away your home\nYou know less the Fifteen thousand dollar president interest exclusion that you're allowed to give away so that's the freebie gift that the freebie trial anything don't even need to file if that's all you were giving away but because this gift exceeded that amount\nYou would file it reduced by the amount of the president interest exclusion the Fifteen thousand dollar freebie\nThe amount over that would be considered\nThe taxable gift and so if it was you know a hundred thousand dollars minus the Fifteen you have an eighty five thousand dollar taxable gift\nDoesn't mean you're going to pay taxes because you are going to eat into your eleven million one hundred and eighty thousand dollar once in a lifetime gift tax exemption ... by the eighty five grand\nThat doesn't hurt as much but in Massachusetts and depending on your state even though there's no state a state tax ...\nI'm Sorry no state gift tax yeah you do have to redo shore estate tax exemption\nSo if you only had a million dollar exemption you ate into it by eighty five thousand dollars well now you are under a million and if you gave away a five hundred thousand dollar home let's make it a real gift right you now have five hundred thousand dollars left of your exemption not helpful yeah they taxes\nAnd a lot of people don't realize when they say oh I don't need the attorney I'm just going to put the house in my kid's name\nThat's a gift that's a gift and we're not even talking about all the other negatives and loss of control and things that go with putting the house in the kid's name ... but a forgetting that you're right it's a gift\nAnd it's a taxable gift and it really does impact the estate tax calculation going forward right for the person who made the gift not the recipient mhm the recipients folks has no income tax or gift tax liability OK okay ... go\nAhead and how does that all differ if you transfer assets into a trust you still need to do that same tax form the form seven and nine and so forth\nYou know and that's a beautiful thing about these irrevocably trust everybody says things are so you know rigid inflexible and scary scary word that area's ... I've given it away and all this\nI tell people right in the beginning when you set up these irrevocably trust they are in complete gifts for gift tax purposes you are not giving anything to the children mhm you are not giving anything to the trustee\nYou are simply putting it in the trust the trust what on it\nBut for gift tax purposes it's an incomplete gift because you as the creator of the trust have retained and you've heard of spoke speak about this before\nA limited power of appointment which means you have the right as the donor or to a point the assets to charity mhm\nWell because you could appoint him to charity\nAll during your life we don't really know who's a gift would have been made to right that's what makes it an incomplete gift it can change your mind you can change your mind so therefore no seven or nine gift tax return really needs to be filed and there is no gift tax liability\nAnd not only that but there are benefits to giving your assets that transferring your assets into an area vocal trust\nVersus just giving kids from a capital gains tax sure active so you you may be unnecessarily creating a tax for your kids were none what exists that's exactly what I just kept it in your trust or even in your own name that you're doing that from a tax perspective\nAnd and also the creditor issue yeah or you don't own it anymore I mean this is a whenever I ... tell me well why don't we just put it in their name I'm like I won't do it yeah you need another lawyer because I'm not going to have my client give up the ownership rights to their home\nThey need to feel comfortable that they can live there the rest of their life they need to feel comfortable they can sell and downsizing and yet to another state and and not be impacted by adverse gift or capital gains tax consequences we\nDon't like it pay in taxes let alone unnecessary taxes folks if you have been thinking about creating an eerie vocal trust but you're really not sure where to start start by educating yourself because Todd's guy that is written\nFor the month of October it's designing in income only ... trust and it's a great resource for you to see what should an absolutely should not be included in your trust as well as how these trust operate on a day to day basis\nCall right now to request your copy of Todd's designing your ear evoke about trust guide eight six six eight for eight five six nine nine at your last chance to do so eight six six eight for eight\nFive six nine nine visit our website legal exchange show dot com you can download your guy there you can download our podcast and you can submit your questions for Todd to answer on the air\nYou're listening to Todd ... apart and it was a law firm of Cushing Indonesian I'm Susan Powers a financial advisor with the Armstrong advisory group and we'll be back again and just a few minutes on the legal exchange with ...\nSecurities offered through security is America ink number ... ... s IPC an advisory services offered through security is America advisor think security is America and its representatives did not provide legal advice therefore it is important to consult with your legal advisor regarding your specific situation because you can do in the Armstrong advisory group the legal exchange and the securities market companies are not affiliated\nTitus was very Armstrong amazingly over twenty percent of Americans have said nothing for\nTheir retirement can you imagine you're sixty five and you haven't saved a nickel hopefully none of you listening today or in that boat but whatever you save for retirement I'd like to help you devise a strategy that will allow you to enjoy your later years my new guide out this month will help you learn strategies to help manage your portfolio and protected\nSo that when it's time for you to retire your assets\nCan be there to work for you retirees have to worry about a lot of things will your money last kind of cover your expenses if you don't know the answers to these questions called me right now at eight hundred three nine three four zero zero one request a\nCopy of this brand new guide how to develop a retirement income strategy that's eight hundred three nine three four zero zero one or download it right now on our website Armstrong advisory dot com\nSecurities offered the securities America incorporated remember ... ...

can move you look back at the markets performance last week here's Susan Powers and Michael Armstrong make\nThe American jobless rate is that the lowest level since Nineteen sixty nine in the unemployment rate is at all time low those do you think the labor market has reached unsustainable levels at this point\nI mean the labor market is just like all other markets you know when employees are readily available employers can pay less for workers and when\nUnemployment is low like today employers are forced to compete for workers often through wage increases when workers becomes scarce employers have to attract workers with wage increases and benefits and while there is an upper limit to the number of people that can have jobs without ruining it for everyone else there's still significant room for growth\nFor those looking to be fully employed despite this low unemployment rate you know one indicator of this is the inflation adjusted compensation per hour\nWhich has only grown by four percent since two thousand seven you know in addition average hourly earnings and dollars has been very little gross suggesting that inflation is not yet a threat to the labor market\nSo when you say that there's still room to grow for those looking to be fully employed what do you mean by that Mike\nWhat what I mean is that there's a large group of people who are under employed these are people that have part time jobs but would probably work more if they could find reasonable paying jobs are looking at Americans age thirty five to forty four who are\nYou know a group of workers most likely to be employed you can see that there are still significantly less likely to be employed than they were back in two thousand seven to eight Nineteen nineties or even the late eighties\nSo according to ... about three percent of American part-time want to work fulltime but and that's comparable to the weak job market to the early to thousands which is another sign away remark is actually not over here to\nThings make folks if you have any questions about your portfolio or the economy visit us said Armstrong advisory group dot com\nYou've been listening to Wall Street weaken review with Michael Armstrong no back to the legal exchange with time ... and Susan ... hours\nListening to the legal exchange and it's time for this segment where we'll answer your questions about anything and everything that included in the planning process once again here's Doug loves the Susan ...\nA few questions similar cares for you first question comes from Linda in lake worth Florida and Linda writes I Am widowed and have two children my daughter's financially well off but my son is not and he recently moved in with me is there a way that I can make sure that he's able to continue living in my home if I pass away\nWell I think the question that's missing here Linda is do you also mind if you just inherit your other child ... shouldn't say that in this question I'm going to assume the way she's phrased is that\nShe doesn't want to just inherited her daughter I Would assume so she just wants to make sure that the son\nWho doesn't have a place to live it sounds like the daughter does right or can can live in the house so let's make some assumptions so let's assume we don't want to just inherit anybody 'cause most people don't\nAnd let's expand this a little bit because I see a lot of problems here in addition to this one you talk about are irrevocably trust Susan it is I think is one of the most important things to mention a and I know we're discussing it in the material\nThe ability to change your mind yeah right if this had been given away to the kids\nAnd reserved a life a state and that's all and now later on when she wanted to just take care of the sun\nNot not as guaranteed you can't do it because the daughter has half mhm you even though you have a life estate you've you've lost the ability to rethink how you want that remained her interest to go\nUnless you get kids permission so not as good a ... a way to do with the Iraq a couple trust if it was in there\nAnd can you do it I'm going to assume yes we need a trust even if she doesn't have one ... so if we take this house instead of doing a life a state Linda we put it into an Iraq a couple of trust one just like we're talking about in our materials then\nWhat can be done well then once it's in their ... Linda would be able to call let's say I was the draft her she would call me and say you know Todd I we did this trust and you know two thousand six and\nNow my son has fallen on hard times and I need him to have a place to live the rest of my life can we fix it\nYes we can fix it and the trust that we don't need to talk to the children at all we can simply name uh exercise the power of appointment in the document allowing her to adjust how she leaves the assets to our children\nSo now that we know the flexibility exists to do this in an era of a couple of trust even for all of you folks who might have done one years ago\nFor Linda it looks like she hasn't done any planning so we will create the trust now and we will put this house in it and we can set it up this way from the get go\nThe language and the trust which say upon my death I divided allocate everything equally to the children\nHowever with regard to the property located at X Y Z street mhm that needs to be held in trust for the benefit of my son put the name and\nAnd the language in there should go on to say that my son can continue to live there the rest of his life but to put some teeth in it that says provided he pays all of the bills real estate taxes up jeep maintenance et cetera\nWhy because one there may be no money in the trust\nTo do that right and then what the house gets sold or by the real estate tax people put a lean on the house and force the sale you don't know ... right so you need money to maintain the least he can do is maintain it\nPlus the rest of the assets might have been divided equally to the kids and maybe you wanted them paid out so maybe the daughter\nGot her piece mhm and the son got his peace well then use that money son to pay the bills\nAnd you'd be looking at an ear evoke will trust in this case because we want to make sure that houses there for the sons we had to protect that\nThat's exactly right okay planning that would be done here would be an irreversible trust so that the nursing home can't take it in case Linda\nFalls into one before she passes remember we still want to protect Linda ... is all about Linda first and then the children but this would give you that ability to do that so and if and if she if he doesn't pay all the bills than the house can be sold\nAnd the money simply amongst the children's so we've got to send her to the Donner\nInland and if you or any folks listening are interested in finding out how these very vocal about trust operate on a day to day basis great place to start is with education and Todd's guide that he's written\nFor the month of October it's designing ... trust this guy will show you exactly how they operate it will also including information about the drafting of your trust in information that\nAbsolutely must be in there and all those problematic clauses that absolutely must not be included in your trust you can call right now do it soon because it's your last chance folks because the month is over\nEight six six eight for eight five six nine nine minutes eight six six eight for eight five six nine nine or\nDownload your free copy on our website leader exchange show dot com\nTodd our last question comes from bill in ... burn math in bill writes my wife has MS and has very little assets in her own name years ago when she was first diagnosed I transferred the home\nOut of her name and put it in just mining my question is about my IRA that's worth around eight hundred thousand should I changed my primary beneficiary to my kids just in case I die before her she would like the likely have to live in a nursing home if I pass away before [laughter]\nThis is a very interesting question and and it reminds me of some other real life stories and and\nYou know the the idea of planning through short cuts\nIs not always good planning or trying to do it in a you know a quick manner or some kind of a cheaper approach I don't I don't think it always is the best and so when I look at this and I say OK I understand that\nMy my wife has MS we don't know from this what stages she's putting the house and your name now really doesn't do anything you could put the house and your name last minute if she goes in the nursing home putting it in your name now I guess of I'm not even sure why you would do it it doesn't help\nAt all because you can always do it last minute right and again I Would imagine that since she has MS that you guys would at least have powers of attorney in place now so that you could start signing her name and paying bills in ... transferring real estate in case she does go into a facility\nBut more importantly the fact that you've got and that that that your wife has MS\nShould be saying never mind my house and my other non IRA money", "show_name": "The Legal Exchange", "year": "2018", "city": "Providence", "day": "27"}
