a report called the producer price index that came out early yesterday morning good showed inflation was heating up more than economists had expected and so the concern there is that in a situation like that that the fed is going to have to raise rates more rapidly than they expected\nAnd then as a result the economy ends up slowing because ended up becoming more expensive to bar we saw something similar back in February if you remember\nWe've got a really good jobs report for the month of January the following Monday right after the super bowl that was all over seven hundred and

didn't\nThis could be a short term fit that the market throws over the next two to three months very similar to what we saw in the spring because I don't think that this issue is going away and simply disappearing overnight\nBut I also don't think there's anything that is structurally fundamentally wrong in the U.S economy that would lead to this may be in a bigger and longer downturn at this

is a very solid prompts seven I really like their their defensive front uh they've got active guy's strong guys are paying their place during the well with their hands and been able to go and be very disruptive up front\nOr their line backers or you know really good sized guys they bliss and quite a bit [noise] um\nAnd you know you look in their back and you know they've got a couple of quarters is to keep pretty good so I you know again I you know you look at everybody respect all opponents were you know our guys are jacked up to go play\nWe've they've got some concerns defensively for us and you have any time you call your defense the black hole I guess that you know this is what they are all about and that they're kind of their their trademark could\nBe a very interesting match up I'm really excited to see our guys are fencing match up versus ... in our kids have practice very well I'm really looking forward to challenge\nCanada the first weekend of football or see a award was just getting in a sterling Sheffield over the co was defensive players of the week and both of them have had very good years they'll be Mack is just had a spectacular year\nFor doll and you look at Makin Sheffield that may be the two best defensive players so far and the CIA Sheffield number eleven and tackles number one in ... in the morning CFLs get six and a half Saxon nine CFLs you'd number one for stumbles as well but the Mac is\nThirty six and tackles he's up in the defense ally to force a I got twenty tackled but number two and ... just a half a sack behind Sheffield and they're tied Annette TSLs both at number one was nine of those you get to the best offenders that that the CIA has to offer right now\nI think that's right starting to go to go to meet him at media day uh you know we talk to him and recruiting\nYou know there are different position will will you know when you when you ran determined sacks them to go for linebackers cause more than likely you're you're ... you know we'll go to be able to come off the ball each and every snap and you know it's a little bit different flavor our we get the productivity but as you mentioned they're both you know outstanding football players\nYou know [noise] as every football game is going to be a question of what's better team out there and that's when you know we talk to our kids about we've got to go in and play as a mature group with great confidence in play fundamental in all areas and ah you know just when one step at a time till sixty sixty minutes is off the clock and see who's left standing\nAround with the forty eight helping went against brown while Maine was beating Villanova Thirteen to ten at Maine three three at the hat on\nYou mentioned the or the struggling on the fence aside ten ten after three quarters and ended up being a fifty two he'll he'll go ... who is the uh special teams play or the week for that long and at that point was thirty eight and his career and he it's a fifty two yard or to send everybody homeless time\nExpired that's a pretty cool stopped so so they want to a defense and and you want to defense and often just past weekend against Brown University so just to get together as a what's going to be a great match up coach the governors cup\nEvery year is important is here along with it you're vying for position and the CIA for a playoff possibilities and also for lead title as you keep going up to an hour right now so it goes hand in hand\nWith that cut but I Know it's still very important to have it in Kingston were resides right now we're stuck up or as we speak right now and then end up ... I asked is at your house\nIs that they're the travels of the cup you know at the end of the game I don't know if you saw as we were kind of chase them around and couldn't find out where it was oh okay no I guess certain round there's any dirt go then all of a sudden there's the governor so we picked up the cup tacos you out later that it made its way into the locker room\nThe end of the time I go finish up but I had to do and going out and see people yeah\nI turned to my wife about nine o'clock and I wonder where the cup and it's [noise]\nDonny Smith one of my ripping through the door nine to five years ago you know and so we had the cup and home brought it in in the morning I walked in the office it was gone again but I think they were putting the black on there which is good reason the policy it up and then put the score on their\nSin save heads with Donny oh that is absolutely right and that made it it's just so the appropriate ways that really thought the kids might have been\nOf the town you know with this thing but uh it was a it's a special game you know we can't take the governor enough I think she's done an outstanding job you'll recognize the importance of that game a week you know we're very appreciative of that kind of recognition\nAnd you know just however there are first year two thousand fourteen I recognize it was the governors cup but I saw no governor yeah right exactly that she's taken off because she's been in each and every one and\nThen I think that as our governor she is are probably very down deep are very strong Rhode Island fan I think she was very proud of the voice last week I very\nMature for after you adjusted her alma mater Harvard the weekend\nHe got to take the good with the fat but it's a I think she's she's been very supportive and heart\nForced she's great we uh we appreciate all her her support interest in the rivalry that makes it that makes us something really special coach before we get to veto a joy on an update which ... as far as his ability to come back\nBut he's going to be back is just you know again it's gonna be the same does answer day to day yeah yeah you know these things take some time you know he's you know moving around and\nYou know there's always the possibility we could pop 'em out there on Saturday and I'm going to keep that secret for everybody has to continue to prepare for him but he's getting better and his attitude is tremendous and he's been a\nOh he's one of our captains and he's still leading from the sidelines and and what he's getting up there and our kids are anxious to get them back but uh [noise]\nYou know for your time will tell and it'll be a day to day operations until we get them their\nVeto pre already unbelievable do you watch them at the end of the Harvard game any kind of manage the team and and did some good things and I and also other ... will shorten the\nWay the game close but you know he he stood up there for you and then he goes back the next weekend and you know I expected to be him to be better I expect them to do what he did man Nineteen or twenty five three hundred and ten yards four touchdown passes [noise] ah we get our current culture where the Sikhs have grabbed one of those are\nJust a just an amazing performance by a kid and a very very high pressure situation\nSo it's not surprising to us now staff from Emile de Vito no unknown to everybody else is that he was really in the competition for the starting job two years ago and\nYou know and he came in and then he was a partial scholarship guy that you know continue to just keep driving we've left there's veto dropping dimes I may just dropped the ball right where it needs to be a test to get rid get rid of its these the defense very well truly smart player [noise]\nUh and so it wasn't a surprise us when you go back and study that Harvard game you can stay out of his struggles but I mean the bottom line is that you know he missed what do you over through one really touchdown pass to Kyrie and you also through the other one down which we thought you know really should've been\nCompeted porn and broken up as a possibility so those were the two of\nErrors that we saw a drop in in that game so I mean it was he wasn't as bad as everybody thought it was so when he came in and out a full week or practice or we all had extreme competed semi I think the players do are no the coach is two\nAnd a kid came out and lifted up and that's what that's what people are supposed to do when you test a football team football program you're not going to be healthy all the way through you always hope it's not going to be a trigger guy but Vito stepped up to the plate\nKnocked it out and we saw Tyler Harris get in there for a little bit ... as well so some exposure for them the gameplay Harris was you started at the beginning of last year but I haven't gotten out there yet the show or get them some touches just in case or whatever the future brings already for it I guess\nYou have to be you know it's always there every position is one snap away from being the next man a young you know the you know the\nBill Reynolds article in the Providence Journal was a nice little tribute but it was far cry from the one who wrote about you know dropping football a long time ago but\nThe thing that was remarkable to me it was exactly right is that you know you have the balls being delivered everywhere there's a lot of people touching it there are a lot of people playing and that was a very happy group on the sideline\nSlacker on or we work with them slack on or whatever kind of lift me up and now that me going so\nThat was pretty nice like Oprah Winfrey stuff and I want to start an hour we want something that we could use against the air and later on you know he's really nice about that I heard you could hook it up though right\nYeah pretty good basketball as good as it was pretty good and play a little bit so one on one who wins on the court or hadn't uh after the Thanksgiving meal when you go out to the driveway and play a little I mean it is it's a competitive game but I get a [laughter]\nI say you play any other sports like in in high school and the ... okay so you're an hour on your basketball you care about any basketball game but losing records well not an object is football and basketball does it\nSounds good so ah and want to talk about this because it was just a terrific years for for a ... or a credible ... uh he goes down veto comes\nTo talk about as a receiver and take so many reps what you want to get a few with veto but you know obviously the large majorities withdrawn and now veto priorities in there for however long before John ... a big difference and catching a ball and one guy versus the other parent\nIs not it's not a difference at all like goes uh say veto been preparing for star every week isn't [noise] either the backup ought to start because like you said it's a nice man thing and we had to deal with this a verse it is that's what we don't want to take all the little guy to make the play happily so I Would go about it how about\nYou as a uh like this or the philosophy the ball coming to you as a touch your eye is there any difference between the two to one better or worse or just different\nOh I Can't really tell now I'm just I'm usually catch in the Boston both of them just because we represent given so much and practice so a\nKnock can't really tell the difference now you know most teams will have [noise] that'll eat receiver now they'll have an air and parts of the more they'll have an idea culture rather have a more of a bull ... who are ... and you know and his guy says\nWe've got all of them right to defend Rhode Island ... defense has to be so tough because they really can't tell you right there that's a good thing about it\nGet it done and different phases good again we're comfortable out there and we all went to see each other do good [noise] so uh\nTo in ... Maine which is the best defense and the league [noise] do you look at that as a challenge Aaron saying okay you know we feel we've got the best off and why\nThey think they've got the best effects of that show that they do or does that does that give you a little extra fire\nIt gives you a little extra hard and make you go harder harder and practice and I'm sure that everything is on point to key move things like that so we've been practicing and trying to all this week to come out on top with this one\nLooks like rain in the morning the clearance for the daily afternoon or initially they were talking to some rain in the afternoon is it a very tough to catch the ball in the rain\nTurtle and she was with us those games when they always said that\nI tell you what do you like a receiver [noise] I think is is more\nA concentration ... article was always like us to talk so I feel like if we just stick to what we know and just focus I think everything will be great I mean it'd be good and I do think you're\nI mean it's not really a big difference like you say you got focus and concentrate but we can't control Mother Nature so if it's raining and we got to run the ball we'll be out there block and so\nThe your mom is his mom's sister ...\nDoes she have a great uh so uh [noise]\nThey ah who's the favorite in the family of the two of football what\nReligious such a lover lover\nLove us I mean they used to send it to a West Virginia over the summer Tom Charles was his is uh to go try and when my uncle Walter easily get it right actually played in the NFL\nEvery summer we used to go down there and use the uh tickets at a gym or to the food we was always just out doing something that was athletic so so\nCouldn't park high school who gets there were a number of retire at first I guess the question [laughter]\nLike if you're there for four right right right I guess one year to go first right after that as a an air and again either way hey I I Lived for years of this place to be in first of all yes so here's what we do do this thing called a no your home town where\nAn air has been through once I say this your first town and it's the same town I rarely wind Maryland so I'm going to ask you questions about burn out you know I said earlier that we would do it like first one to answer I'll I'll go back and\nAll right so we've got some easy ones up front and then make it a little tougher as you go see who knows her hometown better okay and then both your mom's can say okay this is our favorite [laughter]\nOr ... or I Will start with you what county is brandy why Maryland in ...
