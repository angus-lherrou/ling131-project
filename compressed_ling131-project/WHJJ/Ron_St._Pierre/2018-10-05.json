us from our twenty four seven network I guess that most surprised so far and all of this is what Kevin on himself said among his testimony Michael he said he might have been a little bit too emotional a mayor\nYeah Ron he uh he wrote in a column for the wall Street Journal that he was apologizing and with the the title of the column was I Am an independent impartial judge and he allowed in that that he was at a sharper tone that you said a few things maybe he shouldn't have said\nAnd he wanted to reassure any Americans who are worrying or any Republican senator who may be wavering in their support of his confirmation that whatever you saw on that hearing when I'm On the bench\nI Will be an impartial judge with blinders to partisanship and that could have come on the heels of you know we already knew about the very public questions by Yale Law school in the American bar association yesterday we had seen the more than twenty four hundred law professors\nHad signed a letter saying that cabin on display the lack of judicial restraint the national council of churches said that he disqualified\nHimself from the appointment saying that they saw the extreme partisan biased and disrespect

Kavanaugh legal work\nSaid the judge Kavanaugh was not qualified to sit on the court that could be very well all of that\nCollectively why we saw the apology from Brett Kavanaugh yesterday yup\nWell what it means right now though is that men aside as the stages sent for procedural vote to continue the confirmation process today that could lead up to a confirmation vote for tomorrow but who are we looking at because this isn't exactly a slam dunk\nNo not at all in fact one of the red state senators that people were thinking could be a swing voter Heidi Heitkamp who's down I Believe it twelve points as of yesterday afternoon in her race\nHas given an official emotional no she will not be supporting Brett Kavanaugh\nUh she indicated that she had to look herself in the mirror couldn't vote for no other word from the other four senators were considered the five swing vote so\nSusan Collins did say that she thought it was a very thorough FBI investigation but that she was going to read

reacting just the way you might\nAssume they would have reacted Michael by our joins us from our twenty four seven network I guess that most surprised so far and all of this is what Kavanaugh himself said about his testimony Michael said he might have been a little bit too emotional a mayor\nYeah Ron he uh he wrote in a column for the wall Street Journal that he was apologizing and with the title of the column was I Am an independent impartial judge and he allowed in that that he was at a sharper tone they set a few things maybe he shouldn't have said\nAnd he wanted to reassure any Americans who are worrying or any Republican senator who may be wavering in their support of his confirmation that whatever you saw that hearing when I'm On the bench\nI Will be an impartial judge with blinders to partisanship and that could have come on the heels of you know we already knew about the very public questions by Yale Law school in the American bar association yesterday we had seen the more than twenty four hundred law professors\nHad signed a letter saying that cabinet display the lack of judicial restraint the national council churches\nSaid he disqualified himself\nFrom the appointment saying that they saw the extreme partisan bias and disrespect toward certain members of the committee and then at the end of the day we all kind of saw that former Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens who previously had wonderful things to say about judge Kavanaugh legal work\nSaid the judge Kavanaugh was not qualified to sit on the court that could be very well all of that\nCollectively why we saw the apology from Brett Kavanaugh yesterday yup\nWell what it means right now though is that that aside as the stage is set for a procedural vote to continue the confirmation process today that could lead up to a confirmation vote for tomorrow but who are we looking at because this isn't exactly a slam dunk\nNo not at all in fact one of the red state senators that people were thinking could be a swing voter Heidi Heitkamp who was down I Believe it twelve points as of yesterday afternoon in her race has given an official emotional no she will not be supporting Brett Kavanaugh uh she indicated that she had to look herself in the mayor couldn't vote for no other word from the ...\nThey're four senators were considered the five swing vote so Susan Collins did say that she thought it was a very thorough FBI investigation of it that she was going to read later and then give her idea for the vote when it was vote time Jeff Flake very much mimicking the same thing that Susan Collins said\nLisa Murkowski is held a ... a little bit closer to the chest\nShe says she's still reading the entirety of the report but she didn't eat with dozens of sexual assault survivors from her home state of Alaska yesterday in our office and then Joe Manchin the fourth now a it has to offer any definitive take on the FBI report the nomination saying that Heidi made her decision all make mine so that's where we stand here this morning\nOkay Michael power from a twenty four seven network I appreciate the they'd have a great weekend Thanks Michael Scheuer weekend brought\nYou to do if today's vote to end debate on Kavanaugh's nomination is indeed successful final vote in the full Senate on whether or not to confirm him as expected for\nSaturday about a month away from a critical vote in American politics as we were well aware of vice president Mike Pence he loves a significant accusation against China more from Fox is ...\nThe vice president said at a D.C think tank that China plans to interfere in the coming midterm elections in a roundabout way\nChina is targeting US state and local governments and officials to exploit any divisions between federal and local levels on\nPolicy China denies the claims but the administration and says China is using trade towers to advance Beijing's influence the vice president says the U.S wants to ensure trade practices that are free\nFair and reciprocal and we will continue to stand in demand that they'd do\nVice president Pence says these tactics are worse than what the Russians have tried to do ...
