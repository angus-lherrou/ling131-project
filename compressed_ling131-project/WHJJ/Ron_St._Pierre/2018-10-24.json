Gagliardi news radio die twenty four seven FM here at the top local stories we're following ward man editor prison after he admitted in superior court today he was drunk when he ran a stop sign struck a child back in may\nUm but I still think that you know when we when he came out and have you know it was still twenty four seven it was a\nYou know it wasn't a pretty first half we played the entire op subside backed up we played you know short feel defense a we're\nMaking our way through things had you know [noise] ah you know drop passes which we haven't seen a whole bunch of there was a couple of them you know the third down efficiency was awful it was one thing after another but at the end of the day\nYou know Stony Brook gonna manage the game they were utilizing clock they weren't going to go ahead and\nYou know poll away quickly so we were twenty four seven coming out of half and we knew that we had the ball you know on the kickoff return and the the plan of attack was to come on out near the good kickoff return like we're always capable of doing with Amir back there and our guys block up front [noise]\nBe able to move the ball down the field and you know pick up you know seven points and closed to attend point day yeah you've got to you know and then you've got a competitive game for the rest of the half unfortunately hit with a third down way through and through an interception they brought it back twenty two yards or something like that had another short field they punched in\nAnd you know we found ourselves and you know in a in a bad way and we weren't able to get it going you know in bright spotlight I think with [noise]\nYou know see injustice an interim unwound a little bit but I mean you know certainly are not are you know not her best performance very obviously and uh you know it's a tough one that we've had to address the number of issues all week long and we're on to William and Mary and come on come on out and playing well this weekend\nHe had just so sad that fifty nine year old Ronnie they do yard sign up for ... late ... when the game was decided are named Jones gave you a good effort to uh fourteen carry Seventy six yards a couple a touchdown\nThey saw more action because O'Brian was out uh for the game and I think you realize\nHow important he is to this often said north south guy that's going to ride it out and get you some yards or his value showed up and his absence on that field on Saturday\nI think everybody's you know everybody who's a starter that's out you know becomes a significant in your ability to\nPlay your best and you got to count on your back ups come in now you know I think names are very capable guy and you know you plug and play him and I feel very good about names performing you know I thought that we did a good job is not offensive stuff trying to figure out ways to be able to [noise] you know knowing that we're a little bit of a deficiency in the\nPosition to get a mere out there and we will hand the ball off to and we weren't able to get 'em unwound like we wanted to until later on you know and the one scorned drive and the first half I mean it was all him you know we got 'em going on the run and then we got 'em going\nPast game and um\nYou know and then you saw you know we were able to get ... touch and then we got you know tremendous or he he had a very solid game was pleased to see that\nSo I mean you know there's there was just would never found the rhythm we really didn't I mean I think that the pocket was closed a little bit although I think our guys were in the right spot it's just a you know it was one of those days you know and and then we went in and it was\nThat it has never sparked were never able to play off one another like we've been able to do it made him playing off and defense and [noise] you know make a stop here and then the answer and often so we are making a big play off and be able to come out and get it going so we put it in a river near we've learned from it and uh you know we're looking you know\nFinishing stretch here that's you know as you mentioned with injuries I mean that's something that is part of this game and the challenge to our guys you know there's\nThere are people that are hurting the people that are injured when Andrew you can't play when you're hurt you got to suck it up a little bit and our guys are are pushing through some tough tough things but we're going to be ready to play on Saturday and it's a it's a must win as I looked at the\nConference standings with the kids\nAre this morning you know you're looking at\nA very interesting conference race matching up you\nKnow there's we want it for no with ... and you got a bunch of at three in one and now it's ... two and two and now you're looking at\nA you know when my marriage got to go out to knock them out of the race and then we got to go ahead and keep chipping away at at one game at a time and we've got some you know real good challenges ahead of us but you know everything's still possible and so that's our approach them\nYou know still one game at a time but you know we are in the middle of this thing as long as we're able to come out perform on Saturday and go to W.\nYeah I I guess you look at it at the remaining schedule William and Mary is tough they'd be Maine a team that Rhode Island a window right down to the wire with a couple of weekends ago is the me last week so other coming in and feeling pretty good about themselves but as you look at the the remainder of the good news is you've got Jay MU and ... to the top teams in the country\nThat are you going to be on the road for both of them that's that's tough so uh but you got the teams that you need to play in order to get where you want to get\nA look at the CIA over the last five years and they've gotten four teams into the post season and for those five years and three in the other year and that was two thousand Thirteen so the last four years has been fourteen she can pretty much count\nOn for teams getting any lounge AMU seem to be their ... and obviously is looking pretty good for that spot but you know you go knock off jam your lawn and the picture changes a little bit and then you've got\nMaine in ah in Stony Brook in Rhode Island kinda\nVying to to move up you grab a couple of quality wins like that and even though you lost the head to head you can leap frog all of those teams\nI I don't know the entire history of see a football but I Do know that you know\nThe course of the season it's been somewhat remarkable in terms of the number of see a football teams that have been ranked at one time or another and twenty five\nNow you know we're looking at you know as we've always said you know you want to get into the playoffs and you want to have a chance to win the championship you know age the magic number ... ... you know work for we got four left yup yup but I Do think that when you're looking at the\nQuality of this league that you know they're pretty good there is a very good chance would totally kids this morning is that uh you know those are the chances are there's a seminal for football team out of our league that's going to go ahead and get to the get to the playoffs now seven afford team's not going to win the championship\nBut ah you know it's going to be really interesting because as you look at the matchups throughout the league which I spent a little bit more time studying just so I could explain clearly to these go to Adam ... enjoyable here's where we are [noise]\nYou know it's not all over it's not you know real bail out its you know we just got an uncle down and you get this to be in and moving on down the road because they're going to be a lot of really significant matchups this weekend and every weekend on out in the CIA will see at the end of the at the end of the year where we stand\nI think that just having that conversation and sitting down and putting that together and present again T a player speaks to others programs going right that you know two thirds of the way through the year uh we're figuring out a scenario for an island to get what you want to get which isn't to postseason play that speaks to the first two thirds of the year and obviously\nDoes a bumped the road last weekend against uh against ... Stony Brook the ... the main game was into anybody's ballgame down to the wire and prior to that you've been playing great football so uh uh put you in a position to be vying for postseason play which is a a compliment to this program and what you've taken a\nYeah I like that and I I like that I liked that thought and I liked the tribute to these guys but I mean you know and again they they need to to see that you know right now they're coming off the top law you know their their focus is you know that that's a tough loss and you know they don't really know which way to go I mean that's our job is coaches to lead them through it\nBut we've come out we believe established it we practice Monday Tuesday Wednesday I think we practice very well we've got a good day tomorrow head of us and then we got to prepare for anything goes on Saturday with what it looks like coming in from mother nature's gonna add act on that game\nAnd we'll talk about that in a in a second you or you want just about every stop all the way throughout your\nYour career these kids had been part of this rebuild of this program so the winning is new you know at this at this point in time as as this program continues to progress every year you build ... to get this program right out the cusp right now\nIs it something that you can translate to them as far as you know like ... they've been there in these other teen a lot of these other teams have been there were islands is this is a new venture for these kids right now is a you know the combination of your work here to put them right back in the in the ... uh is that something that you can\nTell them what do you just have to experience and I you know it's the holy grail ... and I mean you\nReally you know to to to\nYou know the big statement is all you gotta learn to win and why do you learn when my winning and how to you when\nYou play fundamental football you don't turn it over you go ahead and play all three phases you play every snap one snap at a time with the discipline necessary to be able to achieve victory on that one to snap I mean it's a fairly simple formula one you really break it down but it's all the you know the\nUps and downs that happen within a sixty minute ballgame how you handle that is critical to winning\nNow you know when you look at where we're at right now is that you know if our guys which I Do believe in these kids I Believe that we have the metal to be able to make this happen to make the move but\nYou've got to brace the competitive situations are ahead of a you've got\nGreat competitive football games ahead of you and what a score requires to do is play our very best each and every week and that's regarded as to who's into football game you know so our team and our fabric of our team has got to be a one just a focus disciplined approach to play one step at a time\nThe scoreboard don't matter until the last ... goes off the clock and\nI think that if we're able to play that way and and play you know the way we like we've seen during the course of this year I could be a story ... story book finished you look at\nNearest competitor I'd have to say probably Twain\nOkay yeah he's good on both of those is you guys play a lot\nYeah you got to some different quarterbacks behind you had your last one at the start of the year with him at a vetoes been out there or is it a different for you with different guy a little different style you know John is going to run around a little bit more of a drop that guy uh do you have a one guy versus the other guy behind you do you do things a little differently\nHonestly no we just try to do do a job same as always we know they're two different style yeah but we don't really try to switch it up with a mhm so you see the same yeah we got a lot of chemistry and both with both of 'em and um we just try to protect them\nYeah talk about that that relationship with the quarterback for us that they left tackle just to you know why you're yours main guy\nI especially cause means to be to a room mates right now we really have\nGood connection is as well as on yeah but um as we just feel comfortable with each other you know when we talk to each other um\nIf one's getting down and we know how to calm each other ... is really nice\nYeah we do go off to a a great start after the Harvard game where it came in relief yeah uh the next weekend at number ... game against brown and this is a you know a few song himself had some good success out there must be pretty pretty fun view being so close to him to see him or has suggested that quarterback position\nIt definitely is like because I always knew when vetoes type of person if he needs to step up you're really well he's always been prepared and it's just really exciting to see him play how I always knew he would\nCoach talked about these next four games being must win for you to self in a position here where you have a chance to get what you want to get a do you have confidence of this team is already to make that run\nI definitely do I know you went through a\nSome adversity the past couple of game yeah I'm not the Endings That we wanted but I Know are really looking forward to the last four games and really to put ourselves in the playoffs are on\nThe conversation amongst you guys not coaches for you guys after that Stony Brook game [noise]\nKind of just keeping each other up there on each other that\nEverything's okay we're still for the team and we still have\nA very good chance that Congress championship as well as play offs mhm so it kind of just keeping each other together not letting anybody fracture anything what do we really have kept each other together\nAs Craig look forward to seeing the out there Saturday get this thing going and make
