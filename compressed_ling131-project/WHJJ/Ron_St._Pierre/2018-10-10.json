the national security advisor to people who work closely with Nikki Haley and now we're told that she didn't even tell her own staff until yesterday morning\nSo uh this really did catch everybody by surprise everybody except to the president apparently a Nikki Haley says that she told the president maybe six months ago that she was thinking about ducking out after a couple of years as you want to ...\nUh whether that is true or not we do not know but the you're right there certainly was a big surprise and other reasons remain unclear as to why Nikki Haley would bow out\nAnd then I'm prompted in the oval office sitting with the president yesterday she said she has no plans to run for president in twenty twenty and that she would campaign for Trump but I don't think there's any question that she's a rising star in that party\nThat's what makes this so curious Renault why would she suddenly remove herself from the public eye even if she has some aspirations down the road you wouldn't want to maintain that the public image in some way and if she decides to stay away from politics sheet removing herself because\nUh if you're not going to run against the president we're talking twenty twenty four six years down the road\nAh so I I really don't see that as a possibility you know what the most likely scenario to me the one that makes the most sense even though we've already

by Lindsey Graham that creates a vacancy for a senator in South Carolina added\nNikki Haley's available so odd to me that seems to be the most likely and the other most reasonable scenario out of all these Trump says he's considering\nFive different candidates to replace Haley but we really didn't hear any names creeping out of there but one name that the sort of did swirling around was the former deputy national security advisor Dina pile\nYeah and that she is the most likely candidate for this a ... a former White House officials you mentioned deputy security advisor former Goldman Sachs executive\nI I Would think that she has a shoo in for this post I'll Joe or Richard run out of the ambassador to Germany or was mentioned as well but\nAh he ah the president has said that that would create almost a double task here because you're while you're filling a vacancy at the un you're creating another vacancy an ambassador ship for Germany and of course the market drop name came up that was quickly dismissed by both the president and buy vodka so don't look for that to happen\nRight bill's infer from a twenty four seven network thank you bill you're walking around so Nikki Haley says she's not going to run for president in twenty twenty but that was on prompted you know nobody asked her if she just offered it you're buying it what do you think or do you like bill's idea of what he
