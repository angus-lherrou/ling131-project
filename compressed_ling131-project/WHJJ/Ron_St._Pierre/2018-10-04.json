Jones from Newark New Jersey who's you know again a four year player forced a DJ Stewart from Hartford, Connecticut and a four year player for a spin on the field ever since he stepped on campus here and then just in Hogan who are starting middle linebacker who's played\nFour straight years as well so I mean these guys have been on these shows before a guy's a we watched you know growing it's really hard to believe and simple to believe that you know it's coming to an end in front of this is the last time we have those three cats and they've been you know tremendous contributors to what we tried to accomplish here\nAbsolutely so we want to look a head to brown later on we want to also look behind to Harvard and a big win for now back to back victories against Harvard back home last year and this time at Harvard Stadium but ah one of the takeaways from that game to ... and he lost him a\nFairly early on in this game I went on a run play for a touchdown ah he's ah situation as we approach the weekend\nWell you know he got it when we use scored the the second touchdown of the game and you know we was in that position where you know there is no turn it down you know there's the goal line and there's a couple of defenders and he was going to do it by the end zone and\nA Harvard which I thought it was a really good talk when football team but tackled on the low end of things and are just you know got I'm On the side of the leg and so each week Disney a little bit it's been a day by day you know progress through this week and he's a\nDay to day deal he's had a couple of reps this week and we'll hopefully the you know the next twenty four hours or so we'll be able to get things back up and running and get him running at full speed I thought\nI thought it was funny the press conference or you opened it up for ... you and Phil that's just for up there and go just to say I got the first question are you starting quarterback innovate\nOur way of caught me off guard just a second and there's pretty much you know none of your business I Will say is that or do you want to go out we do not recognize you as part of the media you know [laughter]\nNo no it certainly got getting inside information whatsoever so get prepared\nNow due on obviously gives yeah a lot of great a great things you saw veto pre already come in and release of him in that Harvard game and got through it to the victory what did you see in him then what have you seen in him prior to that that are that you like and what where does he need to develop\nI mean you know he's a ... it's you know he's a kid who's been in the program is in are in the second team spot when you lose your start and Gore but you go to the second team just like nobody like everybody else in this you know every other position on the field [noise]\nYou know veto has great anticipation has got a great touched on the football\nHe sees the field extremely well he's got a strong enough farm I don't know if it's the biggest storm in the world but he obsolete can deliver dimes and um you know operate are often it's you know I think you want and it was you know was is continued and we're hoping to continue this weekend you know just\nDeveloping as a really a phenomenal phenomenal quarterback you look at what Joe won was doing over the first four weeks [noise]\nUh you know shame Donaldson R. S. I. D. you know the you know was pointing out to me on the way up you know you really look into statistically is that all American type thing which you know everything is early it's still early in the season but\nYou know a you'd look at veto a he's got a very good understanding what we do and I really certainly think that he's got a [noise]\nYou know he's got a really good opportunity you know if she gets more snaps this weekend to continue to blossom and get better and better\nTitle Harris get some ah some some rats during the week as well\nAbsolutely you know we we always keep Tyler alive and this is you know mentioned is beginning of the year and I think it's a truthful statement and hopefully we don't have to bear the truth out you know I felt that we've had three quarterbacks here that we can win with\nAnd uh you know I think that all of them have prepared well all of them will be ready and if you are sitting there throwing a dart out there and say okay this is a guy up this week I think\nOur whole team would be rally behind that one quarter back and and they will give us an opportunity to win but as you know to a team game we've all got to do our part and and I'm really looking forward to\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWell right now you can get to Dunkin bacon egg and cheese sandwiches for five dollars and well in that case the forecast calls for rain some partly
