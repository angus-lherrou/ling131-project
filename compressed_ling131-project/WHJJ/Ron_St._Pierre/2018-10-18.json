you've gotten this year I'm up in the in the top Fifteen at a at one point right now and number twenty two in the country does that help when you're out in the recruiting trail when you're a a

Saturday and continues to be had to make you feel pretty good too right yeah it\nWas really an outstanding environment we knew was projected to be you know you've got a much better perspective on that kind of thing that I Do having been around for so many years you know I I rarely you know recognize what's going on behind me and he got into I turn around and ... you know catch a quick peak of it\nAnd I recall you know a year ago when I looked up and the stadiums are the lawn about midway through the third corps had oh wow you know and then uh this one this one at the even more\nOf a flavor of of you know not ... not shock kind of what we've been expecting to build here and you know it just a it's a really nice thing to look around to see the support to the excitement\nAnd a kind of our day to you know my message that I've been talking to you about for the last four years going on five that you know there is a really good football product down here and there is a good environment and there's something great to build on here and\nUh we were crushed by the loss obviously because I Would have kept things off quite well but ah\nI think everybody did walk away feeling very good about where we're at a football program where we have at a store for the future and future being this year as well\nYeah I remember when you came in and or the you know a lot of talk Matt inside the university from the athletic department but just fans and supporters of programs saying hey\nThis is our last best chance to get this thing going with a coach Fleming came in with a record of success at\nEvery level and like if you can get done here this is the guy to do it and this is the time to do it and we're going to find out if indeed\nIt can be done in a it's not a quick fix as as we see but uh we're talking like going to talk to coach can make it a little while ... one of his roses as recruiting coordinator and uh you know to me it's it's a recruiting success urine and year out making this team deeper\nMore skilled at each position to a point where you get now well you say you know what they can't compete for see a title\nWell it took a collective effort is you know I mean obviously you can point to the hard work could be assistant coaches going out day to day grinding away trying to find the right guys to fit the program [noise] but you know we've got a tremendous product to sell and then you know you obviously cannot do this without emitted\nIf support and mission support financial aid support I mean everybody at the university has to be on board for determining that we want football to be a you know a part of the campus environment and you know I think we're still in the building process there I mean we got to get more of her students down where you got to get them\nOut of the out of the bed you know it for those early noon game on come on\nDown to the game but I think that will even put the capacity over what we can even have there but uh you know that's a good sign for things to come and with all the the positive things that are happening in the near future for our football program I think that there's\nA tremendous upside to where we can go and you know our focus is a football team is just to be able to continue to produce victories and [noise] and ah that tore me to do this weekend when we go down Stony Brook\nTalk to Tom ... will go and get those lights in coach he can have like a Stony Brook have a six o'clock game or something you know I remember my college days I couldn't sleep at six PM I was always up for me you
