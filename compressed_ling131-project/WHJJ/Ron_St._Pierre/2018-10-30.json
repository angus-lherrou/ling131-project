J. Providence and I aren't radio station\nNot going to ask you because I'm right there next to the bench and you are down on the score is about as far as that coach's box can stretch and you're in a crowd for most of the game they're certainly the whole first half as much of the second half as well and you head coach sudden in the first seat and then a a coach Carroll a few seats down from there sure is that going to be your spot\nA ... more than likely not a you know I I\nI had a game plan actually going into this and go into the spurs game we we played a scrimmage at at St john's or you know a few days blow to that and it was a close scrimmage and our guys are are guys play very well they compete at a very high level and um and I\nOf wrote them pretty hard throughout that game uh and I was I just I was wondering prior to the exhibition versus base whether or not they would be able to handle me a as well as the crowd mhm uh I knew I couldn't tell the crowd not to come\nAnd yet in nor did I Want to do right so I figured out what kind of eliminate myself from the equation and and just allow them to coach as well as allow me to kind of watching evaluate but uh no that won't be my that won't be my spot I'll be I'll be working those uh those sidelines or the debt I'm sure you you you see me you know yeah and an action before when the practice or\nOr in scouts situation so ah\nNo I'm I'm usually a a very vocal but uh I had a sense that they were a little bit nervous particularly the young guys and I didn't want to pow on with a\nYou know coaching them every possession of the game not to mention I just thought it was a great opportunity for me to just sit back and just got to evaluate where we were and uh you know we have a lot of work to do\nI've always said it best scout in the business I've been there twenty five years\nAnd as far as breaking down a team and be able to communicate it to the players I've never seen anybody do it better than you are my years in University of Rhode Island now it's a different role now as you work with your systems on that but uh it ... ... ... you certainly bring a lot to the table a couple of things about practice today before we get out to the uh\nThe scrimmage and what happened against uh against paced um I I Know you're emphasizing a practice defensive about transition defense yes and that was maybe the if there was a theme to the practice it was that is that a a an emphasis is that a concern of yours that you're not getting what you need to get out of that\nWas a huge is huge emphasis or you know a defense wins championships defense is a huge part of our culture I Will not sacrifice that I Will not change that\nThey know the expectation the older guys and I was disappointed in the end [noise]\nDuring the ... we faded you know I mean what are our our defense of intensity faded I thought our focus on defense said it so you know it's been a point of emphasis on the defense of Ben you know since since campus kinda started\nIn particularly transition defense because that's your first point of defense you know once the team gets the ball whether it's one of ... you have to you have to get back you have to stop the ball and you have to find shooters you have to not allow them to score\nEaster baskets once you do that and then you make them play half court game I feel pretty confident in us you know defending and a half court set but in transition you know kind of anything anything goes not mentioned we're\nPlaying a team and our first game you know where there are there new head coach comes from a program where they really really emphasized getting the ball down on the floor and ah and the spring and around and shooting a lot of three so that's been an emphasis of ours is like the first the first line of defense or getting\nBack absolutely yeah I also uh I Know mentioned a couple of things to think of the time it was Ryan Preston and maybe Christian about uh being leaders and you know Jeff in fat certainly involved and in that role is surreal to the veterans that are back\nUh and uh you you you said said nicely but make sure the the guys know that they need to hear from you\nYeah no absolutely I I have tremendous a trust and faith and all of those special players from those who played you know major minutes you know like just out\nAnd it's real and and France obviously to a certain degree and to those who played limited men and saw last year at like Enron or in the Christian ... case who didn't play at all last year but I have tremendous confidence in and all that those guys because they they'd been in this program apple released a year not if not more object land Christians case\nAnd ah you know Ryan senior in and of course has a fourth year you know guy himself so he he's been around he knows what we expect on a daily basis so no I absolutely encourage all those guys not trust in them to relay a you know the message that that\nI Would as as well and Jeff when he was talking to the media after practice today he said that ah you know he he wants to make sure they're fresh or no they they hear from him and he said they're receiving it well he thinks like their their respect him respect fat Brian Christian and and ah and respond to what they say\nShort no absolutely absolutely well you know\nIt's a a communication is key at this level and they're all learning particularly teenagers how to talk to one another and how to receive information in and you know it's it's a it's a process uh and I think the leaders are already balls and I think the young guys or or or evolving as well they're learning to a grand to listen\nAnd I listen to what the message not necessarily the delivery and go out there and ah you know try to do what they've been taught\nOkay exhibition in one of the district or one or at St john's you can't talk specifics she'll just an overview off and defense or ... uh where are you pleased\nOverall yes as I mentioned you know at at the top I thought we'd just compete at a\nA really high level down to the very very deep and talented a talented team or a and they uh they can score the ball a five guys and started back in school with a ball and or you know I just thought that our our our focus our determination are competitive spirit was there throughout the gang they made a couple of rounds we made a couple of runs\nAnd ah you know so I was very pleased with our with our defense or for it and and also then simply you know I I just think that uh you know with Jeff surreal you know those are ... are just as fast as a to point guards who can also school the ball at a high clip and uh you know it was real now\nBeing comfortable knowing that he can play minutes we're going to build on the ball you know those three guys I felt really really excelled and then there's the fourth guy was a Christian Thompson who was just a he made winning clay after winning play after winning play so you know he'll be a a a key a key for us to share\nExcellent a Christian sat out last year everybody else's you got freshman other than uh\nThe the the top three was surreal and fats and ah I'm Jeff as well and the Ryan coming off the bench a little little later on but you got a lot of young guys did you get more than you expected in that St john's game to do they perform better than you thought going an\nIdea of the state I I certainly did and then they brought me right back down to earth after that after I had a fish out of that that's what it's about if you have to it's a ... is a process uh you know not too hot not too low but I did I thought they really came there you know on a road game first you know college experience although there was no crowd a but first college experience on\nThe road against a very very tough talented and veteran leading team and I just don't they they every last one of those freshmen can play really compete at a high\nOkay let's talk about that paced game and they do the sixty five when for you the starting five was Jeff fats Christian Dana and surreal yes uh is that a is that an evolving process or deciding that is that was when he was sentenced\nJust nothing it's nothing is set in stone a run right now there's a lot of moving parts you know a particular some of the young guys they're they're searching for consistency were searching for consistency from them right now\nUh you know we just haven't we haven't seen it in any one particular freshmen you know yet in order to you know to to say that hey this guy's definitely going to be a star but I Do feel good about about where they're at and how they're progressive\nEntire we started in the second half right instead of a danger I think instead of a get out of the city actually got out there first right so even there you are a little evolution as far as uh or you're looking for\nThat's correct that's correct yeah now that the more that those guys play the more comfortable that they will you know that there will be so well now we have to just keep plant they ask the planet games on their\nBelt germane Harris like a lot of fans were disappointed they didn't get a chance to see him very much again early fall trouble then more filed trouble more ah and I'm sure you're disappointed and get more minutes as far as just getting experience out there uh what do you have the foul prone is that something that comes with him\nOr I think it's too early yet to label him there I mean it was just one of those is one of those games you know again he's in\nHigh school I mean is this something that he\nPlays a tremendous physicality yeah and ah you know we've allowed these guys kinda beat each other up for the past ... you know for the past month or so uh you know ... a physical environment now we have to tone it down so I think part of that plane you know from a coaching point of view I probably should have\nA prepared him a of for the you know with a with a way to ... ... ... you know at this level although he just went up there with a tremendous amount of energy out of the ... through his body around you know once you've settled and the second time around the second half I think he's a he was able Salem police in sidelined\nA little bit along the way with a ... a ... does that hurt is he a little bit she still catching up all that\nHe is you know absolute you can't miss once you miss a day you know a freshman you must a day that's a lot until just you know we\nIt's a lot of information it's a you know we're putting in that's on a daily basis and then he also is more important to you know outside of the ... as he missed you know the first the first scrimmage okay you know and that was just an opportunity for him to kind of go and get all the get all the kinks out and get the rust off and he didn't have that opportunity so the first time\nHe was able to do so it was in front of four thousand fans you know an ... at home you know with high expectations and he'll be he'll be five\nMinutes or Jeff gets thirty seven fats gets thirty five those are I mean they're just going to stay out there as long as they can\nYeah didn't plan on playing them uh that many minutes it out in the exhibition again but the game obviously got got tight and ah you know those guys are winners and uh you know I wanted them to stay on the floor to see how they responded to that it would have been much\nBetter I think you know for us and for the team just in general for us to have had a big lead me to be able to get them out and play though shower guys but you know it didn't happen it didn't happen that way and those guys are actually just starting to get their synergy as well I played them\nAgain involved with not only just buying tickets go to the games but also a half times gr images for your local use teams a national anthem performances birthday packages PTO now all bunch of stuff eight seven four ramps number to call to get involved with back coach no national anthem for you All right I'm not\nSuch a although I've heard just a little bit will got something going on there they said the Christian ever see 'em or get into\nSong all down yeah you do it a little bit Christian tops and with this lady that would\nI watch uh\nGot to be an exciting time for you you know last year I sat and watched a a team play very well and you're a big part of the team even though you were sidelined for the year getting back to it\nWow and they had the scrimmage against uh saint John's but with the crowd at the Ryan Center during the starting lineup for getting out there to talk about\nWhat was going through your mind at that time after this long trek to get back to be on the court for the University of Rhode Island\nUm [noise] it was it was a humbling to be out that long and watching everybody and do what they do and to come back it was it was the moment it was a good feeling I'm\n... I ... I was really excited at first and I had a lot of ...\n... oh man before the game I call them oh man that's a game that we all well from now on [laughter] I thought it was\nFor the game just keep talking to me and uh basically trust me I ... I Know he says you know so it was just ah I just needed to get myself going really and that's what I did later so long road right\nHad to be times throughout last year the question and you know whether this thing was ever going to end and I was ever going to be able to get back out there\nRight right it was it was times um\nThere's a lot of times I was just like not really wanting to give up but just\nI thought it wasn't for me you know and and uh he just ... we had meetings about it a couple of times each has told me and I stick with it and stay with it if I if I wasn't supposed to be here one of many so\nStay with it and now uh you know we mentioned you being kind of the forgotten guy because obviously you weren't out there on the court for it but it is the last year and people like putting the team together like hey Christian wow [laughter] that's right it's got about\nA lot of ah against pays says a third guard working with fast and working with Jeff are and people make mention of that stand Robin Hood analogy you'll ... you'll like that is that something you think you're suited for the kind of feel that old that that he left when he when he graduated\nRight um I I feel like I can fill that hole and uh uh I bring\nHim to say what stand brings to say one is just one when doing it all in a ban on a team player and then in the day\nPeople talk about a shaken off the rust when you have a year off a is is that the troops do still feel yourself trying to get back to where you were\nTo being sidelined\nI'm yeah I'm going to send you a shot and stuff like that right right um is a lot it's like getting back to where you are but it's also a since you had a year out you want to be able to show people that you also got better and you know what I mean that you don't want to be at the same level that you were when you went out so just a\n... proving to yourself that ought to work you put in it it is a good outcome out of it\nHow well you better than when we watch you players next Tuesday turns into game two and three uh how how would you better now than you were then\nI'm mentally I think I'm way stronger what I was I'm\nNo one game a lot more a van able to\nLead these guys the young guys in like taken everything that I learned from the older guys I left and be able to give it to them I'm On the court be more consistent when my play not not be so much up and down a that's a big thing I Want to work on and I'm not not getting in my own head you\nLike uh if I make a mistake just try to get it back I mean let's take off and try to make a plan on decent get the ball back and change my momentum and the teams are mental\nWorking with Jeff and uh with fats as well and the right you know there's there's two guys are kind of the the the ones that are on the posters and stuff like that you know uh what's your role with them on this team [noise]\nRow with them as do do what we need to do basically or\nWhatever they do good they need to do good at what they do what I was real does he need to do it and so as me and so far down the line we just we all know are rows and we just got to play those roles at least that\nThey gave us a call just to give us don't trust them\nYou can shoot it and you can defend I mean what would you rather have some somebody can only say one thing about you would you rather have them say kids are pretty good shooter or this kid is great on decent [laughter]\nUm I Would want him to say he played both sides of the\nBowl okay [laughter] all politicians [laughter]\nVery good [laughter] coach defensively though he brings to something that you really need that\nBut yeah no absolutely defenses are obviously ... you have to know a yet have to have some technique you know when you have to know where to be a boy outside of that it's it's will you know so the other sixty percent Seventy percent whatever you want to call it outside of the technique pardon knowing where it'd be which which he has found\n... is will and uh that's what he possesses that you\nGreat defenders was asked you have the will to compete the will to to get to stop a he wants to to the plate the best officers player on the other team regardless of position you know if the guy six eight let me have him if he sticks one let me\nIn between so you know just that that\nUh to compete at the highest level in the defense and takes the personal you know that's what makes them so valuable\nChristian and stop the pack you wanted to take to get to where we are as you know you obviously went through a lot over the last year and a half\nBut now that you're here look back and say maybe a little bit of a blessing last year when a lot of minutes at those guard positions because for the starting five was the starting five or this year there's much more of an opportunity for you to have an impact on this team is that another way to look at it\nUm it definitely is in a\nJust knowing that ever happened to me it was for a reason and\nContinue working for me\nTo get some young guys and coach calls upon the veterans and you're one of them to be a leader with the freshest houses clash but you know these kids were in high school prep school last year that's a big jump are you comfortable that role as a leader\nYeah I Am I'm comfortable or telling these guys and\nBeing able to show these guys what to do the right way of being able to talk to these guys and the right way and uh to get the best out of them and the best side of the game [noise]\nYou've seen these guys you guys have picked fifth from the Atlantic ten this year after me regular season champs last year and [noise] you know graduated a lot of guys so you know there's certainly\nSome logic to all of this thing but a big fifth there uh\nWhat do you think of his team said midway through the season of going into the in the conference play getting the freshman half a year or how good can this be the theme be at that time [noise]\nUm I think the same could be really good I think we are\nContinue to get better [noise] uh once everybody continue to just trust their role\nTrust what they do and how they do it'd be confident in a row as a player\nWill be really good really good you are\nAppreciate things more now having had taken away from you for a while\nThere was a ... do you think about how lucky you are to be where you are\nYeah I Do 'em all the time and uh even when I have like a bad day or a just a a bad practice or I'm going through the motions out for like ... like I always have will have always telling me like\nLassie wasn't doing this you know so as to having him there and they helped me get through it\nIs good for you guys seem to be pretty close knit even the or the younger guys pretty quickly you guys are coming together\nRight right uh yeah we do everything together so it helps us up to ... just being brothers and uh [noise] you know families as first so\nA week away man we go way to say that against Brian I also heard this that uh you claim to be the best NBA two\nK. guy on the team is that right [noise] um that's where I was out somewhere and might have been saying Donaldson through that one out there so we can blame chain but are they use the the you're pretty good yeah I'm pretty good at it so I talked to Jeff after practice [laughter]\nAnd I have talked to a Christian later he said he was the ... best had you heard\nThe third had a guess who had number one him\nOn I think I Can't remember a surreal if somebody was over to ... third so what do you think um\nI think just confident is really high [laughter]\nNow you get to create your guy right throughout my career or whatever it is I guess and NBA team to play out what team do you play on your guy\nThe tumbles symbols right I'll just on the timber wolves to everybody\nIn your gives you a crowd is that right yeah that's the team and you get to create your own guy he said he's he's got a left handed\nBut point guard you know after you left the uh what's your guy like did you can you can put in what you want right\nRight yeah I'm originally I had a six eight\nBut he did it all you\nHe just he was a bucket Scott\nScott rid of him though he got rid of them and the shoe guy right now\nAll right ed go south as good a Christian so good to have you back and not be able to laugh but you know as far as playing be an active I'm ready to contribute I was so thrilled to see out there", "station": "WHJJ", "city": "Providence"}
