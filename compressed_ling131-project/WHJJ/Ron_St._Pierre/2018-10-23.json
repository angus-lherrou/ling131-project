in the book because a lot of people have these experiences and then people kind of go well no one guy there that did that so you must be mistaken or maybe somebody was traveling through or this or that\nSo I Hope that helps them sort of get a better idea of what could be happening in that situation\nLet's go to Chris in Columbus ohio Hi Chris go ahead\nOh Georgia since you're a gift there has been a in Ohio northeastern part yeah I've got to ask I Believe he did a show from there the man's school reform and tore yep we sure did\nAnd every time I go there and there's something it's electricity and if I could have like to share a love story with you sure okay my mother I'm full blooded Cherokee of call been quite a few times a follower ... but anyway uh my father died\nAnd three months later my mom she's really depressed didn't know how things were going to work out you know to put two kids\nAnd just before they liked woke up my father was there\nBecame in her bedroom sit down on the bed mom's food up her daughter kiss through and said honey everything's going to be All right but it's beautiful in the strongest power of everything is love and I was going to share that\nWith sweet mhm\nThese sometimes these stories are just emotional issue will they Brendan\nYeah yeah you know I mentioned a little bit before it's these aren't negative experiences for the most part in in my in the ... in my accounts that I go over with these people that have people I've met over the years\nYou know sixty sixty seven percent I think are more positive than they are negative and it's this idea of someone coming back saying goodbye saying you know it's okay um\nYou know these are positive experiences in their life changing and they reaffirm the connective ness that you had with this love one and and these are important things in life we talked about before it it could heal some sort of psychological wounds and help you move through the grief process\nSo this phenomenon could be used as a coping skill and there's a lot of research out there that says that there's sometimes paranormal experiences are used as coping skills um so you know I always shutter when it's always negative negative negative negative goes goes go scary scary scary\nScary not like that in real life go to Joe in the Bronx side Joe some going\nHey George how are you know Joe good I'm Brendan yeah I wanted\nTo ask you a question then maybe really a story about\nA full up are rich and I've seen um [noise]\n... um the question is\nDo you think that there is a supplemental undo channel of communication going on between to go see a permission and a recipient of that goes to experience\nUm maybe perhaps subconsciously there's this supplemental um communication to wake communication going going that precipitate the uh goes we have permission appearing [laughter]\nAnd I had a full reparation experience or after my brother passed away um if I was ... and and I was having runners\nOn a song that really destroyed before on coast to coast [laughter] um my brother comes into the room [noise] um [noise] he looks the way he did when he passed away in the hospital I'm short of 'em and uh it's it's during the day\nOr at the foot on my bed he walks by and he speaks to me and says just get it done and then disappears into at all um can you may be elaborate on what could have precipitated this\nDoes your does your brother pass away or he was he a this was the best way how long ago that he passed away a ... a ... before you know maybe maybe maybe maybe uh fourteen years\nOkay All right I'm while enter your second question then we'll get back to the first question will quick so I I think it's kind of similar to the what we talked about earlier you know with the husband thing his wife and then the wife kind of said hey check buying the workbench you find the pumpkin there\nThis is an idea where you sort of gather information from the environment\nUm possibly connecting are resonating with his consciousness\nAnd communication is happening in other words he's saying get on with the complete your song those types of things he's giving you the motivation because that's something you need at that point it's like that guy needed to find that pumpkin you needed some motivation to resonate with the consciousness of your brother\nAnd when you resonate with something not just information it's the visual stuff as well\nUm and the idea you talked about before as far as that I'm unconscious communication between people there's a lot of cases out there like that there was one case in my book that I go over where a I'm a guy wakes up in the middle of the night\nAnd he has this feeling like his dog is in trouble and he has this visual operation of a dog laying in the water injured and you can't communicate with a dog but he could somehow feel like the dog is trying to communicate with him and they're kind of reading each other's emotions\nAnd then you know wakes up cars finds a dog\nThat type of thing so you know why there isn't physical communication or words there's some sort of like I'm understanding or collapse you're reading a mind type thing\nWhere do we get the books or do studies sprint and uh the good studies is available at Barnes and noble a it's an Amazon dot com\nIf you like listening to books on radio or um in your car you can get it at audible as well so basically anywhere he could find books you can pick up\nFor Brandon thank you love talking to you for Dan belong to Tom Dan Hynes or Lisa lion elect Sloan who'd Sean law the shore
