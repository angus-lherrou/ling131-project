right I think um you know the format I think it was pretty good I think they kept control of the uh the crowd you know various heckling various caring for different candidates I think having the moderate party candidate was really important um they'll cover I think he raised survey he loved to calm or write a\nLot from them and he also raised some sort of interesting a part in a policy question for the other candidate set bounce off I said I thought that was a good edition for the day I think that sounds\nFun um when more positive and the second part of the debate which is important for him you know he's so ... so negative\nAnd I think in some ways you can see the damage they don't campaign by not campaigning in the summer you know you really wouldn't talk to craft he wouldn't answer questions even interviewed you know he read his closing statement I mean it's going to note for closing statement that somebody wasn't getting enough so I was I'm for his campaign I think it was a good thing that he\nManaged to move away from a lot of the negativity they had in the latter part of the debate into more positive territory\nLast time you know ... after the first televised debate I asked you if it was time for Ellen fun to kind of shift a little bit and go on the attack a little bit more aggressively on a ... instead of just focusing on\nA governor Raimondo he has changed course just a little bit running radio ads actually it's the Rhode Island forward Inc that's running the edge but he's going after George or low and basically saying a vote for ... vote for Gina Raimondo\nRight now he's finally doing that but still remains I think ... million I think that the negative publicity last week but it's a pretty big disaster for both Alan ... and ... because\nYou know that sort of idea that other crap that police department leaking a forty year old police arrest record for you know ... how did they get out and with fungal hind it just created a lot more rumors about them are working to shut chill out and\nI was a little bit more negative actually I think in this debate and but he did try he did offer ... things about how he would help people for example if I go to college right\nWay to help people find jobs and a balanced budget\nI think that would be smart strategy on his part but um I think you know you look at that and you think ... back\nVoters from the Charles camper offer ... and that is really hard task for anybody who they are you know you got to get this every little really loved Trump in our heart and party and get to get the independents\nWho might like in her mind that social policies so it it's just a very hard thing so he's hanged going after the governor I ... in a financial disaster you argue\nUp but uh everything else on I think it's kinda hard to swallow getting you know the unemployment rate in Rhode Island is stunningly low for the history of around recently and and longer term\nAnd it is in line with the national recovery so it's very hard to make the argument that things are going sideways and they don't get me some polling data outlets you already Rhode islanders think the state's going in the right direction maybe not state government right the fate itself that's just a really big trucks half\nYou know I almost did it a full fledged coffee ... bit when I heard both a Gina Raimondo in Allen function they were against negative advertising I mean their particular advertising you know what their funding with their coffers maybe hasn't been negative but let's let's face it they embrace ... stuff that's coming in that's completely negative\nYeah I I'm just not persuaded me up you know I'm not running for that you know running against Cranston per se yet you have to attack ads on his

very much for [noise] [noise] [noise] and then uh get things going with a little\nBaby after that that can be a fun night and I was up there today watching your practice and I was talking to the guy's a ticket office and I said tickets to go real well for so it's going to be a nice grass or excited about that so when you first got the job everybody would tell me\nOr you know ask me questions as a black guy as smart as anybody is successful coaches you know every stop you may you know all this stuff he said but it just seems like he's to Niceguy [noise]\nYou know just you know Kenny Kenny can you get after these guys so I've been to a few practices since uh uh it opened up and I'm here to tell you\nYou can get after those guy says no question about it right I mean it's I think it's a terrific blend of you know mentoring shore and teaching you and when it's time putting the hammer now\nYeah well you know basketball it's a it's a sport yeah sport tends to bring out you know that side of a of you if you're a true competitor and I'm actually competitor and I love the game that doesn't mean I'm going to\nWalk around every day with a you know what a scholar and oh no orange gain votes so you know I Do enjoy interacting with people outside of basketball but when I'm On the basketball frame of mind I'm I'm I'm a little bit different and I'm worried that little bit\nDifferent when you're not happy with what's going on out there you don't think it's done with the efficiency looking for it's like All right it's time to yeah I don't take no\nHave any you in and and I can see and I fully expect that and obviously you had this long ago but you've got everybody's eyes and ears you go to their respective everybody on that team and uh when it's time to get after ... after\nYes no no absolutely no that is something that ah that Danny did kind of passed on to he was huge on establishing and strep inane and forging relationships with the players even after they've committed even after\nThey've come the campus is you know daily communication with them you know a off the court about basketball all social issues academically just bringing them to the office so when you force those relationships you're able to you know you're able to do that you have to communicate with them in and tell them\nYou know that you're disappointed or or that you expect more or even you know good job with a good job at a boy's every once in awhile so because of relationships that we have a staff and players you know I'm able to to to go after them um and they uh they accepted\nHey get get down to business a private scrimmage coming up a a secret scrimmage or I Want to call it on Sunday I can say ... in New York City we can't talk about the results right but the rules say you can talk about getting ready for sure so ah how do you approach this what are you looking to get out of it\nWas a great job pretty much for us particularly where we are right now uh there are a lot of a question marks or a lot of unknowns um there are\nSome role changes that the returning guys are going to have to uh you know adjust to and there are obviously new guys getting their feet wet for the first time at the college level and it wow what a place to play in a team to play you know you're going to\nCount the Big East team with the hall of fame you know all of them are NBA\nA coach I'll actually as a player but the whole fan on Chris Mullen kind of very talented roster an extremely extremely talented roster they're older they are more athletic they're probably a little bit bigger than a so it'll be a great first a test for us I'm eager to see how our guys a response\nAnd I'm and I'm sure we'll have a a a lot of stuff to uh learn and grow from after that after that game but I'm I'm excited to get the guys up and I'm sure they are as well we practice and now\nOne another for quite some time so it's it's time now that we go out there and\nA test us ills against though of somebody that's not to do a common to us\nNow what are the dynamic so is it a controlled for mature you can stop play if you see something and you want to correct something new you know say hang on a second I'm gonna address this\nBulls things very depends on you know you usually ... with the ... and Chris we'll we'll talk over the next couple of days about exactly what we want out of the um ah typically it's play almost like a regular game you know with the referees are to have time to things of that nature we try to\nGet enough of the media time outs as well just so we can get the rhythm of the game and and and the coaching aspect of it but yes there will be times I'm sure we'll one of us if not both of us will be\nVery unhappy with what's going on out there and we want them to stop the play and uh\nWe will allow each other to do that\nNow a when you talk to him can go like this hey listen we ah we've been struggled but against uh the sea fans can you for a couple of series anyway throw that at us or to see what we do and of course has something he wants to work on going to throw you away yeah well usually\nWe do that for the extra quarter alright the first you know the first half\nOf the second half like an entire forty minute game and then we usually have some additional time at the end for other situations or things like that you just mentioned you know something that we might just want to go or ... that that's what that extra period for but the actual forty minutes is going to be kind of plays like a you know play like a game\nYou mentioned the officials usually there's a time during the year that they'll talk to the players are allowed points of emphasis and things of that short a at I'm sure during that game they may have an influence in that regard yes as well have you heard I looked around for you know usually those are two or three points of emphasis going into his term uh you you gotten any\nNow I haven't heard them this year or\nHowever the constantly we do have Brian ... coming in tomorrow to talk to us about uh some of the points that I haven't heard of any yet we just had rest and for the first time on a Monday to wrap our live last period during our practice and they talked about a few things that were actually emphasize the\nOver the last couple of years but they didn't mention anything new yet so I'll be eager to hear from Brian are I'm sure he'll share some uh some knowledge with us about what the points to solve this year he'll talk to the team as well as to talk to the same as well as the coaches that\nHave any questions because this is like you said a big transition your for your guide to seniors on your team you know and uh uh well of town and Ryan and uh other than that all underclass meant settlement around but a lot of them can be their first collegiate basketball so this private scrimmage and that time with the the officials\nIs like three times as important as it was last year\nThat's right that's right you know those young guys there he has a bomb sure about the pop off right now with all the information on like information is information overload you know in high school and and they you guys probably head [noise]\nYou know two or three or four plays on on all fans and they probably had you know ... to ... that they ran and now we're responsibilities now and there's just so much so much at this level to the game so they have about the ... but they are giving me a a great effort on that day I used to see some good\nThings out of the young guys that I've been watching any way so you go Sunday with ah with St john's and then there's four days until the public exhibition game against paste that's where that's on the twenty fifth ah [noise]\nSeems like it's it's scheduled nicely they give you a little time to go to the practice law with what you learn to what it is\nNo that's right and not too much time yeah you know so it will still have you know a a taste of miles from that scrimmage whether it's good or bad to be able to make some adjustments and they won't be able to get right back out there that she mentioned four days later it it'd be a a a good contests for us we'll be able to play it's nothing like plan in front of a crowd I always say under lights and the whistle popcorn now to\nGet the juices for wants to love to see how those guys respond respond to that and we're eager to take on pace because there is a common full on ... I think a date and the forces on a or was it it will\nBe a freshman color right either through a credit crunch will\nSee where coaches sitting in for that one huh\nThat's awesome that's good to be all one big part of a happy family goes with those to St john's of pays a with a lot of new guys who have never been through the entire process of getting ready for a game scouting our porch walk through the whole thing do you do that\nFor those two games in a similar fashion\nOr the regular season games or an absolute so we play\nAh our secret scrimmage on Sunday at one o'clock uh in New York City so we will love traveled down on Saturday or will stay a they denied Connecticut and we'll get down there will have a pre game bill watching film a and then we'll give them a curfew and look it up the next the next morning it will go through our in our routine leader in the ... head over to the gym will\nDo I send my version of our pre game a routine or there'll be a scout involved in this or do you expect it to no good things about the play in the personnel\nSt Louis is good for us too as well as a coach and not new coaching staff here you know trying to uh [noise] you know be thoroughly as possible and figure out exactly what we want to do this year in regards to the scouts built up a new people\nGoes currently coach sudden I hear they're going to be on with us for the remainder of the show up to this first segment of the kind of a roundtable short on college basketball and especially about your eyes so we look forward to a look forward to that\nAre so you'll be running through those ... nations that I mentioned being on the road again St john's is better this year than being at home so those young kids can experience a road trip but yet or that whole\nYeah the whole thing would miss and will be the crowd yeah no that road crowds you can't you know for all the way we don't need that right now well baby steps\nThat's right exactly so of course let's talk about practice before we bring the other coaches and and uh open this thing a little wider are so far your overall assessment uh as far as practice have I've gone to you or you're pleased or are you left wanting a little bit where I\nAm always left wing and a little bit yeah no I'm not\nHas a lead you to a ...\nWell I Would say that the first time that we had practicing Kenny\nThat I had a cold sweat [laughter]\nMy memory of being in Kenya wasn't really a fond one it was a\nUsually like mid February\n... a company down there I guess you know Rhode Island and coach Skinner and ah although I think we want a couple and he won a couple just just lost my idea of Rhode Island basketball but um\nBut being in the rye and center is a joy I'm being around this group of young men that we're able to coach and being around Dave and ... and the rest of the staff has been\nPleasurable for me just being at a basketball a little bit you know what you miss about basketball more than anything is the camaraderie [noise]\nFamily aspect I'm taking young men and trying to help them get better I'm competing you know I think\nWhen you're a competitor as a player and even as a coach um you know I always say there's some people just don't want to get into it but and it's the highs and lows the basketball or coaching it or even though the lows are are difficult it's it's the joy of coaching so I'm I've been fortunate to coach for\nThese guys have been around for a while but I seem to be the one they say oh I've been in twenty ... yeah well I've been in forties so that kind of tips you off on your age a little bit um but again it's it's been a joy for the last first four or five months a year and I'm looking forward to 'em\nOr scrimmage on Sunday and just tipping off in a couple of weeks or so\nYeah just going off what you said and watching the two of you in the limited time that I've seen you or a you know I don't know how you're going to react after when\nI'm sure you're very happy but you seem like a couple of guys or about teaching about development and that the kids decide to practice and and work on one thing or give that advice and tried to make it better and and Kevin you known as one of the great teaching\nBasketball coaches in the country I as far as that goes in that seems to be what it's all about a little bit about your stops along the way and now you're developing as both a USA Basketball and also at Georgetown and a couple of stops as well yeah\nWere first and foremost I'm really happy to be here they are part of the road on family I'm learning a great deal of\nUndercoat David Cox in such a tremendous job I'm\nGonna date myself here 'cause I've had the opportunity to no danger for over Twenty years now and to see him get to where he is today is not a surprise at all but it's something that made me a\nMe to be a great deal yeah happy for him because he's a person who's worked very hard to get to this point my coach's career started you know I'm going into business for thirty four years I'll go to the highest level high school basketball I've been very fortunate a\nUp in the Washington DC area where basketball so the number one sport a\nHotbed and uh so I learned how to teach the game of basketball which I feel as though the most important thing that we do ask coaches\nAnd then I've had the opportunity to coach it that will universities George Washington University of Georgetown\nPittsburgh Old Dominion and I met a mild to moderate James Madison university and see all of those opportunities never forwarded me this chance to to be here at the University of Rhode Island and in my experience for USA Basketball is undoubtedly my uh the most thing that that I'm\nMost proud of them because we've had an opportunity when two gold medals under\nCoach Don show last good stuff and some of the great players in the game you about it\nA chance to coach to develop and help them get to the heights or how do you want to talk about all stuff around this team around college basketball but coach a quick word\nYou know going in when when you received the job you are in the job or you had an opportunity to ah bring in a couple of just the coaches and there are a lot of rumors out there these guys that are you know who's the next day and I'm really good recruiter that type of thing\nAnd I think we're all shocked that you're able to get two guys with the credentials and the abilities of these two and a credit had I guess to go to ... as well for allowing the salary structure to bring in a couple of people with this much success\nYou know as I mentioned this to you before um you know I'm I'm known as they you know a pretty good college basketball recruiter and ... and it's it's ... to the relationship that I have four years in basketball or I take tremendous pride\nThat uh what that means that you know my greatest my greatest recruiting coups\nWasn't a you know force or a train Harris wasn't you know\nMcDonalds all American a while the judge who I got the transferring to Rutgers ... wasn't any of those guys that was these two guys right here being able to secure their\n[noise] crowd and the guy\nKnow all the experience all of the college ah\nAnd they are just you know they are almost crushing are guys with knowledge on a daily on a daily basis to teach in the game at at\nA very very high level you know I'm obviously in conversations with them I'm learning things every day and\nThey're great men you know so you bring in experienced guys you know we're also great men grandfather's great mentors great educators you know there is there's there's no stealing on his roof as far as this program so no I'm I'm I'm really excited about having these guys on board\nSo after a practice bunch of media around in a a\nA Christian Thompson was one of the guys they talk to and somebody asked him about uh the two new assistant coaches and he just said hey they're my guys he says they're there for me every day whether it's basketball where there was anything else and that's a short time that this relationship is uh\nAs it developed enough to have a kid say that got a mean an awful lot to you and it's got to tell us exactly what's going on in New York University of Rhode Island which is good stuff the big thing I've ever wants to know about is recruiting areas you know we can't talk it's obviously a but a areas of a stretch for recruiting I Know\nOh it's a with Kevin and youth coach there's some duplication there so or certainly the coach setting and the coach Carroll what areas do you feel as though you're you're you're in a in a good spot to help out this program as far as ...\nUh well the game of basketball the global game and then I was the head coach at Mount word of mouth ... down in Florida and it's an international boarding school so I've recruited internationally for you know ten Fifteen Years and being a part of USA Basketball before to me that opportunity to to see the game from a global perspective until I have relationships um\nYou know they have an international market as well not Washington DC by far as wanted a hotbed for high school basketball and I am a little biased but\nA lot of talent that come out of there and a lot of people recruit from there so I'm I feel like I'm really strong relationships in the Washington DC area and then also be an end state of Florida for eight years and giving me a footprint down in the south so um\nI Would say those are my strong areas\nI coach a coach girl I Know a basketball and the Massachusetts area recently is something that you've been right on top of it but uh other than that or as well as that ah what were your strengths territorial\nWell [noise] I was at the Celtics practice the other day and a\nCouple of people came up to me and one was Brad Stevens soon to\nWho said how do you how you enjoy your time that you are right and I said um [noise] I thought I Love it I Love the coaching I Love being around the kids and I said let me tell you one other thing I Love and you're not going to believe it I Love recruiting\nI've always loved recruiting I've always going to sound a little disingenuous split on really good at it and I love being good at it I Love the competition of it I loved the fight of it um my wife would probably disagree with me she told me a long time ago when I was recruiting a\nFive star player at seatbelt well you know if you get up and he wants to go he'll like no that is not the way this works she was going to be here Steve I Know\nAnd uh it's the same thing here at your I I mean the guys that were you are involved with you know it's it's a challenge you take it on personally um and I know what it will bring to our team and into the university so I Love it I enjoy it I work with guys that are really good at it\nUm and I look forward to kind of keep doing whether it be you know in New England area where I Know a New Jersey or New York or\nOr wherever coach you mentioned your time is you know the J college among you joined up with him in Portland as well and the NBA spent uh several years with the Celtics and the interim coach with the head coach of the Celtic for\nHalf a season or so or that credential is not one that many coaches have out there on the recruiting trail [noise] ah is that influential when you're talking to a lot of kids who\nTheir goal is to play in the play in the league [noise]\nYeah I think it's [noise]\nStating the obvious I think it's one of the reasons that I have this job is one of the reasons that I bring\nA little something extra to the table a four day even for\nOur recruiting efforts of\nAnd we've used that already and\nThe goal for a lot of young men is not only a college degree but also to play in the NBA and when you can present to them not only how you look at I've been in the NBA no would've\nApplied a basketball player looks like in the NBA what it feels like a what he needs to do in order to\nBe successful and he had his next paycheck in the NBA those things resonate not only with young men but their families and their you coaches and so on and so forth so\nNow already some success with our is to be on a strict coming in from Greece and coach you had a a a relationship their knowledge of him they are right though of course I'm right and are are able to get a head start on him yes um", "show_name": "Ron St. Pierre",
