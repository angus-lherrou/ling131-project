I'm I'm Sorry it was the question again he's he's asking if the pyramid is actually the tip of the iceberg\nAh okay that's a great question so um I you know one way to marry\nThe the the theory of a lost civilizations starting something in ... uh and then the old kingdom are Egyptians of a building on top of it is basically to draw the line exactly where you are asking a Michael I think micro was your name right\nYes so um yeah so I think ... and in fact when even when you look on on the pyramid itself on the ... on the north east corner I I was there just a few weeks ago and you know what that is bad walk that's not human stone that is actually the original hill that was there and it was molded it\nTo sort of you know allow for stone to be placed on it but you're looking at something that was there before the pyramid was built\nAnd so it is possible that there was some structure there before and in fact Robert ... has it insinuate it is that things that maybe there were shrines on in this three locations and they were in line to you know the belt stars of Orion a dating to the happy\nAnd and you know the old kingdom Egyptians came they basically built up your um it's on top of the shrines\nAnd so uh and the softer so what's under the pyramid\nAlso you know the subterranean chamber from the looks of it it looks much older and when you walk into the pyramid or you walk into the what's called the kings chamber\nThere's also a you feel like you are you are basically to phase monument like there was something there before and then the pyramid was built on top so it's an excellent question um proving it is a little bit difficult of course but uh it's definitely something that's possible\nThank you so much my new or just an absolutely perfect fascinating conversation tonight Iran coast yeah I loved\nIt thank you so much to me we've got a twenty seconds left what's next for you\n[noise] um what are your ... one of your listeners asked exactly the right question
