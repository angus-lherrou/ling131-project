gonna they they make us more dynamic they are I Believe they're going to score or maybe not right from the first game but I I Believe that the poor time that they're going to be a group that\nYou know puts up a lot of goals but the end of the day the college hockey and our group it's much more about\nOur juniors seniors are returning guys those are the guys that we're looking to really carry the flag of how we play the game um of what it takes to win and and have those guys kind of bring the young guys along as if we're going to rely on the young guys we're going to be in trouble\nAs far as the young guys who will get to the older guys and you have brought them in early now for a number of years having them get on campus get their feet wet with at least one class and that and as you look over time you think that helps you you're by you're having um on campus a little sooner than they would if they just came in one\nSTART I think it does I think it uh it really helps this time of year when midterms come ...\nHum colleges are really getting into gear where things are ... you know things are bulls in fast and they have two classes under their belt they know where where to eat they know where to get their academic support they know um\nKnow where everything is on campus and they know their teammates and I think this year one thing that separated this year is that we had all three of our captain came in um you don't periods of time\nThroughout the summer to spend time with the guy Jake up here it was here all summer\nA ... year Casper came for a week or from Finland silver and it just spent time with them and I think that means a lot to also because um you know I think that that were we were going to be successful team we have to have a culture where older guys are\nAre extending a hand to her younger guy saying how can I help you\nTelling them they're freshmen pickup pox or things like that you know and I think we've done a lot of work on that uh like Brian did it did a lot of work on that last year by a panel and and I've really been impressed with what our our older guys have done with that\nThis year one more thing as far as the you know the younger guys coming in and you mentioned there's a lot of buzz around um the the recruiting class I think it was ranked second in the country from a recruiting standpoint and coaching standpoint so nice thing to to go out but they still have to prove or when it's on the ice as far as the team itself\nWhat I'm saying that you picked second hockey's the pre season poll fifth on the country I Know it was a coach that means nothing but from a program standpoint\nIt's nice to have Providence College mentioned I was driving in here tonight listening to another station the they ran an ad for BU hockey and they talked about come see blah blah blah including Providence based in northeastern that wouldn't have been the case five years ago\nMost good I mean that the their preseason polls the you know the the\n... when people talk about your recruiting classes things like that I mean that's all based on past it all into in the polls this year you know with the you first they were they won the league last year or so for me and my mind there's a league champion says the top dog until somebody knocks them off and\nThat's what we're going to do um you know but it is for us I mean the ... league in in college hockey where you got to earn it you know you can't you're not going to you're not going to show up and being anybody you're not going to show up and\nAnd just be a good player because uh because you part of Jersey on it or or or because you're playing a certain team or anything like that and\nYou know you look who who have coming up next the Betty Darren ... might have been recruited by one or two schools total and look how good of a player and then all of a sudden he's drafted all of a sudden it was one of the biggest forces in in in our league so um that\nAll that recruitment talk and stuff like that and writing classes that that's for people that you know or outside the game is not really for the people inside the game\nAll right we're going to take a break and ah it's

Driscoll and associate athletic director Steve that but we'll oh well I like this because I Know now be back to when he was just you know work in the ... the souvenir shop at\nThe box that's how far back and I go come alive he certainly has as we sit here Bob I think it's very sitting here we are sitting in the middle the lobby of the remodeled should not read it and we look through the glass and ah you know soccer teams getting ready to play\nA Yukon gear and I think it's a good example of just the transformation if you will of the campus especially on this side of it when it comes to the athletics\nOr more importantly I'm looking up at the\nFor national championship in Boston and that's kind of what we want to do again right so let's just pretty special place and I just punched in the army lucked out there and look look at the stadium and I think I'll far we've come\nIn the last Fifteen Years and we opened up the ruined fire development center this past weekend and that's pretty pretty special as a hundred million dollars with a brand new athletic facilities thanks to a\nDebate work of coach nap and his team to raise the money to do this so it's a pretty special you know as Steve\nYou look at something like the ruins center or even the renovation here or or this um soccer stadium when you first look at it it's a it's a big task but when you look back on how you're able to put the the funding together in that\nI was always told when it comes to sales with relationships correct\nYeah Mike you sit at a exactly how it is it's amazing how when you think about where it started to where we have gone and you know I look at that the key to all of us as people and bottle he says it and I think you know for our fans that are season ticket holders\nI think you know we can't take for granted having\nA guy like ... at the helm of our uh you know every year now we're going into the tournaments and I have a chance to win and see a national championships and if you think about from our fans are season ticket holders are alumni are athletic director to you know young guy like Kyle Murphy one of the best in the business\nPeople are what make things special\nAnd I'm so excited about this weekend our season ticket holders are so excited about our season ticket holder party for opening night Saturday Night I Want this place is packed every night because when you have a special coach team like we have\nMike it coming along you know there's a lot of hard years you were part of them and what he's built here uh we need every body part of the battle because um when that built into Iraq and Iran is one of the best in the country\nWhen I was I was saying to him as a as a coach and you're a former coach yourself Bob [noise] you know you you hear all the preseason polls and as a coach or doesn't mean anything but when you step back in the university and the\nYou know here Providence or you know top five in the nation and you know second in the league and I go back to when that wasn't the case and whether it's from a recruiting standpoint of marketing standpoint just getting it out there but to have a program like this in a like a lot of the other uh programs on campus it just makes it that much better for the school itself\nYeah I just really a tribute to Nate and all the people around him that helped make this happen and we talk all the time that you know you kind of never arrived right you can't rest on your laurels you know we used to be the hunter is now with the hunted\nUh it's a tribute to what NATO is done and\nEverybody in the organization but we want to do that on a consistent basis I mean five in say tournaments that arose unprecedented\nYou know we we have higher standards and that and\nIt takes a lot of hard work so I'm really proud of what NATO is accomplished and just really proud of what the college has accomplished because you know Mike and the old days it wasn't like that were just happened to be there but\nNo longer we want to be the best the best\nAnd I think and I've said this to a lot of people it starts were father Shandling and uh you know runs through yourself and the different coaches you\nYour mates nice hires and those hires whether it's with NATO or with it with the men's basketball program or or different match Kelly what the the women's hockey team and different things and it it all kind of just runs through in the end of the day you look at it here you are sitting a with a\nSchool the size of Providence and the success of so many of the programs or you know you've got to step back and be a little proud of where it's come\nYeah I'm I'm very proud and I've got great teammates and you know coach nap here who is an alumnus of\nProvidence College has had in ...\nWhat's going on here and you know you've got John Sweeney over here it was a CFO he's the guy with the resources and has to let us do these kinds of things but it's very few schools that you actually have a president the CFO chairman of the board of trustees\nThe best fundraising team in the nation somebody that has done this for forty four years and myself was hockey coach a player um it's it's a very very special time but we can't take it for ... you know we've got to keep pushing the edge because people come after fire down now but I Want us to continue to push that way\nTo save fundraising is never easy but given where you're you're at now or is it a little easier when you sit down and have conversations with people today compared to maybe five ten years ago\n[noise] well I like to say I've been to her while Mike is I don't I don't think we fund raise we asked people to invest in what we're doing\nUm and I think that's what makes this so special first off what blessed prior town is an unbelievable fan base I don't care if you didn't go here the people who love this place Mike our our fans are amazing\nI'm In one of the things that you know as Bob just touched on as you've never ride one thing you never want to get his get complacent because that's when you crash and burn and I think what what ... really\nDoes ... amazing job of challenging us every day that his goal is to win a national championship every year and every fan of comes here they should be so fired up to be part of a PC men's ice hockey because his expectations his goals and what he wants us to deliver on\nThat's the way you want for our fans for our players are alumni and I think that's that's all you could ask for what we do in our business is really is a championship organization and the standards high that's why you know Bob and I talk about it is we want we want to give Nate this place rock and every night because he's given us a team that can win a national championship\nAbsolutely well it's an exciting time you go to hockey and basketball both getting going along with other sports and ah [noise] I think it's gonna be another funnier in prior to\nYeah I don't want to thank you
