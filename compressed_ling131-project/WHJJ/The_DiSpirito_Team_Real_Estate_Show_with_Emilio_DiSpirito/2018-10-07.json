positively\nAbsolutely I think there's a lotta times are things just aren't lining up the way you want and you have to just power through it with the positivity\nAbsolutely and you know and and and really like the whole reason why I go\nInto thinking like this is because again I see people out there struggling all the time I'm driving through communities okay and I'm seeing different communities I'm seeing different people and this and that and I'm seeing the way people interact with one another\nAnd I'm really looking at like what is what are the positive trades with positive people what are the negative trades and it's basically all seemed trait it's consistency and the way they're talking the way they're thinking and if it's negative or positive I Want to before I get off the subject I just want to leave you with one thing have you ever heard of Lindsey sterling she's a violinist\nAnd I don't think I have ... you should Google this this girl right Lindsey sterling okay she's got a

estate simplified we're in the studio right now with Courtney hotter with energy monster as well as most people you know we're going to law and this is your show by the way for everything real estate so if you're just tuning in now\nWe're talking about buying selling protecting your home what to do to maintain its value all that useful information\nRight now coordinate with energy monsters here talking about residential ear ceiling services what does that mean\nSo air sealing um is not the ceiling and Bob us we're talking about I'm feeling up all the draft and the air leaks in your home\nUh it's a high impact energy efficiency upgrade Boca so if you have drafted a air leaks in the home um and you go ahead and you see them up that's one of the ways you're going to see the most drastic savings on your energy that was awesome um\nWhenever there's a difference in the air temperature between inside and outside and you'll have air trying to escape your house caused by pressure\n'em and common leaks are found around gaps in your electrical and plumbing outlets gaps in your door frames around your chimneys and other areas in your home including um duct work if you have ducks\nThe draft and the air leaks in your home can account for thirty percent or more of your home heating and cooling does wow so that's definitely one of the most important ways that you can save is to ensure that you don't have draft and you're like in your home\nUm one way that you can be short is to have an energy assessment with energy monster will come out and will actually look throughout your whole home for any of those drafted air leaks and recommends peeling them up for you and Massachusetts at that absolutely no cost to you I'm In here in Rhode Island uh the insulation is an air sealing has also repeated\nThe uh the energy assessment is free\nRather than it's at no cost tick technically because you pay for it every month on your utility bills a national grid ever source Columbia gas and you know tell customers\nMy energy monster dot com by the way to Florida Connecticut Rhode Island Massachusetts my energy ... heard here on the radio please absolutely\nOn and now the air sealing typically goes hand in hand with insulation on which through the energy efficiency programs here in mass and Rhode Island um it's also genuinely a rebate it for him a insulation is definitely the most important part of managing comfort in energy consumption in your home\nUh the purpose of insulation is to prevent heat transfer\nLike a blanket for your home mhm so it's going to keep that warm air inside and the cold air outside especially here in New England without coming winter\nI'm now how can you tell if your homes insulated obviously we can't see through walls you don't have X ray vision um but when you have that no cost home energy assessment our guys are trained 'em to used thermal imaging cameras which are going to detect all the heat loss drafts the air leaks in your home\nAnd let you know exactly how much more you're going to need in order to you know reached that our value and maintain the most energy or value now our value is resistance value and that's how much on\nThe heat is resisting to be transferred\nSo the more our value the more resistance the less he transferred the greater inflated your home is going to be ... and there's different our values for a different states for different parts of states close to the water you might need more our value on and there's different types of insulation to reach those goals\nOn you can use fiberglass insulation\nAlone in cellulose are those are part of the programs that's what I'm the most energy efficient and that's what you're going to get the incentives and rebates on here in Rhode Island a national grid rebates you up to four thousand dollars to do that work in your home\nIn Massachusetts on its Seventy five percent off with no cap\nSo it was ... and no brainer as ... um\nYou know with winter coming up we
