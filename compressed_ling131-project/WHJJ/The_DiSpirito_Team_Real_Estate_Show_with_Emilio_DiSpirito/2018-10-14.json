O. L. A. yes\nA much more problematic dangerous even because they eat the roots of plants and of course the vegetable garden now or if you want to have a little bit of fun yeah for the late fall and in a wonderful wonderful healthy\nHealthful a product or to grow is garlic\nGarlic and garlic you have a window between now and probably mid November just so hot neck Gallic which was is the uh preferable type here in New England and a producer wonderful crop it'll probably be ready about mid summer so um\nThose are two heads up I think that are important for fall God this Marion seekonk you're up next to Jim Hi Mary\nHow are you I'm wow\nHey I just had a question if you ever heard of shouldn't bug\nTinge pogs cage changed parties are a little flying criticize the adults that\nAre usually um prevalent in the late summer late summer months and one of the best I'm Tess actually for change bugs is around dusk\nTo use the headlights of an automobile or to cast across the lawn area and I changed parties in infestation will be a parent because you'll see the adult change parties flying all hovering just above the turf grass\nReally ... and and ... and ... and the other way to test for change bugs is to put out a a small container of water\nAnd see if the judge bugs or get a trapped in the in the water and that's an indication because of the density of the insects you know the amount that you capture\nWhether or not you have a problem big enough to uh address I'll tell you Mary ah in my experience of over the years ah especially with turf ... problems I have found very few actual\nA chinchilla ... infestations most of them have been a misdiagnose and uh the uh results of other insects or disease problems\n... is not a widespread insect problem but if you've been diagnosed with ... by a qualified turf specialist then of course you need to take appropriate measures and those usually include\nA insecticides most of what you're potentially toxic uh and and not safe not helpful but there's one product that is made by a company called ...\n... makes a grand yellow turf insecticide that is a hundred percent organic it's made with the essential oils of different types of plants that kill and repel insects\nAnd they lace the uh the ground corn cob a granular material with these oils and put it together a in a package so that it's refined and you can\nMeasure it out like the lawn chemicals and put it in a spread a and use it on your lawn\nAnd I'm telling you marry it works better than any other lawn care products I have ever used in terms of being an insecticide and it's so safe you can use it with your bare feet you could spread it with your bare feet\nAnimals can walk on it and look it up I'm Sorry\nWith adults would be good for grad\n... good for grubs because uh it will repel the Beatles that lay the eggs that become the gripes rubs themselves are below the ground level\nSo they would not be affected but\nThe let's say the Japanese beetle would be much less likely to lay the eggs in any area that's been treated with this echoes my product you can find it online and they had good nurseries everywhere\nComes in a bag it's called ... and it's great for fleas and ticks and a ... ... ... ... and all kinds of insects that spanned a part of their life cycle in the turf grassy area\nIt's a wonderful product it's a hundred percent safe and it really does work really does work one of the\n... Iran has all these round spots of debt and it just keeps getting bigger and bigger it does that sound like a ...\nI'm I'm thinking that instead if you have these irregular patches on the lawn\nAnd you don't have definite evidence of change bog activity or grubs which you can easily a determined by digging out a portion of the of the brown area adjacent to the Green Bay area\nAnd you know what Mary again\nMisinformation regarding grub activity I'm most lawns everywhere have some grub count but even professional ... manages\nA light Rob infestation because it's just not dangerous there's only so much a roots or grass or damage that a grub can do consider its size and it's not around that long\nMost of the time those brown spots are attributable to a disease of turf disease called brown patch\nAnd you need a fungus side\nA lawn fungus side to arrest brown patch hey we got to go and uh if you need more information you can always email\nAmerican dash landscape dot com for more information for more information about the chores you can ... seven eight one seven eight four five eight five eight that seven eight one Seventy four five eight five eight\nOr again American thank you Mary American dash landscape dot com see you next week and don't forget a tour is on the age\nOut what to buy or would object is it a pre ... so you want to do a pre list home inspection you want to have a home inspector come on in and they can uh pretty much let us know where all the red flags\nAre if there's a leaky roof leaky pipes or you know\nUm if there is some issues with the electrical system if there's past issues okay\nAll those things we want to talk about and get done up front it's actually a pretty minor investment compared to the money that you will lose if you don't do that stuff and again if you're not in a position to do that we're going to put together a tailor planned for you call me for one three five nine to three three eight\nWe can get you started okay or make sure that the buyers can finance your home this is you should have [laughter]\nSo uh unless a buyer unless your home is over the price point of like what four fifty fix or four Seventy five somewhere around there\nThis this one won't really go towards them so much but I'm Talking about homes under that that that F. ha price line onto that what is it for fifty ... fifties have been more ... four hundred and three four hundred and fifty seven thousand dollars in Rhode Island it's different from state to state but let's just call for Seventy five and under\nThis is for you okay if you're home under four Seventy five you need to make sure that you're home can qualify for F ha financing Rhode Island's housing if you're in Rhode Island I'm\nA veteran financing because a huge chunk of the market and that price range is coming in looking at homes\nAnd some areas that you need to pay special attention to our broken or missing hand rails if there's any mould led um bars on the window SARS and the window and also if there's any chipping paint things like that health and safety issues and the ... list home inspection from step number one will come and really handy here\nIn your real estate professional can go through that with you\nA first impressions are the last thing impressions this is number three ... basically in order to get the highest sales price in your home I have realized throughout\nThe thousand or so homes that I've been involved with selling when buyers walk up to a house if they see that the law on the grass is is high and if they see that there's shipping paint all around the front if the first impression is a poor impression\nThey're going to run for the hills or they're ... they're going to be turned off right away okay at ... the ... are part of the first impression as well well the ... yeah absolutely earlier than I have to go listing engine that's going to make a listing age innocent showing up and flip flops\nAnd I I got to tell you I mean when I see that stuff it really kills me sometimes like you're selling someone's most ... important asset and you are wearing shorts and flip flops get\nOutta here get outta here I mean some some some realtors may object to it that that's okay that's your style or but it wouldn't be okay if I was listening home I Want my real during the suit and I've heard a lot of a\nLot of your customers say that after they want to hire us as we go up to work show up to work and show is your first impression yeah first impression is everything making that\nThey needed to you're wearing a suit right now\nAll right so um so yeah so make sure the status of the property are are are really in great shape I got to tell you the best the best bang for your buck\nFor the front of a home is obviously like I said cutting your lawn\nPutting a new roof on that's the only area into your house where you get a hundred percent return on investment okay so\nIf you need a new roof again there's a way to price if you can't afford to do that but if you can't afford to do it absolutely do it put that new roof on go thirty here don't go twenty or single\nThe differences nominal now walking into the house of fresh coat of neutral colors in your home\nIs going to do wonders if you walk in and you got the pink carpet and the pink walls or if you've got you know odd color walls or if you got to pay color that you thought was awesome but buyers are not going to like you're really hurting your home value\nSo I Would suggest to go to to you know Lowe's Home Depot Sherman Williams wherever asked for neutral color palette\nAsk them what colors are hot right now and paint the home accordingly and you want to make sure to stay within the lines do not do a crappy amateur job and hit the ceiling with the paint brought a God and make sure this thing looks clean because the first thing they look at our the paint the walls the ceilings\nThe floors and if those are a mess they're going to look at the rest of the house is being Mickey Mouse when you\nPut your house in the market you and you have let's just a downsized amount of buyers down to like ten viruses tend buyers and you have a house that has pink turquoise\nOrange ... like crazy blues or whatever in the house yeah\nYou you you're looking at ten buyers ... hopefully find one that that's going to deal with it and then ... fix it on the end yeah whereas if you have a whole new true colors all those ten buyers are probably going to be able to be okay with the baby was actually you know so you just you just said okay ten people now that don't have a reason\nNot to buy the house even one person that is okay with pink intercourse or whatever so going to be okay with the new ... will make it painted turquoise\nHalf of course because they can throw their thinking turquoise over right so why not why not marketed to everybody that's okay with ... absolutely yeah you're going to want to make sure and and and also de clutter in stage make sure that your property is really you know picture picture ready okay\nI went to an open house this weekend and there was a and the ... the ... the woman had and most publications over the and I'm like you've got people walking through your house who's to say when nobody is not what can I just not grabbing like people are crazy and grabbing whatever medication that there is I I didn't look\nAt a medic al ... says yeah medication if yeah if you're going to say I was put all that important software\nFlux itself up absolutely number four on here running a time number four don't inflate your homes price okay several months ago a year ago you could inflate the price uh anticipating the up and coming market\nNow at this point in time prices have plateaued homes that need work are declining and price you need to make sure that you are on at market value\nAnd the best case scenario and you're going to think I'm Crazy for this but I promise you it works is to price you're home a tad bit under\nFair market value okay now will go through this and make sure that you feel comfortable with this but let me give you an example recently Middletown Rhode Island okay\nNow Middletown I Would say is a little bit more of a seasonal market right yeah okay we just recently lifted of property that could have sold for a two twenty to thirty max we just recently lifted at one eighty nine nine it needed a ton of work\nI'm Talking everything needs to make it on and on our end where the work right yeah yeah yeah but it it's in a neighborhood with higher priced homes we had eleven offers fifty seven showings ... offers on this thing and it's going it's selling sixty thousand dollars over and selling at two hundred and fifty thousand dollars okay\nIf you would have lifted that property at two hundred and fifty whatever heard crickets you would have got nothing moving mortgage gets I don't I'm not so sure but but I got to tell you there's a way to do this stuff and make sure you're speaking to a professional any questions that I'll call me for zero one three five nine to three three eight\nFour zero one three five nine to three three eight or you could go to my dream home now\nDot com and one more dope posture on an offer for an offer comes in when it comes in especially if it's a couple of weeks that have gone by where you've been on the market and you only have one offer on the table don't expect the multiple beds anymore okay unless you're pricing your home a little under fair market value\nAnd your home is perfectly turn key or have the crazy view other than that don't expect multiple bids anymore in this market and when an offer comes in\nBreak the ocean sand and blew it up and made Ireland\nIreland yeah islands and that might be they might last for billions of years\nWhere it might not a civilian almost anything I don't know I make it even way more real estate hill like by it was like well there either I totally agree there's another thing\nToo for for buyers out there right now I'm ... it's ... you're having a little bit less competition because there's more inventory\nSo finally there's more homes for us to select from and I have noticed working with my ... meant that you know those buyers that got extremely upset because there was no homes to choose from our now pretty happy because now they have several homes to choose from and there's actually a few\nFewer buyers out there from what I see as well\nYeah um I you know I I think that\nThere's fewer unqualified buyers so like like not to ... and I want to do you mean like I feel like I'm I'm talk I'm spending more time with people that that qualify right away yes and less time we're like so it's by pool thirty applications in a in a month ...\nTwenty of him or need work you need ... and like need you know a guy in there and in\nAnd but then that there's time that are really ... uh\nYou know strong buyers that are ruined you get a pre approval it right away and whatnot we still take care of those are the twenty buyer of course we nurture and we got him guidance coming up anything in a few months and months put 'em on a track put 'em in the calendar you know get them in touch with certain people that are going to improve the situation that ... that I I came to myself\nIf I can do it myself absolutely one hundred percent help you out but so ... and so what I'm\nSeeing is that in ... instead of me pans pulling thirty and getting the thirty three percent capture yep I'm pulling Fifteen and still getting the same ten wow that's great you know so that's kind of where I'm seeing right now um and I think it's just I I don't know I I'm not sure why but that's where I'm anytime\nThere's a little bit of a shift in anything people kind of want to watch and see we also do have elections coming up some people are a little leery during the election season\nI really don't think it's going to matter so so much I mean who knows um but at the end of the day I mean homeownership over the course of time as always been the best investment any I have always oh any kind of real estate\nYeah you know when you do it right to do it right and it and they're short term goals which is to get into a house and then there's long term goals so and which is to like you know are you going to buy another how soon are you going to ... um are you going to a being a hair short term and um or you investing like what's the\nWhat's the overall thing and if you talk to one of our um uh uh partners on the radio show Greg rice he he's amazing at going out and in in capturing real estate deals and getting\nIn by investment properties and then he's you know ... willing to refinance and play the game just to get a day or you know\nBut as you own it you won't you can take you can you're you're in control when you refinance and when you add all\nYour property has to buy a proper nothing no not one mortgage that I've ever sold in my entire career is has any pre payment penalty or you're locked in besides like Rhode Island housing loan that you have to be locked in for five years ... penalties that's the only one that I read it yeah it's a ... that's like the only one but the the majority of them\nYou can restructure the mortgage that anytime\nWow that's good stuff man how can somebody read too as they are I mortgage guy dot com they are a mortgage guy dot
