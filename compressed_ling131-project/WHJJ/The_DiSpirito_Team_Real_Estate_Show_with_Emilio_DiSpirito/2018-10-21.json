food Web as well and uh the the the problem is a folks that in addition\nTo the steep decline of amphibians there's also\nA mass of crisis in some cases across Europe as much as fifty percent define fifty per cent decline of insect activity insect activity\nNow I Know many people will say that that's a welcome statistic than fifty percent of the insects ... those creepy crawly a or flying insects a will be diminished but\nInsects are I'm\nA for healthy eco system and to reduce the quantity of insects the population of insects by fifty percent is a consummate to a a a crisis\nAnd an indication that are eco system as a gone significantly arrive\nAnd of course this goes down the food chain and the pollinators and the whole thing is just um it's a an unhealthy\nBut fifty percent of the huge number a for insects to be diminished and I think if you uh\nSpend any amount of time outdoors you'll agree that the number of insects that you see and you encounter\nIs far fewer now than even a recently the case John and not Smithfield your next with Jim Hi John\nHi Jen how are ya I'm well thank you [noise]\nUm I I have a question about a candle Eli cell [noise] um I I I got 'em all over my yard grow them in high demand the winter and I haven't had good luck are storing them and they they dry out and some of them survived but a lot of them go I'm just wondering what the best way I can start them and and and now\nI'm I'm guessing if you're a good time to take a man before\nIt yes yeah exactly right about now when they uh feel the effects of a a a real frost on the foliage begin to be a damaged a is a sign that they should be dog and\nBrought indoors now just have to ask John ... these are plants in pots or in the in the ground in the ground\nOkay so plants around I treated much the same as a dad is and for those of our listeners that are not familiar with cameras\nCameras are from a sub tropical regions of the world that have a huge uh pointed flight leaves in fact they used as a food source\nIn some parts of the world about the leaves and the truth is that they grow from and are these choose to ... looked like almost a giant ... like like the sweet potato or not you will that are in the ... in the soil\nThat the the sprouts the shoots emanates from\nAnd uh they're frequently divided\nBy a dissecting these are two Bruce roots in the spring retaining at least one or two of the eyes to make new plants\nAnd a half you dust them with a copper coil solve a fungus I'd let them try out for a day or two a but but store in them is pretty easy and uh we do this uh\nEvery year at the nursery a hundreds of them are and and the process is pretty simple you dig them up and you put them in a cool\nDry place a away from direct sunlight and after they die back completely you cut the crops from the tumors are within a four or six inches and remove the access soil\nThen you store them inside\nDust off peat moss or\nWood shavings in a cardboard boxes for the winter and just check on them from time to time uh to make sure they don't become completely desiccated so you you get\n... a sprinkle a little with a little water and keep them on a dock place and then towards spraying you'll see the the shoots will begin to grow and that's a sure sign\nThat they could be divided into all potted at that time okay\nYou're going to ask you one more when you when you're taking me when you take them out of the ground you shake it off you got to you\nKnow wait wait wait and let the dirt dry up and then let it fall away more easily from the tube is\nOkay great All right John thank you John for your call okay yeah you have a great Sunday and uh oh before\nWe leave now we're very special guest Malcolm to Jerry from cafe bon ami good morning Malcolm mind Jim how are you sir

right out front and uh as I've sort of tell people I'm half the\nPurpose of the trip is to me about them and Jerry and looking forward to it and we'll bring in a lot of our friends so\nThat would end in Massachusetts big but when we're looking at the big picture inventory is increasing there's more homes on the market right now but what else is increasing you'll be talking about next segment interest rate interest rates interest rates are increasing so what's happening is it's becoming more of a balanced market also pushing more towards\nA buyer's market which means\nBuyers now have more of an ability to negotiate terms in price that fit their needs more than the one sided seller's market okay\nYeah it's it's it's reassuring off real ...\nAnd ... it will it will I mean it's consumers are actually still very confident out there now home sellers was quickly talk with you about this why this is still\nReally a fantastic time because rates or not they're not at the five point seven five per se as we anticipate they will be next year at this time the homes are still affordable for buyers where there are ... there's a ton of buyers out there and the buyers that were so Pete off\nRight when they couldn't find anything are now back working with them again real estate agents the smart ones are calling the buyers their clients and hey jump on it and you know we've got thirty forty percent more inventory in this area than before\nThat's huge okay so big stuff good stuff there for homebuyers as well as home sellers a K A balance market it's a win win\nTo high quality died ... number three was the balance market when when I forgot I wrote that out of touch upon a little bit better than a minute number two high quality real estate experience Ashley what happens\nWhat happens when you when you have a such a fantastic easy seller's market where you can just lift the property and and it sells what happens from the bias point of view or they might have to\nQuestion but how so everyone things that you know it's a push to sow and then you have\nThe buyers fears of okay am I paying too much or what happened to the market crashes like I hear all of these things that are needed from people's mouths like now it's just a different time and it will rebalance again but I think again Sally think okay did I miss the boat and now it's a fantastic time this\nYou are correct there's one other thing that happens\nEvery one and their mother and father and uncle and sister and brother wanna jump into real estate and become a real estate agent so what you then have there right now there's over two million real estate agents in this country\nTo ... million license to real estate agents okay there's so many real estate agents and it's so it was so easy you just had to\nList the property and it would sell now ... real estate is one of those professions that is it's a fantastic opportunity and there's some people that they want to go in and and so three or five houses a year and that's fine\nYou know as as long as they answer the cause do their job read up on stuff there's nothing wrong with that\nBut there is an over abundance of people that make that give the industry a bad name because they're not picking up the phone\nThey're they're they don't know what they're doing they don't have the mentor ship and then people look at real estate agents as a whole as a negative type of profession and I got to tell you that buyers and sellers alike are going to have a far better experience because my prediction is this\nAn out the market's going oh yeah my prediction is about thirty percent of the current real estate agents there now and are gonna be gone in and it's okay because the the stronger ones are going to de ... okay the stronger ones are going to stay and they're going to give really fantastic service\nTo their clients and provide of value\nAnd it's going to be better overall for the consumers\nThis happens you know every ten years yeah absolutely and it's it's a good at it that experience honestly it's a good thing that\nI give anyone credit that wants to become real estate agent give them a ton of credit it is it's not an easy gig I mean no job is really easy to think about it all has stuff that's good and bad\nUh and and I give the most credit to the ones that that day with it stick with it fight through the first six months the first year\nLike look at our producer Christina over here right she she is always hustling okay I could not call her a part time real because I Know she works forty plus hours a week at both job she's Clinton\nOver eighty hours a week I see her right in emails taking calls doing her thing she's on top of it that's that's type work\nAt ... now that's not the age she you know HDTV have become a real time because we make it look easy that is work\nBut I'm Talking about that person that it was like well you know what\nI'm just I don't have anything else to do some I guess I'm going to\nYou know half or or I work my full time job sixty hours a week in an office I Can't pick up my phone\nI'm so but you know what I really want to do this 'cause everyone's making a killing making money\nWrong idea that's the wrong reasons for going into it and that gives the consumers and overall bad experience moving on to number three\nA balanced market is a win win situation okay so we are now more or less than a balance market more markets than non here in Rhode Island and Massachusetts areas right and the balance market allows buyers to purchase allows sellers to sell and reasonable times\nSo these are all three reasons why I Believe that this housing market is fantastic\nIt is a wonderful market you know and I I don't know how many times people asked and they probably continue did they say okay well neither am I getting away from the market if that\nPrediction that the market's going to crash now it just means that were coming back to norm norm ... normal two years ago so we're just back norm and so you just have to change the mindset and accept\nDeath we got to understand as well why the market has crashed before what caused the market to crash before and over fifty percent of the loans that were getting out okay we're sub prime meaning that they were pretty much almost guaranteed to fail\nYou add one out of every two buyers purchasing homes that were hardly qualified not qualified that were purchasing homes what do you think is going to happen\nNothing now I mean where so highly regulated that lean ... everyone in the industry learned from that mistake and and now you know it's not going to fail proof that don't can't control things but it is much better again\nYeah absolutely so thank you actually appreciate all that and put state soon we're going to be right back with Ashley boarded with residential mortgage services she's going to be talking about how to prepare to buy to\nKnow what ... what does that you could start with the think of other things that starts wouldn't be a\nWho cares about the other thing is for you that that's something that we could be used for you that's the best we can be used for your stuff that we can beat you played you please Euclid starts with the\nYeah they paid for that to retirement factory and I'm David eleven AM [noise]\nFrom my family county board of elections by phone from former ... or ... or ...

[noise]\nRadio nine twenty present\nYou're the good\nMorning they are tuning into the roundtable real estate simplified this is Emilio disparate over the despair do team and we're here today\nWas really great professionals we're gonna be talking with Peter George with Peter George public speaking and uh he's got to tell us basically why it is necessary to use the right body language in tone when talking in any environment especially a sales environment\nUm but in the studio with us I also have to introduce besides Peter I have to introduce Ashley born with residential mortgage services\nLike good how are you\nGood Peter thanks for joining us again pleasure to be here it's great to have you here and um you know for those that don't know Peters also my\nPersonal um public speaking coach so we're coming along way slowly but surely they will get there yeah [laughter] so what so or the the thought of the day the tip of the day Peter go ahead what what's on your mind would you want to ...\n... ... people often think of public speaking as being on stage or in a meeting business meeting of the like ... and they forget that it's really when you're speaking with anybody\nShould only be one on one and I see a lot of people who may have even taken sales training which I highly condone it is very worthwhile but what happens is they don't\nLearn how to use the body and the tone of their voice\nTo foster and supplement\nThe sales training that they learn so their bodies might even be trade them okay and when you give us an example yeah let's let's take Ashley's profession oh I'm just sitting there if someone wants to a mortgage\nAnd they're sitting across from a mortgage originator and that originated or has the hands under the table now no one's going to sit across from the originator and say thank you\nAnd say oh my God she has her hands under the table this doesn't feel right no one's going to do that but they might walk away saying I didn't feel comfortable I don't know why I didn't feel comfortable cat I didn't feel comfortable and the reason for that is psychologically\nYour hands under the table or especially guys standing there with their hands in their pockets and we can't see someone scans yeah it's a signal of Mr ... what are they hiding okay so when you have especially someone in the financial industry ... hiding the hands of people don't feel as comfortable\nAs true so their body language when they're helping people by providing a mortgage or making a sale or selling a car or whatever it might be\nWhen their body language betrays than people walk away and again they're not saying oh my God the person did this that's not it but they are walking away saying I didn't feel comfortable with this person is I did with that person it's good to know that makes sense\nAnd this is why I end up working with sales people as well as executives and the like so they can learn how to do this and they learn to use their voice to get their point across when they're making that sale helping in assisting someone to purchase especially a major purchase like a car or housing or really anything\nHuge or how does tone come into play when you know when when you're working with somebody on let's talk again about financial somebody like a real estate agent or a mortgage broker or financial planner\nTone is huge it's like any anything else is going to be a component of this it they all work together\nAnd your tone of voice makes a difference and I've even spoken with some real estate people were all I'll say when someone walks into a house if you guys still do open houses and and I absolutely walks into the house is a difference between high ... and good morning yeah I'd rather get the good more different right it's a different tone\nIs all fake we often think of lower tones being more sincere more with you and you know there's more genuine\nOnly sang I\nMean if\nYou're going to take it personally in this area don't take that first talking about you actually have\nYou ever want to see how this actually works in in real life\nYou can go on and just Google a Margaret Thatcher was the prime minister of England in the eighties I Believe\nAnd when she started her career her tone was higher and she realized she wasn't getting the respect that she thought she deserved really and she worked with a voice coach for I Believe six months\nAnd you ... they'll show it when you Google this they'll show before and after and then the picture of her voice comes down so that tone makes a difference how we we do things\nAnd I know that when I get excited or are happy about some to my voice goes oh yeah and I don't have a real low voice you know we always think of those radio voices that are real low and look how much credibility we build George B one on one get that oil radio voice yeah that's why they call it that\nScale people have to learn to practice it really bad at it I wouldn't think about that\nWhen I go on stage my voice drops in my last of my head a little like you know it's funny how it just happens but when I normally speaks probably up here\nYeah but when I'm On stage it'll drop down a law that's funny like this so totally makes a difference you voice or the way you use your hands all of this state sitting up straight basically everything your mother told you yeah what you want to use\nThat's great advice I got a question for you what about when your heart is racing to re actually like right when you say you're sitting in front of a client All right let's say you could be in front of a client you could be on a date you could be in front of a stage in front of a crowd of people your heart's racing how how do you keep a calm\nA voice first thing you want to do is understand why it's raising its racing because of your adrenalin okay your adrenal glands say [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The DiSpirito Team Real Estate Show with Emilio DiSpirito",
