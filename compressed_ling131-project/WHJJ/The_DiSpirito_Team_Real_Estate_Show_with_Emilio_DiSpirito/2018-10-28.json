present\nMorning thanks for tuning in here with us today on the roundtable real estate simplified no you know the show is not only about real estate it's about community and it's about us\nAs humans doing what we feel is right we're talking business sometimes we're talking with some thought leaders and on the line with us today I'm really excited about this gentleman his name is mark ... and he has a podcast called humans to point out one of the top one hundred pod cast right now being played\nAnd without further ado mark welcome to the roundtable\nMeal yeah thank you so much for having me on and that they each everyone out there for ...\nHey you're very much welcome I I enjoy your podcast and you know basically from what I gather and you know you can answer this bass but humans to a point oh is it from what I get is a pod cast where you interview people who are the catalyst of positive change would that would you say that's accurate\nCatalysts that positive change and the people out there that are actually creating results and walking the walk I talked to people that have created billions of dollars and well there are creating ventures around the world that are fundamentally redefining our problem the day and that's what I think it may be a human to point out that\nThat's awesome now I'm going to take a page out of your book mark okay how do you spend your time on planet earth\n[laughter] I Love this question man\nThe way that I spend my time on planet earth like I Would say the main ... the hurt me is just constantly understanding\nAs a kid I was you know kind of labeled as shy kid and and what I learned that that actually gave me the superpower of observing understanding other people's behaviors and intern kind of the second part of\nLife is the creation side so now that I understood that concept in my own mind how can I create something and pull something out of me so that the other mine mine that's next to me can then start to understand something as well and maybe start to benefit\nI'm just a I'm a Twenty one year old guy I run a business I run a pod cast I Do some consulting I've been doing some speaking\nAnd overall it's all about how to why how do we upgrade that's how I spend my time you know\nI Love that I Love the way you think I Love the the energy that you bring to the table and the fact that you're more concerned about the value you can bring versus what you can get and that's huge that's the biggest thing right now and I think people are really waking up to that and I think there's this huge wide awakening around not only in the United states but the world\nIn in forms of like like content that makes sense that has now you in giving back to get I think that's really great that you said that now I Want to touch upon the fact that you've said you were shy kid\nBecause I was too and it's so funny like that the ... the shy people sometimes like you said are pretty observant and that has ... I agree with you a hundred percent that's absolutely allowed me to observe others as well and the kind of figure out\nHow how people interact with one another and kind of the right ways of doing things were the wrong way of doing things so that was pretty cool that you said that\nYeah yeah man I might think a lot of the people that I talk to just one that pops out from example at my lab he he was also a a shy kid and because you have that\nMay be um you know under dog you're not as equipped as everybody else in your mind depending on the individual you start practicing different things and you actually become better than other people\nAt my life now is one of the top speakers he's the fifth the wealthiest person under fifty and really just all the people that I ended up talking to a meal on my pod cast\nHave really just reaffirmed this concept of if you've got a problem if you've got an obstacle if you've got an issue in your life\nThat's actually not the thing that's holding you down you know and as soon as you shift your perspective and get your mindset right you actually discover that it's your biggest power and it's going to be the advantage to everyone else around you\nAbsolutely it's all mindset everything we do from the start of the day when we wake up to when we go to bed what we think and what we attract to us is really huge\nUm now now aside from the humans two point oh podcast which is fantastic and by the way for our listeners I strongly suggest that you check this out you can Google humans two point oh and it'll come up on ice tunes on Google stitch or I mean all the major platforms\nMarks marks humans two point oh is on their mark aside from that\nWhat um what is your business about I'm curious\nYeah so my business is a digital growth agency and the virtual augmented and mixed reality industry for those that don't know [laughter]\nVirtual reality is um you know you really just put a headset on your eyes and you're immersed in this\nThree the virtual environment a lot of people know what four games but today the military is using it to treat veterans that peak yes he some of the biggest corporations in the world like Wal Mart are already using it to train their employees\nBecause it's actually cheaper and it increases efficiency and augmented reality is\nSnapchat filters ... go in the grand when you're taking those digital objects and you're putting them in the real world\nAnd my business helps those companies how to best communicate their message on line specially in an industry that is it really well established yeah I'm going to be mainstream and the next five ten Fifteen Years\nThat's fantastic so like real estate now I'm noticing that people are using augmented reality to stage home so we can literally take an empty home and we can stage it with different pieces of furniture and save our clients thousands of dollars I'm going to have to talk with you off here about this and kind of pick your brain\nOr sometime to what you suggest or if maybe if that's something you can help us it's real interesting now what about as far as you're speaking does it it seems so you do public speaking what types of uh\nWhat what are you talking about when you're going out there\nYeah man that's a great question so this is very new for me I'm at the beginning of this month I ended up going to\nNew York city Manhattan and um I ended up doing an event at this way then um community\nEvents and it was just awesome because we were talking about authenticity and thought leadership and how to stand out not lose your authenticity and I also had the chance to go to Manhattan College and be on a panel with the head of strategy at Microsoft\nDiscussing the speed of innovation not only in technology but also in the global mindset that people have today's age\nCongratulations that's big I hear what was your biggest takeaway from that\n[noise] my biggest takeaway from that man is honestly that there is so much opportunity because nobody is still you know despite the fact that we're in twenty eight keen on a lot of people are now on social media now people not pod cast iron and this and that\nThe amount of white space the amount of opportunity that is still there that hasn't even started his mind blowing\nSo like for me my biggest takeaway was just like really understanding the marathon that I'm running here and understanding how far I'm going to be ahead of everybody especially because I'm Twenty one and I already have my head screwed on right in terms of\nGlobal scale in terms of global impact just for an example yesterday my business\nHow to keep it how to ditch one is for why you need it while you might not important stuff we're going to be right back here on news radio nine twenty if the roundtable real estate's fine I'm\nMostly uh\nFirst [noise]\nHi how are you planning on line [noise] um\n[noise] News I'm Karen McHugh eleven men and women killed and Saturday

for all things real estate Saturday mornings at eleven AM W. L. E. C. C. team can so without further ado Michael stay or out of Nashville, Tennessee what's going on like\nMan I don't even know about what up man thank you for the intro the span of that little bit we actually just like to ask them as well as many coins or Easter you on a on a point where you have to paint and WNYC eleven AM on Saturday morning but just the way I put that as well\nWhat's the website\nOr money man like that that much money may have Mike Dinah my dot at ... All right Michael embrace book one of my Mac radio my ... you know go ahead\nI I gotta I gotta ask your question man yeah\nMany buyers like paying them I didn't even know what am I as\n[laughter] no none of my buyers like paying mortgage insurance\nNo and and for people that are listed that not exactly sure where more insurance let's define at real risk because if you listen to my show I hate to church you know basically a necessary evil and they were sometimes by our house and I preach against mortgage insurance mortgage is a is a\nA insurance policy that you're paying for in case you default so you're paying for an insurance policy on behalf of all in their ... to faults and that's what more dish aren't this a lot of people confuse it with a homeowner's insurance\nIt's not the same thing now went as mortgage insurance required Morgan assurances required when you don't have ... percent down ... down on your\nHouse and this is\nA big area computer for consumers because a lot of consumer still think they need twenty percent just to buy a house ... and that's just not true you can do on a personal finance you get away with ... percent now sometimes a little one and a half percent down\nThere's tons of options but when you knew that it comes with ... and I always grudge against that or hey let's find the lowest\nPossible cost a little as possible way to deal with ... and when you go with it that makes a lot of it is what it is you go along you have a buyout of it\nYou can do what's called a single premium so you have a much smaller ... okay does increase your closing costs but you look at your payment payment lower because you don't have not yet my involved in it yeah and\nWhen you look at it over the course of the next three four or five years you're going to save a ton of money because it's like going to Costco fans or any other kind of wholesale discount chain store on line yeah you pay a lower rate than what the average person does so that's a couple of ways to do it and\nBut then there's also times where you want to pay my mortgage insurance so that's where people honest it back when they listen to me talk about him I and they're like you're saying I Want to pay the mortgage insurance [laughter]\nDid you smoke I ... up one of the the other and here's why you know [noise]\nIf you've got a buyer who thinks they can't buy\nBecause they gotta have twenty percent down they're going to continue\nTo ... they're going to miss out on the property appreciation the whole nine yards and what rivers don't realize is they're paying a mortgage whether the fares are somebody else's they're paying a mortgage so you go out there and buy a house and you don't have to sit down let's say you have sometimes have that at one percent of the ...\nThe point yeah you don't get on the market\nAnd buy a house and the numbers that we like to use like a thousand dollar purchase\nAt in five years that probably going to be worth it to the grand more states are run appreciation rates and even some of the national is lower rates and that's a comfortable appreciation of what that profit is going to be worse in five years mhm so\nYou would have spent over a five year period yeah my ... six thousand six hundred dollars on that purchase round numbers that will change from one ... to the next but sure these are the numbers were you to get by for to be over the next\nFive years you pay a total of sixty six hundred dollars and if I ... I probably ... or ... more knocked him ... down on the principle every month as well so you're able to enact we both ways I pay down your principal and equity appreciation\nSony subtract out just a simple map of hey I've paid sixty six hundred bucks from my equity gain a grand ...\nForty three thousand dollars ... three thousand dollars to your ... well if you're renting all you have is a highly ... today versus five years ago so in situations like this\nIf you're thinking that you need to stay on the sideline because you don't want to pay will get insurance you don't have twenty percent down here most of the game\nI hear your your message out and free money free equity free ownership [noise] that's why it's so important to talk to somebody like us that knows what's going on in understanding him I understand the bigger picture it and really act we retire well there's you can't just get hung up on the fact that\nI don't have twenty percent down and I don't mind\nYeah absolutely Mike ... I'm going to say about a year and a half ago maybe closer to years ago I had a client his name was John\nHe started his home searches buying this first home he was looking at do I do a hundred percent you know Rhode Island housing type of financing or do I go ahead and go with F. ha or conventional\nI suggested in his loan officer suggested go with the three percent conventional mortgage because your home is going to appreciate and when it does and when you own twenty percent equity in this property you can write the bank and ask for a brokers price opinion of BP oh\nAnd then they send out a broker that's connected to that bank they go ahead and basically appraise your home and when you are in a twenty percent equity position\nYou can go ahead and get rid of mortgage insurance\nSo I only have not even two years later this gentleman now has zero mortgage insurance he is now\nTaking that money that he was paying for mortgage insurance and now ... in his principal only balance he is literally gonna knock probably about ten years\nOf interests off of his mortgage by doing this in in his ... his equity position as you know is increasing and increasing and continue increasing\nNow when we think outside of the box Mike right and I know you I Know this is where a real estate professional really has a value when he's thinking outside of the box and wants to buy an investment property he can go ahead and pull a line of equity out on his home and put it down boom right you can put that down an investment property and start bringing in more money", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The DiSpirito Team Real Estate Show with Emilio DiSpirito", "city": "Providence", "day": "28"}
