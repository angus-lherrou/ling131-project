{"month": "10", "state": "RI", "station": "WHJJ", "content": "I always encourage even if there was a non financial spouse\nI encourage both to come to every meeting because it's just so important\nTo at least hear what's going on with your finances even if you're not going to be the one to handle it day to day it's important to have a general idea additionally it helps us build a relationship with the non financial spouse so is the financial spouse passes away we can better transition\nThat non financial spouse into handling their assets like they never had to do before\nNow one of the things we can do we have a fine of family organizer so it's it's like a four page or in\nEven if you don't want to commend to meet with us look just just call and for all won three three three eight thousand we'd be happy to send out one of these hard copy to you where you can list everything that's important to you it will is whether or not you have legal documents your real estate holdings do you have government savings bonds a brokerage account\nOr do you have long term care insurance heavy length somebody money that needs to be repaid do you have any ... what about your bank money what about your retirement accounts\nAnd life insurance it lists all of those things aren't that organizer in one simple place if you can do that that is a huge gift for you to give to your family if something were to happen to you because then they know where everything is so a number here for one three three three eight thousand\nIf you call and ask specifically for the family organizer\nHim give us your your name and address and contact info and we will send that out too hard copy free of charge\nJaffe they're all such great ... strategies where do we go from here\nWell you know if we're if we're looking at trying to get organized in case you pass away\nThere's other things that you should consider not many people think that life insurance has for younger people that have a mortgage there are so raising their kids and that is an absolute correct way to think about it\nBut it doesn't mean that as you get older there's no good uses for life insurance so whether you're in your fifties sixties even Seventy some older\nWe have put insurance is in place for people to really to leverage what they can pass on to their family so there's two two things that you want to look at uh you want to take care of your spouse number one and if it's important to you to pass on a legacy to your children\nI've trademark something called the IRA leveraged legacy plant\nAnd that is discussed in my book if you happen to go to Amazon dot com or mass and money dot com and click on the the book button it'll bring you to Amazon and you can purchase that book and it fully explains what that irate LeBron's legacy plan is and it is so effective\nFor passing on money from you to your children\nThat's income tax free and it's a wonderful plan and it has so many other benefits that you can pull into that as well it's such an important thing to look at\nSo if you care about somebody having life insurance provide some some dollars so if you want to have a plan on yourself so that your spouse has more money to live on in their last years that's a great\nA perfect place for life insurance also if you were to have taken a retirement or a pension plan\nAnd let's say that like many people think that sixty five years ago and thankfully I haven't seen this in quite a while back but years ago I met with so many people that was Seventy five years of age and they were their pension was ending and I'm like what is going on why why is this happening\nWell these folks these guys primarily said you know what I was sixty five I could barely get out of bed in the morning\nI figured there was no way I Would live past Seventy five and here I Am I'm healthy as a horse and my pension has ended because I took more money for just ten years instead of doing a lifetime guarantee\nSo if you took what's called the life only pension and you have a spouse then you should consider having insurance in place that will replace that loss of income that your spouse will have to deal with if you pass away in your pension goes away with you another key areas that we look at to make sure that\nThe spouse if if one passes at the surviving spouse has what they need to live a you know a nice life for their final years as well\nGet conscious about the importance of naming beneficiaries\n[noise] you know this is a topic that I talked about every time I get a a group of people together whether it's a public seminar a client of and I always talk about this because it's something that people tend to overlook\nUm but naming beneficiaries you know this is part of the whole decision tree that you go through as to who will get what you know who get this account gets that account or all the accounts going to be split evenly\nYou know after you pass away your name them on insurance policies annuity policies retirement accounts tick cetera\nThey also will supersede what used to be what you put in your last will and testament so simple example let's say you have four children and you say in your will my kids split everything equally\nBut uh let's say on your um let's say you have an annuity that's going to have some cash when you pass away but you only put one of your kids' names on that and nobody for whatever reason\nThey get it it doesn't matter that the wolf says it should be split equally among saw for children so a beneficiary designation will always take precedence over the last will and testament has my attorney or when he's talking to her clients he says look the will speaks last\nAnd the will only handles assets in one person's name\nThat does not have a beneficiary listed and that's what has to go through probate court and deal with all the delays and potential pitfalls with dealing with probing that's why we suggest you name beneficiaries on everything and it's so important to look at your bank accounts because those seem to be the most overlooked\nSo what do you have savings accounts checking accounts CDs make sure that you've got beneficiary designations on all of those now we're getting some feedback that there are some financial institutions out there that limit you to one beneficiary on and like how\nI you know in today's world of of supercomputers in software\nI ... a it boggles my mind that they're restricting people's beneficiaries like that but\nJust just know whether your financial institution limits it or not as an act accordingly so you may want to have you have four kids who might want to have for accounts have one go to each of them\nYou know it's very cumbersome to do that or you know maybe change institutions that's always an option as well the one that's a little more flexible with what's going on so checking beneficiaries is always part of our conversation with the folks that we meet with\nOr whether you become a climate that we will always say look check your beneficiary designations it's worth the few minutes and it takes to find out what you've got\nAnd then how it's structured and then fixing it appropriately now I remember when I set up my trust in my forties I mean it it's a big thing to sit there and say All right if something happened to me what do I want to have happened to my assets\nIt's weird to do that I get you know I I Do I'm going through it but once it was done I have to tell you that I just felt kind of relieved that it was all laid out\nNow as I say this I'm like I maybe it's time for me to relocate in mind too because it's it's been a while since I've done that\nI Would suggest that you look at that at least every five years or so or anytime that there is a major a family of that if there's a birth if there's a doubt if there's a divorce et cetera\nThen you may want to read look at your plan to see if everything is still appropriate the way that you have to stop ... if not well take some action our number here is for one three three three a thousand or we help guide our listeners through the maze of all these financial road blocks and hurdles that she might get\nAnd three things are going to happen is going to either be a positive outcome um what the doctors would call preventative I think the word preventative its way overused I\nDon't think popping up till to sell to solve your health issues Israeli preventative but that's just me but that's what the doctors would call it um and what happened was a positive outcome your cholesterol level went down\nYour good cholesterol went up your bad cholesterol went down\nUm or to nothing happens at all so you had 'em you took the prescription as prescribed on your LDL stayed the same your HDL say stay the same everything stay the same so we're back to the drawing board and the doctor's going to put you on another stand\nA different brand or three\nLike the commercials you see on TV right all the adverse reactions that could happen that the FDA requires that the big pharmaceutical companies talk about on these TV commercials and that's why the last thirty seconds of the commercial or at least the last ten seconds is usually all the adverse reactions that can happen\nSo three let's say you took the pill as prescribed and now you're having some beer lead paint on severe leg cramps that's one of the side effects of one of the many side effects of that and um so now\nI'm your again back to the drawing board you're going to try something else and so the same can happen with food and I don't think a lot of people think about that you know it's not one size fits all our genes help us determine what foods are going to help us either have a positive reaction\nHave no reaction or have a negative reaction maybe even tolerance maybe we have\nUm an enzyme lacking that helps us digest meat or fat or dairy on maybe we have\nLess of a seat a high ... which is an enzyme that help digest alcohol maybe we have none of it at all and we have a very adverse reaction if we ever drink a glass of wine everybody acts\nReacts differently to food and the same thing happens\nWith medications um so you guys um by using this jet at genetic information and again we're given away today the origin addicts skin tests\nThat's worth a hundred and forty nine dollars and it's going to help you to determine what your genetic makeup is in your skin and what you should be using to best utilize\nWhatever products you want to utilize them make your skin\nUnder and healthier and pressure now I should I should say appear younger because I hear a lot of people saying it's one of my pet peeve is\nThe big um buzz word out there is anti aging and um I just have to say that yeah we may be living longer but there's no such thing as anti aging we're all going to age um we could use\nProducts that may help us a appear aesthetically I'm younger um true but doesn't mean our insides are younger and it's the insights that matter\nSo I just wanted to say that that's one of those buzz buzz words that I hear a lot of people I'm saying like infomercials or um\nYou know a commercial for certain products on ... on TV whether it's skin care products or what have you it's a big buzz word is anti aging and I tell you guys yeah we are living longer um some people claim we might live to you know a hundred and twenty at some point um you know but even if\nYou know people were only living into their sixties now they're living into the eighties and nineties and even longer so yes I agree with that but I don't agree with anti aging products um\nSo we're going to look today at certain um foods right that can\nActually certain enzymes\nThat we have in our bodies in certain foods and how they interact\nWith these enzymes and um I just want to tell you guys that I Am super passionate about what I Do and I want you guys to remember that um it there are a lot of people out there are calling themselves quote
