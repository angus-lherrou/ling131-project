her specialty so so looking forward to taking all day but it's information and being able to share in the local marketplace here for ladies that are near or in retirement so you know stay tune if you have an interest in that we'd like to get on a mailing list for that seminar\nSend an email or call you can call for a one three three three eight thousand or you can email\nInfo at Massey and associates dot com that's all spelled out and just put David Baake in the in the topic so we know what it's about and just say you know please send me an invitation when you're ready to send those out and we'll take care of you and make sure you get an imitation\nWhat an incredible Yvette I'm so excited for this Jeff I Know the women in our community are female listeners they're going to want to attend this because it really does speak to the unique challenges that\nThey face and I used to hire met while I'm so glad you partnered with David back on this I I'm I'm just thrilled I'm thrilled because this is not something everyone's doing but boy is there a need Geoff my\n... you know I I really think there is and then I have a passion for helping people as I Hope our listeners or get that passion they understand that you know I'm really driven help as many people as we can so I Do believe that offering this type of a seminar for the ladies that are our listeners and their family members and friends that may not be listening\nBut may want to come to the seminar because will allow you to invite your friends as well as long as they're about to retire or in retirement because that's geared specifically for those women that are that are near retirement or in retirement\nJeff one of the questions that I Know both are female andme male listeners has is when to retire you know this seems like a simple question but as your proving today it can be more complicated than I think a lot of us would anticipate\nI Want to talk about the risks that can actually help us determine when we can retire\nWell you know the more you can protect yourself and your assets against certain risk the better chance ... of last thing you throughout a nice long retirement no\nAnd I say that and I talk about often as as you know making about longevity in our living longer well recently the Providence Journal our number one newspaper for the state because it covers the entire state because we're so small\nBut I had an article about a woman that is a hundred and ten years old right here in Rhode Island and and I was like wow that is amazing now oftentimes I talked to a seminar is how we are you know living into her nineties a at a higher percentage than any prior generation but when I saw that a hundred and ten\nI was pretty impressed site I had helped classes that Rhode Island college for a while back and there was a gentleman there who said he help care for his aunt and then ultimately she went to a nursing home and she passed three months before her a hundred and fifth birthday\nNow to me that was the Elvis I'd heard or seen and then we see a hundred and ten years of age man\nHow do you make sure that your income is going to last that long\nWell we know how to do that and we use specific products that are geared to do just that and that's what I think makes a special because we do focus on getting that income that you can rely on for the rest of your life regardless of how one that may be sore number here is ...\nOral won three three three eight thousand we look forward to your call we will sit down with you get to visit get to know each other a little bit better determine what your goals or for your retirement either when you may sorted or what it might look after the fact if you've already retired\nAnd then we do a deep dive in analysis of your portfolio come back as a second meeting and then lay it all out for you and say look here's what we see and at that point in time we should both know if massing associates and can help you with your planning as you move forward\nSo it's pretty straightforward we recover a lot of ground and those two meetings\nAnd we are looking for people that are serious about their retirement planning\nSo if you save two hundred thousand a more fuel retirement our number here is for one three three three a thousand\nGet are there any risks out there that you think people sometimes forget about\n[noise] you know when we see the most er here about the most of the people don't pay attention to the health care aspect of retiring early\nBecause if you're not sixty five yet you do not yet qualify for Medicare part a ... or be so then you've got to take that out of out of pocket and that's a big deal\nSo it's important to keep that in mind and for those people that are nearing sixty five or if you're already sixty five are older and you have a Medicare supplement plan\nNow is the time to give us a call for one three three three eight thousand\nAnd we can help you with making a decision do you have the best plan might you be able to get a better plan for yourself or for those that are already clients of ours because I Know we have clients that are regular listeners if you have a Medicare supplement plan and they would just like us to take that over for you we'd be happy to do that for you as well\nSo if you're new to the Medicare plan you can give us a call if your existing on Medicare and you have a supplement plan already we'd be happy to evaluate it for you and perhaps help you with that going forward now is the open season it started October fifteenth and we have a couple of months to get that done for you\nSo what people forget about the health insurance if you're if you go to health plan through your employer you may only be paying a portion of that but if you have to buy your own plan and you're in the early sixties that a good plan could cost you eight nine hundred thousand dollars a month for each of you\nSo that can take a big chunk out of assets for those first few years until you get to age sixty five\nSo whenever possible we encourage people to at least shoot for sixty five however we can do a plan if you want to retire at sixty two we've got plans were folks are looking to retire at fifty seven and fifty nine but\nWe worked it all out and say are you going to have to draw more money for the health insurance until you get to sixty five and then we can kind of turn turn down the withdrawal rules from your accounts because I knew shift over the Medicare part a party and the supplemental plant\nSo those are important and if you do not have a plan a physician foxtrot or a planned season Charlie Medicare supplement plan they will be going away after this twenty Nineteen season if you will so they will still be decent plans available but the better plants in my opinion or see an F\nAnd if you don't get them like on this go round you may not be able to get it after twenty Nineteen so it might be a good time to consider changing so now is a good time to really evaluate what you have\nAnd we're in the open season so coal four oh one three three three eight thousand and we'll have you sit down with one of our professionals to review what you have and see how we might be able to help you with that so you know make a great segment with David Bach and I do look forward to helping out with his workshops in January and February\nOf ladies only workshop so if you want to get on our mailing list\nEither call for a one three three three thousand and ask to be put on the list or send an email to info at Massey and associates dot com

caller now at one time we\nHave a welcome back to the harmony with food show my name's Mack we're talking about we're going to talk about a new program I have coming up is called don't gain the eight harmonies foods trusted system to get you through the holidays it's going to be a program where you can stay at home I'm either going to do it from Facebook Live\nOr go to ... which means if I Do it from going to happen now you will get it once you joined the program you will get an email and your inbox\nAnd then you could go ahead and um\nGoing in with me every week we're probably going to be doing it on like Tuesday and Thursday nights\nBut the premise behind the program is that basically I'm what I'm saying is that a highly recommend not waiting for the new year to get started on your anti diet plan to improve your health improve your energy and stop\nThe weight loss resistance so I Know how you guys think and I think that you guys say things like this one Halloween coming around the corner I Will just buy candy I Do not like the um I Do not like for the kid I was for Halloween so in other words you're gonna buy candy that's not gonna tempt you and\nI'm so that you don't even want it but yet you still give out your Halloween candy and see how the kiddo and enjoy the night right\nBut that fails because one day after work you stop at your local store and you see all the candy fifty percent off you're hungry and tired\nAs you start stroll through the store you think to yourself everything is okay in moderation so you buy that bag of many sneak Snickers after all it is a deal you cannot pass\nUp plus all the people that you um do not want to eat the candy you know bring it to work so there's like candy everywhere and you think I\nWill start my diet and Monday\nHowever Monday comes and goes and you think I Will start my diet tomorrow\nAnd then that becomes your new mantra and you're never start your diet\nSo the rationale behind this program is that I'm going to lead you through the holidays\nI'm from October twenty ninth weekly for ten weeks all the way to I think it's January second and every week will meet for an hour I'll have a different topic um so for instance um [noise]\nLet's say we're going to talk about how the dinner suggestions and shopping list and I'm going to answer your questions one week\nThen we're going to talk about every week remember you'll get a link to join in your um email box and your inbox joint then we're going to talk about emotional eating intuitive eating and getting ready for Thanksgiving Thanksgiving eve Thanksgiving\nDay and the day after how we can prepare for that to be our best we're going to talk about our ears circadian rhythm one a week and the importance of sleep and then I'm going to always answer your questions\nNow you got to talk about some of my favorite exercise and some of my favorite exercise sites and again always answering your question we're going to talk about portion sizes serving sizes we're going to talk about how much protein you should be eating and we're going to be talking about stress reduction techniques\nBecause remember on the fear cortisol levels are high is going to be very very difficult to lose weight you're not getting enough sleep is going to be almost impossible to lose weight because the thing is you're not producing the enzymes that you need to and you're Ari and sleep that helped break down fat\nI'm we're going to talk about how to prepare for Christmas Eve Christmas Day and the day after because we all know most of the time we take that day after two and we're going to talk about sample meal plans were going to have some suggestions\nOr going to talk about um you know sharing our results on in a Facebook group so this is gonna along with this um program we're going to have not all there were going to meet for an hour every single week\nUm it's probably going to be on Tuesdays and thirties Thursday's around six PM for those of you who that work and the programs going to be called do not gained a instead crush it over the holidays with harmony with foods helped me through the holidays plan so it's a ten week program [noise] um I value at\n'em one hour with me is in my office is two hundred and Seventy five dollars on but you're going to get an hour with me ten times that you're gonna get ten hours with me plus I Will stay on for the answer the question parts for as long as you guys desire and we're going to discount that\nTo three Ninety nine [noise] and um if you're not on my email list that harmony with food dot com\nAnd you're not going to get the opportunity to join and here's the thing that one of the best parts of this program is I'm lemonade in it to a small number of\nPeople so that um you know I can answer all the questions so that it can be kind of an intimate group and guess what you guys I think some of you guys already know that is that um let me just repeat the the number of hairs eight six six nine to zero nine four five five and remember the\nThird call or it's going to get a hundred and forty forty nine dollar value DNA bliss cats um so I'm\nThe program works by saying bye I'm actually only allowing about thirty people in the program we'll meet each and every week\nAnd some of you know that I Will be hard on you it's my job to be tough on you to to get the answers out of you that I Need to know to do where you need to get to the next step to see what your next goal is going to be for that week\nUm you'll be able to stay at home the meeting will be on line like I said it's either going to be lived through Facebook or go to Web and are either or both and then each week you will get a link to joined the meeting\nYou can call in or view from your computer",
