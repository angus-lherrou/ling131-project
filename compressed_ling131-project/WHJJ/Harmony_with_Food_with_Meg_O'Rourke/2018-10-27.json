{"month": "10", "state": "RI", "station": "WHJJ", "content": "Gas you emphasize having a strategy having a plan each and every week here on the show what strategy like that included\nWell there is no cookie cutter for everybody making sure will know it does depend on the individual listener but\nThe key components of a retirement strategy could include of course your current financial picture you know what are your income expenses cash reserve network that ... what are your fish and what are your goals were those the short term and long term\nYour protection snow insurance to address your most pressing risk you know do you have the proper life insurance so you have proper health insurance is disability insurance something that would be important to you along with the typical you know your home your auto et cetera so looked at\nAnd then your investments are they appropriately positioned\nBased on your comfort level with risk and other spread around enough so that we have good asset allocation\nYou know retirement income strategy is the key to making all this work because you're gonna have a lot of money but if you don't have a set retirement income coming in is harder to to budget for your retirement expenses and then of course we always want to look at\nTax mitigation as best we can because many people come to us with their largest single asset being their retirement plan which was all pre tax which means what when it comes out it's fully income taxable\nAnd when we look at that and we assume our clients are gonna live twenty plus years what are the tax rates going to be five ten Twenty years from now\nI'm willing to say clearly they're going to be much higher than they are today because of where the federal deficit is that it's been building up\nNot just for one president ... multiple presidents over the decades you know it's been building up it's not anybody you can point to currently it's been building up for many many many years so it's important to understand that\nAnd understand that if taxes go up you're going to pay a lot more in taxes from your retirement accounts we have strategies to help you kind of\nIn the long run reduce or tax exposure so it's about wealth preservation and wealth transfer that we talk about a lot from our clients to their family\nSo having a well thought out retirement plan intrigues you a number of years for a one three three three a thousand\nIf you save two hundred thousand or more for your retirement please give us a call we'd love to sit with you\nSee what your vision and goals are for the future and if we might be able to provide some assistance with that if we feel we have a chance then we'll gather your statements do a full report and come back in a couple of weeks and say look here's what we see here's what's good here's what we feel might be able to be improved\nAnd then you decide what you want to do from there are number again ... three three three eight thousand if you save two hundred thousand more of your retirement we look forward to your call\nJeff when you have that strategy and you you're looking at that road map I Would think having an actual strategy something that we can refer back to that is really going to keep people on on the right course her retirement\nAbsolutely you know becomes a lot easier to stray off course when the stock market is behaving rather unpredictably\nBy off course I mean people tend to make financial decisions in the moment that might not be in line with their long term goals\nSo having a form of strategy and plays helps you refer back to it and say oh yeah that's right you know we did talk about there can be some ups and downs on that portion so we're not going to jump out the window because things aren't that bad [laughter]\nYou know and so having that they're\nThinking of it as as a providing a certain level of comfort to you because you know it's part of the plan and you know it's been addressed\nYou know not having a financial strategy for retirement just helps you to know all the noise that day to day week to week movements of the market and of course the media attention that is paid to them and I keep in mind when it comes to the media\nAre they telling you like all good stuff no their job is to get your nervous so that you tune in whether that's on a TV show a radio show even or the newspaper their job is to try to get your back\nAnd get get you connected so that you're constantly turning on the TV show listening to the radio show or reading the newspaper\nSo when you have a plan you can say yeah we have a plan we've got a professional taking care of us were in good a good place we can kind of relax a little bit let the professionals do their job and will our job is to have fun retiring [laughter] that's your job when you were as are\nStill a big picture financial strategy that at a great thing to have a leading up to during retirement and pretty much at any stage of your life for that matter so get do you suggest that we sit down and we hammer out a strategy on our own if that ever had that idea\nOr you know if you listen to the media you know do a YouTube or Google you can do it yourself with pretty much everything you know there was there was a story of of a doctor who was up at the north pole and his appendix burst and he was the only one there\nHe had to operate on himself oh dear I don't know if people remember that we put literally this guy had to take out his own appendix 'cause he was the only one there otherwise we would have died\nNow let's face that is the ultimate do it yourself\nKidding not that he had a choice but my God that's not what you want to do with your investments for your retirement lifespan 'cause we're looking at making key\nAre not just for this month this quarter or this year we're talking about potentially two or three decades that can be impacted by\nDecisions you do or to not make appropriately now so what's most important is to sit with a professional that specializes in retirement income planet\nBecause that's the most important thing that you can do so that you have a plan put together that will help keep you focused on the long run and less focused on the day to day ups and downs in the market because we know the market will do both oftentimes that does both in the same day\nRecently there was a big drop like five hundred points midday and then it corrected most of it but it was still down at the end of the day but those are big swings and those I think that's just my personal opinion I think it's more of the traders that are causing those bigger swings\nThat's just my opinion and computerized a programmed trading happens at certain levels so if the market drop a certain amount\nAutomatically computers are selling things and if it goes down to a certain level again they'll buy back in and it's all pre programmed so how can the the quote unquote little guy compete with that it's very difficult to do that\nGas great show today as always any final thoughts for us\nWell diversification is key in the different types of events such as using and the different tax or positions whether it's pre tax money your after tax money non retirement plan money having old diversification and all those areas make sure plan that much more solid in a workable as you go forward\nOur number here that messing associate sank is for one three three three eight thousand we look forward to your call if you save two hundred thousand or more for your retirement\nAs always
