exactly where it goes\nYou know I still draw a lot of correlations back to where we saw in February and I like you don't make myself in the business of protections but\nI can see a few instances where you could see a rally of this coming back rather quickly or if you if you get the midterms behind you and all of a sudden you see a very strong consumer spending towards the end of the year\nTo me

of companies that they have recently acquired and they're specifically that they do pretty much the same thing as air BNB but what they try and do is have a better relationship with the people that actually own the places that are getting rented out so one of the big issue that they identified as people that are [noise]\nYou know releasing an apartment and then sub letting it out on the air B. and B. and are bad creates issues for the owners they don't want that it can create issues for the condo association there can be rules against that sort of thing [noise]\nSo what this service uh the

who's going to be in the apartment and a number of different factors to make it just a little bit more secure in the way they're renting this out\nDo you think this makes what one of the questions that I I've raised with regards to air being the is you're seeing ... he's pushing back on either setting limits are saying hey you can't do this do you think this helps to square away some of those
