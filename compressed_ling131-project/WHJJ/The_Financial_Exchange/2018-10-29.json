J. Providence and I aren't radio station\nAt least I don't think we have they are expecting truck a home care is going to require one point two million additional workers on top of what they have now right and you're gonna have a lot of retirements between now and twenty twenty six one point two million needed by twenty twenty six\nAnd it doesn't ... doesn't pay well it's only like an eleven dollars an hour\nJob no it ... it doesn't pay well and I think\nYou know what's what's really interesting to me is to kind of look at where we've come from in kind of this in in dealing with the the problem of aging mhm 'cause this is kind of a new issue it on two fronts number one you have people living longer okay so that means that they you know a greater percentage of people are going to run into something that doesn't kill them but requires them to have care\nYou know used to be if you go back to you know the forties fifties and sixties\nYou didn't have a ton of people that needed this level of care 'cause most of the time\nWhat ever happened to them usually they were dying anyways you know they didn't have this level or the disability and they didn't live for ten years in that state no it's it's in the medical advances have gotten to the point where we can keep people alive now but we don't really have a system or a way to take care of them easily\nAnd the problem I think is compounded by the fact that in today's world\nIn so many families both spouses have to work in order to make ends meet and so you end up in a situation where you know a family member can't be that person carrying it a lot of\nCase what about assisted living facilities 'cause that's a that's an alternative they you know I'm going through this with family members now where you know they're they're selling their house right and they're buying a unit in assisted living\nThat costs depending on where you are but that's about four or five hundred thousand dollars but if you have equity in your home if you own your home outright you can afford that\nBut then you're looking at the the cost for this couple is six thousand three hundred dollars a month but I really question how many retirees can afford six thousand three hundred dollars a month every month you end up not that many gay they may know families don't have that much in gross income\nYou know in in in its in particular what you're going to see is you know so many people in really it's it's generation X and kind of the beginning part of the millennial generation are going to be in situations where they're having to care for parents yeah but also still having kids in their teens and a lot of cases\nSo what are you guys going to do or you go to like have your folks moved in with you are you going to pay the assisted living facility yourself ... like I I mean right now I'm not joking about this this is a serious issue that millennials are going to have to take care of no way the boomers we're going to be you know we're we're going to be the ones that need taking care of\nNo idea I I I have no idea how to\nDeal with no really no easy solution is there no it's the idea where how ... what do you do put them in a warehouse ...\nYou've got two options you have care for them yourself you know or spend money so someone else care so the rate like either way like there's no easy way to deal with\nIt because the nursing homes are closing ... we've seen a wave of nursing home closures because they're saying hey the government regulations and this is you know this ... it's a it's a fascinating topic and I'm not an expert on it but you look\nAt the reason nursing homes are closing we you close your business because you're not making any money right right and and the government says well you must have this many nurses you must have this many doctors you must have this type of\nCare well the government regulation is driving up the cost and I understand the logic behind it right it it's kinda like daycare maybe you get a lot of government regulation involved in daycare\nBecause the kid dies well same thing in a nursing home a senior citizen dies and the government feels the need to say well you must have this type of care available you must adhere to these regulations and then eventually the nursing home say\nThey they wave the white flag they just say look we're done I talked to folks we have a client who who are used to run a health care facility and he said very you know you you have no idea what kind of merging compression we've experienced in the last twenty\nYears on in in in looking at this overall don't get me wrong ... these are good problems to have because the the the flip side of this is look if people just you know pass away than like you don't have to deal with this problem but no one wants that you don't want your loved ones just passed away it's OK we need to figure out how to care for him so it's\nIt's a good problem but there's no easy answers because of how we build\nA boat the system right now that cares for people as they age\nAnd the fact that many families they can't take enough time off to care for these ... to care for a folks who need it you know in their families it's we're we're just not built in today's society to deal with these problems and that risk is going to be present whether or not we build systems to fix this or not [noise]\nAn interesting topic that would require much more time and research we can solve isn't ten minutes no no no no I didn't think so hey when we come back we're going to tell you how to get
