companies that are really be whacked by the uh China tariffs but you know this burning season could give us a sense of the broader economy wide impact of what essentially as a tax on you know two hundred billion dollars worth of stuff that we buy\nTo correct myself by the way markets were flat about Fifteen minutes ago right now the Dow is down about Seventy points apple pie off seven NASDAQ off\nThe five points so down and or some ... down about a quarter of one percent the NASDAQ off about more than half a percent that would make a three day losing streak of this comes to fruition so so far pretty rough October uh\nIn addition to earnings though you know the big backdrop that we have other than earnings of the terrorists is interest rates\nSo the ten year treasury yields\nIs now up pretty far above three percent read three point two three three percent on the tenure treasury as we all know that impacts everything that we do now you go get a car loan you get a mortgage any of these things are going to be impacted by the ten year treasury rate and that's been on the move really since the end of the summer\nWhen I was amazed to see it jumped Fifteen basis points last week zero point one five percent um and you know in the in the news the world a bond trading you know that's a ethic until you have a move that big in one week and you know as you pointed out have really been around two point eight percent for most of the summer so\nYou know it's one of those sort of bad news good news things 'cause to me the reason the interest rates going up is because the economy's doing well and the fed can raise the interest rate and\nUm you know we're seeing some uh I Would say a for now fairly positive signs of inflation growth so\nYou know uh every uh every piece of economic data you can argue is good or bad yeah I mean we did get so we\nGot a a jobs report on friday and you know the reiterated incredibly low unemployment rate we're down to three point seven percent unemployment a wage growth was up at an annual I's rate of two point eight percent but it's been accelerating so it's the ... two point eight percent but if you look at the last\nQuarter by quarter we've been getting faster and faster here so I think there are some legitimate concerns that the fed has\nAbout inflation or as as you see interest rates and that's the reaction is they're moving up interest rates but wage growth is the big one that we've been looking at and uh if there's one thing that I think you really need to keep the stock market and the U.S economy afloat for another few years it's going to be it's gonna be coming from the consumer\nIt's got to come from the American consumer make it a little bit more money and spending that money on things like cars like toys like all that ah you know all that useless junk that we don't need but that keeps our economy floating Seventy percent of the economy you and me and everybody spending a so speaking of interest rates\nLast decade you know if you wanted to go buy a new car you can get a pretty sweet deal on financing zero percent financing deals really came about right after the the great recession all these car companies said well we got to sell these car somehow so how do we do we'll get a man with zero percent financing lot harder to find these days\nWhen I was amazed when you started seeing you know zero percent for one year three years or ... you know great deal but when you start seeing Seventy two months zero interest loans I mean that's really a the ... the lender taking a major risk about what's the future going hope\nYeah I mean I Would do is Seventy two months a loan on a car if I had zero percent but you really got to think about what is it don't don't just sign up for one of these car payments people uh Seventy two months loan yeah those payments are really small\nHow how often do you have to replace a car before Seventy two month goes by I mean I I Try and drive my car is into the ground but a if you do a fair bit of driving in a pretty good chance you're gonna have to replace that car for six years goes by\nYeah and then you've got a big uh you know or you get the total than the other way around\nThat car pretty quickly yeah I'm ... those deals are going away if you see it zero percent financing deal on a car uh usually it's for a couple of reasons one that's just something that can't sell anymore so\nThey get you're still seeing some of these deals on you know smaller size sedan that just aren't selling very well right now you know everybody wants to small SUV sedans just aren't really going to they're putting some decent financing deals on those um\nBut they're really by and large have gone away that zero percent financing\nWell the city power numbers or two years ago nine point one percent of all new cars consult with a zero interest loan\nNow is just three point four percent and even you know a talking about the effect of\nInterest rates percentage of cars funniest with an interest rate of one percent or lower uh that's just five point three percent a and that was never there was a Levin point seven percent September twenty sixteen so definitely people you know I'm digging deeper into the wallet to pay for a new car\nIf I did I just bought a spotted minivan or about a month ago because I've had my third kid and so I jumped on that bandwagon I think my my interest rate on their cars over three percent now for only forty eight months loan so\nYou're saying it interest rates are moving up if you're trying to lock in a mortgage or anything like that I don't think they're going down anytime soon died seems to be like it's going in just one direction I Would say\nThe mini van is like a colonoscopy nobody wants to get one but you get to that point in life when you have to go now I'm all about\nMy minivan and it's a it's a super cool cool minivan\nOr we are going to take a quick break here or we're going to be joining where we come

on Facebook free food go come slashed the financial exchange says the financial exchange radio network [noise]\nIt seems to be to me at least a lot of confusion these days about the health insurance marketplace\nNow if you got an employer and you know they're covering your health insurance that's pretty simple it's not trying to not that we're trying to figure out what's covered and how much is going to cost\nBut at least you know what you're expected to pay is pretty simple but with the rollout of the Affordable CARE Act and then the you know the changes that were made the Affordable CARE Act a law has been changing over the last few years\nAnd now there's these almost like GAP insurance policy that you can go out there and by short term short term insurance that you know they were designed to really only cover insurance for a period of three months that you're in between jobs or something like that\nUm but they are now being sold on a longer term basis they can be really cheap you know as much as fifty to eighty percent cheaper than plans available and Affordable Care act but as we're learning new yard you know specifically very different from what we think of as your typical health insurance plans\nAnd I mean they're completely terrible this a story that we're looking at from or CNBC\nYou know ten thousand dollar deductibles coverage a pre existing conditions no prescription drug coverage no subsidies uh you know you can't renewed them so you go from one provider to another\nAnd I get to the end of the story and I said you know why would you even pay for the coverage of the first place it seems like you're better off just not even going totally uncovered\nKnow I think what this type of thing I disagree with you a little bit there I mean what if you really do your research what this is covering you for is somebody that says hey I don't want health insurance but if I have a heart attack I don't want to go bankrupt they basically just saying if if you have to have an emergency really expensive procedure it's going to cover that\nHe's going to cover pretty much nothing else that your pre existing conditions you won't even be approved for the health insurance and the first place so don't worry about it\nUh it doesn't cover prescription drugs largely a sky high deductible talked about that at ten thousand dollars ...\n... thing I didn't realize though so if you buy one of these policies and then it expires because they're you know three months policies you can't just go back and buy an Affordable Care act policy if you get rid of one of these policies you have to wait until the open enrollment period\nAh which is actually the one they come here yeah um the other thing too is their subsidies available or if you're in an Affordable Care act policy these types do not offer subsidies\nSo you do it it's tough these days you really do need to research this I actually talked to a guy or just last week who is running a small business she had been in corporate America for years\nStarted a small business really you know ... the politics of the Affordable CARE Act really rubbed in the wrong way so he just wasn't carrying any health insurance up until that point and it didn't really it it didn't really seem to click like\nYeah I mean if I if I get in a car accident uh if I you know if something like that in a letter I'll lose my house I'll lose anything that I have because no any visit to the emergency room these days costs thousands of dollars um\nYeah I I hadn't had a client who had a heart transplant\nThe bill to the insurance companies one and a half million dollars\nWhat would you do if you I mean if you didn't have health insurance area and you're just toast ... and he was in the hospital for two months are all sorts of prescriptions and that's the other thing right you know yeah that's all covered the heart transplant these basic insurance policies but how about all the prescriptions that you have to be on to the rest of your life that and this this health insurance is going to cover all that\nInteresting to see the the last time we saw at the end of twenty sixteen they're about a hundred and sixty thousand people in America who had a these short term uh coverage plans will be interesting to see the the updated number you know it's just getting to maybe five hundred thousand or or even a million now\nThe penalty goes away now you don't have to pay a penalty if you don't have health insurance so I think a lot of people are going to drop off and it's a big bill ... if if you earn a decent let's say you're a small business owner you're you know just a independent contractor and you make a decent wage issue for you know a decent Affordable Care act policy you're shelling out\nEight hundred thousand bucks a month for just an individual family plan two thousand four hundred yeah it's big big money I get why people don't have insurance it's really really costly but are you really need to think through the implications if you're not going to carry health insurance\nFolks do you have a trust to protect your assets if not in your closing in on retirement this messages for you [noise]
