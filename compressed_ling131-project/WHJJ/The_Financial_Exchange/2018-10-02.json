I think it explained so much about what we're seeing with a capital case right now I think it's\nI think it's absolutely in line with ... well it's amazing because I think a lot of people if you're trying to look at it and you're and you're just playing teams a lot of people would just be like all the Democrats are the worst in there and saying but I mean I Know people who are are Democrats\nAnd they sound completely insane about this cap it off yeah completely off the rock are these are people that I Know people who I'm friendly with\nAnd the extent that they'll go to here to try to take all male crime in in the last twenty five years and apply it to this one guy where there's no evidence that he committed any sort of crime and that sort of jump it not\nIt's not just hey they want to stop this or hey they want to protect roe versus Wade\nThere is a different part of it is it's about throwing the entire um the tire efforts of logic off base\nIt's based in post modernism huh it explained in the book and you'll see a lot of times I look at a time like I don't understand what are they doing why are they saying these things just doesn't make any sense and there's easy political explanations for all that but it's not real\nThe real basics of it the foundation of why there why are they attacking this in this way is all in the book\nI mean and it's I Wish I could I Wish Kavanaugh would have happened while I was writing the book\nBecause I think it is the perfect example maybe we should do that tomorrow maybe we should take the book the theories and the book and just show exactly why everything is happening point by point yeah\nYou can find it in the book addicted to outrage and the the most important part is it educates you and shows you how the other side is fighting\nAnd why you must not fight that way\nA and the reason why is because they are trying to create chaos and I don't mean your neighbor who's a Democrat I mean I mean the people who are at the university levels uh and the the upper echelons of politics they know what's going on they don't they do not believe\nWhat they're saying they're doing it because they have a goal and their goal is to disrupt the hierarchy in the patriarchy\nAnd to collapse the system that we have\nYeah and if you've ever had someone who has an addiction problem in your life ... you see them acting a radically and there's some reason and you don't understand that why would they do that they blow their job why they do this they blew their marriage all those things why would the left act this way about this thing\nAnd it ... you know if you know why they're doing it and if you're not just dismissing it as typical politics you can fight against it much more effectively and and you know you spend a lot of time in the book going through not just how how and why this is going on but how to push back against that and how to defeat it yeah\nIt is not a a it's a book about surrender it is a book about stand and fight just fight to the right way\nJust know who your enemy is the tactics that they're using and fight the right way it's called addicted to outrage we'll talk about it on Thursday with you so if you're reading it tried to finish it by a by Thursday if you haven't started yet please do 'em and uh and then joined us on a joined us on Thursday\nOkay hum we've we've dealt with the ... the Kavanaugh scenario uh\nAnd it is that we're in an interesting place it's going to come down to whether the press and whether the Democrats\nTend can Vince enough Republicans not even about Ford I

this work [laughter]\nI Know you said no deal but let's kind of get let's let's make this work I think we need them more than meets the feds an interesting theory they ah\nTen things to know about the NAFTA deal to tell you the a lot of a noise is being made over this deal and then I looked at the damn thing about much\nDifferent I said it's\nNothing like it we went from having access to two point eight five percent of Canada's dairy market up to three point one five or ... or directly like we still don't have access to the dairy market\nUm and they're actually kind of mad that they have to give up like zero point five oh yeah we're giving into the Trump like watch the uh the one thing that that's actually\nPretty good in there I think is especially from a national security standpoint is our cars now I have to have Seventy five percent of their parts made in North America\nAnd that's going to be phased in over five years but I Do like the idea is there are certain things that I think we do is there's too many places where we've um\nExtended and an offshore on reduction that are dangerous I'll give an example um your your kids ever have strep throat when they're oh yeah you know all that stuff comes from China\nReally know what I did not know that yeah so imagine you know like you were in a trade war with China you're right they do we really want to get into like\nWe we don't make any of that stuff for rabies and incorrect so yeah that's that's a whole separate issue and it's a very important Seventy I you know you're talking about the fact Seventy five percent of auto components must be built in North America now\nRight now the requirement is sixty two and a half percent right so that's a bad I looked at as being pretty significant I Would say the President Trump okay that's a that's a when I put that in the ... it's incremental and as many incremental even then it's phased in over five years\nDoes it also tell you how big a business dairy is though that there was this much squabbling about that yeah and both sides are saying wow this is a really big deal\nApparently Barry is a pretty big business yeah well of course we have about everyday right use it every day yeah cheese to dream yeah exactly you know it made dairy is a big deal\nUm and we made some progress in that so that's good I thought another issue that kind of I didn't think it was that big a deal but apparently is is that forty five percent of workers\nMust make sixteen dollars an hour or more that strike me as very onerous pay well that's a big deal in Mexico\nTrue that that's where the ... the Mexican workers\nAnd it you know like maybe because I'm In the U.S everybody's making over sixty right but in Mexico everybody's making five true and I wonder if that does something to quell\nBasically the civil war going on in Mexico for may in Mexico you talking about a violent play like don't go there on vacation we just don't\nBut I also wonder if in Mexico would be that affected by it because if we\nCount all the workers in Canada and we count all the workers in the United states and then we add they have huge factories in Mexico true\nAnd also this yeah at the at the margin this could keep a lot of jobs from going down there in the future I think that's the big concern yeah I think from Mexico's perspective they they they're they're looking at it and say the one thing that I'll mention though\nYou average price of a new car over thirty six thousand bucks now yeah and that brings us back to ... this is it NAFTA deal that we negotiated is going to make cars it won't be long before the average price of the new vehicles forty forty five thousand bucks and no one's going to buy him that well they're not buying them now I Know like if you look now\nEvery every like my next car is going to be used vehicle yeah I'm just not going to spend that kind of do on a new car that spread between the new car and the high quality used cars\nIs now a very very substantial spread and it's it's moved a lot of people to the used car market particularly with some of these really high quality leases were low mileage and and and low miles\nNext topic that we're going to talk about is is um China and how they systematically pride technology from U.S companies I saw this story\nI guess it was last week I saw it but we're going to be joined by Bob Davis\nAnd Bob is going to explain to us what China what kind of pressure China exerts on American companies that want to do business in China Starbucks comes to mind you're a big company that does a lot of

driverless taxi service in Phoenix, Arizona for the next three months [noise]\nQuestion about that and the way most is the name of the company that's the subsidiary that Google owns a they're planning to launch a public commercials service without anyone in the driver's seat\nNot an experiment they're actually going to roll it out and uh they're going to be a taxi driver in Phoenix or a limo driver and the uh probably standing by saying well let's see this work\nUh probably nervous that it it does work I'll think about it right they if you're over what is in overdrive or get Seventy five percent of the gross is that I I'm I'm not sure I think that's what it is always so you take out that driver right\nNow I'm just thinking what Google could do to undercut prices like say you live in a Sun City and you're going to the airport\nAnd that is normally a hundred dollar ride in a in a taxi or ... ...\n... what to cut costs you Google fifty twenty five I mean Google that's true but it is it the whole costs of the service is ah the employees that Google ... ... out of business as they roll this out loud they're going to have to ... they're going to be a big purchaser of cars yeah because you know the nice thing is we're basically picky backs\nOff of other drivers owned vehicles they offer arrangements for the drivers but it's very expensive yes if you want to use one of their vehicles I mean it's very prohibitive so yeah they're going to become a ... you can see that with the auto industry\nThey're really cozying up to them because they realize that could be a huge source of their future revenues well and you think about the companies that have you know they're trying to catch up\nA Tesla had a number of accidents on the road ... killed somebody didn't they in Phoenix yeah exactly it's so you know there there's you know the history here that things happen always worked out quite perfectly on in the experimentation phase of this it'll be interesting to see how this rolls out and how effective it is I I\nYou still think there are a major obstacles\nTo fully autonomous vehicles in the United states for a lot of reasons I I continue to believe that we're going to become increasingly autonomous and maybe three quarters autonomous or Ninety five percent autonomous but getting there with driverless I just think is going to be a tough road to hoe no fun to do\nI I Want to see what happens I think Phoenix is a great market to look at it it's a huge city yeah ... you know you've got I don't know what the population is got to be I think is one of the top ten cities\nIn the country in terms of population oh yeah and if you can all the sudden drive the cost of a taxi ride down by fifty percent ... you're putting everybody\nOut of business yeah I mean this would be a a
