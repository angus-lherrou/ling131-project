why their currencies devaluing and this is why their stock market's down\nHere today this is yet another example of them arguably the most glaring example of why this really could hurt China a lot of when you start seeing this this really does bite into their economy so what we're seeing as we're seeing collateral damage on both sides\nClearly China has more to lose than we do a which is adding some urgency clearly there markets have reacted even more adversely than our markets although our markets are starting to do poorly this month\nI'm so these are the stakes were experiencing is nothing compared to the Chinese John absolutely uh you know the impact of this for the United states will be\nPretty small you know um it it it may have an inflationary impact\nIt may make us a little bit

in these are the consequences that are\nThat we have for oh what is essentially a trade war and in China\nIt's a lot more to lose in the United states I I Do think this is setting up to some sort of negotiation to come to agreement on on some of these key issues there's just too much at stake and also from the perspective of the United states you know the ...\nYeah I I Would like to agree with you I like I I've been wrong so I Would love to agree with you but they they are cultural feeds I mean if if he can green in their culture to steal\nAnd this is a separate issue and we have to get the

of agreement I mean I'm not sure why can't why should Boeing has to pay for an issue that has to do with apple I mean when it comes down to I mean I I Know what you're saying I I feel like we can address both you know\nI'm not sure we cannot I'm losing okay because I don't trust them John on anything I don't trust them as far as I can throw them is just like I don't trust the Saudis\nYeah ... ... if this is a case we're gonna have to really rely on domestic consumption and the consumption of allies now we're going to have a new world where we are working to drill\nInstead of China they I mean that that right ... you're going to see companies move their manufacturing out of China and once they moved back going back and\nAnd the problem in the mean ... in the near term is that we have American companies are really good bet the farm on growth in China\nAnd we talked about ... talk about your Starbucks in your General Motors yeah I mean General Motors sells more cars in China than
