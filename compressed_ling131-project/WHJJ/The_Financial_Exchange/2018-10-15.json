is if you have rates going up meaning that the the the treasury is going to have to pay more on the bonds that issues at auction\nAid that extra interest is going to eat into the federal budget which means we then have to borrow more or cut other programs for it and so you end up with this crowding out scenario because you don't have foreign buyers to sterilize the U.S debt anymore and you potentially end up with some nasty situations as a result of that\nIt's not something that is guaranteed to happen because hey maybe things get cleared up internationally all of a sudden China says

Maine\nI have a good buddy of mine from a Alabama who I was talking to him over the weekend he went down to Mississippi or over the Mississippi for a wedding\nAnd he said for everyone who ever makes fun of Alabama have them go to Mississippi and they won't make fun of Alabama and these are his exact words [laughter] um but yeah so you take a look at these uh these numbers here [noise] um what what stood out do you most overall in terms of some of these trends\nLike I just look at wages in like in Maine the average weekly wage is eight hundred and ten bucks a week how do you live on eight hundred and ten bucks a week even if your housing is inexpensive [laughter] yeah I I think it is\nAgain it is different when you're in different parts of the country and you can if you take a look at some of these areas Indiana I'll just use it as an example you know Indiana their wage growth is slowly one point two percent\nUm but it's really cheap place to live actually like you can live off of you know twenty five thirty grand a year pretty comfortably and a lot of these ... or low property taxes property taxes are low you're overall expenses are low 'cause a lot of the food is grown relatively close by they don't ship it long distances\nYou know things like that make a big difference there but in terms of the overall economy is that you see here\nWhat stands out to me and you talk about this an awful lot\nIt's education yep you know education makes a big difference you talk in Washington state Colorado\nDC you taught Texas Massachusetts Virginia Iowa those your top ten and they always are have really good public universities or really good private universities in them so they don't ... it really does make a big difference there when it's all said and done\nBut I look at Vermont and New Hampshire a pretty good at it education infrastructure and their economies are good I think\nPart of that is is so education I think is a big piece there um but if you use those cases I think it's just size and scale you know they just can't get to the overall size 'em in critical mass in those places you know Vermont's got the second smallest population in the country\nUm then and I think that plays in their Florida you've got a good economy we have your ... growing at two and a half percent yup eleventh best in the country and again you talked about really good education University of Miami one of the best schools in the country\nYou know they've got some obviously they schools are good state schools are pretty good they've ... they've gotten better they didn't used to be great but they've got to get out of the nation systems terrible but again on the private side they've got some good private university\nI was talking about your grammar school though like if you live in a in Boca you're not sending your kid to public school no\nSo I I think in general it's its its size and education and kind of are the two pieces that you need in order to kind of get things moving\nNetflix with the ... what's the problem and Netflix they laid an egg\n[noise] well they they did in that they didn't grow at the rate that people were expecting that came in with five point five one million new subscribers in second quarter this is what we found back in\nUh when they reported earnings last quarter\nThat was down from seven point for when the previous quarter and blow six point two million that they had guided to in April the big thing is Netflix is a growth company okay and when you buy a gross company they're not buying the cash flow that they have the day you're buying the potential cash flow they might have tomorrow\nAnd the issue with that is if they miss numbers like this the stock does get punished this stock went from for Nineteen of sharing July down to three sixteen in mid August ... around three twenty four share today so it's all about twenty five percent almost twenty five percent from its highest here\nHas to do with all the competition coming
