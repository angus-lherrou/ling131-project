I mean you see that even healthcare though is that there is a story recently about um\nCommunications and maternity ward in the hospital I Believe in the south shore\nUm and how they were looking at ... variant birth time because there have been such a reliance on trying to control the birth that instant ... through the roof and a lot of doctors didn't have the skills on ... to be able to handle you know breach birth and unusual press so they're trying to bring that back through a team model and\nI just think it's interesting just you know we rely ON Technology so much that like you said we're not giving ourselves the time we need in order to develop skills and I think that there is an argument to be made across the board across different industries reinvest singing that education and teaching people how to do it\nYou did bring up this this actually I'm I'm gonna hijack you're pointing completely has tried to make my point I'm Sorry in advance but\nRobotic system surgery we see this used in a ton of common procedures right now are all over the place we see robots that are being used to do surgery that traditionally had been done by hand with a doctor but we see them being used\nBecause they're often more efficient and more precise than a doctor can be in some of these surgeries\nWe don't say no I Want a doctor there to do that we say hey the robots just as good if not better in some cases and doctors have said yeah you know what they actually are and so you see robots being used more commonly in a lot of these cases if we can trust robots with surgery can we trust them to fly a plane\nI guess that's where we said on that so and you can either text in just six three five six six and I'll\nContinue to take all the punishment that's coming my way 'cause I Know I

about how employers are trying to battle back against high healthcare costs Marshall thanks for joining us today\nThank you for having me on Marshall before we get into what employers are doing we have any data on just how bad the problem of health care costs have gotten for employers these days\nWell if you're an employee and you have benefits through your employer you probably have noticed how year after year your cost keeps going up your benefits\nGoing getting worse and um you're out of pocket a spending keeps getting higher and so it really is affecting people's take home pay you know about a hundred and fifty one million Americans\nGet their benefits through their employer and literally the costs keep going up every year now for decades\nOr isn't just because the care itself has gotten more expensive\nIt hasn't gotten more complicated to do it in ... when I'm you know this year than it was five years ago or tab Europe and the extra moved in fact a lot of that technology is exactly the same but there's a whole network there are layer upon layer of metal man\nThat are pulling money out of the system and finding new ways to keep taking more and more money for the employers and workers and that's why we keep hearing more and more money\nBurger Marshall we've got to run but thanks for joining us today we really appreciate and thanks for putting this together it's great work I asked you to great art or have you\nBut as Marshall Allen from ProPublica talking about employers in the cost of health care and and certainly you know just about anyone in\nYou know you could pick any time pretty want the last five years ten years or Twenty years it's not just the healthcare has gotten more expensive but a lot more that costs being pushed towards individuals' deductibles continue to rise um just because the overall cost of insurance is\nIf it's not right now to be completely honest you know do that in it and it's so hard for us to measure those costs changed because someone will say oh gee the cost of a ... you know your plan went up by five percent this year\nBut when it by five percent but you're deductible increased by twenty percent so how much more you actually paying it's really tough to measure those changes\nAbsolutely and you know as our population demographics chefs for have an aging population we're only going to see more pressure on the system we've got to figure out how to start managing those costs better so we can make sure we can provide quality care and I think that that we focus so much on the cost side that I often think about the actual delivery and not that reality that we're providing\nAbsolutely we got to take a quick break but when we come back\nWe're going to have trivia here on the financial

stake in Starbucks\nYeah he's been historically known as an activist investor although I'm not really sure he's positioned himself as that and Starbucks but it's interesting the Starbucks Starbucks has been facing a number of challenges I mean one of them it's just the fact that people don't want to sugary drinks that their ... aren't quite as far as they used to be\nBut they've also had to kind of slow growth and a lot of ways on they announce closures to that a hundred and fifty stories coming up and typically are twenty Nineteen which is three times the average number of closures that they've had previously\nUm they're looking at the urban markets to open up but there are slowing growth for their license stories as well like the ... you see in supermarkets and you're like that\nSo definitely a lot of challenges there it's going to be interesting to see whether or not he kind of activates and that decides to push for other changes\nStarbucks is one of those companies each time their former CEO Howard Schultz has left you know he's left twice now and each time the company has struggled to find direction and I I I really you know if it happens once you say well maybe it was just a fluke or something\nI Will get that and I I just wonder if it's one of those rare companies that need that specific person there in order to make it successful because yeah I was there was a person who's that transformational\nBut also she's he's willing to try new things right right I mean everything from like the new products you he that he tells you know adding and things like music and stuff like that on you definitely see you know how this creativity plays into the stores and he comes back in\nThere is definitely there definitely is creativity in a a I guess new idea I'm open mindedness in terms of Starbucks but the one thing that they really gave up on soon it through in the white flag our white towel and on was the wine do remember that it\nOnly lasted for maybe like six months to a year they were\nTrying wine at some of the stores and it barely lasted a year and there's just like I feel like that could have been a really nice niche therefore Starbucks you know ... you know right around you know seven o'clock there is still technically open but you can go for coffee and dessert or you have a glass of wine and wine tasting or something like that and I'll\nYou know I Wonder about on that is if maybe I I I almost think that it could have been successful\nJust needed a different brand to put it under yeah you know is its own they I don't know what you call like you're not going to call wind box but whatever you want to call ... lumping that actually sounds smart but just\nYou know Starbucks is a place where people sit down you know they might spend the afternoon working on their novel or on a business plan or something and then a couple of people come in to see them but it might just not be the right atmosphere\nFor hey I Want to stop and for you know a couple of hours in the afternoon just for a glass of wine to catch up with someone I almost wonder if they just needed a different brand to put it under yeah it's a small place it's not a bar it's you know still more of that cafe fielder but just a different\nBrand yeah the environment just isn't Timmy lend itself to kind of a wine bar when he thinking oh I ... that is kind of like ... can you know not really that the cafes wonder about licensing because you know and the ... you know put up some anyhow area that's tough yeah and you really have to go like town by town\nTo download there should be like a wine bar or the you know the Marshall Starbucks or something like that but it's something in downtown Boston or something like you know somewhere near Boston yeah I think I could see that happening a\nWeekly mortgage applications down one point seven percent we know of interest rates above a rather mortgage rates above five percent on thirty are fixed mortgages which just psychologically\nFeels like a huge difference I mean don't get me wrong it is a big difference from where we were a year and a half ago at three and a half percent but it just when you see that five in front of you know the the decimal\nPoint we haven't seen that he's alive [laughter] like\nI I think about it for someone like me and I'm someone who again by the time I got out of college rates were bottoming out okay I look at it and I say I've never seen that that five number up their consistently what I've been in the market for house it just it feels different\nYep yep well not to mention the market in general is also facing weak demand for re five which has really affected the whole industry\nThat that's the indicator that was kind of bothering me a little bit is that more home buyers are looking at those riskier adjustable rate loans and to me that just smacks of you know what we face and the two thousand and ... financial crisis so hopefully people don't get too
