Providence and I aren't radio station\nBit well we'll see you know we talked about rising interest rates one of the things that does impact is your ability to buy a house and we ran through the six New England states and Florida in Connecticut Chuck\nThe median home price has two hundred and thirty eight thousand dollars so to buy that house theoretically you're going to take a mortgage out of a hundred and Ninety thousand dollars at four point nine percent which is where mortgage rates are today that monthly payment is a thousand and Thirteen dollars\nBut if the rates go up and here's what the president's fear is the rate goes from four point nine to six that payment goes from a thousand Thirteen to one thousand one hundred and forty four dollars if the home is still price the same with the\nWay I tend to look at it a lot of people\nAnd again people do this even though it's I don't usually recommend it mhm they buy at the top end of their price range they say hey the banks so that I could borrow three hundred that I'm In a bar or three hundred thousand well if they're doing that in rates go up the banks gonna come back to them and say hey rates went up one percent we can't lend me a three hundred grand anymore we can learn to two hundred and Seventy\nAnd so if that happens to enough people\nWent up sellers have to eventually say gee we can't get what we thought we were going to for the property and prices come down a little bit it makes it more sustainable I\nI think one of the biggest problems with low interest rates is that ... and it's not talked about a lot of let's say that you're saving ten percent of your money for home each year and you're making fifty thousand years you're saving five thousand a year five years now you're going to have two hundred and fifty thousand dollars saved\nIt breaks ... twenty five thousand\nIf rates go down there going to push the price of that property up which means that you're twenty five thousand represents a smaller percentage downpayment so it makes it more difficult for you to buy the place you want to borrow more you know it's an alarming\nIs rates are going up and you still have the millennial generation that hasn't bought a house the vast majority of your peers still do not own a home\nWell if you live in mom and dad's house long enough eventually they're going to be gone and you know upstairs you know all kidding aside those generationally there this is we've never seen anything like this happen\nTo I don't know about never I Would imagine during the great depression we met in the last four generations you know no you're never see you got to go back to the twenties staff you looked at thirty year olds and their homeownership rates right haven't seen this before [noise]\nYou know you have a part of it though if you have in ... and the issue for me is that if you think the fed is going to continue to be easy money in the long run it's a problem because those thirty year olds are gonna get left out of the appreciation that eventually comes in those properties\nSo move as quick as you can because you see they I think what\nI think you can anticipate and this is something I I don't know the correct answer for Twenty years but I Would suggest to folks\nThat inflation is going to run hotter than interest rates and I think the fed is okay with that say and they kind of tell you communicated that you know they'll tell you that they want to see inflation running in that two percent range if it ran at three I don't think they'd worry about it I tend to agree\nI mean Jay Powell said as much I Know he said that in his last you know they said that he wanted to be you know a little bit more hawkish it sounded like and I know everyone panicked on that earlier this year he said look if we have to run a little bit harder to get to a long term average if two and a half two percent inflation will let it run hotter\nIn Florida the median home price is two hundred and twenty four thousand dollars median mortgages a hundred and Seventy nine so Chuck in Florida if your mortgage rate went from four point nine six that would be nine hundred and fifty three dollars a month to a thousand Seventy seven dollars from a\n... yeah twenty bucks yeah so did ... rising rates are having an impact there's no doubt about it um but I Would make the case in the long run your building more stability and more normalcy back into the market\nI don't think it's a problem what do you make of this story though that Americans are starting to say gee renting is not so bad after all cheaper than owning and I'll tell you once you oh you must be experiencing this you know living through your first year of owning a home yes every weekend right there is money out the door and home repairs and project\nSo there's always stuff going on I got I'm doing a big bold plant this week uh yeah I got a hundred and fifty bulbs then I'm going to be all around the guy oh these are back on the oh yeah it'll be a whole lot of fun I won't be able to move well but yeah so you you've got this uh this jumped now that Seventy percent of people now say that renting is more affordable than owning\nUm which is not a great sign if you are someone who's looking to sell a place in the next couple of years 'cause you potentially last buyers that would have come into your you know kind of orbit\nUm I think that's one of the things that is interesting on this is this is a very sentiment that could actually make homeownership more affordable in the long run because if people say look\nThese prices don't make sense and I don't want to be buying I'm not going to buy him not even gonna look no those prices are going to eventually come down and you're going to be able to see people who say hey things have ... it's it's a pendulum swings back and forth 'cause we're not seeing dramatic increases in in mentor airway\nNo and and and we got permits and housing starts this morning that were ... she'll continue slowing um you know the the building that's going on just is not at the level that we want to see it I don't know you know we're still round about twenty percent white as far as what we see
