maker called into site for two point one billion dollars in cash why would they do that\nYes there are they're buying this company or for again that to point one billion dollar\nA price tag on here and you know pretty much Novartis if if you take a look at you know what they're trying to do here\nUm it's ... they're trying to buy effectively drug pipeline specifically related to oncology that's way under state really specializes in I have no idea at all this is a good price or fair price for the company but the big thing is Novartis even growing much organically at this point their sales growth was you know three percent for the quarter\nA there you know earnings growth was two percent for the quarter so they're relatively stable company right now and I think to be completely honest or going out there saying hey we want to try to buy growth for the future\nI thought a lot of them do the right they they they they buy these little small biotech\nSorting out the right now it's one of the main wasted a lot of these companies build their pipelines and grow at this point I'm just because it it gives them away so they don't have to do the early stage investing they can say OK here's where the risk is right [noise]\nLeaving early stage there's risk even if some of these I mean we've seen cases where you know drugs get you know company a buyer you know another company that's been stage to her stage three of you know if the approval and the thing flops on its face and they got it right the whole thing off I mean there there still is that potential out there and there's definitely less risk if you're going in\nTo this to the stage of company but there still is a lot out there just because it again you you never quite know what's going to actually end up paying off I mean think about all the old timers trials that have been out there for the last couple of years where you've had come like Mark said look we're just we're giving up 'cause we can't do any like\n...

about a hundred and forty million dollars to buy this um which I look at this and my first question to be honest was okay so they bought the land for a hundred and forty million to give your factory they built in Nevada cost them was three billion dollars I think\nWhere are they going to get the money to build this thing now\nYou know I Wonder if you know as much as if the Chinese government's investing well in in this is where I was going so you own mosque is obviously not a fan of the SEC the short seller enrichment commission as he called them a couple of weeks ago which probably didn't do any favors\nI Wonder if he ends up getting kind of pushed into China's orbit on this and do we really want to lose a guy like that [noise]\nWell it depends it depends what you mean by a guy like that\nHe's pretty bright guy named ... it'd be like you know you think about all the innovation that he's brought whether you're talking about pay Powell a space sacks he space excellent hip and you know test of whether you like the guy or not it's pretty smart guy either of you really want to chase them into the arms of the Chinese are\nReally smart guy there's no doubt about it but I Would make the case is kind of chase themselves they're ... you know it's not like based on behavior yeah we ... it it's all his own doing that you know so I I just wonder if you start sending up booking coaster that orbit but to be honest I don't know if you'd really get along well in China I don't know that you know like I\nLike I say and he's going to go five hundred thousand cars a year there I don't know if he doesn't\nLike the oversight from the SEC yeah you think he's going to like Chinese oversight right in Chinese oversight is come over here we're going to put a bullet in your head so it's it's it's something I I just don't know if he is necessarily a good fit over it but he might find themselves kind of pushed into that orbit\nNow though is a ... we will watch that story or with continued interest\nA question comes up what happens if you convert a rental property indoor personal resident hook you say your bottom property in Florida and you you live in New England you bought a property in Florida you bought it five years ago he bought a ten years ago\nAnd you rented it out so you've been renting it out collecting the income on it and now you're retiring truck and you want to move into that ... property in Florida\nGet a CPA yeah get ... yeah so\nIn the way that it typically works remember you can declare a property as a primary residence if you've lived there for two out of five years and being able to do that allows you to offset up to five hundred thousand dollars and capital gains if you're married two hundred and fifty thousand if you are single that's the exemption you get if you're able to satisfy that requirement\nIt's a little different when you have a rental property in that if you've been depreciating rental property there's going to be some recapture of that depreciation that you've taken and that\nThat's what I wanted to point out on this story when you do that you can do it you can convert a rental property into a personal residents you can get the five hundred thousand dollar tax free game but you can never escape that depreciation recapture you're always going to pay the taxes on that\nSo if you owned it for ten years and you wrote off two hundred thousand dollars in depreciation yeah even if you're within that five hundred thousand kept game tax free cap game you're still going to pay the tax on that two hundred thousand of\nDepreciation that you know it's really important to make sure that you have a tax adviser who looked at that just because otherwise\nIt's going to be a situation where I've seen cases where people don't realize that the case and all of a sudden the IRS is you know sending them a letter and they're going gee I thought I got this exemption you got the exemption on the sales price but do you have to factor in that depreciation recapture\nComing up we're going to be joined by Stephen Moore and asked Steve some questions as it relates to wages and worker shortages that his next on the financial
