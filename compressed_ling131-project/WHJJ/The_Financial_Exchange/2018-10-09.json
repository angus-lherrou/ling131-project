price dealer price to be happier if your car shopping you probably heard these terms what do they mean its\nAnd there were driverless cars for example which has nothing to do with you know Web searches but it's something that they're they're investing in the future this raises the question though but social media I mean we talked about the scale the someone like a Facebook has\nWould be very difficult to replicate and I would argue that and I'm not a big fan of all Facebook because I I think it's a it's a lousy platform but they may end up having a monopoly when it comes to large social media platforms think about all the money they're having to invest to right now to make it safe\nAnd to deal with fake news and the deal with a ... multiple accounts it's a big investment in the question is how many other companies are people who make that kind of investment and how do you think we're like okay if I sign up for Google Plus it's really no good unless you also do write and my other best friends do\nI don't know I I tend to think that there will always be some replacement to the big question I have is just Facebook just by all of them out like Instagram started attracting a lot of users away from Facebook ... bottom Snapchat has had a similar impact as well so\nIt's a fast moving industry I don't worry about Facebook achieving monopoly in that area of situation is the documents that have been discovered I'm assuming we're just getting information on this story or so it it's not a whole lot clear as to why this did come out eventually my guest and somebody like that\nThe documents ... there's a quote from the wall Street Journal the document shows Google officials felt that disclosure could have serious ramifications revealing the incident would likely result in us coming into the spotlight along side or even instead of Facebook despite having stayed on the radar throughout the Cambridge analytical scandal\nAnd this is so much worse yeah this is so much worse than having been alongside Facebook during that issue\nAnd think about what they're saying is Facebook has got a lot of bad publicity\nLet's not get them aware of that type of listening now let's just make sure all the ... this right under the rug is all Cambridge Analytica and all the issues Facebook has let's keep our problems quiet yep on top of the fact that the major technology companies were invited to Washington to discuss issues\nAnd I you know I I'm I defend the government they kept that seat empty yup Google nobody showed up now and they won't face the music and they have a lot of issues to deal with in terms of privacy and the way in which they regulate themselves it's basically a self regulation it's like a whole different world\nYeah it's not good chief executive officer a cinder ... almost definitely going to be testifying Congress now that we're no doubt about it yeah subpoena time exam they're they're lucky Europeans GDP the general general data protection regulation just went into effect in may whereas this incident took place in March\nOr that new law requires companies to notify regulators breaches ... hours so if this law had been to place than Google it'd be facing a massive find from the European regulators as\nThere are kind of in a gray area now as to what's actually going to happen if there will be any fines ... probably they're going to be finds here I Will give the European regulators a lot of credit because they've been bad as a good rule\nYeah it's a great role and they've been way out in front of the rest of the world when it comes to issues concerning Google al ... and ... were were sort of pointing up at this point that the United states did not have a law like this on the books it is\nOr the lack of regulation is really troublesome because uh there's millions and millions of people who are using these products\nThey're following us everywhere we go they're listening to our conversations they know more about us than we think we know about ourselves on the other hand and and they and they operate independently and it's like don't bother us we're not accountable yeah and and I\nKnow the argument the other hand as well if you don't like it don't sign up Facebook\nFair but there are some services that it's really difficult to you know there's some online services is pretty difficult to not participate in for you it's tough to not have an email address these days yeah although there are ... yeah there are options though there are options that are more secure than yoga agreed but hey you still need to have data protection laws in place to protect us from\nIt's very difficult to have no on line a personality today have no online presence whatsoever is very very difficult in this day and age it's hard not to be on Facebook\n... or ... especially if you're in business I mean if you're in business if you have a if you're trying to keep up with family down the main reason that I use it uh all of my ... my family ah in my wife's family is all on Facebook and wants pictures of my kids and it's just a heck of a lot easier [laughter]\nWe've got great pictures of your kids and I can I can tell you that it's one of the highlights of Facebook at least when Mike I'm the European general data protection regulation by the way a threatens penalties up to two percent of your world or the companies worldwide revenue if they fail to adhere to these rules so\nPretty stiff regulation that unfortunately was not in place when Google broke these rules\nAre so we will see what happens with school based on these results are beginning to be held accountable that is good news and the good news if you're at Google investor on the other hand is fortunately this isn't all the Google dust Oh absolutely ... Facebook that's all that Facebook does there a social media platform and debate screwed it up\nGoogle is much more than a social media platform they screwed up their social media piece of it though\nAnd absolutely and understand when it comes to search advertising Google has a gold mine\nThey do I just hope it's not indicative of a culture at Google that we are just now getting a look underneath the hood at because we trusted them with a lot of information you're absolutely right we have\nUm we're going to take a quick break when we come back Laura Adams from drivers ed dot coms

new tax credits being rolled out this year a and a lot a lot of things have changed with the tax code sorry we're gonna talk about this briefly but it's really important that if you\nIf you're not a hundred percent certain what's changing with the tax to sit down with a tax break air if you do your taxes every year and this is going to be something new for you\nI might recommend really talking with a tax expert at least understanding the new changes that are going into place here\nGreat advice because there are changes some some major changes a a real beneficiary here is a families with kids\nBecause the uh the tax cuts in JOBS Act that what's the name for the tax cut doubles the maximum child credit from a thousand to two thousand dollars per qualifying child\nBut what you referenced is up\nKids were older than Seventeen who don't qualify as kids um who are going to school up to age twenty three and again we want to consult your tax advisor on the bus you may be eligible for a tax credit a new tax credit of up to five hundred dollars for those defendants again we're talking about\nChildren in the household the normal children they're actually adults are up to age twenty three who are students\nRight so and you can take up to five hundred dollars just in specific rules you have to have her basically half of their cost of living are so very specific rules
