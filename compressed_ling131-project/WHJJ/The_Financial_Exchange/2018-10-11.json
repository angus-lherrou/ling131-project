opportunity came to mind that abortion\nCormac gossip mill is perhaps the most prolific serial killer in America you know read you\nAnd if that's money you need twenty four months from now ah you know in my experience uh the last upside to you know money that you could have had in the stock market for two years is so much less painful than the downside of money you left in the stock market\nTo last let's say that you've got ten thousand dollars that you put away for a car you know you need a car in the next year okay\nIs it worth trying to get that up to eleven thousand with the danger that it could fall down to seven in my book it's not just because you don't know what the market's going to do in the short term so I I tend to agree with you on that\nThis does lead us to our poll question of the day how worried are you about the markets sell off very worried slightly worried are not worried at all Tucker what kind of results are we seeing in a in the polls us\nFor a leading the way right now is a amongst our listeners are not worried at all at forty two percent fall by slightly worried at forty percent and uh finishing a distant third is very worried at Seventeen percent [noise]\nAnd I I like already and I think they have dealt with I think ... you know it's ... and again it's not saying that you know you shouldn't look at this and say gee that's interesting that the market felt you know three and a half percent yesterday\nBut if you've allocated yourself properly it shouldn't make a difference in your overall long term plan and that's that's the big thing that you need to be focused on what to talk a little bit about what President Trump is focused on because we had a couple of comments from him yesterday specifically are with regards to the Federal Reserve\nA with him saying that the fed had quote John loco arose rather was going loco ... his bilingual who knew what's what's your take on this\nOr if it's a you know it's a unique approach to ah speaking about the fed or president has unique approach to speak about a lot of different things for you know the past forty four presidents typically a you had them not making critical comments about fed and fed policy and sort of\nYou know trying to stay out of that and um you know it's part of the whole deal that I think you get with this current president he's going to speak his mind in a way that we have not\nBeen a particularly accustomed to before this and um you know I Would say on the on the merits of it um it looks to me like the fed is being anything but logo you know it now is the time with uh what we're seeing with inflation with economic growth\nIf now is not the time to get back to a scene interest rate policy when is [noise]\nAnd and I think that you know a lot of people talk about okay is you know is it appropriate that the president's talking about the fed and this and that and look to the feds a bunch of grown ups they can fend for themselves so I'm not worried about you know the president break the fourth wall and talk to the fed when\nThey're grown ups they can deal with themselves they're all adults they all knew how to handle themselves they're all mature people who can you deal with things like this\nWhat I'm curious about in in what I kind of get out of this\nYou know because everyone will go through that and said oh you know defend supposed to be independent how could you do this I look at it and ask what if he's right okay or is he writes ... is the wrong and from my perspective\nI don't think he's right on this but here's why I don't think he's right when you look at what the fed is doing here they have a dual mandate okay their mandate is to keep inflation in check and maintain full employment okay there's supposed to do both of those things\nWith the current policy that they are are they are doing both of those things inflation is in check it's not too hot and we are at full employment so when I look at what the fed is doing\nI don't really have a huge problem with it in the interim okay now they could get to a point where they start to escalate to quickly and maybe they start to cause a slowdown that leads to unemployment okay hasn't happened yet hasn't happened so I'm not going to criticize them for something that they haven't done to this point\nThey don't have a mandate to maintain stock prices in a narrow range so\nI don't really get upset at the fed if the market you know it was kind of waking up to this and saying [noise]\nThere's a threat here that we didn't really pricing properly and now we need the prices in that's the markets fault not the feds and you don't have to worry about mid term elections four weeks [noise]\nNo no it's ... and so when when I look at this I say\nYou know it's it's it's interesting 'cause everyone jumped right to oh should the president be doing this I see what it doesn't matter whether he should or not the fed can handle themselves the question is is he right is he on the money on this end to this point\nThe fed has neither caused a recession nor have they cause additional inflation and so when I look at it I say hey I don't think the criticisms warranted if he wants to say it go ahead to drill pelican handled self and if you're shocked by the president saying shocking things\nYou probably need to get a wake up wake up where have you been for the last three years so I don't have a problem with them staying because again the fed can deal with it\nBut the interesting thing is pay like ... if their merit behind this and that's where I think

I mean look at all the overtime games this year or two\nTons of them and in the ... the games the more competitive and there's a benefit is a quarterback driven league at this point oh yeah of all the rules against the defenses yeah there are so many good quarterback like whether you're talking you know people making their first starts like Patrick homes or someone like that\nYou have interesting stories in terms of quarterbacks to new locations you got her cousin's going up to Minnesota\nYou know you've got a lot of good quarterbacks now where'd you go back you know five or ten years ago and the picture was just like there were a lot of teams that just didn't have a chance you know they they get on the field and it's a great you're starting you know Chad Pennington again great you're going to look like you have nothing you can do their wares this year it's\nHey you know we're the Cleveland Browns we've been awful forever but let's see what banker may feel ... you know it's just there there's a little bit more interest especially in some cities that I think down and out for a while there are other cities that are going to continue to be down and out for a while but it seems to be more competitive as a whole\nSo the anthem protests everything like that has had zero effect on the ratings this year the up and all the time they're not showing\nThe old for that anymore and I also wonder you know we're way has the uh Colin Kaepernick Nike ad campaign and somebody said that to have that sort of pulled some energy on that whole issue away from the NFL and put it into Nike and that's probably good for football\n[noise] the thing that I still find fascinating on that whole thing is\nYou know you you of Nike sponsoring the NFL and that gives it it's a really interesting juxtaposition I I don't know how I don't know if we've ever seen as the ... like that before but it's it's fascinating just to see how that works out uh with regards to you know what what's going on there", "show_name": "The Financial Exchange", "year": "2018", "city": "Providence", "day": "11"}
