and\nYou've seen wages going up in that area from eight to twelve percent per year my question is are we just finding a different way to ship these goods or is there truly a decline coming in terms of the number of orders in the number of shipments that we're seeing across the country\nI think that when we look at some of the other data that's ... that it it is out there and I I hate to keep going back to the south Korea number but we had a number from South Korea last month exports declined eight point six percent year over year if that matches up pretty closely with this decline in truck order so okay\nAnd so I look there and I say look there is absolutely a trucker shortage that is going on right now that probably leads to a lot of you know companies saying\nHey why are we going to order a truck just sits around with no dry for like ... that makes sense\nThere will be some whatever [laughter]\nAnyways what I'm trying to get at is what you absolutely have a trucker shortages probably affecting this but I also think there is a plot totaling that's going on right now just because of that one time stimulus of effect of tax reform starting to wear wear off a little bit and I do think\nAh that you have some international pressures that reducing the amount of commerce that's being done overall [laughter]\nSo we're we're been talking about a bunch a barricade scenarios talk about a bowl if you're going to be bullish on this economy up what is going to grow earnings for ... for companies over the next let's call it three years and then we've got tax reform behind us and what\nIs going to change whether it be political policy whether it be can you know consumer behavior what's going to change to make this US Economy continue to burn on all cylinders\nIf you look at the two biggest things that would have a stimulus of effect over the next twelve months number one is getting trade deals hammered out with all these other countries not just you know redoing NAFTA so getting that squared away just so you don't have an certainly from a supply chain perspective\nNumber two infrastructure projects okay\nGet infrastructure projects going figure out ways to get that money you know deployed and so forth we're gonna have trouble getting enough workers there so it might even be something where we say look we need to come up with temporary visa programs in order to get workers in for\nThese infrastructure projects because we know we don't have enough construction workers today I'll never happened I'm not you asked me the bookcase yep you asked me the bowl chair that ... is it okay so that's\nIf you want the most bullish case that you can have get all these trade issues behind us figure out ways to get infrastructure don't gets more people into the workforce in the short term\nThat's how you keep this party going for the next two to three years that's that's the ... so there's a path there it's tough okay 'cause I don't see the issue with China going away anytime soon\nI don't see us coming up with any ... any kind of big infrastructure plan that actually can get through Congress anytime soon so\nThe bull case I think it's a it's tougher to stretch that out more than twelve to Eighteen months I think we still have at least another\nYear or two to three quarters of the minimum left here before this thing starts to get a little bit dicey but look I'll be honest if you continue to see wage growth like this that's going to stretch this thing out even more just because the concern is look if you don't have wage growth how do people spend they can only borrow so much if you have wage growth that question goes away\nYeah I was gonna say the barricades here and you know it might not be great for the stock market you know as you see a slowdown in earnings that might not be Griffiths awkward but it's probably not that bad of a case for the average American worker because I don't think unemployment is about to shoot up and I don't think that wage growth is about to stagnate\nDepends what causes it you know if it if it's caused by just a shortage of workers and things like that yeah you can you can figure that out eventually if these trade issues blow up and continue to get worse than then you've got some concerns because they'll get supplies and when you have supply issues you got prices going up not because you don't have\nA demand for stuff you have no problems actually getting stuff to people and it's you know we've gone through that with you know oil shortage is back in the seventies ... we've we've talked about this kind of stuff before it's not pretty if you see that\nSo all this does bring us to our poll question\nIt does in our poll question of the day is up right now it's up on financial exchange show dot com you can go over there and vote in our poll question is have you received more than a three percent raise in the last year we say this or we ask that simply because we are talking about wage growth now we're

Texas it's six three five six six and tell us what industry do you work in where we're we're looking for some trends here I don't think we've quite seen any real big trends in terms of what industries
