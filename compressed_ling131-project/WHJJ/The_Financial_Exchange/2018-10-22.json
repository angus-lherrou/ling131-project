Medicare tax on every penny you could make a million bucks and you're paying that Medicare tax on the million dollars earning ...\nOne thirty two nine hundred there and it looks like a that is the same kind of the top five Ninety three point five percent so there's about six and a half percent of people that are going to be affected\nBy this they just means that you know an extra paycheck you're you're paying that fake attacks and it's a big tax it's a flat tax\nIt is if if you're self employed you're paying off the twelve point four percent if you are employed by a company you pay six point two percent and the company pays six point\nTwo percent as well people forget that you know they they talk about tax rates right they say Oh nice my tax rates thirty five percent on forty one percent gotta factor that in and then they forget about the state well you're thirty five percent is another five ... of the state ... ... in most cases not Florida\nA normal retirement age is increasing by two months that's just that's part of the I think that went into effect in the Nineteen nineties where they pushed out the retirement age\n[noise] you know it was one of the things that they did in order to make the program more sustainable it's going to be something they have to do again if they want to you know deal with the funding issues are that the trust fund has or rather is going to have an about fourteen years\nNow and he can make a little bit more money or those of you who collect your Social Security early you can earn a little bit more money without suffering a reduction in your benefit in those early years you know sixty two to sixty Seventy\nHalf you retire before full retirement age will now be able to earn Seventeen thousand six hundred and forty dollars a year up from Seventeen thousand forty uh that's what you'd be able to earn with out it affecting your benefit\nGreat question that a lot of people have actually look if you're retiring in a given year\nLet's say you retire in July of that year a lot of people have a question hey can I earned income prior to that but in excess of that\nThe answer is yes now if you are turning full retirement age and twenty Nineteen and you can earn up to forty six thousand nine twenty in the months prior to turning normal retirement age but if you earn more than that than Social Security with old one dollar for every three dollars above the limits\nA lot of money a lot of money by us shale has a glaring problem this is one this and unfortunately our friends in Saudi Arabia are aware of this yeah we're producing a lot of oil in the United states I think we're we're the largest producer in the world in the army or second largest or read\nProbably depends on the given week but we're right in the ballpark yeah problem is we're losing money doing it well it's as though here's what's interesting is in particular this was looking at a review of thirty three quote publicly traded oil and gas fracking companies so this is just companies that are involved\nA in oil and gas fracking not companies that are uh you know just have that as a portion of their business but purely ones that do that\nAnd what it found um were that these thirty three companies posts they combined three point nine billion dollars in negative cash flow in the first half of twenty Eighteen ...\nNegative cash flow in the short term doesn't necessarily mean you're going to be negative in the long run is that because you get a lot of ... or a lot have a lot of ... they didn't break it out really so it's hard to say where it's coming from\nUm but it's it's something that I think could be a little bit of a red herring just because it could be that they're just investing a ton of money right now because they think oil prices are going to continue to move up words so I'm curious to see what this looks like on a consistent basis just you know obviously we've seen this report here\nWhat was it a year ago what was it two years ago you know is is this something that's changing here you know because companies are adding so much capacity in the U.S right now we've seen us capacity\nGo for about eight and a half million barrels a week up to eleven million or a day rather up to eleven million barrels a day over the last two and a half years it could just be they're adding a ton of capacity and that's what's going on here\nStill distribution issue ultimately though isn't it they we we either don't have the ports are we don't have the pipelines to get it where we need it because we theoretically we shouldn't be exporting any oil if we had enough pipelines to get it where we needed more profitable to export [noise]\nYeah but it should it ever be more ... like if you think about where we can export it to her to export to China why should we have to ship it all the way to China shouldn't it be less expensive to send it to the northeast by pipeline than shipping it to China on a barge what\nThey think it is less expensive that's why you ship it to China instead 'cause it's more profitable because again they're they're China is now the biggest I understand her oil in the world they have the demand and they don't have the production I understand and they need to be able to pay for\nThis or either going me your your produce 'cause most of our oil is coming from the Permian Basin Texas right oh it's it's scattered\nI mean you've got big deposits now that have shown up in like in Colorado you've got the\nColonel production though is it's the largest come and I think it's about thirty percent that's in Texas so you got your biggest slug coming out of there and we're still importing between what we buy from Canada and in our friends in the middle east we're still importing a good seven million barrels a day yeah so I ... my point is if if you had\nA distribution system would you really need to be exporting at all but ... what it wouldn't you be better oh you mean by distribution system pipelines\nWell how do you think the ... getting to the ports it is truck but ... the the we can't get natural gas to the northeast and we can't get oil to the north and I guess the different issues\nSo I think when when we look at ... gas that's a very separate issue that local to the northeast and and that's because we haven't built pipelines\nBut if you look at how you know oil is flowing around most of the country right now it's it's not a pipeline issue to get it to most places aside from the northeast now you know the northeastern isolated issue but it's of its own making you know they they do because we won't allow the pipelines that's the big thing if you look at the entire rest of the country they don't have the same issues\nComing up we're going to tell you why you should no longer put your vodka in the freezing I thought everybody put their vodka in the freezer I thought I was just like what you're supposed to do that only I was wrong refrigerant America's got vodka and ... that's got to come to a stop we'll talk about next on the financial exchange\nCommission news is cones break and we're here to break it down and show what it means to your
