A. dot com [noise]\nHi Michelle I'm often hear one of the biggest outrageous I recorded on the trial of abortion doctor Kermit got now\nHow the woman goes into his money comes out of data there is no police report\nI helped expose the crime the mainstream media tried to cover up we had instructions natural course they got now movie it's amazing Cormac ... perhaps the most holistic zeroed in American bring friends and family you do not want to pass a unique opportunity to change our mind about abortion goes\nRated PG Thirteen no play\nTonight ten nine central on ABC finish the sentence for millennia Trump is the first lady\nWomen in the me too movement call you a supporter no question is off limits you're not the first first lady to\nHave to deal with her husband's alleged infidelity has just put a strain on your marriage tonight what will Milan even Trump say let's talk about the jacket this\nWhy did you wear being ... [noise]\nWhen does it closed for the day isn't there a circuit breaker that kicks in my home now and I know there might be now there's there's which to be honest I don't think there should be but just because it doesn't do any now it doesn't but I I you might be right on that I Can't remember the specifics there just because we haven't seen triggered\nUm if you go back to October twenty eighth Nineteen twenty nine again October kind of a trend here okay kicked off really the the Great Depression\nOr with the wall street crash kicking off on the twenty eighth twelve point eight two percent so\nThat would be somewhere in the ballpark of around twenty eight hundred points right now and you continue down the list\nYou know it it would be we're talking thousands of points here ... we saw five hundred yesterday we saw eight hundred the day before it's not a whole lot of fun even if you combine those two days into one which doesn't make sense because there are two separate days it still doesn't even get into your ... your twenty worst days in doubt Jones history\nIt's the problems we love talking about the points to\nThe point some of the doubt it's irrelevant the percentages on these things that really are a relevant factor here and yeah I mean you know a couple of percent has nothing to sneeze at but it's not a ... a significant amount\nOr the ... the a circuit breakers by the way if you're a you see a seven percent decline that is a Fifteen minute halt\nThirteen percent decline is another Fifteen minute halt and if you see a twenty percent the climate anytime during the day trading shell halt for the remainder of the trading day so not really that possible to have a twenty percent plus market decline these days\nIf you want to talk about volatility by the way we look at what happened in October of twenty nine okay on ten twenty eight on October twenty eighth of Nineteen twenty nine markets fell Thirteen percent\nThe next day you sit there and say oh gee maybe we'll get a relief rally nope down in additional twelve percent okay so you're pretty much down twenty percent in those two days\nThe following day on the thirtieth bounces back up twelve percent okay and then five or six days later on the ... of November back down in additional ten percent so like\nYou you talk about what we're seeing now I get it it's uncomfortable if don't comfortable for every one\nThis is all happened before and it's all been way worse ship so take heart in that but hey we've gotten through things that are worse will get through this we will okay let's talk about some good news for Social Security recipients getting a to point eight percent boost the Social Security administration announcing yesterday\nBased on the average benefit people receive it's going to be about forty dollars more a month in Americans' pockets\nIn really good news for the last time we talked about this uh was last year and there was a pretty big Social Security boost last year or two of the problem was it got eaten up by everyone's Medicare premiums that does not appear to be happening this time Medicare costs are expected to stay in check this year a\nPart B coverage which covers doctor visits other types of outpatient care is expected to increase between a dollar fifty and hundred thirty five which is an ex credibly wide range but they're not going to one thirty five right yeah that's not a range oh sorry I didn't like one thirty four right now I got it\nWas poorly written throwing up a fifty ... buck fifty to one thirty five exactly so it's not a huge inflation and the health care costs are surprisingly this year so you're going to really see most of that increase in Social Security which is a nice surprise\nYeah and so again you know for I I Know that sometimes we look at forty dollars and say gee what's that mean for someone for the people who are living just on Social Security which again it's a lot of people I think it's close to forty percent of people live only off their Social Security benefit once they're retired so it's a big chunk of the population\nThat forty dollars a month is real money you know it is something significant okay and so if it shouldn't be pooh poohed I Know people say oh gee it's only two point eight percent forty dollars a month is real money to a lot of people hear\nIt you know it it's the difference between being able to pay in some cases for you know certain prescriptions that you may have the ability to you know around the holidays go out and buy a president for a niece and nephew a grand center a granddaughter is someone like that\nSo it's important to see this it's been really tough the last few years when we take a look at Social Security or the Cole is the cost of living adjustment\nIs what they call it um effectively it really has not been significant in recent years the last time that we saw an adjustment this big was two thousand eleven\nAnd the only times we've always seen it twice in the last decade north of two point eight percent other than that it's been all two percent or below so this is big for the for a lot of folks who are living on a fixed income because I Know that you know we look at the inflation numbers that are out there and we say oh gee you know inflation's pretty tame\nHey if you're on a fixed budget you know the inflationary cost probably are higher than what the government tells you because of the way that they measure the\nEasy to forget how rampant inflation was backing away seventies and eighties and Seventy nine or ten percent cola increase right Haiti fourteen percent Ninety One eleven percent that is just crazy\n[noise] so Google a revealing a whole bunch of new devices or with their latest uh you know roll out of uh these different uh you know what what would you call them smart devices I guess\nFor Google smart devices they also about their new version of their pixel phone or so it was a bit of a combination of different products for them uh and this is right on the heels of Facebook's own smart home product which at least from people that I've talked to has been a big flop and bad timing for the company\nI'm Google made a pretty smart decision I think with one of their smart home products what they do what what what are they talking about doing here so Facebook let's start with what Facebook did which is they put a\nAlmost like an iPad type device that uh you can do video chats with within your home runs on the air\nAnd that's on a Alexa smart home device\nGoogle has put out a new product which it looks like it's again it's another smart home product it's using the Google smart devise a but it's mainly use for watching video not performing video calls and the thing that they I think addressed properly is the creepy factor they said\nYou know why should I hang up on the right it's hey were brand new to this industry people are still getting over the fact that there is a speaker in their home listening to them they probably don't want a video camera watching them at the same time so\nThey admitted a camera on their version of this you can't do video conferencing with it but I think that's you know for somebody that's looking for this maybe they're just looking to be able to watch a quick video and how to cook something I\nI think it's a smart move at least for their first generation of this\nAre

are definitely not dealing with it\nBut apple and Google are taking it upon themselves to come up with something because they know it's a huge complaint they want people to continue to use their phones obviously a so they are doing something with it and I I like I like a couple of the solutions actually why and stuff are they talking about\nSo I like the one that Google is doing a particular 'cause I think it's just a need technology but what they're doing is they're going to have they're going to roll out a a screen this call button\nSo if you pop up in your phone and it's raining and you look at the number and you say I think this is garbage there's a screen call button and the Google Assistant will hop on and they'll let the color no hey we're screening this call\nAnd ask them for their name and so you'll be basically just looking at the phone it'll regions a transcript of what that person is saying on the phone and you'll be able to say oh yeah it's my long lost cousin

they're trying to look at the data behind the incoming call to determine whether they're you know\nLegitimate or whether they're you know afford Internet calls but the fake phone number\nI don't

story out of the wall Street Journal today according to a number of economists\nUh that were surveyed by the wall Street Journal or they are relatively ambivalent on this new deal with Canada and

big changes in the U.S economy I'm among them I don't think that the new the written NAFTA deal is all that big of a change so I wouldn't expect a huge impact the economy\nEither but you know I think
