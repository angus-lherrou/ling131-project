I I really am surprised more people are not just checking off [laughter]\nI'm black Native American that sort of thing on their on their college applications is mostly college applications I don't think you see as much of this maybe I'm wrong um in hiring for jobs\nUm I guess we'll have to go to the left to go back to the old the old south blood tests on what percentage actually makes you someone deserving of prefer treatment in America Lewis wars are living in an America with white privilege it's just that no one wants\nTo be white because you won't be admitted [laughter] and you get a job\nRight ... that's the that's the whole thing but the you know she's gone back to the one drop rule this is the the ... she's the classic Democrat right one drop makes you a friendly and non white as far as she's concerned by the way here's some of the things she she advise people to tune out the lies\nOkay [laughter] hired the facts I don't understand what a lot of the fact is she is one one thousand twenty four\nIn the ... that get experts she chose to look into that\nFor her that's when he came up with so what what is the law it's a lie that one one thousand twenty fourth isn't full blooded and again I don't understand what the argument is here yeah\nWhen I was hired expert this is like you know Christine Blasey Ford taking their own polygraph and then releasing the result she hired this guy so what's the lie\nRight well she she's talking about the lies about by Donald Trump but she's uh what else is she saying he you know he cheats that's another thing he everybody's cheating\nI mean she's the cheater here right she treated us she cheated on her way up the uh the academic a totem pole\n[laughter] I mean I think I think the holy already of your longtime mascot being fully exposed to the world is going to lose your mind she has been completely exposed to no end of the evidence here and go\nOr do I get I get it again and I said my column believe believe in my column today was a list of books warn this bill a fake Indian I understand that I'm just saying I'm just talking about how the mainstream media is\nTrying to portray it you know and by the way here's one we this is the first week in the in the series we all know why real Donald Trump makes creepy physical threats about the right I mean I think we would know about these creepy physical threats of you know do\n[laughter] that's a good thing you can always\nUm facts check their crazed claims about about Trump um but the question what do we know about this if it were true [laughter]\nHow about this one how about this when I asked what you missed the ... or ... Academy Award winning presentation this is the second ... bottom line my heritage played no role in my hiring ever the Boston Globe reviewed all the evidence\nWell if that's the case the Chinese auto when\nIn their lawsuit against Harvard I'm eternally black students and absolutely Native Americans should because Harvard isn't doing affirmative action right\nIf it didn't play yeah you know that's that's another irony here to get it hasn't gotten much play but the she released this this ah fabricated a DNA test\nOn the same day that the trial against her her former employer began in federal court here in Boston\nYou know I mean it's it's rather ironic isn't it I mean she she's ... she's running a scam and at Harvard has been running a scam for all these years I mean the heart Harvard you know Harvard this a century ago Harvard was discriminating against Jews for the same reason to discriminate against Asians because they were doing too well\nYou know and they didn't want to write it and so nothing has really changed their has it\nBut the weird thing about this is I mean normally the\nDouble standards you get on the left it will be um no it's okay for a governor of a state to state employees bring a low level employee to his hotel room dropped his pants and take his it that's not sexual harassment at all and then\nWhen one Brett Kavanaugh was\nDrunken freshman in college he dropped just um and I ever recovered memory of a Thirty Years' later though one is is taking 'em no up golf at it for one thing that's nothing but recovered memory of cabin are dropping expanses of drunk I'll treasure ...\nThat's a rape that's right that's what usually there you know they're they're they're separating these things are at least a few years\nThe strange thing about affirmative action flash Pocahontas is\nSimultaneously these organizations like the New York times with Jason Blair um Harvard with Elizabeth Warren\nThey brag and bragging brag about affirmative action we have lots of affirmative action just apply and look at all the diversity and we're going to pick people on the basis of diversity will discriminate against white people don't worry [laughter] um and then when they won one when we find out that\nOne person in order to take advantage of affirmative action um for Native Americans what\nAre you talking about I mean it's it's one sentence to the next as opposed to two completely separate separate and innocence is here at Harvard bragged about Elizabeth Warren being a Native American diversity diversity\nAnd how much he says is ... this never helped me get a job however\nShe was crying shows an instructor\nAt the University of Texas law school which is about law school from what I understand but she was an instructor\nAt ... or University of Pennsylvania\nSo she suddenly decides in the mid eighties to list herself as a minority and appears in this these minority guide books which are basically used as hiring guides to while you know do away with your diversity problem if you're the dean of the law school\nAnd all of us right she's she's working at first at the University of Pennsylvania and then at the at Harvard University law school\nAnd she and she wants us to believe that it had\nAnd the ... because she's been cleared by the Boston Globe which right\nIt's just like Jason Blair they at times bragged and bragging brag about their affirmative action program to bring in black reporters and then it turns out Jason Blair is\nMaking everything up and what you're talking about well if they're not doing this and they're not doing affirmative action I don't think [laughter] they actually like they can give preference is on the basis of race and and no one else is allowed to notice that that's what they're doing their bragging about\nIt and then she's she's got different stories where she said I put down but I was a Native American because I Want it to get invited to the lunches of the nation from wrote that was the\nOne one thousand and twenty and one one thousand twenty fourth I'm\n... and then I got out that shows recipe and now she\nSays I'm ... I'm I applied because my my elderly matriarch some my family were dying so what does that ... so I decided to become an Indian I decided to become an F ...\nTraffic and weather station news radio nine twenty had ...\nWhen you're waiting for\nEye on radio station [noise]\nThe caravan of migrants moves closer to the U.S border I'm an Carrick Fox News Mexican agents blocking the Central American migrants briefly before allowing them in at the Guatemalan border Fox's William allows you and ask\nIn that area towards Democrats [noise] so what it looks like right now and again these things can change with large developments obviously you know something like a you know a war or to break out these were changed completely uh you know individual scandals can change these things as well but the Republicans look like as of this moment there in really good shape\nTo control the Senate and a really bad shape to continue their control of the house\nWas kind of mean I mean look at the ... dream policies that the left is looking to push in\nThrough the Democratic party free health care\nSingle payer sorry single payer health care free health care free college\nI'm a repeal the taxes they are looking for an even bigger\nA infrastructure package than what Donald Trump was even a asking for\nAnd you mentioned health care Medicare for all and twenty Thirteen Bernie Sanders proposed this and gotten zero cosponsors zero he was the only one who publicly supported now the you look at the top ten CNN has a list of the top ten or ... democratic candidates which by the way will not be enough to ... to cover the field there's gonna be a lot more than ten I think\nUh but I mean everybody with the exception of Joe Biden who I Will not be surprised at all if he comes out and\nIt does endorse Medicare for all\nThe all the big names are for it already there are many of them are co sponsors of the bill uh it seems to be this I mean the idea that we in two thousand ten and eleven were being called racist for suggesting what they wanted was single payer\nAnd now here they are\n... the entire field is endorsing single payer health care I think credible\nYeah we were scare mongers and racist for saying it yeah so I I just want to go through there's there's three stores will go through this tomorrow but it just flashed\nOn a ... um Cortez was out of this weekend we have to eliminate the electoral college\n... no that is a fundamental um a a a fundamental aspect of what brought the states together in the first place\nThe state said we don't want the big states telling us what we can do and if the big states can control everything well then ... ... what do we have\nIt can't be that way so we had the electoral college\nWe are one stayed away from losing the electoral college anyway you lose Texas and you have New York California and Texas the rest of the country doesn't matter\nIt will be those three states you lock those three states up and it doesn't matter anymore that pretty frightening pretty frightening\nSo now we're talking about taking apart the electoral college\nWould make all of the red states really pretty much in consequential\nYeah I mean it certainly would change the way the founders thought about the idea of people being elected right I mean we have to do is just just\nAppeal to the big cities and by the way this this uh this is an idea that I'm In it's not just democratic support for getting rid of the electoral college I Know Trump sports at for example thrown um I I you know I'm not a big fan of the national popular vote or certainly not what our founders had in mind but\nUh there is a there is some contingency on both sides of the aisle that actually believe this is the right way to go which I mean you that gets you just basically a country run by cities\nI mean as you know it'd be which it wants that like as a Republican I certainly don't understand why you'd want it but ... again like it shouldn't be that way\n... says you should run themselves in the city is going to run whatever they want and the rural or your skin do what they want\nWhy do we all have to live under somebody else's thumb I don't want to live under a farmer's thumb no farmers should make the although I'd feel better with this than the other way around no farmers should be telling what somebody in the city has to do and how to live\nThey don't understand it taking any of my farmer friends to Manhattan their heads would explode within twenty five minutes\nThey would not want to live there they wouldn't understand it so why should we have the people in farms and farmland trying to dictate rules that are good for them that also have to be applied to the city it's ridiculous\nRight and it's headed by the house and Senate both exist to give balance to that so that ... not not one side can tell the truth out right and it you know\nNo it's actually it's it's it's goes further than this if you would have if you could a race the mistake of the uh of the progressive under Wilson where they changed the meaning of the Senate they way they got elected yeah it used to be that the house was the place where the people could move and move quickly\nSo things can be passed because there was a disaster and things can be passed quickly\nThen the next ... the first check\nOn the balance of power the first check on that power was to go through another body that was a lot slower the Senate people are always like parents too slow it was designed to be that way so you go through another body that was much slower but it wasn't just that it was lower\nIt was also supposed to be men or women that were selected by their state legislature\nNow what would that do\nThat would make sure that those guys are beholden to their state not to the rest of the country not figures in national politics for Iraq I shouldn't care what uh what's his face in New York is says shouldn't care when Hillary Clinton was Senator Barack Obama was center I shouldn't care about\nThat because they would be focused on their state and they would be making sure that the federal government would not be eating into the power\nOf their state then it goes to the president and the president is only supposed to veto thing if he finds it unconstitutional now they'll say I think this is unconstitutional but I'll sign it was way no that's the opposite and it's the opposite way you're\nSupposed to veto it not if you don't like it if you find it unconstitutional it's unconstitutional then it would go to the Supreme Court\nWe've screwed up the balance of power so much and that's why you have this story today the United States Senate is a failed institution you also have this one from Fox the case for abolishing the Supreme Court\nAnd this story the constitution of the United states has failed\n[laughter] are you arguing for came right with these the several ... around with a ... give you the argument for it came\nRight I mean okay really they failed or have we not been using them properly you know it's it's like it's like going out into the woods with a a Swiss army knife\nAnd saying I've been trying to I've been trying to cut down trees and split lumber and this Swiss army knife has failed [laughter] or no you're not using it properly that's not what it was meant for\n... I Would also argue the failure part right and you're talking about ... what is basically the biggest success story in global history the United states of America and the fact that it has its problems is is well documented but the idea that you'd call it a failure is patently insane insane\nAbsolutely insane All right let's go through a couple of other things how about the Portland mayor\nWho the hell is Ted Wheeler and how did he ever become mayor of Portland or Portland but\nI I'm Sorry I'm Sorry I'm Sorry so you know the ...\nThe Portland mayor ah refused to let the tops intervene when ...
