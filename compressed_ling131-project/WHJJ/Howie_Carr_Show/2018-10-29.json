[noise]\nLove them Matthew brothers [noise]\nFor for five hundred forty to forty two that is the toll free number about how we car show up to like to join us here this afternoon every weekday afternoon as you know a a\nA bay grunt mob is winding its way through Mexico headed for the U.S border and the\nPresident Donald Trump has said he's going to stop them today he uh I guess I don't know if people said this in March before you on the plane to Houston\nOr a tweet ... ... he challenged the ah\nThe media to take the cameras inside the caravan and see if they can find some gang bangers some MS Thirteen members or some middle Easterners because again we know we know a lot of MS Thirteen gang bangers got in through the less the surge of unaccompanied children the Texas a public safety department has a\nHas documented and we know that a lot of um mid eastern for potential terrorists have been arrested recently in Guatemala was in the major newspaper down there the president of the country announced it\nSo joining us now on the line there's a Jessica Vaughan from the center for Immigration Studies a and we just wanted to ask her\nJessica what the what should the president do next how can how can we stop this a mob but this this mob particularly before the midterms and all these future mobs from a breaking into the country and invading ... trying to fundamentally transform it is a block Obama cheered them on\nWhat you do\nWell there are a number of things he could do he been leaning on these other government trying to force their own immigration lot that should help but yeah we can't wait for other countries to on you know save us from caravan so we have to take steps in cases like this one of the options he has to simply\nClose the border it's an extreme\nOption diet you know if I Am a mob of four thousand people is hell bent on\nTesting our sovereignty that's what we're gonna have to do and it can be done and then you know short hurts business for some people but it hurts our communities and the rest of the country where these people are struggling not to stop them so that's one option the other thing is is it in and started that would be simply\nTelling these people know you don't get to apply for asylum here because you come right through ... thousand per thousand miles throughout the country that has offered you asylum so you have no basis for making that claim here\nOn the other thing is that we simply couldn't I just put a really a house hold the line with the help of military an additional border patrol agents her mother\nHow 'bout how 'bout uh been suggested this all day I read of a power line blog dot com\nWhy don't the under the U.S constitution the president has the power in the case of a rebellion or an invasion to was suspend habeas corpus I due process I mean the ... and just declare basically a state of national emergency because of an invasion I mean this is an invasion is it not\nWell it it sure feels like wind when you have people waving the ... orange flag and trampling the barricade I you know between Guatemala and Mexico\nAnd looting ... looting grocery stores on their way north I mean these are not people who were planning to contribute anything to the U.S economy obviously they're criminals\nI well many of them are and certainly entering illegally would be a crime and the president does have the authority under the constitution player that any aliens that he feels a would be a threat to the United states\nFrom anywhere can be barred entry just like with the travel ban at the same um statutory basis as the travel ban which of course has now been held out\nIn court approved by the Supreme Court\nThat was that's a and authority he has and that would be the basis for simply shutting down the places\nWhere these people will try to ensure a and the president also has the authority in crisis to get your tri state and local law enforcement agencies and I have a feeling that ... it would be quite happy to help with its resources because they've been doing it for years now already at their own expense\nI Know I think Texas will be hard I think Texas has been moving the national guard that I heard the lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick on another show earlier today saying that they were moving troops into position but I I mean I don't think that they have the same powers that are that are the regular army or the border patrol what have you know\nThat's right only the border patrol can make immigration arrests but we don't actually want to make him here where\nDo we want to keep them out and sort of country we don't we don't want them to that's the thing about suspending habeas corpus I mean that way you can keep the these these gang of eight immigration advocates lawyers\nYou know from a ... you know ... you're the one to adjust to go out with says the or the process isn't all the appeals process isn't over until the alien wins and it's so true I mean we got to keep them on the other side we gotta keep 'em on the other side of the border\nYou know to prevent them from getting inside 'cause once they're inside I mean they're going to be our responsibility for the next I God only knows how many generations will be paying for everything\nAnd the rest of their lives in our no question about it why why people ... and it came over I'm just and the problem is it's it's just what happened with the caravan in the spring is that most of them got in\nUh the Roma coming from Romania they don't you know there's Asia from Romania to travel to Canada so the ah groups of Roma are coming to Canada and crossing illegally enter the United states and asking for asylum and we're treating them exactly the same way\n... you know usually more than the\nMS Thirteen from the south and and also within and apparently there are middle Easterners that are trying to sneak it on the southern border I mentioned the early oh your ...\nA newspaper or the president of Guatemala so they just a rounded up a hundred Syrians but we're a purely trying to you or you know they use a Guatemala's a staging area to seek a sneak into the United states\nSo we could not only be wedding in uh MS Thirteen people just want to sell us heroin or chopper hands off with machetes we can also be letting him a ISIS terrorists in this a caravan\nThey're absolutely because the border agencies are overwhelmed they cannot read every one and it's a matter of fact they don't have a routine\nScreening process for people you know even from um terror prone countries necessarily mean that is a weak area\nUh in our controls right now we've known you know there are certain smugglers who specialize in what are called special interests alien in other words people from certain countries in the middle east like Syria Lebanon wherever and in some of the prosecution is one of my colleague\nHas analyzed all the documents and found that sometimes the smugglers knows that the person they're bringing in is um with Hamas or Hezbollah al Shabaab or whatever they can bring in terrorists they don't care they bring in whoever pays\nWell they're not going to be they're not going to be in the mall but gets blown up or the skyscraper the airline that gets hijack that ... one of the year you know there are downsides of the border down ... he co way you know Jessica ... a Center for Immigration Studies where can people going to learn more about your organization\nEverything we do is at the I. S. dot org\nC I F spot or thank you Jessica thanks for being with us it's always great to hear how I thank you Jessica Vaughan from the center for Immigration Studies CIS dot org I'm highway car\n\nThrough his parents were becoming hard of hearing and saying what did you say go to hearing how\nCommon you promote home where you get to be a registered hearing aids\nBe dollars a month ago to hearing how\nUse radio nine twenty and one oh four seven of him\nHi this is Cindy from Boston, Massachusetts blood well Amy and Lindsey falls Maine and this is how we know [noise]\n... for five hundred\nThese two forty two we don't have much time left here but I Do want to mention one thing the Harvard or\nRacist admissions policy continues to be under the spotlight in us district court here in Boston\nI I happen to be reading oddly enough New York times on Saturday I found myself is reasons I to two weeks the to go into but I was ... I decided to rebuilding the story about the uh\nThe Harvard admissions controversy Harvard's admission process once secret is unveiled and affirmative action trout they're introducing one the\nOne guy named saying cute yeah he's a senior in the eye and they say we don't discriminate against all Asian seems to be the case right he has only meddling test scores but was admitted to the college by showing a strong work ethic and infectious Lee happy personality\nI could've sworn I had a an infectious happy personality and to have a strong work ethic very fake\nSo\nMr Fitz ... she's the uh he's the Seventy years Seventy something admissions director uh he\nQuoted in admissions interviewer saying what was most striking about Mr de up was his fund casual nature fun casual nature oh\nThese dog whistles fund casual it's almost like us it sounds like a a you know Chili's restaurant doesn't the chilies is a fun casual restaurant and the thing the way up as a fund casual guy but an impressive understated maturity so I kept reading this fascinated as I said there's something I'm missing here why why if they let\nThings deep the up and you know when he has lousy ... the mediocre scores in you know he's getting into had all these agents that are getting perfect scores and everything else\nIn summing up Mr ... personal essay one reviewer highlighted his immigrant Vietnamese identity and said that Mr de up was here it comes grappling with sexual\nI Know they bang bang bang bang so I saw this is why I say why didn't I think of that in Nineteen sixty eight when I was applying the Harvard University that I was grappling with my sexual identity not that I was rapidly whether you understand why didn't I just think of something like that\nSo but here is infectious Lee happy personality are they saying that he has a a gay personality he's funding casual so fun cases fund casual nature of these are old dog whistles\nYeah this is just this is just such B. S. I mean I again there's there's so many\nStories but need to have be getting more attention than they are getting and this and this is one of a bright here you know that they all these scams but I'm putting this out for for all of all of my fellow\nWhite people and all of my fellow Asians cause I consider myself an honorary Asian if you want to get into Harvard just write the just mentioned in your essay that you are grappling with your sexual identity so there when they see you tried to pick up babes\nYou know when you're in the yard and you know once uh once orientation is out of the way they just say well I ... I was grappling with it but\nI have grappled with it long enough to know I'm a heterosexual after all\nJust get once you get inside once you get into Harvard it doesn't really matter you know 'cause they got no one wants out a harbor I've never run it that some people drop out like soccer burger Bill Gates but nobody ever forks out of Harvard I and I use it to tell me if I'm wrong I don't I've never known anyone who walked out of Harvard\nFor worst case scenario they put you on the six or seven year plan\nRight right or they yeah they tell you to come back of the year ... year off and since everybody at Harvard is rich you know it doesn't matter you know just go and uh you know\nDo something to do something fun goes tend bar ... [noise] so remember this rumor these words if you want to get into Harvard you happen to be white or Asian rapidly\nWith sexual identity those are the\nTraffic and weather station news radio nine twenty had ...\nEye on radio station [noise]\nRemembering those killed in Pittsburgh I'm an Carrick Fox News and the squirrel hill neighborhood vigils and ceremony in remembrance of the eleven victims killed during the shooting at the tree of life synagogue this man lost a friend and the tragedy just sad I was\nA percentage of people who are really interesting election only forty nine percent of Democrats Democrats got smoked\nUm it's the same thing two thousand fourteen remember Democrats got smoked again they're Republicans fifty nine percent or said they were really interested only forty eight percent of Democrats said that um and what's interesting is leading up to I Would say Brett Kavanaugh\nYou had the same type of thing playing out again in this time in favor of the Democrats started to look a lot like two thousand six so up until ... you had sixty three percent of Democrats highest levels of interest in the election\nWas only fifty three percent so that is a you know a big it's a type of gap that leads you to lose the ... and lose the house or at least it makes it possible since Kavanaugh that has changed\nDemocrats have gone up from sixty three to Seventy two percent holy cow Seventy two is the highest number for any party and all of these elections\nHowever Republicans have jumped a higher percentage point basis from fifty three to sixty eight\nSo now we have a basically a balance a very close within the margin of error separation and both of those numbers sixty eight\nWould be the second highest level of interest of all of these elections so the Democrats are Seventy two Republicans are sixty eight both of those numbers are the highest of any of these elections going back to two thousand six ... two dozen six midterms\nUm and I mean which is which is crazy it is a a a ... there's a level here that we don't know what's gonna happen is we this is like you know this is territory that has not been seen before\nAnd ... you know while you can look at the polls and you can see the polls as we've talked about over the past couple of weeks relatively\nAre relatively pointing towards a Republican or a ... victory in the Senate where they maybe pick up a couple of seats and Republican loss in the house where they would lose a couple of states um there is a you know if you wanna look it's going to be optimistic way of looking at the house right now\nTo show you how close is if Republicans were just sweep the races they are favored in okay that's not it's not going to happen it never happens but just kind of generally for understanding if they were able to sweep all of the races their favorite and\nUh and they revealed a when all of the races that they trailed by one point so all of these races are either victories are toss ups right I mean they could go either way but if they were to sweep all of those Republicans still hold the house at two twenty two Fifteen now the problem is\nThe idea that they're going to sweep all those races is\nWe know that's not going to happen it never happens the other thing is they will win some races where they're underdogs by more than one point they will win some place where there was a down by five in the polls they'll want him winning some of those races so the split is going to be important here but\nJust that gets them only to two twenty two Fifteen which is a I think they lose that's been losing tens seats from where they are now um but also a very narrow majority to the point where some conservative things could be derailed by just you know\nThe generic moderate house member that you've never heard their name before um when they decide they're going to vote against the president so it's an interesting a way of looking at it\nAnd it shows that this really could go either way I mean when they say that there's about a twenty percent chance the Republicans lose the Senate and about a twenty percent chance that the Republicans when the house\nThat's the way that these models are all kind of looking at it twenty percent is one in five right um so it is very possible that one of these things could happen\nBut right now it looks like those are gonna wind up getting split and then of course still has ... even though you're not gonna be able to pass the Democratic bills because they would either be told her own the house you're still going to have investigative power could have subpoena power are going to have imposed\nA nightmare it's a nightmare and if if they get the house it's a nightmare okay so here's here's what I found interesting in um in watching the news and watching just the flow of it\nHave you noticed that you know places like the Atlantic and the times and the post are now starting to publish stories about\nYou know it's an uphill battle to win some of these races in the house it's an uphill battle they have changed their tone from um you know an absolute positive well we're on a blue wave\nTo now almost laying the foundation of yeah we we lost but it was you know it was really kind of a long shot anyway\nYeah I mean I that's how badly I think the Kavanaugh saying ah has backfired on them\nI mean it's made the Senate basically I mean again it's just that it's one of the five chance but I mean they had they had a better chance that this up two months ago I mean they had a legitimate path to victory when Cruz was only up by three points all of these races that look like leaning Republican we're all toss up are and some of them looked like they might be leaning Democrats\nThey had a chance to win the Senate before the cabin I'll thing now I mean I think it's a real ... going to come to the independent power the independence feeling\n... they're in an interesting group because they're not as passionate as you would expect in this environment so independence in two thousand six and two thousand ten where at fifty percent\nIndependents are almost always going to be lower in a high interest in part a sense because partisans engage more like generally um the ... of course the blanket role but it's typical um and she doesn't fourteen it was down to forty percent and she doesn't eat uh Eighteen up until Kevin I was forty two percent\nAnd then uh the jump now to forty six percent so still that's not as high as some of the earlier elections among independents and that may just be because they're overwhelmed with it and they don't they don't like either side and they just want it makes them want to withdraw from Palo yeah but I Wonder\nBecause I Would consider myself an independent yeah and there's no way you're going to keep me away from the polls\nAnd so I'm Wondering you know with that four percent jump was it a four percent effort to preserve four percent jump I'm I Wonder how much of that or people like me who are going to vote for the Republican\nJust because the left has gone in pain\nRight and there's a lot of independents that I ... I mean I certainly would fall into this category as well right I Am not registered member of any party nor will I ever be in her life like was that being said uh you know I vote Republican\nI mean I you know don't vote for Democrats [laughter] so I Will for Republicans independents and libertarians libertarians they don't vote for Democrats like yeah I mean so that's never going to happen so the fact that I'm an independent you can't look at that line as\nThese are people who could go either way at any time between these two parties that's not what that is right people who identify that way it's a group that's ... that's growing and has been growing for quite some time yes people are bailing out of the parties um but the parties themselves are becoming a more rigid in Anbar\nProvince one could come down to the independence mhm this one could come down to because the you can understand the Republicans going up you can understand if you're on the Democratic side Kavanaugh driving all those people but what's driving the independent Mm\nYeah I mean\nI Would think they are disgusted with what's going on right [laughter] if anything they don't like the overall system there's one other interesting this data here Glenn if we could yeah I'm as we're talking about the caravan of of uh immigrants coming migrants whatever\n... which will will be illegal immigrants if they if they get it all the way up by the way who who said that was coming uh\nOh yeah this this burger yeah definitely we talked a lot about a lot about this Huh Interesting to see the numbers among Latino voters so uh in two thousand six were coming off of the attempt at comprehensive immigration reform that fails ... come Republicans very upset about that Democrats win that election relatively easily um\nA Latino at sixty two percent high interest in the election\nThat number in mid term elections has been dismal since ... in two thousand ten was only forty eight percent two dozen fourteen it was forty one percent very low\nA in two thousand uh Eighteen up until very recently or was it was at forty seven percent that number has now jumped\nIn October of two dozen Eighteen Seventy one percent from forty seven to Seventy one\nThis year so this is a whatever the reason while one artist higher than two thousand six for Latino voters oh wow and again that was a wave election for Democrats\n... I mean the one thing I can think of is the Guatemalan\nRefugees what else does happen I mean you did have also a fairly recently the uh uh\nUnaccompanied minors situation where they were being quote unquote held in cages in July or August yeah but still ... relatively recently a I'm a you know the the two thousand each in polls were taken January to September\nSo some of those polls are for that some after okay hum all the October ones obviously after ... men include the migrants caravans situation and that might explain the jump but it's it's high everywhere I mean it would be the only place it's low\nUm and it's not low relative to normal which is our younger voters each other before they're at fifty one percent which is the lowest number on most of these democratic ... demographic groups that you can find however it's also a lot higher than any other time and all of these elections the highest they had been before that was thirty nine for going into consecutive\nSays no ... is
