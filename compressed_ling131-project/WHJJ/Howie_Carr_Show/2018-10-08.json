somebody said\nDemocrats we talk a lot about the Democrats were always getting a arrest a they're charged with domestic abuse\nIt and there's proof of the Democrats usually when they are when they're arrested ... there's this one from New York state Senate candidate courage gas there she's running against the Republican incumbent in around the the ... area accused of domestic violence she was

to leave so she threatened to kill my dog said she was going to burn the house down with all the animals in it at the time she owns five cats and three dogs she probably wouldn't have done anything but I didn't trust her as far as like a\nThrow her this is the Democratic candidate for the state Senate them or how about the Democratic candidates for the state set it up in the north country of New Hampshire jak Woodward\nThey uh they released the apathy released the court documents against him he's accused of domestic abuse with his girlfriend\nAt a a at a Christmas Eve party last year an argument ensued with his girlfriend who's the chairman of the county Democratic Party and what senator would burn ... but the chairman of the party a female in the left hand and risk\nOn June ninth after party is the two were driving home when the woman Jacobs announce a wedge is that what senator would burn her right arm as she struggled to maintain control of the car or while driving she provided investigators with photos of the bruises you know I have a I have a policy\nIf I'm going to bite somebody in the car I never do it while the cars in motion and ... and under no circumstances do I ever bite the driver of the car no matter how angry I I'm with them but\nSenator ... what Britain did\nApparently the affidavit also quotes from a diary what Britain kept these white field by the way in the diary Woodward\nIs quoted as saying mind is sad and focus on my failure to control my anger is so embarrassing upsetting it just keeps with\nThe woman wrote in an affidavit that she and Alison had been in a romantic relationship that she had pushed shoved he had Bush shoved and verbally abused her and had a lawyer intimidate and threaten her\nThis particular woman in Minnesota the ex girlfriend from twenty sixteen\nDid go to a doctor\nThe ... at the time the doctor has released the notes\n\nAll of these uh uh all of these claims are consistent with what she told the doctor at the time the doctor was treating her for abuse\n\nFive percent of democratic women believe this\nSo please Democrats do not start with me\nBelieve the woman believe the victim because you don't you don't you believe the person that will further your political agenda it is just that simple now I Am not saying that the right doesn't do that as well\nI'm just saying as someone who is standing here watching the world go insane I'm not going to play either side I'm not gonna I'm not going to jump in or off this cliff with the rest of humanity\nI Do not believe the victim\nI Will take seriously the account of the accuser then I Will look at the facts if there is a preponderance of evidence then I Will presume that person either innocent or guilty\nBut after I've seen facts\nIs this kind of stuff was going on this should all be in the court of law\nIf you are a victim\nSociety will do nothing for you because we cannot do anything for you if you haven't gone to the police and reported it\nIf you believe that we live in a rape culture then you have a responsibility to go to the police and document everything that has been done\nThen we as a society need to do everything we can to make sure that justice is served\nNot on a collective basis but judging it by the individual case\nThat is a just society that is America [noise]\n\nAirline inning and going back program one of my favorite guys or because he is he does his own homework he rolls up his sleeves he looks any tells the truth as he finds that Peter ... is a here he's the president of government accountability Institute and a producer of a new documentary that's out called the creepy line\nAnd that is exactly the right\nName for it [laughter] it is that actually the creepy line comes from a speech that Eric Schmidt Schmidt the CEO of Google gay but it was an interview in fact\nWhere he was asked how do you make these ethical judgments about how far you're going to go and then the interviewer actually asked Schmidt are you going to win plant things in our brain and Eric Schmidt's response was well we like to go right up to the creepy line but not cross it\nHe said we're not going to implant anything in your brain at least not yet those are actually erupt Schmitz word and\nHe and his he's up to I find him incredibly Frank yes sheets he just he says it like it is yeah it's I I've interviewed him a couple of times and it is fascinating yes because he's just telling you he\nHe doesn't sugarcoat it and ah and I think it's his background as an engineer or ... or and and he's sort of very direct I mean one of the other things we caught him when the film was saying is that Google a house and takes very seriously its responsibility to change the values\nOf American people uh you know Google's Monterey has always been there are more than just a company making money or they have a certain the east coast in the world view and part of the reason that they structure of the company the way they did\nIn which the founders always have controlling shares is that that sense of social mission is part of it and Schmidt has been always very direct about saying yes part of our mission\nAs a company has been to try to shape and changed the values\nOf the United states and that sort of one of the premise of this film that it's not just about privacy it's not that they're taking all this information\nGland or using that information against us to try to nudge us or to move us in directions there that we wouldn't ordinarily want to go\nOkay so um so let's can can can you tie this all to Kavanaugh and what we've seen with the Kavanaugh case and how for instance\nYou know there's there's um a\n... there is this overwhelming uh understanding from half the country that he is absolutely guilty and she is a victim right and there's a lot of information on the other side in fact more information on the other side but you're not really seen that right\nYeah it's it's very hard because this is happening in real time right now to sort of monitor what's a Google doing but we can look at the past uh in fact one of the things we feature in the film is a study done by a Robert ... a ... a very interesting guy he's a Harvard PHD in psychology studied under BF Skinner\nOr was the former editor in chief of Psychology Today magazine and by the way and this is very relevant was a Hillary Clinton supporter and twenty sixteen\n... one of the things he did and the twenty sixteen election was he had two thousand people around the country doing Google searches are and they monitored the results of the people were getting this is a very ah you know a clear academic study and and at this research was peer reviewed as his other work was\nAnd what came back was that Google was systematically queuing search results in favor of Hillary Clinton they were in other words they were us suppressing negative stories about Hillary in the algorithm and they were pushing them in favor of Donald Trump\nAnd ... point was I actually supported Hillary Clinton thought she was more qualified but the bottom line is a company should not be doing this and it secret you don't know that it's going on nobody is monitoring the results are getting their assuming the results in the list that they are getting is representative of some objective standard\n... is a Google is a verb now I'm not a noun verb auto Google it yeah well if you Google it and the end the algorithm is giving you the answer that is skewed right that's like going to a dictionary\nThat will always changed the definitions of things but as it applies to whatever's happening in the world yeah that's real problem\nNo you're you're exactly right and so in the in the context of cabin on me and I don't know exactly what because it's a correct right real time but the bottom line is there is a history here of Google doing this it was it was a week to um uh a couple of weeks ago Tucker Carlson talked about a ...\nAbout these internal emails where you actually had Google engineer's saying hey you know what we don't light you know Trump's policy on immigration so we want to sort of us the press certain stories\nUm this is the thing and Google does it end and here's the the the the point that we try to make Glenn in this film and in general\nThe whole conversation that Google wants to have its about fake news and this debate about fake news here's here's the bottom line fake news is competitive\nIf you and I are having a disagreement about something I put my fake news story and you say oh yeah I'm going to put my fake news story but pointed it out in the open you have combat and by the way the news doesn't really convince anybody you know if you like Hillary Clinton that fake news to add that the Russians ran of Jesus and\nAnd and Hillary arm wrestling probably not going to convince you voted different wet I wasn't that that wasn't a real arm wrestling [laughter]\nBut you know the point is is that that's not going to convince anybody because the confirmation bias you know people tend to look for information they want what Google is doing is different because we don't know what we don't know\nTo the point is when Google says you can trust the algorithm you can trust us they've lied before and they're lying now and I think the only question that remains really is how are we going to deal with is um you know there's old story that Henry Kissinger said when he was on the national Security Council\nHe gave a president three choices do nothing\nTake my solution or thermonuclear war those are your three choices are in this case it's kind of like that we can do nothing\nWe can try to deal with some sort of the regulatory issues related with Google or we can break up these companies those are the three options that we have it I think we're really at the point of point number three\nBecause this is not a monopoly like standard oil standard oil that's going to dominate the only market this is controlling the news flow in the United states\nIs in the end this is in the end Peter ... controlling everything yeah Google is ... the most likely company in the America in the American world or to come up with a guy yes who ever\nWho ever gets to a I first controls everything there is no way to beat it once you have a guy yes this company is the most likely in the free world to come up with it\nIf we don't have them\nEat contained in some way or another when they get to a I work toast yes\nYes that's exactly right and here's the thing it's not just\nGoogle the company a lot of people don't realize this I didn't realize this if you use safari on your apple product you're actually using the Google algorithm and that is Google information um if you're using if you are using um Yahoo\nYou're using Google the point being Firefox is Google the all these entities are using the Google algorithm so even if you stay I Am not going to use Google dot com you're using unless you are making very specific choices for other options if you using any of those others\nGoogle is the one that's dominated by the way Google pays apple nine billion dollars a year Google actually pays apple\nTo be the algorithm of choice for safari that's how much they value this information and want to dominate the space\nSo I Want to talk to 'em a little bit about um what can be done um with the algorithm or I'm\nConcerned about some things that I think are really dangerous and gee platform ing and be racing voices right because Google thinks\nThat is you know that's that's not right that's age speech we'll get to that when we come back [noise]\nNews radio nine twenty and one of ...\nFox News I'm Carmen Roberts two key undecided senators said they'll

dot com um the creepy line and it comes from a a quote from the guy who's running the Google\nThat you know we were not going to implant things into your head but we're going to come right up to that creepy line that's terrifying beer from somebody who's in charge of Google\nPeter uh I I wanted I Want to talk to you about the platform ing\nI Am currently saying to anyone who has a conservative voice\nLet's all get on a single server let's get on to our own platform together we don't have to join business or any but we have to have a protected platform because I Believe these companies\nAre are going to de platform us one by one\nIs this what you've been doing going here yeah I I think you're very smart to do that I think you're very smart to do that because let's step back in first consider the power of Google and a lot of people don't realize this but it was widely reported in the guardian elsewhere in two thousand nine Google actually shut down the entire Internet for two hours on a Saturday morning\nThey blacklisted the entire Internet that shows you the the scope and the size of Google ... wait a minute if if the ... bay blacklisted the entire Internet if you go to the guardian\nWWW yes they shut down the entire Internet a couple of years later they shut down half of Japan's Internet\nOr they said it was sort of an area that they but but the point being the size and the scope of this company is enormous and a lot of people don't realize even if they're not using it Google products somebody will say why don't use Gmail I'm not worried about Gmail that's fine but here's your company ... you know it may be John Smith acme incorporated ...\nHum but his acne incorporated email server actually a Google product because if it is golf Google is monitoring and watching what you're doing\nAnd it's part of the data collection they're doing on you a lot of news organizations in the United states use Google we we we highlight in the film for example Robert apps sign this caller who's been critical of Google\nA link to support a Clinton supporter a Harvard PHD in psychology um Iran or did some studies and the Washington Post ran a piece about could Google swing an election this is back in twenty twelve yeah the next day\nRobert ... was shot out of Google he could not get on Firefox he could not get any on on any of the uh the Google products they had shut 'em out the same thing happened to Jordan Peterson a University of Toronto professor\nWho were taken a position about forced speech chip on general a gender pronouns the next morning when that went public he was locked out of his Gmail account\nAnd Google would not let him back into his Gmail account all of his emails his calendars and everything he was blocked from\nThe point being that have a lot of power and you cannot assume that Google is not going to take these actions people will say a lotta times whether a company they want to make their customers happy they are more than a traditional company they say so themselves\nThey view themselves as a company with a mission\nSo here's what people say when when you know what I use ... well you know Google is monitoring your mail they're not reading my mail actually you are both right and wrong they are not reading your mail however\nThey are analyzing your mail because what they're doing is collecting the information on how people relate to one another how people talk to one another all for their a I research so Google isn't free right for no reason that's\nExactly right you you are the product we say what is Google's product you are the product because they are selling information on Glenn Beck or on Peter Schweitzer or on whoever\nAnd more importantly I think they are analyzing all of a look there's\n... this is just at the beginning let me tell ya ... story [laughter] you go to Beijing there are three concentric circles of security in Beijing okay the center is the main city of Beijing many people it used to look it up for me what are you still how many millions of people are living in Beijing\nIn the city proper that is the inner circle there is so much monitoring going on they just did a test they release the guy they they uh took a guy [laughter] pick somebody said go into the center of the city just go hide okay [laughter]", "show_name": "Howie Carr Show", "year": "2018", "city":
