I actually\nHave a whole don't buy the communist regime into so it you mean by only ... guy heading in that direction I think one other thing that that\nIt they have a book can name as I uh we we I don't know what I'm saying why why he had a jinx Judy raised by the Chinese authorities without any advance notice he he had sculptures and there he or\nShe went on to you know the the the I was talking earlier about the great leap forward I mean the Tiananmen Square was terrible I was in the late Nineteen eighties but I mean this was back in the sixties with a mousy pong and uh in in the great leap forward when they tried to collect devise pretty much\nOf rural China they there were there were I mean their various estimates nobody knows exactly but they're you know fifty sixty Seventy eighty eighty million people killed\nAnd you know you want to talk about a terrible uh another terrible policy the Chinese Communist government or how about the one child policy for all for all those years they were trying to get a a a a a handle on the population increases so they they said you could only have one child\nSo you could you could imagine what that led to in terms of abortions and a female children being killed because of families want it to have a male offspring to continue the lie just they they I mean there's just there's so many\nHorrible things have happened under communism and now you and now you see these millennials a you know a huge percentage is like a third of the millennial age group\nThinks socialism is okay but it's it's the way to go it's it's not it's not I mean it's you know even if it's even if it's just some kind of a European socialist admitted it always leads to what economic malaise a loss of individual freedoms and\nA Maggie Thatcher the former rough prime minister of Great Britain I mean ... a lot of people will know exactly the quote I'm about to say which is the problem here quote the problem was socialism is eventually you run out of other people's money\nAnd that's exactly right and you know Bernie Sanders doesn't even understand that his his state Vermont tried to Institute a single payer health care they couldn't do it\nBecause\nThere were they'd already even before it started that run out of other people's money same with California and other left wing state they couldn't they couldn't put a single payer healthcare plan but you know hey he wants to think big he wants to think creatively thanks for the call Mrs X or Pete your next with highway cargo had paid\nYeah hey you know you're talking about taxes for trucks ought to get back on that for a second you know they say Trump lost a billion dollars in revenue since in President but you know and that's it closely they gain Seventy million this big difference in how people approached the government and what they think like or you know\nWe're only member when a Rachel Maddow supposedly got his tax returns and he took a billion dollar tax write off and then it turned out he had mentioned the fact that he that he lost a billion ... billion dollars it was in the intro to one of his books from the Nineteen nineties there was no secret\nThere yet he's not sure you know the thing is rhymes yeah go ahead\nAnd fresh right now you know they got his rise Scottish people losing like fifty a hundred dollars and I get my paycheck but they just took in a million refugees from a you know Syria that don't want to work to y ... worked at all I was ... and it's just like what lucky that we got you know it's from Central America does wash\nWork than our people are just they don't do nothing [laughter] I I Know I I Know\nKind of went in a different direction but I did it fits right in to what we had been talking about today I had a caller uh about an hour and a half ago who said that you know when is it time that we're going to fight back\nAnd we should fight back we should fight back in the polls we should stand the true and steady we have to speak truth\nDo not forget the things that we were all taught and we all know are true\nTo be civil and kind to one another but\nWe were not at a place where I think you grab a gun\nI won't\nChristians in the age of outrage how to bring our best when the world is at its worst ads that are just wrote that book welcome to the program ed how are you\nThank you thanks for having me and I think we both wrote books on outrage sort of a nice time you could talk about outright\nAnd we did and you have you found the ad that it's not necessarily an understood topic or a popular topic right now to try to diffuse it or explain what it does to us\nYou know it's interesting I see the word used more than I've ever seen that before in my lifetime rage and outrageous in headlines of articles all the time but it's when you go a little deeper and in your case talking about his relationship to addiction or in my case talking about how Christians might engage the age of outrage when I I don't think I think there's a lot of references to it\nBut not a lot of okay what do we do interact I think\nYou know damn from Georgia who who are fascinating fascinating call and as you've got to walk through that with him he's clearly outraged\nHis response would be very different than yours and I appreciate your responded\nA and mine and I think ultimately part of the challenges is Dan's response is I mean that just said I'll just say it I'll just say it you know dance response or the way a lot of people feel right I Know you are there's a lot of built up outrage\nThat is and it's it's you know you both on the conservative and liberal side and it's in many ways tearing our country apart from my concern as a Christian leader you know I'm here at the Billy Graham center a well my concern is is as Christians how are we going to engage in a world filled with outrage\nOr and when sometimes where the where the cause of it sometimes where the targets of it it's it's a mix and I love your comments about religious liberty to I mean I I'm I'm deeply concerned about\nReligious liberty or around the world thankful for you bringing that up bring in that case up even today but but but again I I see Christians who are outraged about Starbucks cups rather than about persecution around the world and I think so we got our own issues to deal with but also it's the culture the whole\nSo tell me because [laughter] and I don't know if you heard last hour when I was talking about bond offer\nAnd that we have this closing window bond Hoffert did not succeed in what he tried to do he'll though he was in the end victorious [noise]\nUm but he didn't he didn't change the people because the people had already abandon their Judeo Christian values they were angry they were outraged and they were\nThey wanted political solutions not a spiritual solution uh and uh they they just went for it we have this this window or on our Judeo Christian culture\nAnd our and our underpinnings\nThey're being lost and if we don't get through that window and keep people's hearts opened\nWe're going to go really a wry rarely ...\nAnd I think ultimately this is our moment for them you know not everybody we don't get to pick the moment we're born or that where you live in two in every generation has faced their challenges but this is our moment in in in the book I sort of go through I have a chart in some stats up some new statistics in each chapter\nAnd I talk about how in many ways a that Judeo Christian ... a consensus has been lost and now\nThe views of uh you know Christians different groups maybe a better more on the conservative side are now outside in many ways of the mainstream of society where once they were the mainstream and that's kind of lead to an accelerated\nA outrage cycle it's led to everyone's turning up the volume two eleven\nAnd ultimately I don't think that's the path but I appreciate what you just said earlier when you're talking to talking to Dan is we've got to um we've got to choose a different way now one of the key things as Christians are consistently choosing a different way and you know we don't need to be disabled by our cable news network or we don't need to be\nA shape spiritually by her social media feed\nI think ultimately we need to be shaped as Christians by who Christ\nIt is and be Jesus was afraid to stand up I mean he was in the temple and he turned over tables but he also showed this remarkable ability that we can model to to build bridges with people with whom he shouldn't even be around to the American woman at the well and I think ultimately we need a better path to the answer is not to\nGet like the world the answer for Christians in this age of outrage is to really follow the way of Jesus in to the world and I'm not some you know what don't stand up for things don't I mean when you said your fight but you fight or a you know for example uh you can't war at a people\nAnd reach people at the same time and so it's a question of how you approach that and we're just we're to use your title were addicted to outrage right now and I'm and I'm trying to say there's a better way for Christians to to to to do belt we even when they are the targets of the outrage and certainly\nTo not participate in creating photo and false crises and outrage well\nHere's what's interesting to me and I pointed it out last hour if you talk politically were winning I mean look at the Supreme Court ... Brett Kavanaugh I don't know of any president would have set up for that look what happened with Israel in many ways\nBut you know we're winning it's not they're not swarming mobs and going out and and you know trying to get into people's face and getting them to react out in anger\nBecause they're winning they're doing that because it they're desperate we're actually making progress and somehow or another\nWe're just being swept up in their drama\nWell I think people are ... it's kind of weird that appeals to us there's a part of the bus I think that's why\nA you know we'll find you know some some some crisis on social media\nThat Christians will be very attracted to and then we find out later that wasn't true and it kind of spread around and and you know and and and and I think that's part of the concern what is it in the U.S that draws us to outrage\nRather than to engage and I think there's a there's a difference between the two and you know I'm some for example I'm someone who is deeply pro life\nYou know I spoke at the march for life here in Chicago not that long ago\nAnd you know you have kind of you know they're the girl does of us in the march for life speaking up and standing for life and then you had some protest or on the side just calling us terrible people but then you had some some self identified Christians yelling horrible things at them and here's what I don't want to be I Want to be in the group that saying I'm going to stand for life\nNot yelling horrible things at one another and thinking even the counter protesters who were\nKind of part of the march for life but left and started yelling that's the problem we look\nToo much like them and I don't think that that's our goal if our goal and we talk about this a lot in Christians in the age of outrageous is to just to hold a biblical worldview but then to engage the world with a wins some\nApproach and an income for what's worth I mean I I've been fascinating to watch you sort of walk through that journey as well and I think it really challenged a lot of people in the way that they would think so so so kudos to you for even writing on this subject matters\nUm I'd like to talk to you about your solutions are so let me take a quick break the name of the book is Christians in the age of outrage I think it is\nReally important we cannot become that which we despise we cannot play the same game first of all just strategically you lose but also we lose who we are when Judeo Christian values are under attack and our art type has always been Moses and Jesus ...\nAnd in the process we're able to come to maybe a better understanding of what examples for example is a\nIs the president by oil university which is a Christian university in California uh met with the kind of the leader of the uh the party and state legislature there in California that was trying to change the laws that would make it illegal for ... to live their Christian beliefs about marriage sexuality and more well he ended up getting to understand each other better\nThe will of the bill was ultimately not moved forward was dropped and and and now we're at a very different place now I'm not saying you can always do that but I Am saying that Christians need to try to do that\nAnd I do think that in doing so well act a lot more like Jesus or even this how about a lot more like Christians historically because of the moment we're in is not time for us to join in ratcheting up the outrage and and as you said earlier to your caller I'm calling people to arms\nYet that's not I mean Glenn that's not an uncommon of you know some of the some of the worst things I see on social media I I click on a link and I find go to the bio and it's the first thing to listen thing is Christian and I'm like that's not what it's supposed to look like and I think that's what we need is a change in a lot of hearts\nI Will tell you this the ones who can teach us this right now or the the victims of ISIS and the ones who were were literally chained as slaves or you know story after story after story of these Christians\nWho I I mean I Know one family that actually wrote to ISIS after they said you're all dead were coming Saturday to kill you\nI'm a I think it was on I think it was on Sunday we're gonna come on Sunday and kill you or if you don't submit and we're going to crucify you the family set down kids at all and wrote a letter and said\nWe understand we forgive you for that\nWe're not we're not going to leave we'll be here you can come at three o'clock we only ask that you do not crucify us it it it it is we're not worthy of that kind of a death\nAnd they live ... because they stood up with pita yeah unbelievable what's happening\nAnd we can learn from global Christians are also historically there was this emperor fascinating ever called Julian the apostate I write about this in the book and he he actually he's called the apostate goes victors right the history and the Christians eventually became more prominent and and here's what he writes 'cause he's so angry about uh trying to hold back the advance of course that he's a pagan\nAnd he says this a while the pagan priest neglect the poor the hated galleons devote themselves to works of charity goes on and says these are biased galleons empire ... not only feed their own poor but I was also welcome them into their uh got by\nThe name of the book is the name of the book as Christians in the age of outrage make it a meat is well words are read\nNews radio nine twenty and one ...\nI might be awesome Florida Republican Marco Rubio not worried about jeopardizing an arms deal with Saudi Arabia if they are found responsible for the death of Washington Post journalist ... gosh Yogi\nIf this has proven to be
