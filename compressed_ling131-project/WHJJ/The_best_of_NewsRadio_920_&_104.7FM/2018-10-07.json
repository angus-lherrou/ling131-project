never part of this agreement what compromise has been reached for Chris Coons he is voting no\nHe's asking for the investigation to continue our around whether or not he's been honest about it as

and incredibly incredible lead within a week\nI think the FBI is about finished everybody can look that report for themselves and see if it's changed anything I Hope we don't move the goalpost Geoff oh did you sing committee when the understanding that he wanted to see what the FBI found about these accusations and hopefully get this done this week\nAll right let's talk about this agreement because it was supposed to be limited and the scope and now it is expanded out further we now see the uh the your your colleague on the Senate Judiciary committee the great senator from the state of Hawaii who wants to men by the way to sit down and shut up\nYeah which was pretty outrageous statement but anyway a senator Hirono now is saying she wants to nip FBI investigation into the quote I throwing report\nYeah yeah that's where we are so my dad owns a bar\nSo or throwing ISIS like a good day in a bar so uh the bottom line is that saw a bunch of BS and she's not part of the agreement

I saw him by them or their financial remember these parties Taylor remember how I think everybody in the county remembers that\nAnd we have we haven't heard from us friends so that people alive today I had a party and there are people that know that I have\nThis morning sweating it provided for names of ... she says went to the parties with her one of them said teaches not recall a Julie sweating it another friend she named is deceased we've reached out to the other two and hasn't turned back\nRight twenty five now until the top of the hour there's NBC News going forward with\nNothing after all this was was absolute ... how does this passport news story when on top of everything they even admit there's massive inconsistencies from the statement she released just a week ago you would think she can stay consistent in a week\nAnd the people that she says what corroborate remember she's charging here that there was a ... a systemic party culture where almost every week at that women girls young girls were being drugged\nWith ... and and ... forced to be an ... and young boys would then lined up\nOutside the room waiting to gang rape\nWomen and girls and that does happen thirty six years ago\nAnd nobody ever ever ever told a parent told a teacher told law enforcement and she gives the names just like in the case of professor Ford of individuals that would quote\nCorroborate this story and it's not corroborated just the opposite well this guy is dead and on top of that then we've got oh this one doesn't even know who you are\nHow does this how do you where it is the news standard in any capacity here to put this on the air\nByron York is joining us he's been running as a lotta columns about there's not the least of which is how high the bar has risen in the goalposts we've come a long way from oh it's going to be very limited in terms of the FBI investigation it's only going to be maximum a week and they'll get the job done and will move forward with a vote\nNow you see that a Camille Harris she's now coming out with another allegation just today\nMyron hey Sean Muslim on this on his NBC thing I think everybody's got to be in two minds about it\nA war on on the basis of the lack of evidence and ah there's no way the story should ever had been reported publicly just shouldn't have bought it was given in part a where due to the news networks I'm praying about Michael I have an ... her lawyer\nSo once it was all out there the fact that if you see as recorded beer is probably a good correct or at least we can create what I think what it was a parent to a lot of people\nAre there just was not going to the story [noise] um and when she offered a witnesses to corroborate the stories you just played a one had no idea who she was\nA noted was CSPAN too good answer the phone so I'm the story is already out there and has already gone to manage it is a good thing to knock it out\nAll right so let's go through all three cases that the the Democrats now want to expand the investigation they they never wanted a limited investigation they wanted to know floods investigation is now being the seventh\nFrom every indication at all I'm reading though that the FBI is moving expeditiously and it seems like they're very close to probably completing their work\nBut if we start with professor Ford professor Ford claimed that these four people were at the party nobody remembers any such party that she describes and the one person that was supposedly was an eye witness to the alleged abuse in her case\nWas mark judge and he said absolutely it didn't happen and then if you look at the ... if you look at the ... case this was in the New Yorker\nWill the New York times couldn't print the story and and they actually brought up the fact that after calling dozens and dozens of people to corroborate they discovered that misheard Ramirez was calling former yell classmates and asking them if they remembered and that she wasn't short short herself is Brett Kavanaugh\nBut they're saying well he must have blacked out in this event um nobody would know that but Brett Kavanaugh nobody would know unless he said that somebody I blacked out\nCorrect so does it look a fishing expedition this is now a destroy Kavanaugh expedition they don't care about anything except destroying him\nSo here you know the ... question right go ahead we don't want to get out of\nThe things that he claims yeah I'm from an emphasis on me or the sex misconduct allegations to once he truthful about his drinking and I think that's a reflection of the fact that there really isn't any evidence to support the sex\nOr allegations and now they're talking about whether he told the truth\nAbout drinking although he mentioned many times in his testimony that he dared 'em in fact drink today rocks published an article about his testimony about his drinking that never quoted a single word of his testimony about his drinking\nTricare mischaracterized what he said and then knock it down\nOr are they gotta let it go there thank you so much Byron York uh with us sanctions on Washington Examiner eight hundred nine four one Sean has or toll free telephone number as we

I think it was a great Senate candidate for Arizona served her\nHer country with incredible honor and distinction and\nAnd Dean Heller in Nevada and Rick Scott in Florida but these numbers today are interesting as President Trump's approval rating is now matched his all time high at fifty percent\nAnd more importantly we've got a raspy is simple that says well the latest survey fifty six percent of likely voters agree with judge Kavanaugh's statement to the Senate Judiciary committee friday of last week that his confirmation hearings had become a quote national disgrace\nLet it raises questions about what impact this might have\nOn the midterm elections in thirty three days because mid term election polling is getting more definitive\nThe enthusiasm gap is as close to almost two dead even hold and you see Republicans and important Senate races down a dead heat in all of the states that are red states where we're Democrats where Trump is won by fairly big margins\nI'm like I'm going to go further I think when we see that moment when judge Kavanaugh becomes justice capping off and we see that first time when he is sitting in the Supreme Court\nI think a large part of the left is just going to collapse and morale they have done everything they could they went all out they lied they show me your they did everything you can imagine and they lost\nAnd I think because the morale effect on the left is going to be substantial Chuck Schumer strategy failed and the fact is that he and the process he may well have crippled his party for a generation a good friend of mine called and said you know there's one team out there trying to build things\nThey're called Republicans and there's one team out there trying to destroy things they're called Democrats and he said to me I just don't think people\nAre Americans are going to vote for the destroyers and I thought that was a pretty good way to capture what we're living through\nOften said and then we've been friends going back since Nineteen Ninety maybe even a little before that and I've often said you can predict this what certainty every two and four years that identity politics\nYou know as rich versus poor old versus young\nBlack versus white whatever ... nature of politics they can bring up comes up every election year but they have now son to a new low you know I knew this was not going to be a difficult job for the FBI and the case of professor before there was no place there was no time there was no location there's no place for the FBI to visit\nIt took to look for anything parenthetically that might exist\nAnd the only for people that they could really talked to the poor people professor Ford mentioned\nThat she remembered being at this this so called party when the alleged event happened and she identified one person that was supposed to be a I Witness to the assault and the eyewitness said that did not happen and the other people do not remember\nAny such party is this and then the question is do we believe in the presumption of innocence or we just going to jump the gun and say guilt by association Cory Booker said something spectacular yesterday and he goes well there's an of allegations out there I mean you just you got to kind of believe that they're not qualified based on allegations\nWell look I must be clear Cory Booker sadly somebody who I used to think that a real future as a reformer or it's just sort of decayed I mean I don't know whether it's because he wants to run for president\nOr what but he just kind of decayed into almost making a mockery of himself me he talks about any of Spartacus moment which is a sign of such stunning historical ignorance that has a history teacher founded painful um he he makes comments like that\nI mean here people should know that if allegations destroy you uh then the whole process\nOf the rule of law collapses over totally and it's sad to watch something like that you know I think could have been a positive constructive force and who's now frankly are becoming almost a caricature of himself\nIs certainly a lot at stake and then the next\nThirty three days and you know there's other good economic those that have come out today I mean on top of record low unemployment and fourteen states African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans women in the workforce\nA youth unemployment fifty some odd year low a we have consumer confidence all time high for a million new jobs created for a million fewer people on on food stamps or you see what the president's accomplish with NAFTA the new NAFTA the\nThe new trade agreement with Mexico and and with Canada you see that he is eliminated burdensome regulation we can now drilling and war and the forty eight states uh he is literally singlehandedly save coal mining in America and of course natural gas production will now be at an all time high\nAnd we have a Wall Street journal piece today showing more Americans getting pay raises than ever before\nAnd that's the forgotten men and women that mattered in twenty sixteen the question is will they all go out and vote to protect the progress that has been made in the last two years even maybe if they don't particularly like their individual Republican congressmen or maybe think they're weak or maybe don't even know their name is\n... years putting your finger on the key question of this election I have as you know I've been involved in many many campaigns are actually going all the way back to Nineteen sixty and\nOne of the ... one of the lessons I learned was I don't care about the polls show me the precincts I Want to see the first real votes I Want to see who cares enough to show up and vote because that changes everything is you know we just won a\nA sixty three percent Hispanic district in a special election for the state Senate in Texas\nRight down along the border and this we had a candidate who got lost by twenty points four years ago came back to the special in one um and is the first Hispanic Republican state senator uh in Texas and that's because people were energized enough to turn out so I Would say to everybody in our audience\nWith this is going to come down to isn't holding it isn't conversation at the coffee shop who cares enough to get an absentee ballot who cares enough to show up and vote and if our side does show up in both I think this could be\nOne of the most historic elections there you and I've ever covered living together for lots of elections\nI have a hunch this one could turn into something that we would throw us\nBehind the scenes I got to give you a lot of credit because I remember speaking with you you probably forget it the day before\nYou became speaker of the houses in Nineteen Ninety four and I remember talking to you that day and the day of the election and and you are surrounded by a group of people in Joe Gaylord and you actually shared with me the information you had and you said it was absolutely true that for the first time in forty years Republicans would take over the house\nI think you and I were two of the few people willing to go out on a limb and said yeah Donald Trump as a real shot of winning this election and\nThen people laughed at us at the time and I I Believe that then and and we proved out to be right we also the ... both of us predicted Obama would be an abysmal failure as president based on a very rigid ideology that he seemed to be indoctrinated into\nAnd I I agree with you I think there is an opportunity here to shock the world again\nAnd it the for the people listening to this audience they're going to tune in thirty three nights from now watch election results come in and they're either going to seek kiddy happy liberal newscasters announcing Nancy Pelosi as speaker and\nChuck Schumer is the Senate majority leader and Maxine Waters will be the chairman of this committee or that committee and that the impeachment of Trump will go forward taxes will go up open borders will remain\nAn Obamacare stays all this or they're going to shock the world and all these people are going to do what they did in twenty sixteen and being the shock of their life\nWell that's right and I mean I think what what I Would say to everybody who's listening to us everybody who cares what the country's future make sure you vote makes sure your friends vote make sure everybody you know who favors\nA solid productive work oriented results oriented system make sure they go out and vote if that happens my I'm I'm not quite ready yet to predict what am I going to tell you that because of the intensity\nOf anger about the way the liberals smear Kavanaugh the characterization the dishonesty I Believe we have seen and I've been looking at data for three days I Believe that we've seen a substantial shift\nTowards Republicans now I think that they were almost certainly now going to keep the Senate and probably going to increase our or the total number of senators by significant margins\nHeidi Heitkamp of North Dakota who's down eleven is no on Kavanaugh to me put a fork in that race it's over\nAgain I think Kramer and it was a great great guy and I've known for twenty four years and he's got to get out there and keep campaigning\nWant one of the lessons you know I I had very close races including couple recounts and I had very big raised my experiences\nAnd I say this every candidate do not quit until the polls closed and do not relaxed until the recount are so uh this is a business where things can happen\nOf the house Newt Gingrich so I I Will say this if we allow this\nTo get rewarded and they get power as a result of this or\nLook we're not going to know till Saturday of impact judge Kavanaugh is confirmed and you know I I Hope Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski are satisfied I Know who Susan Collins so she was satisfied with the FBI report and\nJeff Flake said the same thing I don't know where Lisa Murkowski is he has not spoken publicly as of now what I Hope we don't reward this behavior because if we do\nTo me it becomes a tipping point in the country where you're just going to get more of this\nAnd anybody that the Democrats don't like is is going to be subject to guilt by accusation and this type of smearing and slandering that goes on and I'd also like to see a change in the standard in the law if you're a public figure well do you have to show on this that the absence of malice how do you prove an absence of malice\nIt's a ridiculous standard that nobody could ever reach\nWhich is why people like you and me whatever what people say about us we get stopped taking it\nSure looks but let me just say I think that overwhelmingly the American people do not want to reward that kind of behavior sheet you you've seen it now and the kind of surveys we're seeing now\nAre amazing people have moved very significantly in the last week and it shouldn't reaction to ...\nOh and how vicious and how personal or the Democrats have been and I brought this on themselves and I think that they're now going to reap whirlwind\nOr I missed the speaker thanks for being Lewis thirty three days ...

saw either man's spy kids\nThe Brett Kavanaugh [noise] you know fighting a punch Brian Hi and I I saw him given rent fellow kept quiet girls during that time frame I haven't round the punch I Want to say malls or the campaign or is I don't know why he did\nBut I saw him by them or their financial remember these parties Taylor remember how I think everybody in the county remembers that\nAnd we have we haven't heard from friends that are there people alive today I had a party and there are people that how about that part have\nThis morning sweating it provided for names of ... she says went to the parties with her one of them said teaches not recall a Julie sweating it another of the friends she named is deceased we've reached out to the other two and hasn't turned back\nSo if you cannot get a single person given to you named given to you that would corroborate their story to actually corroborate the story and you don't have it and you see a pattern of of backtracking and shifting and changing not\nNot in significant facts but the most significant facts\nRemember the story was about almost on a weekend basis and I've been to ten of these parties myself where young girls were drugged and boys wind up the whole you know so they could gang rape exam\nWell I'm Me gave out red solo cups and I saw him at a party I don't know if he did anything to the punch this is so reckless irresponsible NBC how they would ever dare run this is beyond any comprehension I have now if they had confirmation\nIf they had witnesses\nIf there wasn't a changing shifting\nStory if there wasn't traumatic backtracking they might then have some legitimate reason to air this but because they want what the Democrats want which is the smearing of judge Kavanaugh to continue well they had to air it but even they airing of it made them look really really pathetic\nIt's not fair there are ... and I'll tell you the other thing there are victims people I Know in my life of sexual abuse I Know there's evil in the world I wrote a whole book about evil people that would ever drug rape\nOr girl are evil these people are predators they need to get off the streets\nBut you've gotta have some cooperation to these things\nAnd it just comes out of Seventeen Days ago just on the eve of the confirmation vote for judge Kavanaugh and if you go issue by issue case by case you know it it comes down to do we believe in the presumption of innocence due process and simple common sense or do we believe in guilt by\nAccusations because in each case there hasn't been any corroborating evidence at all in each case what you see is a lot of smearing a lot of smoke a lot of blood shunning but no evidence\nOr\nDidn't know if it's run by the wireless foundation with us from any of the national Center for children that can't [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n\nRight if we can then you were in the war in the ...\nWith us or what I don't understand there's a well I Know there are consequences ... because\nI Know Richard ... lawyer at the time a really good guy by the name of Lin wood uh he got after a lot of media companies I Know the Duke lacrosse kids oh they went after a lot of people after that smear job\nUh I Know what's happened in ... a rape case I guess that's that's following through\nEvery one of these cases though and then add to it a Ferguson, Missouri Trayvon George Zimmerman Cambridge police Freddie Gray Baltimore there's a collective left wing rush to judgment no presumption of innocence\nAnd they get proven wrong over and over again and media companies get suited lose over and over again and they keep making the same mistakes I guess the problem with the president he's the president he can't sue for slander\nWell it's right in and sadly neither can judge Kavanaugh ugly for the same reason we use the public figure uh so I don't believe it's going to be able to legally go down that road but this is what they do this is who they are and Sean I Want to see is the last couple of days you have done a fabulous job winning out the hypocrisy here\nUh I mean if if we're going to have a serious conversation about drinking in high school and drugs and high school and adult conduct of a domestic violence when you have incumbent democratic members of the Senate with court records well out their wealth discussed\nA and and and suddenly this is no longer part of the conversation or can't be discussed I mean this is crazy this is crazy I mean I think they've gone down the road here that they are going to regret long term because every\nTime I've ever had I I don't I don't think so because it sort of like when Harry Reid lied about Mitt Romney at and pay taxes in ten years\nAnd then he was asked after the election if he cared about lying about Mitt Romney's way there's no we won the election what's the difference and the ... the means for the I think the left so believes conservatives are evil that they feel justified in whatever it is that they say that's right you know but the problem is here this is so serious an allegation\nAnd you know I'm not the biggest fan of the Republican Party I'm not a Republican I've been very critical when they're weak in timid and stupid\nAnd I would say they have handled this what the appropriate amount of serious this they have balance what is a fair system they've given every possibility shadow of a doubt and now it's time to vote\nNow the question is Kelly where Susan Collins where's Lisa Murkowski and wears Jeff snowflake gonna vote\nAt right it comes down to the three any Mitch McConnell I had been a real war here and pushing for actual churning graphically not on the Internet and I think that in a crap you're exactly right it can make it a week ago if we would've had\nA comment or calcium sign I think he's here that we might not arrow in East Africa and I said I'm not because I had any faith and Democrat\nBut because they have clinical ... didn't mind you have your mansion looking at it gate or thirty percent margin that people want to eat out and confirmed by a margin that people have North Dakota once the Kavanaugh confirmed it would be ... or ...\nOr high can't or match in Oregon and we cannot vote predict nominee don't get people to get their humor lack God that they might be out of their own political okay in a factory right\nWell I mean yeah I mean high camp and and mansion but I think I don't think they go that way a less Collins and Murkowski or a combination of of Collins and and flake or or Murkowski inflate\nOnce the Republicans have the vote then they'll have the freedom to go and I don't think the Democratic leadership because of of flying hoot about their constituents in West Virginia Florida North Dakota Indiana Missouri because\nIf they did they would say vote your conscience I mean Jeff Flake the hero of the Democratic party why because he admits season on principle man that would never vote the way he really felt because he's only doing this because he's he's lifted up the burden of having to face the horrible voters again\nI mean that was a horrible admission on sixty minutes yeah\nYeah and I I mean [laughter] don't\nReal does wrong principle is a man that stands on values\nAnd it is a man who wrote a book mimicking Barry Goldwater's the conscience of the conservative ham and if you know if he is then now we have a moment to stand up\nHe thinks he's going to be president let me just first of all just like Jeff delusion [laughter]\nYou are delusional you will never be the president of the United states not in my lifetime All right that if you're the thank you both for being with us he couldn't get there just teen votes I I mean he's like at nine percent of his own state race it off to the northeast\nNew Hampshire's not interested in Jeff Flake and neither is Iowa\nI mean so out of touch and its own nobody's interested in the guy that says so I'm only voting this way 'cause I don't have to face the voters again also every other vote was because you wanted to get reelected and you didn't care about\nWhat principles were involved in a particular vote right quick break we'll come back coming up we're Victoria Toensing and Joe

New York times piece that he came out with the ... to me it's absolutely stunning and the things that he's saying because you know while the FBI's packet in the middle of it when we handled the Hillary Clinton email investigation while he was writing an exoneration himself\nPrior to the real investigation which didn't happen until three days before he publicly exonerated her um but then he goes on to trash the president at length\nAnd then he talks about FBI agents are experts which they are and interviewing people and quickly dispatching leads to their colleagues around the world to follow up with additional interviews\nAnd they will confront people with testimony and other accounts and you know yes the alleged incident occurred thirty six years ago but FBI agents no time has little to do with memory um which I found a little strange um and then you know for example everybody remembers if it rained on their wedding day\nUh I don't think that's a ... in that particular sense maybe to somebody who is traumatized by could see that\nBut for somebody that's not traumatized maybe not\nUm once they start interviewing every witness knows the consequences he says is one thing to have your lawyer submitted statement on your behalf it's very different thing to sit across from two FBI special agents and answer their relentless questions of course the bureau won't have subpoena power only the ability to knock on doors and ask questions\nMost people will speak to the other is what he says refusal to do so is its own kind of statement now I Want to just address that because\nMy FBI friends my friends in the in the bureau special agents have all said to me never ever talk to the FBI unless you have a lawyer ever\nAnd I'm like why am somebody who loves the FBI I don't love the upper brass under Khomeini and the cave instructing page but the FBI is is the FBI people I Know what the salt of the earth people and I said I've course I'd want to help him he goes no and then they say look\nWhat happened to General Flynn General Flynn is accused of lying to the FBI and the up here I didn't think he was lying to them\nAnd you just it's dumb to ever talked to any law enforcement without a lawyer that's what all my law enforcement people friends say\nBecause it's a crime if you lie to the FBI let's say you said something in the Senate Judiciary investigation and it doesn't exactly match up you could be charged with a crime of lying to the FBI it's ridiculous\nAnd you know the irony that there's a lot in Coney Coney and\nLow right now is just to try to destroy the Trump with everything he can and his mother another\nSection in that play book but\nThe Iranian he jak sane federal law provision that says it's a crime to cheat lie the FBI is the one that gets a crime\nTo lie to the Senate as their with their debts get it it's not just you know a similar penalty is exactly the same statutory violation so that's just not a thing kind of pretending there's that that I guess playing a little bit on people's images maybe from the movies\nAltering or a camera on a daily basis with this fall state in the first and then just so much Jake uh evidence everywhere\nListen she she identified and there's a there's a part of me that really sympathizes with this is such a serious issue in and I don't think we give the Republicans enough credit for how they've handled this including the president they handled it with the proper seriousness the topic deserves\nShe gave the names of four people and none of the pork and corroborate her story including the guy that was supposed to be an eye witness to it at that point\nThey were really you can't go any further with it and he adamantly denies it so it's um it's a matter of just simple okay if somebody corroborated it we'd be in a very different position today I got to take a quick break final have power\nFree for all our Sean Hannity show and we will continue from our nation's capital Hannity tonight nine eastern on Fox\nYou're listening to the best of the Sean Hannity show we'll have more of your favorite gas topics and memorable moments that's all coming up [noise] [noise]\n\nHi Michelle mocking here if you tell them I work you know the one of the biggest outrageous I reported on with the trial of abortion doctor Kermit Koch now\nAnd the woman goes into a funny comes out of there is no police report and\nI helped expose the crime the mainstream media tried to cover up we had instructions directly from governor regions office not to expect of course\nGuy was he came to me for help I jumped to the camera I personally donated to make sure this film ... main got no movie opens would come out in the main thing ...\nWas perhaps the most ...
