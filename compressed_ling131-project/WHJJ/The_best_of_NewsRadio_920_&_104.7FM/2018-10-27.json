O. J. what's up Joe how are you glad you called sir\nJohn near the number one supporter of Donald Trump in the country I think he's the best president moral history he needs to send troops down to stop this invasion and I think you would agree with that we just can't afford to take all these people and we we have a Twenty one trillion dollar debt and so I Hope that he will send troops down to stop this invasion of our country\nWill be nice of Mexico did their job and Mexico would stop them in their country and\nYou know now they're trying to precipitate a crisis that could be a really disastrous for everybody involved in this and yet you keep breeding reports that you know people are being take well taken care of well fed food and water you know the goal is to get them up to a southern border but\nYou know what to after the seven thousand is gonna be ten thousand more is going to be a hundred thousand more what do we know about anybody that is in this caravan you know everybody come here because Mitt ...\nWell I think between and I've been saying this and I believe it I think between the horrible treatment of Kavanaugh the elimination of\nDue process and the presumption of innocence meanwhile they're silent on Keith Ellison and they're silent on Cory Booker and they're silent on Claire McCaskill's a husband between all of that hypocrisy and between the caravan and the mob that were out all all over the place this weekend\nAnd the success and failure Obama's failure Trump's success I think that there's a lot to get people to get out and vote we'll see what happens in Fifteen days though Joe thank you eight hundred nine four one shown our number Brian is in Lexington, Kentucky Brian how are you and we're glad you called sir\nYes sir I was calling about the migration rush on our border and\nI Want to know your thoughts about who might be behind the scenes organizing there's basically committing treason and is that something Trump could find out where the FBI and you know maybe you need to look into that and find out exactly who's you know has to have this big plan now that we know what's going on\nWhat what is it we know what's going on we know that you know at the end of the day we'll find out where the money comes from that supporting some of those uh I understand you know America can't continue to support and prop up as the president has been saying\nAll of these countries that were given a lot of aid to and they're going to let people leave their country and come racing\nTowards our border I'm all for immigration but it's got to be done orderly it's got to be done legally\nAnd you can have what do you know you can have seven thousand people just drop on our door and say take us into where horrible people uh especially one that the only place they can seek asylum is the first country they get to that would be Mexico in Mexico obviously didn't have the will lower desire to do anything in this case\nAnyway

Waters\nYou know you get a crowded you follow these people and to grocery stores in department stores and gas stations and you tell them we don't want them here anywhere anymore you know telling Henry Kissinger to leave the country Mitch McConnell not only did they tell Mitch McConnell to leave the country\nBut then they're talking about that the guy smashed literally ripped\nHis leftovers I guess just maybe it's taken a meal home to somebody else\nAnd throws it outside the restaurant door banging on the guy's table somebody's going to get killed here you watch somebody is or hurt severely it it's going to happen then nobody on the left ever can critique their own side for the rhetoric they're using Anthony Scaramucci is with us I just finished cover to cover his ... brand new book\nUh and it's phenomenal and it's the Inside Story about Donald Trump it's called Trump the blue collar president\nAnd how billionaire living on Fifth Avenue identified the struggle of blue collar Americans had won the presidency and all those are the forgotten men and the forgotten women in this country and I don't think they're liking this mob mentality I don't think they like to weigh judge Kavanaugh was treated much\nAnd I don't think they like watching this caravan of thousands marching towards our border\nI mean they they literally are mishandling everything and so we're with what's happening is uh the the president has almost like this light Sean like you know you and I were out on Long Island in the summer or parents would hang up that infect light\nWell the president has that the Trump Twitter\nInsect light and they're all going towards the late in the vaporizing a Senator Warren she's got to get a DNA test\nShe's less of a Native American and your mate into the vapors ... big caravan issue the way they're handling the care of an issue if the galvanizing his base that Kavanaugh's thing was absolutely ridiculous they were making up one story after the next they figured okay me too movement seems to work there is no due process and the meat you go\nLet's take this guy that did very well credentialed judge or he's got an impeccable adult life let's try to destroy him\nGoing back to Nineteen eighty one in Nineteen eighty two and so again right into the Trump Twitter\nInsect vaporize or so so for me I'm enjoying list the polls are tightening up into the president's base is actually going to turn out much higher percentages and people predicted in so\nOnce again he's going to defy logic here I think we are very good chance to possibly ah keep the house we're certainly going to gain seats in the Senate\nAnd it couldn't happen without the energy and the ... President Trump\nWell if they do when I'll say this he's carrying a lot of these people on his back but you know what if you like Nancy Pelosi the dangers are what we're gonna have endless investigation higher taxes keep Obamacare open borders\nAnd the president is is battling back on all these ... and Guatemala Honduras El Salvador he says there or not we're not able to do the job of\nStopping people from leaving their country and coming illegally to the U.S now we will begin cutting off substantially reducing the mass of foreign aid we routinely give them and Trump tweeted out every time you see a caravan of people they legally coming are attempting to come into our country illegally\nThinking blame the Democrats\nAre not giving us the votes to change our pathetic immigration laws\nRemember the midterms it's so unfair to those who come in legally and he's right um well and and we don't know anything about the people that are coming here we don't know when when one thing about them and I know the media can be sympathetic because they want but you know who might mix it with the people that maybe just want a job is a big problem for us\nBut but it's but you but here's the other thing okay the American people intuitively notion that it's just all it is is he or she is recognizing with a legendary built for even one set about any country\nIf you have a welfare state in the United states does have one you need to protect your Puerto Rico's free market forces dictate that people will cross over that quarter\nTo participate in your welfare state and so\nEvery country has a strong border and so should the United states so they don't get\nA you know ... on on promoting my my uh my book that today in the last couple of days mom a lot of left leaning shows where they go they go nuts so crazy on the president's response all you want to illegal immigration you have democratic and Republican presidents\nAnd democratic elected officials that have voted for the last I don't understand why just enforcing those laws have everybody saw ... ... ... well could there ... so\nWhy don't they well it's a lot of things are we better off economically than we were two years ago by\nEvery single objective measure the answer is yes the growth of the economy consumer confidence jobs created the number of people leaving food stamps or out of poverty eight million Americans so you know by every measure and more bottom\nThe bottom ten percent of the society shut the wages of five and a half percent according to the wall Street Journal over the last Eighteen months but as a direct result of the president's policies but also the fact that he cut the slack at the border\nAnd so he made it tightened up the labor supply and it's giving lower middle class families shot you know have real living wages\nWell that's the story that you actually tell in the book by the way Anthony Scaramucci is with us all through the brand new book it's out today we put it up on Hannity dot com it's on Amazon dot com and bookstores everywhere it's called Trump the blue collar president I first heard that term from one of his sons who was either Erica Don I don't remember those Donnie\n... get on each call them the blue collar billionaire yeah and I said ... Don if you don't mind going to hijack the nickname and just switch out billionaire and put in President he was at the end of the day he resonates with these people\nLook I I I think it is and you talk a lot about his background you you talk a little bit about your family background it's similar to\nBackground and and it's amazing because the only thing that I really care about what motivates me it's about politics itself it's not a game to me\nBecause the policies that we have in a country as we do now greatly impact whether or not people are on food stamps or whether or not there are jobs we now in two years\nHave us a scenario that is not unfolded in this country since Nineteen sixty nine and that is we have a million more jobs than we have people on unemployment you know that identify with that that's what you identify with you you did not have any better than your mouth\nAnd you know I saw it as a dishwasher at twelve and and look what you started I you know\nSean Sean list that I mean I think that's the message and I think that's the reason why you're so clearly popular at the end of the gay America is about aspiration\nIn America is about passing the ... the the baton to a next generation of Americans that can do better than ourselves and that's what our grandparents did for our parents that our parents did for you and I and and but yet at the white policy shift of white free market based motivating\nMarket incentive policies of because what we both know is it you cannot just the ties or through a political system created equal out called it never happens black markets crop up and then there's a thin layer at the tippy top that are living better than everybody else and everyone else has devastated whether it's Cuba or Venezuela like that\nYou know the real danger so I don't know how this is all going to play out but we we see all weekend long these mobs you know really making and get an unsafe environment for anybody to even go get a bite to eat if you're a public figure which was really sad I mean when you're doing it in front of people's wives\nIt's not only sad it's pathetic when you're going after Pam Bondi Sarah Sanders and our kids and\nSecretary Nielsen and all she do all they're doing is trying to sit in a restaurant and have something to eat telling you know one group of Americans they're not wanted here in any way what are you doing here get out of this you know they're going after an a Ninety year old guy Henry Kissinger now who served his country with honor and distinction\nIs that it seems like there's no limits here but there's no moderation left\nEither mulch and the Democratic party it used to be I I used to think Democrats at least they on paper they said they cared about the American working men and women but apparently they don't\nYou know the the generations that built this country that none of your Scaramucci Hannity Trump it doesn't matter but the generations I built this country are just amazing people the immigrants that built this country my grandparents all for coming from Ireland\nUh anyway the book is called the Trump the blue collar president Anthony Scaramucci it's up on

I Would imagine that your polls are going to go higher\nShon well it it's unbelievable every single day a new part of her radical passed in her mocking Arizona and their extremism on so many issues as being an earth\nBut the Arizona local media is protecting her a and making excuses for her and so the only way that filters down his shows like yours are us turning it into a TV ad\nOr the fact that she's still hanging in there is really ridiculous so out of step with Arizona values and American values you rattled off a number of uh a number of things that would have a Senate candidate B. disqualifying in the past\nBut here we are right down to the wire over eighty percent or around eighty percent of people will vote early over half have already voted and so we need to make sure that the messages out about her radical out of step past\nThis qualifying statement you know compared to nice to have been twenty six years in the military and defending our freedoms that are way of life\nWhat did you do in the military I Know well you served abroad post nine eleven correct\nYes sir I was a a ten pilot I was fortunate to be the first woman in us history to fly a fighter jet in combat uh and then the first to command a fighter squadron and combat I've had six deployments to the middle east and Afghanistan a hundred and twenty five combat\nHours in a tan ward hog again saving American lives on the ground and defending our way of life it was an absolute honor of my life to be able to serve\nKnow when you hear curse and send them to say oh it's okay at that point what I Believe it was two thousand and three that oh it's okay if Americans want to join our enemies the Taliban nearly died\nA Sean when I when we heard this I I couldn't believe it I mean I was deployed on nine eleven uh the Taliban harbored al ... who can and killed three thousand Americans since then with them and their affiliates they've killed thousands of American troops\nTo include truthful I was deployed over there I've told this story before but we would at Bagram Air force base when I was a commander\nUh we you know we would get out there as soon as we heard a firefight was going on and we'd be overhead to protect them in our eight ten but often times uh you know the the the firefights happened before we could get there and Americans lost their lives\nAnd as we would we would line up on a taxi way as the ... the flag draped casket would come through and there's ... there's a silence there\nAnd everyone is saluting giving our final salute to these American heroes\nWho perished over there fighting the Taliban and their affiliates\nAnd for her to be able to say that she's OK with an American going to join the Taliban to fight against us\nThese are not sure it's better than John Fong it's a Democrats for obstructing\nA closing loopholes and securing the border and the president as frustrated as the eye and he knew easiest everything he's got to cook it do to put pressure on Mexico\nAnd then they usually work out and finding and fully funding all yes and you have\nBoarded our belt thirty eight billion dollars including building of all yes there\nWould you vote to repeal Obamacare the both of John McCain decided to change his mind on\nWell Sean I did vote to repeal and replace Obamacare on our house they'll I'm getting my asking for it right now because it's being misconstrued either Democrat they're trying to uh you know invoke fear in people in that family\nMember wait a minute I Know Arizona didn't how many Arizona's lost their plans lost their doctors and are paying infinitely higher rates because of Obamacare\nYes Obamacare has failed in Arizona there's only one choice and fourteen right ... no choice people lost their health care coverage we had people right now a tree that thing conditions you can't get access to health insurance because of the failures of Obamacare\nSo I work hard to make sure that we were moving away from that and and towards something that gives more choice for people\nMore flexibility at the state level of them are free market getting the federal government you know to not be doing it in one size fits all top down penalty taxes mandate it's cold\nAnd so we you know I voted yes again I've got millions of dollars attacking me right now misconstrue ing that vote I voted to protect people with preexisting condition oh that's good intentions but their policies are wrong we need more conservative policies to bring the cost down and provide more options for people to get access to insurance\nOr I ... a really a rock star a hero who served their country and an important race for the Republicans as they not only want to maintain control of the U.S Senate but also to build their majority in the Senate that'll make votes for Supreme Court justice is a lot easier\nGoing up against the very radical leftists in the name of Chris and send them a thank you so much ah Martha McSally for all you've done for your country and and the positions you take and ah you should win this race\nFar and wide when the people of Arizona fully understand the record the background and the radical views of Christ and send them a thank you for being with us Martha McSally\nThanks on appreciate you signing a flashlight on that in an advocacy and if people want to how they can go to Nick Sally for Senate dot com you

dedicated listener concerns my concern is the Supreme Court list that across that\nIt actually a presented when he was on trial is okay and the reason why my concern is just as because magic closed is already a put the news out there that they do smear campaigns\nAnd they've done it can ... they want us to have transparency and so we've given transparent like open up our playbook so they can actually investigate every person on that list so whoever has meant shop actually nominates\nThey've already got a team investigate that specific personally attacked a smear campaign\nWell that's all you get from the Democrats that their only play book that's all they have that one on one one or two one oh three one oh five one oh nine that this is it you know and you know it's interesting to watch the Democrats now are trying to urge caution on blue wave and temper expectations they're scared to death\nBecause after all the mobs\nAnd after what they did with Kavanaugh\nAnd what we see
