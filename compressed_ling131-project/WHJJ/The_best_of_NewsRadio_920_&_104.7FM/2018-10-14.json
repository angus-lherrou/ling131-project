Brunson spent part of his first day back on American soil visiting the oval office in thanking the president for helping to secure his release after two years in Turkish captivity\nOr the God Forbid I get cancer or the God Forbid I got a bad accident right\nRight um you you don't have a car insurance for gasoline you don't have home owners insurance for lawn care\nInsurance is for the big things and we've tried to ensure everything top down and that's led to the last\nYou know really a ten years of insurance premiums that have doubled or tripled we need to do is insured less which is how every other insurance product works they keep it that is means doctors have to make more of the services they provide affordable\nAnd they can if they cut out the middleman and streamline than a simple\nMath and how big is your practice how many patients do you have in your facility and at the same day in Wichita\nIn Wichita we have five doctors and over thirty two hundred patients\nUnbelievable and your aid you give concierge care and I could pick up a phone and I'm getting a doctor at three in the morning that it's going to answer my call\nYou do you have and I could go down and see somebody at three AM in the morning\nIf you need stitches ... it's an emergency you know a lot of history and phone calls or chest pain which we might send to the ER but a lot of times the kid who's sick and a mom who's worried and um you of if you can avoid the ER you can avoid a thousand or two thousand dollar bill\nThat's how you get health care health insurance is a card in your wallet health care is access to your doctor yeah\nAll right and then how many other practices around the country have you been able to to provide your model that they have duplicated how you you've been out and about on a champion of this for a long time\nYet we've helped over five hundred and fifty doctors convert to this model in the last few years but there's about a thousand total there in forty eight states in every state except north and South Dakota right now but we have one about to launch in North Dakota [noise]\nUm and then it's even gotten a little bit international so um this is a a sound tried and true model\nNow and what do you do Dr grows in terms of your president of duck a doctor patient care foundation you know now that we have alternatives that are working real life experiences seems to me that we ought to be able to duplicate it a lot more than we are\nAbsolutely a so doctor patient care foundational er physician run health policy stunk because doctors never seemed to be at the table when ever having conversations about health care\nSo we put traditions about getting back to the table to have conversations personally I I also have a primary care practice much like that lets them here in southwest Florida a practice of any health are plus when he was\nYou know why are we using insurance to pay for health are for basic primary care services all it does is create obstacles to access and\nYou know and we're ... the phone ... points as Dr Josh and we're seeing patients come to us from all over the state of Florida and even from outside of the country ... medical tourism uh ... what we're finding is that\nYou know not not the same thing got about health insurance we're just using it for all and you know when somebody is\nYou know pay twice the amount of money for a service because the ... shots why don't we ensuring is using insurance drives up the cost of the other products\nSo an MRI cash price Ross is two hundred and twenty dollars\nWhile using her your commercial insurance you know we go through all the the hoops to get it authorized\nYour co pay five hundred dollars or so we we see this time and again the more people are are coming out of pocket to pay for health health or I'll let you signed up to ... more insurance seems to be becoming an optical\n... solution so I'm pleased to see that you know we're shifting the conversational from a coverage for everyone who I'm Talking about reducing the cost of health care\nI think the real close and that's why I was about to testify on us some help committee on the ...\nWould it be a better idea I mean I'm watching for example they have this race out in California everybody's shock gather news and who is now offering free health care for everybody it whether you're a taxpayer whether you're in the state legally or illegally\nEverybody's going to get free health care well I basically put a sign that says come to California but you get sick\nUm but there's people are going to go there now what's interesting to me is that a Republican is within striking distance and that gubernatorial race out in California because instinctively people no we can't afford to pay\nFor every illegal immigrant in the country are but the reality is is that if I Lived in Wichita, Kansas I Would be a part of at the same day and I would be your patient\nAdopt ... because I I think it's the best deal I liked the idea of being able to call my doctor whenever I'm sick or if I have a kid that sick every parent wants the ability to do that and your preserved for service provides it for fifty bucks a month now how much does the average in Wichita, Kansas catastrophic plan and if the big things heart attack\nOr accident or cancer how much would one of those plans cost\nAbout five hundred dollars a family five hundred dollars per year or a month a month\nSo and the current rates closer to you know a thousand twelve hundred a across the nation people are paying more for health insurance each month and they're paying for their mortgage if the Trump tax cuts only put a hundred dollars per household per month in and they're being credited with\nThe economic boom of your four point two percent GDP\nIf we fix health insurance we could put five hundred dollars back in the pocket of every household [noise] ah the the real ... and the the politician their heads and California is to send them on a ridge analogy\nThis throwing more money at the problem has never fixed it what we're doing is Dr Lee and ourselves and and a thousand other physicians is is innovating and saying how do we get ... cheaper how do we make it so patients don't have co pays how do we provide stitches for no cost because they're so affordable [noise]\nUm you know actually looking at ways it's fundamentally fixing the system that's what we need not just promises of more spending\nWay and if I could add add to that just a a you know as far as the cost of care you know the biggest thing that people ask us is how can I just get\nMajor medical you know we we can afford what what services the armor care practices providing but we just need something catastrophic well mama care made that illegal or so ... just brought\nBy ... that access these major medical plan called ... short term medical plans and you know some would argue that these are actually true insurance they don't cover anything except the major medical expenses there's Seventy five dollars a month or\nWhat but what it is this going to be implemented easily city by city town by town we can duplicate the model\nAlready does take care of individuals with preexisting conditions if somebody wants to sign up for atlas MD and they have a preexisting condition a doctor ... denied them service\nNow everybody's welcome and everybody's price the same just based on age um we know we're going to work harder for some patients ... Wilson ... not have to work as hard for other patients and we don't want to know judged by their illness\nHow did you get to who directly negotiate these prices with these pharmaceutical companies\n[noise] boy I Wish I could say was because we're so darn good at it um the truth is it's so much more simple than that I\nHave a doctor's in forty four states are allowed to work directly with pharmaceutical wholesalers so just like you can go to Costco and get something for much cheaper because you pay a membership we do the same thing and we're able to get the you know the actual cost of the medicine might be at ten dollars for a thousand pills and ...\nUnbelievable well look I Hope everybody will pay attention because in twenty eight days Americans are going to go to the polls in Obamacare won't work and we know the left and the Democrats want to keep it in a I applaud you guys for what you're doing and the fact that you've been able to duplicate those models around the country\nSpeaks volumes about what your real mission is and that is saving people's lives in his very inspiring thank you both think Sean ... we'll talk more about it in a day's coming up throughout the election eight hundred nine four one Sean ... telephone number when we come back wide open telephones if you want to be a part of the program straight ahead\nYou are listening to the best of the Sean Hannity show and stay\nTuned more memorable moments interesting gas and a lot of fun coming up next [noise]\nSo with your back against the wall and her birthday or anniversaries just days away who do you trust one eight hundred flowers dot com right now when you order a dozen red or multi colored roses\nTwenty nine Ninety nine a one eight hundred flowers dot com we'll give you another doesn't end up vase absolutely free choice between gorgeous red or multi colored roses is absolutely yours one eight hundred flowers dot com click on the radio icon but in my last name Hannity one eight hundred flowers dot com promo code Hannity this offer ends on friday\nHi Michele I'm often hear one of the biggest outrageous I reported on the trial of abortion doctor Kermit Koch now\nNow the woman goes into a company comes out of data there is no police report and\nI helped expose the crime the mainstream media tried to cover up we had instructions natural course of the gods now movie is amazing Cormac God's know is perhaps the most polish a serial killer in America bring friends and family you do not want to pack up and unique opportunity to change our minds about abortion got\nRated PG Thirteen no play [noise]\nThis audio is for your review and now for ...

News President Trump at a campaign rally tonight in Richmond, Kentucky talking about securing the release of American pastor Andrew Brunson Brunson was sentenced decades in prison in Turkey for supposedly having ties to terrorism\nPeople to just how vicious the Democratic party can be\nYeah I'll listen to the old tactics of the past with the Republican Party mature intimately familiar with where\nDemocrats lobby political grenade right onto the field usually some kind of a you go through the list every night on Fox or you know a racist besides you just you know the the phobic ... kind of stuff these identity politics grenades and Republicans would scatter\nWell they tried a new one with Kavanaugh they try to really disgusting one this rapist line which is one of the most important things I've ever seen in politics and for the first time shot in a long time\nWe had a president the White House who said we're not going to back down a cabinet we're not going to let you back then I work at a back you up\nAnd we won one and that when I Believe is really just ... and this is not a scientific sample I don't want to oversell it but based on me just driving around in my town which is a fifty fifty Republican Democrat county Orange County Florida\nRepublicans could not be more ecstatic that we finally have a warrior and a fighter in the White House who is not going to leave the battlefield when that identity politics or disgusting label or comes in from the Democratic party and I think it's really\nA spiced up the Republican base I think we may have a we may have a a a decent the election day\nWell I'm not sure I Can't read the tea leaves um I think it all comes down in these midterm elections always comes down to turn out and people are motivated like the recipes from poll says\nUh than it would happen to them and looking at the numbers that Republicans are more mad about the cabinet controversy than Democrats are in a more determined to vote in the upcoming elections just as a dramatic twenty five point shift in just the last six weeks Greg Jarrett so that would give hope to me and hopefully the American people that\nSomehow the Republicans can bucked the trend and and maintain power in the house and maybe pick up some Senate seats which I think are a distinct possibility\nWell I think you're right the only question is\nThis with twenty seven days remaining or does this trend that Republicans are motivated and energized vote\nHave legs will it last over the course of the next four weeks [noise]\nUm and you know we just don't know that but you're right the polling data does show that and I you know I think that there is a general anger among both men and women across America that this was a process\nOf the confirmation hearing that was a mass amount of fairness and the presumption of innocence and due process and that absent some corroborating evidence from a thirty six year old claim\nYou really can't ruin somebody's career and their life and you know the reputation a ... that they built up and the goodwill and their families reputation\nShow I mean I Do think that there is a feeling across America that a lot of this is unfair now there are liberals and the media which is redundant\nUh who are show rabbit that they don't care about fairness they just care about their own political agenda\nHowever misplaced in wrong it may be\nAnd so you're never going to change their minds there is no reasoning with on reasonable people so we'll just have to wait and see it's up to the Republican Party I think and and the candidates and indeed President Trump to maintain that momentum going forward over the next twenty seven days\nLook the hell out of great article today about what their agenda is at night the Democrats have big plans none of which will help the country or they want to shore up Obamacare which has been nothing short of a disaster for the American people\nThey want war Dodd Frank financial rules to protect quote dreamers and the integrity of elections in other words they want massive amnesty they want to aggressively probe any single thing they can they want this country locked down into endless investigation\nAnd likely the impeachment of Donald Trump they you know Republicans celebrate the passage of the biggest tax cutting history they refer to as crumbs\nAnd they're saying it's time to take the crumbs back I guess the crumbs or the most delicious part of the meal so all of this isn't ... jeopardy damned bonds you know I don't see a waning in people's enthusiasm now I think they have they went so far in the cabin okay some frankly in the last two years what we have witnessed split the\nAnd you chronicled lives in your new book\nYou know the the attempted sabotage of the president I think they see the fundamental unfairness and nothing they stand for is going to help the average American I have a better life\nRight and so on the media and Greg just nailed it by the very you know the media and the Democrats ... ... it's it's it's symbiotic guy I mean it it's a host at a at a parasite at this point they're the same thing they have ginned up this rage not\nAll of them but many of them against Donald Trump to such an intense for me to think about the things showing that have come out I mean new lows in politics Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee called the rapist Donald Trump called the uh treat treat guilty of treason a crime literally punishable by death that's not hyperbolic\nHe's been he's been called trees is they've given up the base so much on that here's the problem the Democrats have created for themselves and the election\nThat in order to seem like the more anti Trump candidate to get that money in those volunteers for your twenty twenty presidential campaign or to get that money in the midterms what do you have to do you have to oppose the trader you have to oppose the train rapists or whatever it's sick name they call the capital\nSo that that's what's leading to this ... this psycho pathology on the left\nAnd I agree I I don't see this waning and I do see Republican voters saying listen when is enough enough you attack this this this American patriot and Kavanaugh you try to take down the Trump Administration weaponize and the government when is enough enough and I think they're going to show up I Hope I pray they do\nWell what do you think about Hillary's endorsement of ah the incitement of getting in people's face and you can't be civil suit basically calling for civility you you can't really civil with the political party\nThat wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about and then the other comments made by people like Maxine Waters and others getting their base follow him into a grocery store is following the gas stations confront them chase them out of restaurants which we have seen going on and on a on a regular basis\nFor Republicans it is absolutely wonderful you know they ought to send an early Christmas gift to Hillary Clinton Michael ... Maxine Waters Jerry Adler Nancy Pelosi many of those individuals are calling for a the investigation and then teach men of Brett\nKavanaugh which Americans realize you is wrong and preposterous I could have certainly explain how in a legal basis\nImpeachment is not possible for Brett Kavanaugh but the more that these toxic individuals and all of the ones I mentioned especially Hillary Clinton are toxic uh the more that\nOnly drives Republican voters to the polls to make sure that these people are not ah in positions of power and will not be able to ruin the accomplishments of Donald Trump which you've been incredible you know in the course of two years he's accomplished more than\nObama did in eight years the greatest level of American economic growth and prosperity in modern American history and that is not\nJust made up there I mean the statistics demonstrate that and so if Americans want to maintain that prosperity 'em and add you know money to their wallets into private\nAh from government officials who loved to squander hard earned money from American taxpayers are their choices easy\nWell I did like Kevin McCarthy introduce which has a bill to fully fund the Trump border wall\nA the president has already spent about what three three and a half billion dollars he needs about twenty three billion dollars more to get the job done and I think that is certainly one of the big issues that Americans would be motivated to go out and vote for and the other I think\nYou know the president rightly said he could make as many as four more Supreme Court appointments that is a massive issue at this point it is it's a tipping point for the courts you know if you think of the AIDS and the health of some of the justices um ... there's no doubt there will be vacancies in the in the years to come in the\nNear future ... and don't forget showing that the circuits in the district court the Supreme Court gets all of the attention you know it's the sexy story the highest court in the land quite obviously\nBut his Greg can tell your most of these cases that are ... importance to American businesses American individuals' moms and dads out there are settled that the circuit court level they don't even make it to the Supreme Court and Trump had already has\nWas uh twenty six appointees to the circuit courts and there's a couple of more are getting ready to to be confirmed as well so this is a really big deal now um we have of course the Ginsburg seat or you know they could come open if Trump wins reelection bid may come open I ... and I say that Sean I'm worried I mean I mean it I'm actually\nWorried what will happen to the country if that seat if it gets very decides to step down I mean look what we just witnessed with cabinet can you imagine what's gonna happen if that seat comes open as a potential\nSix three conservative majority and the courts\nI mean it is genuinely frightens me at it and again that's not melodramatic I worry for my kids what will happen\nOf the United states in the hopes of getting something on tape but that might invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment those are the same Rod Rosenstein that is up to his eyeballs and conflict\nHaving written a letter and recommended the firing a James call me the same guy the signed the fourth and final buys a warrant that we should have on redacted in released the American people that hasn't happened yet and the same guy that appointed Robert Mueller\nUh why wouldn't you want to testify Greg Jared under oath\nWell he doesn't want to transcribe the interview or anything under oath or which chairman Goodlatte and others are demanding why\nIf it's not recorded or not under oath Rosenstein can do what he always does this leave and the lie with impunity without putting in self\nIn legal jeopardy too what Rosenstein really want to say\nOh you know Mr ... let's just you know I sit down and have a cup of coffee and we'll chat a little bit too if Rosenstein or July as as I suspect he might um he doesn't he's not looking at a fashion misleading statement to Congress he's not looking at\nPerjury because he can always deny the conversation ... ... remembers\nThe which which is why there's just so critically important\nWell they've got to do it a shot to subpoena him and they've got a demand to show up and they've got to put on my own and these answers to be given but\nUh I got to let you both go do the right great job Greg jar congrats on the successor the Russia hoax ... new book is out right now it Spygate the attempt to sabotage that Donald J Trump that

David the Pfizer warrant signed by a career law enforcement person\nSwearing that what you are presenting to the court is true and that you know it to be true and affirmed it to be true well\nThat didn't work out with the third renewal by the application in the case of Carter Page\nA which is the fourth buys a warrant issued but the fourth one that was signed was signed by Rod Rosenstein\nAnd we all know that the bulk of information that was put in the ... and ...\nWell that was based on the pony Clinton bought and paid for dodge the aid that not even Christopher Steele stands by to this day and that was never verified never corroborated and has turned out to be mostly debunked\nWhich is among the many other conflicts that Rod Rosenstein has of course he's the one that recommended firing Jim call me\nHe's the one that signed the visor warrants he's the one that appointed Mueller\nAnd now he was scheduled to appear tomorrow under oath and a two sources now telling Fox News at this hour\nThat Rod Rosenstein scheduled the parents before the house Judiciary Committee is at an impasse over the terms of the testimony\nAnd he doesn't want to\nHave a transcribed interview under oath which is the standard for congressional taskforce interviews\nAnd those close to Rosenstein say well he prefers a meeting or a briefing with the house Judiciary Committee chairman and other lawmakers where there's no paper trail where there's no under oath part well the question is why would he be afraid to go under oath\nWell here to weigh in on this and much more\nUh is this impasse continues Mark Meadows is the Freedom Caucus chairman and congressman Jim Jordan of Ohio also of Freedom Caucus member a end by the way would be in the house Judiciary Committee\nWhile the interview of Rod Rosenstein um we also have learned in the last three days Mark Meadows I'll start with you that\nWe now know that Lisa Page\nAndrew McCabe the deputy FBI directors under criminal investigation Lisa Page who is out at the FBI James Baker the top attorney at the FBI they all are telling the same story that Rod Rosenstein said that he wanted to surreptitiously record the president of the United states\nIn the hopes of being able to get him to say something that would allow them to invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment so we there's a lot of questions were Rod Rosenstein at this moment\nWell there are a lot of questions I think probably the bigger question is why would Rod Rosenstein\nOr not be prepared to come to Congress tomorrow to clear his name\nAnd I think the reason for that is there there are credible witness is you know your lead in had Rod Rosenstein voice saying well you know the needs to be facts and we have the rule of law well we're willing to to consider him innocent until proven guilty\nHim not coming tomorrow indicates that there is real credibility with these witnesses that suggested that he not only wanted to tape the president but he wanted to use those tapes a to effectively have a de OJ ... on the president of United States\nWell he met with the president apparently earlier this week and blue on air force one does anyone know what the result of that meeting was\nWell I think the biggest thing is uh Shaun is is I let's don't read too much into a flight on air force one and I think it's the president trying to be reasonable and hear rod side of the story I think the president has been extremely measured\nI tell you who's not measured at this particular point uh you've you've got Rod Rosenstein believing that he can hide behind the fact that he's the number two at the oj I can tell you got to people on the phone today\nOf twenty Seventeen or he allegedly said that he was going to record the president and now that we have a ... individual who's come forward and said he took it seriously after talking with page and I'm Mr McCain who came right from that meeting so look we've got to subpoena we've got to bring him in so we asked the question\nI Will take a quick break more with congressman Mark Meadows of North Carolina congressman Jim Jordan of Ohio and more on the latest why won't Rod Rosenstein answer these questions under oath will take a quick break come back we'll continue also more coverage of hurricane Michael pounding the panhandle [noise]\nDo waiting in line all those lives prominent believe if prop ...\nIs is Sean Hannity show was radio nine twenty ...

third buys a warrant and three people now saying that he's talking about taping the president of the United states and the contacts so possibly invoking the twenty Fifth Amendment what else do we need to get a subpoena for somebody\nWell uh hopefully I I Want I Would not encourage giving out anybody's phone number and you're great at holding people accountable but here's what I Would say\nIs the fact that you're covering it your listeners and the people that are truly tune in on a regular basis to listen to you [laughter] they need to make sure their member of Congress feels the heat and understands how important this is but the other part of that is is Gemini or trying to work today\nUh to to stress the importance of why transparency and and the fact that\nThe deputy attorney general must come yet\nHe must raise is right in and say this is what I did and this is what I didn't do anything shy of that uh really uh would would be an indictment on his credibility\nYeah what about the president now talked about the classifying and releasing the un redacted by the applications especially pages ten through twelve Seventeen through thirty for the final Pfizer warrant the one that Rod Rosenstein sign have either have you seen that particular Pfizer application\nI have not shown we need to see that we need to see the notes to take an after every time Bruce or goes in and talks with yeah yeah I remember Mr or told us that after each conversation he had with\nGlenn Simpson and Chris steel he would then contact person at the FBI and he would sit down with them and they would take notes we want to see all those notes of all those conversations we know they're at least twelve of those\nSo the so called real too as we need to see those and remember when the president first talked about e classifying well we'll ask him to do this three weeks ago he talked about any communications from Andy McCabe Easter page all those documents as well\nThat would include McKay number so we we need all that information\nAnd again if you're ... you're dead talks about\nOur great system of justice works keyed it at a trance parents he give us the information that we need to see more importantly the American people need to see\nWell do you want to call chairman Gowdy it's too old to two to five six zero three zero be polite please do oh two two to five six oh three oh\nA chairman Goodlatte is too old to two to five fifty four thirty one too old to two to five fifty four thirty one we'll put them up on Hannity dot com and again be respectful but I think with all that's going on and they should demand that he testify under oath\nUp thank you so much congressman Mark Meadows thank you congressman Jim Jordan and we appreciate your\nPush for the truth we need to get to the

poor people that did wrong in the D. O. J. face consequences\nRegarding fight that well he signed the final buys a warrant himself and then when he was talking about the rule of law speaking up for truth and Jim Jordan blasting Rod Rosenstein uh conduct now the president met yesterday on air force one apparently had a meeting not a lot of details about what went on in the meeting\nWith Rod Rosenstein there was talk about well he might be fired after it had been discovered that he was talking about well you want me to wear a wire\nAround the president and his answer was you know at least has the spin was well I was just saying that you wouldn't want me to wear a wire around the president and it was all in the tone and the cadence of what he said we have three articles in front of me right now one by Katherine heritage at Fox one by Sarah Carter won by John Solomon\nSolomon's article goes on former FBI lawyer plot to record removed Trump was not a joke and John Solomon let me read from the article don't tell for FBI general council member James Baker he was one of those that resigned that those infamous discussions\nAbout secretly recording president Donald Trump and using the tapes to remove him for office where a joke he apparently doesn't believe it and he yelled quite the vantage point as he was on the inside of the FBI bureaus leadership and may have twenty Seventeen when the discussions occurred and Baker told Congress last week\nThat his boss than acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe\nRemember ... and Lisa Page both took notes of the meeting and McCabe was saying yeah Rod Rosenstein had in fact said this\nAny way now James Baker is saying and Andrew McCabe is saying that in fact they were dead serious about about the idea\nOf Sarah surreptitiously recording the forty fifth president\nUsing the evidence to make the case\nThat Trump should be removed from office according to every source now in all three articles and Baker told lawmakers that he wasn't\nIn the meeting that McCain had with the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein and which the subject came up but he had first hand conversations with McCain and the FBI lawyer that was assigned to a ... page about the issue\nSo Baker talk to both of the un quote as far as Baker was concerned this was a real plan being discussed that the source directly familiar with the congressional investigation it was no laughing matter to the FBI remember then you can go back to what was the insurance policy to remove Trump\nIs this five months now into his presidency is this just before the appointment of the special counsel\nAs soon as Justin ... at that time frame around the media elite strategy that was occurring anyway so it goes on word of bakers testimony now is surface just days before Rosenstein said to be interviewed them private by the\nHouse Judiciary committee lawmakers that's supposed to happen Thursday\nThis week and the New York times first reported allegations that Rosenstein the number two at the department of justice has tried to downplay his role in all of this in his office suggested that\nHe thought the discussion was a joke that Rosenstein never gave in order to carry out any such plot\nAnd he doesn't believe the Trump should be removed from office but making those statements through a spokesperson is a bit different than having Rosenstein himself face Congress answer the questions under the penalty of a felony if lawmakers think he's lying and bakers account lawmakers this month clearly complicates and already complicated picture\nAs it relates to Rod Rosenstein before Congress\nAssuming he shows up put Thursday's interview but even more so Baker story lays ... extraordinary conversation and we go on from there and now we're going to really take our time with this issue today and\nWe're going to now begin to put the pieces of the puzzle together because what this is we're laying out here are the top people at the upper echelon member twenty five people have either been demoted fired or have left the FBI the OJ their\nUpper ranks here and James Baker is one of them and Andrew McCabe at least a page both corroborating what apparently now James Baker is set about Rod Rosenstein anyway John Solomon is an investigative reporter is what the hell\nRag Jarrett Fox News legal analyst and of course the seller of the number one book the Russia hoax\nThank you all for being with us I'm John let's just I Want to also put this in context for people because it gets complicated\nWe've got a first start with the pine lighten the timeline is may have twenty Seventeen well that's when Robert Mueller is getting appointed by Rod Rosenstein just before that we had people like ... Lisa Page and and Peter Struck talking about uh media leaks strategy\nThat had right it with the dusty a\nWhile it now appears that that was all being league for the purposes\nAnd they got rid of all it was was the dot CA recycled and different news outlets for the purpose of initiating the special counsel so would get appointed that we're discovering that they're even talking about Sarah ... taping the president of the United states so that they can remove him from office this sounds like a cool to me\nOr if there's one other event that occurs and that may timeframe that rarely I think you're a shockwave for this conversation and that was the termination of dreams go\nColumbia's the FBI Director of it all out all this Russia investigation to go on and we know now from ... in may they still have anywhere from a proving any form of collusion with Russia so they've been nine months out of James Kobe's let this go on for nine months\nHe's led to agents who have an anti Trump a virus read that investigation get fired\nAnd worked for natural reaction of all those who've been supporting dreams call me that the roses have a a Cape and a stroke page it's hey maybe we can remove this guy rather can't prove that he did something wrong with Russia maybe we can prove easily confident in well over a quarter\nAnd a and maybe try to take 'em out through the recording and the twenty Fifth Amendment\nThere's just not what the FBI were brought into the ... I'm ... ... talk about history his book lays out a real possibility that this was a soft crew right look at this we have the FBI they're not investigating a crime here that in fact they can't find a crime by a page\nAs well at least two pages testimony just to be clear she said they they had found nothing and nine months leading up to the point\nThat's right so they switch gears right maybe we can remove them through other means and and this conversation is so extraordinary ... it says that drama the FBI or twenty Fifth Amendment maverick vision the FBI being involved in it\nShe got the FBI and the deputy attorney general or allegedly have a conversation has it's a joke they say they're dead serious about it and they believe he was dead serious about it and it will matter which way it comes down is just another example of how far down the road the FBI\nWas beyond its core mission which is to investigate crimes stop counterintelligence\nAgain and again this has nothing to do with rank and file agents that all this this is John group of rogue power hungry upper echelon management types and if anything they took the the cases away from the field offices purposely so that they can involved themselves in these nefarious activities that's why\nIt really does explain a Greg Jarrett why every FBI guy I Know is so angry about this because they know was ripped out of their hands\nAnd this and all of them say that if this was them they know they get fired\nThat's right and in fact I interviewed former top officials or the FBI who are angry at people like James Comey Andrew McCabe James Baker Lisa Page\nPeters struck for ruining the reputation the good name of the FBI I wrote a column recently that said Rosenstein actions\nIn an attempt to ... the sitting president of United States\nIs the equivalent of an attempted coup not a bloody violent coups what's known and John refer to it a moment ago as a soft coup a huge dean and misusing their power in the law to remove a sitting president and so here we now have not just James Baker\nWho was told this was serious but the people in the conversation with Rosenstein who are Andrew McCabe and Lisa Page you said he was\nDead serious recruit people to invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment and secretly record the president to gather evidence in support of it uh Rosenstein whenever he gets caught engaging in wrongdoing\nClaims oh I was misunderstood he threatened the intelligence committee staff members in January first denied it\nThen it mitigated but said oh\nI was misunderstood he threatened Devon newness\nAnd said oh I was misunderstood and now in his attempted coup of the president of the evidence indicates he is saying oh I was misunderstood it was my words were misinterpreted it was just sarcasm\nWe got so much more to get to we're going to hold over ... Jared and John Solomon into the next out one other thing that we've got to get to an all of this we have now other revelations that have come out with everything that's been going on with Brett

FBI ideal Jay sources including a James Baker who is resigned and Lisa Page and Andrew McCabe that is now under criminal investigation all corroborating that Rod Rosenstein\nHimself was discussing wearing a wire\n... secretly recorded conversations with President Trump and hoped she'd say something that they could use and then in both the twenty Fifth Amendment and remove him from power Andrew McCabe telling that in and confirming that along with Lisa Page\nAnd go into the office of the general counsel James Baker he's corroborating all of this and uh they're saying the Baker's set it Baker and heard about it and the other two actually took notes about it at the time the other story that we're following is\nWe as a pretty stunning revelation and since it directly contradicts what the Justice Department\nAnd the FBI officials have set in sworn testimony but James Baker also telling Congress last week member of the law firm Perkins Kuwait\nThat's where Hillary's campaign that's where the DNC funneled money so it would look like a legal expense when in fact there was anything but and then they hired fusion GPS and research firm that went out and got hired by the name of Christopher Steele and he used his Russian sources to put together\nA series of papers they become known as the ... same dot CA that was never corroborated uh verify but used as a buys a warrant application the bulk of information to get a ... a warrant to spy on a Trump campaign associates\nAnd it gets worse than that it was used even though this information was not corroborated it was disseminated on all levels of government to propagandize on line to the American people in the lead up to a campaign and then it was used what now understanding to bludgeon\nThen president Donald Trump and to try and get him removed from office and creating a phony Russia Trump narrative that never ever had any evidence whatsoever anyway we found out that you know in the case of a ... coup either lawyers who've die by the name of Michael ... directly handing documents Baker told Congress\nTo Michael suspend handy to Baker documents\nAbout Russia's attempts of meddling in the twenties sixteen election other words he was a cut out a go between for Hillary Clinton the FBI knew he was a go between in this particular instance how the question is why did the FBI knowing all of this not stop it\nWhy did they lie about it in effect the application for the Pfizer warrant wiretap on the Trump campaign was done\nAt the direction of a political opponent Hillary Clinton and that's entirely illegal for both the FBI department of justice and Clinton herself and you have numerous officials that the deal Jay and the FBI have sworn under oath that nobody at the FBI or D O D J knew anything\nAbout the Democratic party being behind the Clinton dirt house intelligence committee chairman Devin Nunes saying on Sunday Now you have one of the top lawyers for the Democrats and the Clinton campaign\nWas feeding information directly to the top lawyer at the FBI so it appears the FBI and the Justice Department we're all doing the Clinton campaign's bidding and applying for Pfizer warrants\nAnd permission to snoop on the Trump campaign communications John Solomon and Greg Jared continue with us or anything I'm saying here that is wrong Greg Jarrett\nYou got out a hundred percent correct there was never any Trump Russia collusion the FBI and the DEA OJ knew if there was Hillary Clinton Russian collusion two people\nAre on her payroll the British by Christopher Steele who composes it totally fabricated phony document\nBased on suppose Russian sources and providing it to the FBI and the de OJ so they can launch the investigation is spy on the Trump campaign and now a second person on the Hillary Clinton payroll Michael Sussman or who is passing along\nComputer storage data as well as documents to the FBI and so this was the Hillary Russia connection and conspiracy to use phony opposition research to defeat her political opponent when that failed", "city": "Providence"}
