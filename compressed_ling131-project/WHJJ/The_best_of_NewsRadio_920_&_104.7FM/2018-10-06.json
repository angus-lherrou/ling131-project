is they do is they even they Connecticut Senator who himself has been the target of attacks from Trump the target of attention from the guy was flat out why or what do you mean the target of attacks\nFrom Trump trumped an attack anybody told everybody who the guy is and here is Sarah Sanders from the press briefing just now exactly as I said she got a question from John Roberts and it was all about\nDo you think that maybe the president shouldn't have done it marking her like that because you get Collins and Murkowski ended me in the way they vote means horrible you'd think the president for maybe should have not done it\nThe president was gaining the facts I frankly facts that were included in special prosecutor Rachel Mitchell's report he was skating facts that were given during Dr ... testimony and if it has to make a decision based on those facts\nAnd whether or not face the judge Kavanaugh to be follow five to hold a position on the Supreme Court every single word judge Kavanaugh said it's been\nPicked apart every single word second my second of his testimony has been picked apart yet if anybody says anything about the accusations that have been thrown against them that's totally off limits and outrageous\nExactly right ya can't challenge her so Trump did for everybody else who doesn't have to go ...\nTo do it Trump did it in yeah he's provide no little Shay and for some of these people to hide under [noise] and I'll guarantee they may be publicly saying she hadn't done it that's outrageous what prompted their thinking everybody he did it privately\nSomebody has to say it it's the freaking truth\nOkay back to the phones and we go to Tom's river New Jersey ... is next and he is Fifteen Years old from I'm Glad you waited you're next on the program thank you for calling\nHey rushed great to speak to you again\nA great to have your back yet\nIt can be on again anyways so I'm watching this whole thing on me too movement watching the Kavanaugh hearings I'm I'm Fifteen I'm just regular straight guy\nThat's into a girl but I think that I really cannot believe any of these women that pop up on TV anymore you can't believe any of them or come an old guy raped me the guy did this to me did that to me you know he had to draw on CNN while you are a couple of months ago saying that a guy raped her because he asked her for her phone number [noise] can't\nBelieve any of them and I think that what this this whole me\nTo get a white ... ever met on credit anyway at that that is my exact point I Believe that woman I Believe\nShe thinks she was raped when somebody asked her for her number that's how she's been conditioned\nWomen's studies on campus the the outright hatred for men you know I keep talking about it but it's relevant Casper McCann and this was back in the nineties she was a professor of women's studies at Michigan She taught women in her class the all sex is rape even the sex marriage\nWomen were lapping up and women have been taught for two generations now that men are basically predators and that their own kids are not safe from their fathers and it's not random it's widespread it is part and parcel of higher education today\nSo you have a woman and she could be acting I mean she could be making this up could be a political activist but it's entirely possible at the same time out from that\nThe cause of what she's been taught and heard on the news and talking to her she made all literally believe that men don't have no right to ask for her phone number is the same thing as bullying her raping her\nThat's my point she may really believed it\nGoes well rush of you know the same woman that are screaming about living rates are also the ones who want to have the right to having abortions it so they could have unlimited sex\nOr have you\nEver um a year right sex without consequences it but you better not\nBut then they claim that all men are predators but then they run to run hook up and then they want to have abortions for free\nWhen does their idea then everything's fine\nHooked on it if I'm not bitter ride by the way here's what does your\nAlso random it's not all women but it's been made to look like that isn't it\nThe me too movement supposedly include all women women on across America who do not think this way are being lumped into this movement\nAgainst their will\nIt's just an assumption that the Democrats and the drive by media or making I think I Am from you're young you're growing up I think you're going to be OK finding a woman but you got to be real careful about it just gets written permission for every move you might get it notarized after the dates\nYou are listening to Rush Limbaugh you voice on the right time but he I see Mitt for\nUse radio

I I'm sure they were it was either find people because they already had been interviewed\nBy the Senate Judiciary committee look the the the goalposts are moving faster than the speed of light here it's it's very difficult to that to believe that any of these people\nUm it it can take themselves seriously they said\nIt's going to be four days a week and now they're going I an artificial that time you know they were saying the FBI the gold standard there impartial\nThere you know she said that ... every Democrat that they now they're going up but Trump is evil puppet master controlling the FBI they're actually going to be as horrible part is an organization\nYou know it it it it is and it would be laughable if it wasn't a man's\nLifelong reputation here on the line\nHere don't want to do like\nTwo weeks ago as far as everybody else knew Brett Kavanaugh had an impeccable reputation that is now that's gone forever you know re Donovan famously one said after being investigated for a year and a half where do I go to get my good name back mhm well in this case\nI don't think ... ever gets back in many many ways I mean Clarence Thomas will ever be remembered because of the last minute accusations of Anita Hill\nYeah it it it's very discouraging although I have to say I I Do get some on there is someone who clerked for Justice Thomas and knows the why he he you know there's certain ... ... people who are going to just simply use that as their excuse to discount discount them because they disagree with in any way\nOn a key if someone who does ... incredible amount of perspective on that that judge Kavanaugh is a kind of person where even when he was on the DC circuit as a lower court judge\nThe Supreme Court they saw him as someone to really take seriously you know more than a dozen times like twelve to fourteen different times they've found now ain't vindicated his opinion they had a huge amount of respect for him I don't think that's going to change I think um they are not going to be watching this\nWith the same knee jerk or part is in response as I Hope that that that we're seeing some some of these people are ... but but it's\nThe parents' reputation now\nIf you read James Comey's New York times piece that he came out with the ... to me it's absolutely stunning and the things that he's saying because while the FBI's packet in the middle of it when we handled the Hillary Clinton email investigation while he was writing an exoneration himself\nPrior to the real investigation which didn't happen until three days before he publicly exonerated her um but then he goes on to trash the president at length\nAnd then he talks about FBI agents are experts which they are and interviewing people and quickly dispatching leads to their colleagues around the world to follow up with additional interviews\nAnd they will confront people with testimony and other accounts and you know yes the alleged incident occurred thirty six years ago but FBI agents no time has little to do with memory um which I found a little strange\nUm and then you know for example everybody remembers if it rained on their wedding day uh I don't think that's a ... in that particular sense maybe to somebody who is traumatized by could see that but for somebody that's not traumatized maybe not\nUm once they start interviewing every witness knows the consequences he says is one thing to have your lawyer submitted statement on your behalf it's very different thing to sit across from two FBI special agents and answer their relentless questions\nOf course the bureau won't have subpoena power only the ability to knock on doors and ask questions most people will speak to them but there is what he says refusal to do so is its own kind of statement\nNow I Want to just address that because my FBI friends my friends in the in the bureau special agents have all said to me never ever talk to the FBI unless you have a lawyer ever and I'm like why I'm\nSomebody who loves the FBI I don't love the upper brass under Khomeini and the cave and struck and page but the FBI is is the ... the FBI people I Know the salt of the earth people and I said out of course I Want to help him he goes no\nAnd then they say look what happened to General Flynn General Flynn is accused of lying to the FBI and the up here I didn't think he was lying to them and you just it's dumb to ever talk to any law enforcement without a lawyer that's what all my law enforcement people friends say because it's a crime if you lie to the FBI let's say you said\nSomething in the Senate Judiciary investigation and it doesn't exactly match up you could be charged with a crime of lying to the FBI it's ridiculous\nAnd you know the the irony that says hey look he he told me coming MO right now is just to try to destroy Trump with everything he can and it's just another another section in that play book but the Iranian exact same federal law provision\nThat says it's a crime to to lie the FBI is the one that says it's a crime\nTo lie to the Senate as their ... with their investigators it's not just you know a similar penalty is exactly the same statutory violation so that's just not they've been kind of pretending there's that that I guess playing a little bit on people's images maybe from the movies\nOf what the FBI dies to say that this is somehow it's going to be a separate different thing what they're really doing here is there going down the same list to people the Senate Judiciary committee had already talks to\nGetting the same statement in some cases they might get exactly the same thing because the FBI can't ... can't force and talk to them\nEspecially if all you know as I don't remember that I wasn't there they they could be dealing with taking the same exact statement from the same lawyers for the same the same individuals could that's ... that that is all we can no ... just because nature of the old investigation so the FBI isn't going to find anything new to hear that there there's my prediction\nDown there and I are you in that they they don't have any other thing\nThey've already moved on against the ... and and that's the one that came out in the New Yorker piece and you know ... that's the one we're even the New York times that said they attempted\nTo interview over the course of a week several dozen people they couldn't find a link a one to corroborate a story and then saying the mist Ramirez\nContacted a former yo classmates asking them if they were called the incident and told some of them that she could not be certain Mr Kavanaugh was the one who exposed themselves which at that point tells me you know what are they investigating here if she's asked for the other ... she's telling other people she doesn't know\nWhat are they investigating\nMore shocking thing is even right and it's you know right before\nThis whole um ... most recent face exploded I think it was the morning on of the vote she actually her lawyer was telling people she's not even still share it with him she said why did he was in the room [laughter] I'm positive he adjusted his hands but everything that so but I but I Can't say for certain it hit it\nThe biggest music festival of the year and it's coming to their senior\nDon't miss the iconic\nWash our must be I heart radio\nThe W.
