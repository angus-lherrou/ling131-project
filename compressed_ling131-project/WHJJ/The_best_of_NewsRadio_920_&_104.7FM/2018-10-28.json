Trump\nTo people who enter the United states without our permission or illegal aliens illegal aliens should not be treated the same as people who entered the U.S legally president's decision to end DACA\nWas heartless and it was brain was when we used phrases like undocumented workers we convey a message to the American people that their government is not serious about combating illegal immigration hundreds hundreds of thousands of families\nThe rift apart if you don't think it's illegal you're not going to say I think it is illegal and wrong and the thousands of American businesses who is hardworking employees\nAnd the argument them as the president is Americans do want to do the work wage jobs can't buy American workers to do the work is the president that is a crook in many instances it's just not true in my view\nFrom the citizen to end the DACA program or some eight hundred thousand young people in the current and most ugly presidential are\nIn the modern here three of this country I cannot think of one thing though which is ugly and more cruel\nWe've got to do several things than I Am you know adamantly against illegal immigration people has to stop him for illegal immigrants\nTo west Chester showed is that they can Nassau County stand in the street foreigners in Brooklyn or the French seem as if people waiting to get\nTo go to yard work in construction work and ... for [noise] you know any this is not a problem that the people who are coming into the country are solely responsible for counting if we in for them to\nKeep families\nAnd it will include a path\nTo citizenship what a bunch of ...\nAll of them almost partly as a matter of fact it is all the uh Joe is an L. O. J. what's up Joe how are you glad you called sir\nJohn ... the number one supporter of Donald Trump in the country I think he's the best president moral history he needs to send troops down to stop this invasion and I think you would agree with that we just can't afford to take all these people and we we have a Twenty one trillion dollar debt and so I Hope he will send troops down to stop this invasion of our country\nWill be nice of Mexico did their job and Mexico would stop them in their country and\nYou know now they're trying to precipitate a crisis that could be a really disastrous for everybody involved in this and yet you keep breeding reports that you know people are being take well taken care of well fed food and water you know the goal is to get them up to our southern border but\nYou know what's happened to the seven thousand is going to be ten thousand more is it going to be a hundred thousand more what do we know about anybody that is in this caravan you know they haven't come here because ... ...\nWell I think between and I've been saying this and I believe it I think between the horrible treatment of Kavanaugh the elimination of\nDue process and the presumption of innocence meanwhile they're silent on Keith Ellison and they're silent on Cory Booker and there's Tylenol Claire McCaskill's a husband between all of that hypocrisy and between the caravan and the mobs that were out all all over the place this weekend\nAnd the success and failure Obama's failure Trump's success I think that there's a lot to get people to get out and vote we'll see what happens in Fifteen days though Joe thank you eight hundred\nNine four one shown our number Brian is in Lexington, Kentucky Brian how are you and we're glad you called sir\nYes sir I was calling about the migration in the rush on our border and\nI Want to know your thoughts about who might be behind the scenes organizing is basically committing trees and then is that the Trump could find out where the FBI and you know maybe you need to look into that and find out exactly who's you know has to have this big plan now that we know what's going on\nWell listen we know what's going on we know that you know at the end of the day we'll find out where the money comes from that supporting some of those uh I understand you know America can't continue to support and prop up as the president has been saying\nAll of these countries that were given a lot of aid to and they're going to let people leave their country and come racing towards our border I'm all for immigration but it's got to be done orderly it's got to be done legally\nAnd you can have what do you know you can have seven thousand people just drop on our door and say take us into were horrible people uh especially when the only place they can seek asylum is the first country they get to that would be Mexico in Mexico obviously didn't have the will lower desire to do anything in this case\nAnyway

are said to be fighting for their lives victims of twenty minutes of terror this morning at the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh the suspect identified as forty six year old Rob hours trading gunfire with police now said to be in fair condition\nHi it's getting sicker every day I mean I noticed the same thing the Maxine Waters\nYou know you get a crowded you follow these people into a grocery stores in department stores and gas station do you tell them we don't want them here anywhere anymore you know telling Henry Kissinger to leave the country Mitch McConnell not only did they tell Mitch McConnell to leave the country\nBut then they're talking about the guy smashed literally ripped\nHis leftovers I guess just maybe it's taken a meal home to somebody else and throws it outside the restaurant door banging on the guy's table somebody\nAnd I get killed here you watch somebody is or hurt severely it it's going to happen then nobody on the left ever can critique their own side for the rhetoric they're using Anthony Scaramucci is with us I just finished cover to cover his ... brand new book\nUh and it's phenomenal and it's the Inside Story about Donald Trump has called Trump the blue collar president\nAnd how billionaire living on Fifth Avenue identified the struggle of blue collar Americans had won the presidency and all those are the forgotten men and the forgotten women in this country and I don't think they're liking this mob mentality I don't think they like to weigh judge Kavanaugh was treated much\nAnd I don't think they like watching this caravan of thousands marching towards our border\nI mean they they literally are mishandling everything and so we're with what's happening is uh the the president has almost like this light Sean like you know you and I were out on Long Island in the summer or parents would hang up that infect light\nWell the un has that the Trump Twitter\nInsect light and they're all going towards the light in their vaporizing a Senator Warren she's got to get a DNA test\nShe's less of a Native American and your mate into the vapors ... big caravan issue the way they're handling the care of an issue it's a galvanizing his base that Kavanaugh's thing was absolutely ridiculous they were making up one story after the next they figured okay me too movement seems to work there is no due process in the meat you meant\nLet's take this guy that's a very well credentialed judge\nOr he's got an impeccable adult life let's try to destroy him\nGoing back to Nineteen eighty one in Nineteen eighty two and so again right into the Trump Twitter\nInsect vaporize or so so for me I'm enjoying this the polls are tightening of and uh the president's base is actually going to turn out much higher percentages and people predicted in so\nOnce again he's going to defy logic here I think we are very good chance to possibly ah keep the house we're certainly going to gain seats in the Senate\nAnd it couldn't happen without the energy and the order tutors for a President Trump\nWell if they do it when I'll say this ... carrying a lot of these people on his back but\nKnow what I feel like Nancy Pelosi the dangers are what we're gonna have endless investigation higher taxes keep Obamacare open borders\nAnd the president is is battling back on all these ... and Guatemala Honduras El Salvador he says there or not we're not able to do the job of stopping people from leaving their country and coming illegally to the U.S now\nWe will begin cutting off substantially reducing the massive foreign aid we routinely give them and Trump tweeted out every time you see a caravan of people they legally coming are attempting to come into our country illegally thinking blame the Democrats are not giving us the votes to change our pathetic immigration laws\nRemember the midterms it's so unfair to those who come in legally and he's right um well and and we don't know anything about the people that are coming here we don't know when when one thing about them and I know the media can be a sympathetic because they want but you know who might mix it with the people that maybe just want a job is a big problem for us but\nBut it's but you but here's the other thing okay the American people intuitively notion that it's not just all it is is he or she is recognizing with a legendary built for even one set about any country\nIf you have a welfare state in the United states does have one you need to protect your Puerto Rico's free market forces dictate that people cross over that quarter\nTo participate in your welfare state and so\nEvery country has a strong border and so should the United states so I don't get\nA you know ... on on promoting my my uh my book that today in the last couple of days mom a lot of left leaning shows where they go they go nuts so crazy on the president's response all\nYou want to illegal immigration you have democratic and Republican presidents and democratic elected officials that have voted in the last I don't understand why just enforcing those laws\nHave everybody saw ... ... ... well could there answered by so\nWhy don't they well it's a lot of things are we better off economically than we were two years ago\nBy every single objective measure the answer is yes the growth of the economy consumer confidence jobs created the number of people leaving food stamps or out of poverty eight million Americans so you know by every measure and more\nBottom the bottom ten percent of the society shut the wages of five and a half percent according to the wall Street Journal over the last Eighteen months but as a direct result of the president's policies but also the fact that he cut the slack at the border\nAnd so he made it tightened up the labor supply and it's giving lower middle class families shot now have real living wages\nWell that's the story that you actually tell in the book by the way Anthony Scaramucci is with us author of the brand new book it's out today we put it up on Hannity dot com it's on Amazon dot com and bookstores everywhere it's called Trump the blue collar president I first heard that term from one of his sons of his either Erica Don I don't remember those Donnie\n... get on each call them the blue collar billionaire yeah and I said ... Don if you don't mind going to hijack the nickname and just switch out billionaire and put in President he's at the other day he resonates with these people for a reason\nYeah look I I I think it is and you talk a lot about his background you you talk a little bit about your family background it's similar to my background and and it's amazing because the only thing that I really care about what motivates me it's not politics itself it's not a game to me\nBecause the policies that we have in a country as we do now greatly impact whether or not people are on food stamps or whether or not there are jobs we now in two years\nHave us a scenario that is not unfolded in this country since Nineteen sixty nine and that is we have a million more jobs than we have people on unemployment you know that I identify with that that's what you identify with you you did not have any that are in your mouth\nAnd you know I started as a dishwasher at twelve and and look what you started I you know\nSean Sean list that I mean I think that's the message and I think that's the reason why you saw credibly popular at the end of the gay America is about aspiration\nIn America is about passing the ... the the baton to a next generation of Americans that can do better than ourselves and that's what our grandparents did for our parents and our parents did for you and I and and the cat that the right policy shift of white\nFree market based motivating market incentive policies because what we both know is that you cannot system the ties\nOr through a political system created equal outcome it never happens black markets crop up and then there's a thin layer at the tippy top that are living better than everybody else and everyone else has devastated whether it's Cuba or Venezuela place like that\nYou know the real danger so I don't know how this is all going to play out but we we see all weekend long these mobs you know really making ... an unsafe environment for anybody to even go get a bite to eat if you're a public figure which was really sad I mean when you're doing it in front of people's wives\nIt's not only sad it's pathetic when you're going after Pam Bondi Sarah Sanders and our kids and\nSecretary Nielsen and all she do all they're doing is trying to sit in a restaurant and have something to eat telling you know one group of Americans they're not wanted here in any way what are you doing here get out of this you know they're going after an a Ninety year old guy Henry Kissinger now who served his country with honor and distinction\nIs that it seems like there's no limits here but there's no moderation left either ... the Democratic party it used to be I I used to think Democrats at least they on paper they said they cared about the American working men and women but apparently they don't\nHave to losing the argument then you have to suppress the other side's argument in other words if you're wrong on the facts and your ideology is going to create\nUnequal outcome so you know bad society uh even though it sounds great on paper all of your ideas when they lose contact with reality or disaster for a country a person a citizen then you've got to suppress the voices of the other people it's happened to me it's happened to me on a college campuses\nIt's happened to me I'm Around the country when I'm traveling\nI'm cool with it I'm up for the fight of it are both the you know when you know what's great about the people just want you to think about Ninety five percent\nOf these professors Sean or liberal but about forty five to fifty percent of the kids are conservative so they're not buying into the ...\nAll right stay right there by the way the books phenomenal I read it cover to cover Anthony Scaramucci is one of those Trump

in the great state of Arizona Fifteen days from now glad you're with us twenty five to the top of the hour that was and they put out by Martha mix Sally a war hero and her background or experience is pretty unbelievable here also watching and Arizona this caravan\nAre headed right towards our southern border it's become well a big big issue\nWe have a couple of things that have literally taking the people of Arizona back first instead of a once calling Arizona the meth lab of democracy and the people of Arizona crazy a inviting Arizona State university the radical attorney for the blind shake yeah\nThat blind shake involved in the ... the what the bombings that America um she had no problem with Americans joining the Taliban\nMartha McSally confronted her in the recent debate and said well you apologize you would not apologize and accusing troops of torture and that's only part of it and then on top of that we have the latest development cinema once attacked BS stay at home moms for leech off their husbands\nThese women who lack like staying at home leech off their husbands or boyfriends and just cashing checks to some sort of feminism because they're choosing to live that life is fairly judgmental you would think\nMartha ... with us ah Martha how are you\nA sign I'm doing great thanks for having me on\nWell I think I'm happy with the last two polls one had you up by seven want to do it by two ah but ah I frankly after these latest revelations in the last two weeks about Christ and send them I Would imagine that you're opposed to going to go higher\nShon well it it's unbelievable every single day a new part of her radical passed and her mocking Arizona and extremism and so many issues as being an earth\nBut the Arizona local media is protecting her a and making excuses for her and so the only way that filters down his shows like yours are are turning it into a TV ad\nAh the fact that she's still hanging in there is\nReally ridiculous so out of step with Arizona value than American values you rattled off a number of uh a number of things that would have a Senate committee disqualifying in the past\nBut here we are right down to the wire over eighty percent or around eighty percent of people will vote early over half have already voted and so we need to make sure that the messages out about her radical out of step past this qualifying statement\nYou know compared to nice to have been twenty six years in the military and defending our freedoms that are way of life\nWhat did you do in the military I Know well you served abroad post nine eleven correct\nAnswer I was a a ten pilot I was fortunate to be the first woman in us history to fly a fighter jet in combat uh and then the first to command a fighter squadron and combat I've had\nSix deployments to the middle east and Afghanistan a hundred and twenty five combat hours in a tan ward hog again saving American lives on the ground and defending our way of life it was an absolute honor of my life to be able to serve\nYou know when you hear Christian cinemas say oh it's okay at that point what I Believe it was two thousand and three that oh it's okay if Americans want to join our enemies the Taliban and nearly died a\nSean when I when we heard this I I couldn't believe it I mean I was deployed on nine eleven or the Taliban harboring al ... who can and killed three thousand Americans since then with them and their affiliates they've killed thousands of American troops\nTo include your truthful I was deployed over there I've told this story before but we would at Bagram Air force base when I was a commander\nA we would you know we would get out there as soon as we heard a firefight was going on and we'd be overhead to protect them in our eight ten but oftentimes ah you know the the the firefights happened before we could get there and Americans lost their lives\nAnd as we would we would line up on a taxi way as they ... the flag draped casket with come through and there is no this is science there and everyone is leading giving our final salute to these American heroes\nWho perished over there fighting the Taliban and their affiliates\nAnd for her to be able to say that she's OK with an American going to join the Taliban to fight against us I mean that in and of itself should have had her suspend her campaign", "city": "Providence"}
