until the final report\nRight our to Sean Hannity show toll free number is eight hundred nine four one Sean if you want to be a part of the program what we played their Rod Rosenstein you know for people that did wrong in the D. O. J. face consequences\nRegarding fights that well he signed the final buys a warrant himself and then when he's talking about the rule of law and speaking up for truth and Jim Jordan blasting Rod Rosenstein uh conduct now the president met yesterday on air force one apparently had a meeting not a lot of details about what went on in the meeting\nWith Rod Rosenstein there was talk about well he might be fired after it had been discovered that he was talking about well you want me to wear a wire\nAround the president and his answer was you know at least has the spin was well I was just saying that you wouldn't want me to wear a wire around the president and it was all in the tone and the cadence of what he said we have three articles in front of me right now one by Katherine heritage at Fox one by Sarah Carter won by John Solomon\nSolomon's article goes on former FBI lawyer plot to record removed Trump was not a joke and John Solomon let me read from the article don't tell for FBI general council member James Baker he was one of those that resigned that those infamous discussions\nAbout secretly recording president Donald Trump and using the tapes to remove him for office where a joke he apparently doesn't believe it and he ... quite the vantage point as he was on the inside of the FBI bureaus leadership and may have twenty Seventeen when the discussions occurred and Baker told Congress last week\nThat his boss than acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe remember ... and Lisa Page both took notes of the meeting and McCabe was saying yeah Rod Rosenstein had in fact said this\nAnyway now James Baker is saying and Andrew McCabe is saying that in fact they were dead serious about about the idea\nOf Sarah surreptitiously recording the forty fifth president\nUsing the evidence to make the case that Trump should be removed from office according to every source now in all three articles and Baker told lawmakers that he wasn't in the meeting that McCain had with the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein in which the subject came up but he had first hand conversations with McCain\nAnd the FBI lawyer that was assigned to a ... page about the issue so Baker talk to both of the un quote as far as Baker was concerned this was a real plan being discussed that the source\nDirectly familiar with the congressional investigation it was no laughing matter to the FBI or member then you can go back to what was the insurance policy to remove Trump\nIs this five months now into his presidency is this just before the appointment of the special counsel\nAs soon as Justin ... at that time frame around the media elite strategy that was occurring anyway so it goes on word of bakers testimony now is surface just days before Rosenstein said to be interviewed him private by the\nHouse Judiciary committee lawmakers that's supposed to happen Thursday of this week and the New York times first reported allegations that Rosenstein the number two at the department of justice has tried to downplay his role in all of this in his office suggested that\nHe thought the discussion was a joke that Rosenstein never gave in order to carry out any such plot\nAnd he doesn't believe the Trump should be removed from office but making those statements through a spokesperson is a bit different than having Rosenstein himself face Congress answer the questions under the penalty of a felony if lawmakers think he's lying and bakers account lawmakers this month clearly complicates already complicated picture\nAs it relates to Rod Rosenstein before Congress assuming he shows up for Thursday's interview but even more so Baker story lays ... extraordinary conversation and we go on from there and now we're going to really take our time with this issue today and\nWe're going to now begin to put the pieces of the puzzle together because what this is where laying out here\nAre the top people the the upper echelon remember twenty five people have either been demoted fired or have left the FBI the OJ their\nUpper ranks here and James Baker is one of them and Andrew McCabe at least a page of both corroborating what apparently now James Baker is set about Rod Rosenstein anyway John Solomon ... investigative reporter is what the hell break Jarrett Fox News legal analyst\nAnd of course the seller of the number one book the Russia hoax\nThank you all for being with us I'm John let's just I I Want to also put this in context where people because it gets complicated\nWe got a first start with the prime light and the timeline is may have twenty Seventeen well that's when Robert Mueller is getting appointed by Rod Rosenstein just before that we had people like ... at least a page and and Peter Struck talking about uh media leaks strategy\nThat had to do with the ...\nWell it now appears that that was all being league for the purposes and again we're we're all it was was the dot CA recycled and different news outlets for the purpose of initiating the special counsel so would get appointed that we're discovering that they're even talking about Sarah ...\nTaping the president of the United states so that they can remove him from office this sounds like a cool to me\nIf there was one other event that occurs and that may timeframe but rarely I think you're a shockwave for this conversation and that was the termination of James\nComey's the FBI Director ... allowed all this Russia investigation to go on and we know now from ... or wherever you're from a proving any form of collusion with Russia and nine months out of James Kobe Bryant is gone provide marks he's what\nAgents who have an anti Trump a virus read that investigation he got fired and what's the natural reaction of all those who've been supporting James Comey writes roses are McKay and a stroke page\nIt's hey maybe we can remove this guy you'd rather eat can't prove that he did something wrong with Russia maybe we can prove easily complement him will will record him\nAnd uh and maybe try to take them out to the recording and the twenty Fifth Amendment\nThere's just not what the FBI were brought into the wrong track record talk about history his book\nLays out a real possibility that this was a softer right look at this we have the FBI they're not investigating a crime here that in fact they can't find a crime by a pay\nAs well at least two pages testimony just to be clear she said they they had found nothing and nine months leading up to the point\nThat's right so they switch gears right maybe we can remove him through other means and and this conversation is so extraordinary ... it\nSays that job at the FBI or twenty Fifth Amendment never envision the FBI being involved in it\nShe got the FBI the deputy attorney general or allegedly our conversation because it's a joke they say they're dead serious about it and they believe he was dead serious about it and it will matter which way it comes down is just another example of how far down the road the FBI\nUh we got so much more to get so we're going to hold over ... ... and John Solomon into the next one other thing that we've got to get to an all of this we have now other revelations that have come out with everything that's been going on with Brett Kavanaugh\nThat the FBI ... make it more clear now than ever before that Hillary Clinton really through what is just she's a tour eyeballs and everything being the sole instigator of the entire Russia gate scandal that only paying for the dot CA\nAnd there was a great piece by John Solomon last week and investors business daily also laying out all the evidence\nA chilling indictment of how this political criminal not only managed to escape indictment but was somehow able to weaponize the FBI and the de OJ all to destroy your duly elected president President Trump and last week the ... of course we have the FBI general counsel Baker reporting\nDirectly to former FBI Director called me telling congressional investigators that an

if you want to be a part of the program\nTo big breaking developments as it relates to the biggest abuse of power a scandal in American history one\nHas to do with the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein member he recommended the firing of combing number two we was the one that that recommended the special counsel Robert Mueller number three is also the guy that signed the fourth financial advisor warrant\nIn other words the third renewal application on Carter Page a Trump campaign associate\nWell now we have information corroborated and confirmed by three separate high ranking FBI deal Jay sources including a James Baker who is resigned and Lisa Page and Andrew McCabe that is now under criminal investigation all corroborating that Rod Rosenstein\nHimself was discussing wearing a wire to seek alert secretly recorded conversations with President Trump\nAnd the hope she'd say something that they could use and then in both the twenty Fifth Amendment and remove him from power\nAndrew McCabe telling that in and confirming that along with Lisa Page and go into the office of the general counsel James Baker he's corroborating all of this and uh they're saying the Baker's set it Baker and heard about it and the other two actually took notes about it at the time the other story that we're following is when\nHe was pretty stunning revelation and since it directly contradicts what the Justice Department\nAnd the FBI officials have set in sworn testimony but James Baker also telling Congress last week member of the law firms Perkins Kuwait\nThat's where Hillary's campaign that's where the DNC funneled money so it would look like a legal expense when in fact there was anything but and then they hired fusion GPS in our research firm that went out and got hired the name of Christopher Steele and he used as Russian sources to put together\nA series of papers they become known as the ... the same dot CA that was never corroborated of I used as a buys a warrant application the bulk of information to get a ... a warrant to spy on a Trump campaign associates\nAnd it gets worse than that was used even though this information was not corroborated it was disseminated on all levels of government to propagandize on line to the American people in the lead up to a campaign and then it was used what now understanding to bludgeon\nThen president Donald Trump and to try and get him removed from office and creating a phony Russia Trump narrative that never ever had any evidence whatsoever anyway we found out that you know in the case of a ... coup either lawyers who've die by the name of Michael ... directly handing documents Baker told Congress\nTo Michael suspend handy to Baker documents\nAbout Russia's attempts of meddling in the twenty sixteen election other words he was a cut out a go between for Hillary Clinton the FBI knew he was a go between in this particular instance now the question is why did the FBI knowing all of this not stop it\nWhy did they lie about it in effect the application for the Pfizer Warren wiretap on the Trump campaign was done at the direction of a political opponent Hillary Clinton and that's entirely illegal for both the FBI department of justice and Clinton ourselves and you have numerous officials at the deal Jay and the\nI have sworn under oath that nobody at the FBI or D O D J knew anything\nAbout the Democratic party being behind the Clinton dirt house intelligence committee chairman Devin Nunes saying on Sunday Now you have one of the top lawyers for the Democrats and the Clinton campaign\nWas feeding information directly to the top lawyer at the FBI so it appears the FBI and the Justice Department we're all doing the Clinton campaign's bidding in applying the poor Pfizer warrants\nAnd permission to snoop on the Trump campaign communications John Solomon and Greg Jared continue with us anything I'm saying here that is wrong Greg Jarrett\nYou got out a hundred percent correct there was never any Trump Russia collusion the FBI and the DEA OJ knew it there was\nHillary Clinton Russian collusion two people are on her payroll the British by Christopher Steele who composers it totally fabricated phony document\nBased on supposed Russian sources and providing it to the FBI and the de OJ so they can launch the investigation and spy on the Trump campaign and now a second person on the Hillary Clinton payroll Michael Saltsman or who is passing it along\nComputer storage data as well as documents to the FBI and so this was the Hillary Russia connection and
