saying this could be this means that or something is leaving behind a trail\nAnd unknown trail in it and I don't know if it's communication with some some guys will be fuel it's burning or what have

Mark you're on ground zero\n... thanks for taking my call that a lot of sound bite their governors sounded to me like an old dial up modem modem trying to communicate\nWell with an old dial up modem it was a it was the the sensors that are picking up where they say is a rattle under a under Antarctica and that's what they are picking up it's rattled but some are arguing that what it is the wind blowing across the snow or the ice and that's why we're getting that sound and others were saying it may be from something else completely because\nThey've been receiving these neutrinos signals and they didn't know what they are so something is active in an article something is active in space right now they're shutting down the telescopes and there and they've been they've they shut down you too for temporary period of time to get something they didn't want us to see went on in space last night was going on right now in space\nRight but uh but I yeah I don't think it was a mother a month or something else other than that and the train those uh that's like a radio wrote Peter sounds to me you know\nI was just bizarre I think it's bizarre that that that's the sound uh that uh they picked up on and and while it's in the science journals still you know geoscience journal saying well this is what we think is some seismic waves were picking up on others are saying well this is this is sending is like you say this is like a repeat or\nSending something that was certainly a is bizarre especially in the coincidental ... been going on in the past three days\nBut I'd like to us the single going into that coming out it's the same and the strength\nTo do anybody anybody can take the said don't and they could speed it up or slow it down to see if there's anything inside the stigma because I used to have a guy who he would hear signals he'd say well let me speed it up and see what I get it needs to be to have all this like rpm and you'd get all these weird sounding side band voices going on\nSo or the you know whatever they said that could be I get really even slowed down side band or a span upside banned it could be a lot of things at the moment though they're saying this is what they're getting these are seismic waves or they could be the wind and they're not sure are they saying it could be under the cross or it could be something blowing over the crust to create this type of\nAh the sound uh it does sound very much like something out of preventing planet and sounds like somebody be from an old Nineteen fifty science fiction film\nAnd uh once again I I played it and uh I get I'm getting worried that when I played it I got some jamming going on so I don't know if they're trying to block green from plane is I mean what's going on and I'm kind of

structure in front of the sun\nI thought that might have something to do with all this\nIt it's one of those things that we get out into the the ... that's for sure that something you know that they were looking into it sunspot certainly connected to this we we we never know though I mean sunspot shut down and then all the telescope shutdown\nWe have the rover shutting down on Mars and then we have YouTube shutting down so he's telling me the Amazon shut down and I don't know what that's about it but maybe maybe something else is going on maybe this is some sort of a test maybe I don't I

what's going on mainstream media is not going to talk about this\nCertainly aren't going to talk about it and and we got to get used to be ideal they're not going to talk about it and just because
