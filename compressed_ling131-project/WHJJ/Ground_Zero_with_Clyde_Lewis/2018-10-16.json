Bush when he was in power it's obviously did that\nAnd a bronco bottom of the same they were able to ... him as well they pop it in a mall or the only difference between them and Donald Trump is Donald Trump's stubborn Donald Trump stubborn and he doesn't know how to play the game of ah you know the deep state politics which is a dangerous thing for him and he doesn't care\nBut what I worry about it as if he doesn't care how does that fair with the American people and what would the deep state do to try and change all this while we've seen what they do they they mail rice in out to a out to people to scare them\nThey uh they they go in and they they do these are classic hits you know of a of a noted officials may kill people involved with a certain insight into ideology they that's how it works sixteen states in control so whenever you say about politics however I lean left writer or upside down I don't care\nI Know that there is something above it all there is a sin are above it all but certainly as controlling this country and is trying to control the world so all we're arguing various ah you know or arguing a over various ideologies that we don't like or that we're thinking we're leaning towards you know the conspiracy\nIs there to metal in the affairs\nOf nations all over the world that are struggling to keep their sovereignty and this is why there are few oligarchs\nAre willing to buy up and support chaos in the world\nAnd this is why we're now seeing in our major cities gang violence mob takeover in radicalized factions within separate strongholds and we're also seeing is on the Internet as well where people can't help themselves but to try and be mean to one another because somebody has a different ideologies and they do\nInstead of being a little bit more open a little bit more willing to talk things out you see the warning of a major collapse the United states is not being heated and it's going on right now because there's so many of the radicalized factions and they're quick to blame each other for the problems in the country and not the bad actors on the world stage they wish to see American cities burn\nAnd that's what they want to do they want to see American cities burned the truth is there are many Americans\nThat have been touched by the secret hyper power who wants to further the coaching covered his seizing of world controls against the wishes of the majority\nThe psychological damage has been done to this country\nWill take a generation or more to change that as a people will stop and realize they've all been victims of mass hypnosis brainwashing propaganda it's allowing for raw emotion to get in a way of ultimate truth\n\nIt gets in a way of friendships in family uh relationships it's dividing marriages it's dividing man and woman is that\nIf it's dividing political allies it's dividing it all\nThe deep state has always been\nA refuge for rogue intelligence operators\nThat worked for many of the countries that we have said that we said that are they they are our allies we said these are these we allied with these people but yet they're real good intelligence ops that work within our allies the groups that say that they were friends but they've succeeded in developing ways the heightened suggested abilities that subservient in the world\nAnd with the failure of the fourth estate\nAnd it controls that are now in place has been crucial in creating a warm climate politically motivated violence politically correct speech political dismissive talking points political fanaticism manufacturing racial tension for political gain pseudo science or feared lack of goal resources\nAt a whole hell of a lot of fear and mix up we have a whole held a lot of fighting going on [noise]\nAnd I got to admit to you I'm damned tired tonight you know why because I spent my weekend\nReporting about riots in my hometown of Portland, Oregon [noise]\nI was here over the weekend they add another brawl between patriot prayer and an anti FAA [noise]\nMy my my producer Ron was in the middle of it almost got pepper sprayed I mean come on this is America right [noise] yeah [noise] and who's who's causing it's ... it's the political divide everybody's divided well why the hell do you think you're divided\nWhat what finally [noise] ah [noise]\nHow the town of Johnston plans do you mainly captured that wild turkey that's been outsmarting officials they're the most popular Halloween candy through the years and four more chances of winning a thousand dollars or downloads news trafficking weather starts Tuesday Morning at five on news radio not twenty and one of four seven ...\nSous I'm rich Dennison President Trump toured storm ravaged areas of the Florida Panhandle and Georgia by air today\nHow clean pictures but it's hard to believe when you're above it airplane\nLast week storm was blamed on at least a Nineteen deaths one or two suspects who is now in custody after four men were killed in the town of ...

the inconsistencies of what politics are doing right now and then sometimes you'll say well what Donald Trump is doing is really kind of silly or what\nWhat's going on now is you know as I said the other night I said you know what Donald Trump spoke to a bunch of ... and he said here's the deal if we don't get the Senate there's going to be violence okay and then Hillary Clinton goes well I'm not going to be civil and you don't have to be civil to a government doesn't represent our values so basically what we got here is you've got a\nWar of words we're like I said no longer terror or or or no longer are terrorists the thing we worried about we have to worry about now our fellow countrymen and whether or not our fellow countrymen are gonna rise up against this and this is a product of what we're in the middle of now they just take it at least Eighteen years or Seventeen years to foment\nAnd and it just seems to me that uh when all of this happened the open and then there's some our future with war rumors of wars and all this we're we're actually contributors to the division we're having now and the idea that people feel like well one side this way one side of the other way and I'm not going to play either side nor am I going to\nHave some critical analysis of what I've what each side is saying and each side basically are destroying the other and and no one knows why it's

mean what are your conscious of it or not you can say that doing this\nDividing and fighting is anti liberty it really turns out to be very difficult for the media to understand her except that is why they say well we have these guys over here that are out right and we have these counterprotesters me All right they never say who they are\nI've never I mean maybe I can find someplace by every time I have never heard anti far being spoken up by the media\n\nAnd you know the only ones I hear about are Proud Boys in anti ...\nBut he's also others and you know\nWe have to learn and we have to

but I think the next one coming up is all of a sudden we're destabilized with this tape state marrying involved and all this Trump is going to be put himself in a situation where he's going to say we're going to hold off on elections and we'll just carry me through until we stabilize country\nWar so this is what they thought Obama was going to do this where they thought George Bush was going to do they didn't do it so you think the Trump would be stupid enough to suspend the president but\nNo it's not stupid if you think about it well the way that most you got most of the American public\nI
