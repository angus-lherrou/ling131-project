...\nWell basically what it was a ... back in two thousand is seven I'm\nAlways looking for a new idea for a book and I thought about doing well on on the ... forest UFO landing case in England in

said that\nThe guys in the government to the department of defense who told him that the rental ... case was basically like a fabrication using holograms and mind altering technologies and whatever [noise] um he said that they were actually part of a program that was trying to or is it was sort of looking into the angle\nOf the UFO phenomena and being demonic rather than actual terrestrial than bay and so basically he told me the story of how he met two representatives of this particular group um\nAnd there for a number of decades bank quietly and carefully\nInvestigating um the whole issue of the UFO phenomenon and trying to put threads together um to as vice or at least um to confess I'm the idea that this was demonic no one is I Confess I'm\n... pretty much made up they would paper
