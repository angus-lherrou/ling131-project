you waiting for\nEye on radio station\n... even as evidence grows ... Fox News President Trump calling in another case of guilty until proven innocent\nA condition to take place this outbreak and the fact that it was so surprising in my opinion is proof\nThe diseases are evolving into the FDA Andy CBC or having a hard time keeping up with the evolution of diseases down I Would tell you that bacteria\nAntibiotic resistant bacteria is one of the biggest problems we're facing right now as a nation because many people are getting more so in other problems or a flesh eating disorders\nBut a warning went out\nAbout this increase in uh the AFL this acute awe blasted my light is\nThis has been a significant increase since twenty Seventeen\nAnd a worrying perpetuation of a disease which there is little understanding they don't know where it's coming from the why it's happening\nAll the cases that were announced exceed you of being confirmed and twenty two states\nUh surges babble help officials who announced a change in the way the agency is counting cases they also wanted to raise awareness about the conditions for the parents can seek medical care if their child develop symptoms absolute positions could quickly relate reports of the potential illness to the CDC\nBe increasing cases\nAre started happening in twenty fourteen the CDC was tracking this but every year since then usually in August or September the CDC is logging a spike of it a spike in between ... virus but it it's a ... the ... the spikes are significantly high right now\nAre back in twenty Seventeen the C. D. C. report a bit of child died from this disorder and since the visuals or been able to say I've been able to determine how the view spread\nIt is\nThey're starting to count suspected cases as well as confirmed to better anticipate increases over the coming months so uh I can tell you know it's\nToo early to know whether the total of twenty team will surpass those the previous years but the data is showing a substantially larger number than in previous months this year\nSo\nAnd and the bad thing is is there's no treatment for it\nLong term outcomes or a crap shoot\nAnd what happens is whatever this is you know and we were talking about things like equal and several lightest we're talking about all these other disorders that are certainly affect the brain and the nervous\nSystem this affects the nervous system especially with a specifically the spinal cord\n\nNeurological conditions like you'd have a variety of causes such as viruses environmental toxins and genetic disorders among the case is under investigation\n\nAre basically there are five reported to the Maryland health officials in recent weeks a health department spokesman said that Maryland's first case was reported September twenty first known cases have been reporting Virginia or the district this year but there were three confirmed cases in Virginia and twenty sixteen and that's what health department officials upset\nNow we know that\nMedical science is continually making rapid advances we've got new medications treatments all these things are developed\nAnd they're introduced at a rapid pace our with supply and demand I often come to play the possibility\nThat pharmaceutical companies can cut corners and they get very sloppy\n\nNow we're always assured that the my the FDA or buy health organizations that our system for screening\nUh is superior than most are are drug screening as superior than most are vaccine screenings are superior than most\nBut now can be argued that I after Jay consequences are not necessarily the fault of the doctor but it may just be the fall of the manufacture of these medications or\nWhatever it is re introduced into the system we're looking at a toxic environment of drugs you talk to the environment of vaccines kids are reactive them in various ways I don't think the CDC or the FDR anyone would come forward and say that perhaps a vaccine caused this\nOr some other drug\nI mean we know our biological systems are constantly evolving\nAnd it would go by scientific hypothesis we also surmise that disease causing organisms are evolving too\n\nAnd so this raises a lot of questions and a lot of eyebrows about whether or not treatments in pills they kill the ills are killing the patient or in this case\nCourting and Tara viruses that cannot be altered\nAnd like I you know we look at biological systems all biological systems ... disease causing organisms and\nAnd of course the victims of people they all they they evolve and they adapt sometimes they've all been adapted for certain diseases don't bother them anymore they run its course it's kind of like a virus that runs its course it doesn't say it goes dormant for a while and then comes back with a vengeance but right now\nWe need to start understanding the evolution of what is happening and how can make a big difference\n\nIn how we treat disease\nI mean the evolution of disease causing organisms they outpaced our ability to invent new treatments and it may even al ... or ability to ease pain and suffering\n\nAnd I can tell you that it it appears\nThe failures of the passive given wait for the most unexpected successes and some of those unexpected rises or rate raising\nHim disease and biologically altered diseases as well\n\nNew problems of course in ...\nAnd this new paralyzing disease is harming our children and we know the accidents related to carry a medication in particular multiplied\nAnd we begin to worry about health care and health care professional we we hear about drug induced I after Jenike artifacts\n\nWe hear about adverse effects or even adverse drug events we hear about adverse effects from vaccines and the minute you bring this up somebody says I didn't know you were the anti vaccine or they start ridiculing you\n\nBut just think about all the accidents that all the mistakes that have been made\nWhen the pharmaceutical companies don't evolved with people and don't have all the ... would be a diseases that are coming of or now either we can say that this is all being plan\n\nWe can say that it's all being done for the call the aspects and for the for the eliminating the flock but\n\nYou're not helpless to fight it you're not helpless to stop it you're not help us to a new new things to make yourself better\n\nAnd and so we have available\nMany things that they can put us uh in in a situation where we can\nBuild our immune systems we can build a well you'll be all all sorts of things that we just know\nThe right things to eat the right things to do is write supplements to take the right drugs I mean\nI I worry now because uh I've heard before\nWe were hearing about the the biological weapons we're hearing about the biological attacks we were hearing about\nMosquitoes actually infecting people and giving them you know equine and several light is or giving them some sort of a eastern equine suffer white as for some other a disease that affects\nSpinal cord with a brain or hemorrhaging or what have you and I don't think anybody is is pushing the pandemic button yet\n\nAlthough we are right now the doorstep of the new flu season and I would hate to think that the virus would attack a child\nAnd give them an ... virus a polio and on polio virus to paralyze them\n\nAnd so a word of warning that it just seems to me the diseases\nAre evolving now whether we're giving them the point where whether or not we're giving them the push is another story whether or not environment is giving them to push\nIs another story whether or not drugs or after Jenike artifacts or things of that nature pushing it but it just seems to be\nMore and more ... these cases seem to happen more and more in the flue last year killed eighty thousand people eighty thousand people [noise]\nIt was because of an ineffective vaccine and a lot of people who took the vaccine or got the vaccine were the ones who saw the flu evolved into a very deadly form of pneumonia [laughter]\nAnd kill people killed eighty thousand people last year that is a lot of people to be having die from simple flew [noise] and I worry about these children that are getting these polio viruses [noise] but he's totally like\nAttacks and the CDC and the FDA and all these other groups don't understand how they can treated or get rid of it [noise]\nIt's once again a history of evolved pathogens evolve viruses evolve diseases that we have not evolved\nGone and so there's a lot of [noise]\nThere's a lot of a worry and

six seven three three seven hundred pharmaceutical companies are not keeping up with the evolution of diseases and they're not keeping up\nWith pain and how pain is evolving as well so what they've done is their teaming up with advertising agencies they're creating public service announcements and they're and they're basically pushing\nCertain attitudes ideas about vaccines and drugs now selling that you get you know he is trying to outsell trying to sell your ability to heal yourself and the reason why is because I think as we speculated last year ... bio labs have\nCreated these new superbug superbugs super diseases evolve into something else we have a respiratory viruses out turning into an in terrible virus\nWe have a flu virus that turns into a pneumonia that kills people\nOkay\nAnd so everyone working in the pharmaceutical industry cannot help but notice that it's undergoing a vigorous\nEvolution we're going through an evolutionary period that only for help but for the pharmaceutical companies\nAnd much has been written about how you do pharmaceutical companies will need to change and how they are offering the public uh\nIneffective drugs ineffective vaccines in effect the ineffective I observe Jenike artifacts basically with the cure kills you know CBO affects instead of placebo which do see boats no benefit at all\nAnd show which is why I I think it's important we should talk about this\nWe should bring this up because I I think that a word of warning should go out\n\nAnd if you have you ever have you have a compromised immune system I Would say use your judgment and and and perhaps use your better judgment maybe get a flu vaccine I I'm not sure I don't think ... vaccine is for everyone but after what I read about what happened last\nYear and how people who've gotten the flu vaccine eventually had floated evolved into something else\nI'd be really really really suspicious of its because you can't sue the pharmaceutical company\nRock Obama put that the law says Baxter International course was one of his major contributors and back to international courts makes the flu vaccine several other vaccines are of course we're being pimped in pushed on the American people for the longest time\n\nNow here we are with everything they tell us get your vaccine get ... get ... get busy and nothing's working\n\n... none of our children are now getting and Tara viruses non polio internal viruses or they first start out as a respiratory illness and then they're paralyzed\nSame thing with its EPA why did you start getting assuming of cigarettes and your paralyzed who to gain a function exercises where people are getting rice in sent to them\nWhere they end up getting sick and and they end up uh you know it's like\nWe're in the middle of this right now we don't even realize it's happening but the CDC says well this is happy we don't know what to do but will tell you about to watch your kids to make sure they don't take up the symptoms and get them in all by the way the way to prevent it put on something put on some sort of a mosquito repellent so they don't get bitten by mosquitoes\nBetcha speak volumes to everybody should that especially when we talked about this before and how it's being done\n\nThe mainstream not going to report this to you they're just not\nThey'll report it probably eventually but Dr reporter like were reporting it and they haven't been following it says we've been following the clay decks exercise\nFrom the beginning to what has been happening and slowly but surely the game to function exercise viewed everybody's sick or to get in a certain group of people sick and the idea that using DNA from these twenty three and Mian ancestry is to sell to places like GlaxoSmithKline Pfizer\nSo they can use DNA to basically zero in on certain DNA types of diseases\nAnd treatments they have to do this because the evolutionary process of pain and suffering is evolving out of their hand and the and the CDC and all these other groups they can't keep up you can't keep up and get something is making us all sick\nI'm from hard to breathe it was it was pneumonia

know like I'm a pneumonia some kind\nOr\nWe look back at some of the medications that have been used by the public that have led to\nA lot of bad effects of Philip am I a situation in the Nineteen sixties I Believe was one of the perfect examples of a sedative ... it was anti knowledge of medication medication pregnant women were taking in pregnant women who use the drug costs serious congenital Mao formations and their babies\nNow today they're still drugs that are on the shelves right now than when misused or when they're taking responsibly can cause accidents and you can get anything from the justice and tolerance to dying and that's why they call it I after Jenike artifacts\nAnd physical dependence can happen with the chronic use of any drug including many prescription drugs he would've taken his instructed physical dependence of itself does not constitute addiction but often accompanies addiction\nAnd it stinks in many people cannot or discern the distinction it's difficult to discern\nParticularly prescribe pain medication switch the need for increasing don't you know such as actually represents tolerance or worse thing underlying problem as opposed to the beginning of abuse or addiction and I've always learned as a general rule but if you're taking a pill to kill the pain you're dependent if you're taking a pill after the pain is gone you're addicted\nBut if you're taking your pills as directed in the paper says your body has gotten used to them over time or the worst case scenario would be that the drug companies are doing the equivalent of watering down the alcohol and I've always talked about that as well be advocacy\nOf of a pain medications I Believe the yo yo wing of the doping mean is what is causing the opioid crisis and so what we're getting is adverse effects were getting opposite expectations outcomes it becomes a no CBO effect\nSo called pandemic of opiate overuse may be seen as a as a no see ... no no CBO effect itself\nTonight and I'm going to be a spoiler 'cause I don't really give a damn about the TV show it's called ah the Connors are used to be Roseanne on ABC Roseanne it said that in the show they were going to kill her off\nThere were a killer off the program a with an opioid overdose they did it they actually killed her off\nFor an opioid overdose everybody said how does how do they know how do they know they're trying to cover up the fact that she's spoiled is for everybody weeks ago and I basically had said well if you're following the Roseanne program she was actually are in need of knee surgery and the show\nAnd she'd been taking pain pills from friends and others and having a stash around the house so it was a given that it would kill her off\nBy giving her an opioid overdose and see this is the thing that bothers me about the opioid the opioid problem in the opioid overdose in and out of the opioid overdose scares that they're giving everybody and that is if you are addicted or if you overdose on pain medications it's a moral failing\nPeople will have you believe it's a moral failing of propaganda will have you believe that you're ... you're an addict\nWhen you're not\nAnd so the killing off of Roseanne with an opioid overdose in my opinion is exactly what they were expecting is exactly what was going to happen [noise] and uh and that's why it was done\nSo tonight I wanted to bring on a friend of mine who uh I've I'm I'm not sure we haven't had him on a long time\nBeen Fuchs and he's a registered pharmacist\nUsually nutritious and cosmetic chemist and has been\nCompounding custom medication formulating nutritional in skin care products and consulting with doctors and patients just graduated from the University of Colorado School of pharmacy in Nineteen eighty six distributions recognizes naturally for his work have you on air pharmacist nutritious hosted the bright side radio program Ben Fuchs welcome to ground zero\nHey try talking again love doing this so you are so darn intelligent Clyde thanks you [laughter] I ...\nI really appreciate it and so so bad and I mean what is it with a propaganda when the world today making people who\nAre using pills for paying give it get making them or treating them like moral a pariah I mean that's what they did an Roseanne denied they actually killed her off the TV show a said she had opioid addiction and she died of an opioid overdose boy what why are they doing off\nHer twice sex for you I answer a pool according to his father you know people are so silly ... it's just ridiculous how we have this idea\nThat a world ... people for whatever their behaviors are OK to captains Persians on others or whatever their behavior is back to the human body is hard wired the date that she substances as hard\nWired especially can be an ... substance that are already inherent in it and that's opiates are they are analog bio chemicals that are already in your brain so when you take it home and say that you have to pay ... and you take opiates and opiate tell what all immediately happen is your ... your brain was down regulate\nThe production of its own in ... and you'll in Athens become decision by taking artificial opiates you'll end up in ... which will puts you in a state and there's a there's a ... fry it and you almost impossible to reason\nNow I Know that I Know that we have a a sort of a psycho social context surrounding the patient Dr relationship the patient farm Mr pharmacist relationship\nBut yeah I I think people that tend to ignore the fact that you know right now if you're using opiates you you become pretty much a ... you become a dark and NPR why we're what's that or\nYour award your award at the same yeah you belong saying you belong to the medical model and that and they love that yeah well now what you're saying you're hooked on August ... you have to go to the doctor you have to go to the armistice even if even if it's that need a doctor pharmacist shopping\nYou ... your spouse and you come to be a part of the model of paradigm once you get on a city that wants to get on the drug ... shut illegal drugs too by the way that help people get that's how dealers and and a drug drug dealers gets you hooked on heroin\nAnd that's the truth out you know one of the thing I did a show one time about crocodile\nAnd it was interesting because ah I was talking about he was cheap heroin and that many people that look very attractive to use this cheap heroin and uh I was saying you know be aware of crooked deal because your kids may be using it and blah blah blah blah blah and boy did I have an education I had people\nOh me all over the country in their sixties and their seventies\nSaying to me that they were addicted to heroin and that they are they're the ones that ... that the main worry about that the that uh they said you should be worried about grandma and grandpa or have gotten their pain pills taken away from them\nAnd they have to resort to using heroin or they have to get heroin and they're good like a really low dose of heroin but if they can make cheap crooked deal in their kitchen it'd be more than happy to do that get rid of their pain and the stories I heard were heartbreaking stories of like a guy\nCalled me and said I was in a motorcycle crash and I was in a lot of pain and the doctors gave me my medication

Spanish civil war maybe after the stash wore\nA ... a day or a lot of Mexican starting to come over here at the end the old car that twenty century and they brought marijuana with them so marijuana ... identified with Mexican immigrants and this was around the time of alcohol prohibition and\nA government got his great idea to uh to uh\nTo throw it in marijuana wall with alcohol and we really complain about marijuana nobody really knew what marijuana marijuana was back then but uh they made up and they created the campaign around reefer madness idea if you smoke pot you would go crazy and there's just a funny movie now wasn't funny on called re from ... to talk about all set up\nA ... but they couldn't make it illegal because it was a plant so they had to do is to create something called the marijuana tax act which I don't know if you heard of that a\nTax act a ... put people in jail for not declaring their marijuana\nThey put a tax on marijuana ... didn't declare tried marijuana and taxes on it you go to jail and then the Nineteen seventies they actually completely ... with nations war on drugs they actually completely may marijuana illegal and it's been illegal ever set but the fact of the matter is\nIs that people have been smoking pot straight through prohibition or not and our draw our jail are ill\nWith people who are they are simply because they were selling or smoking or possess marijuana\nAnd like you said earlier we created at least a police state around are around people are just around people who simply want to get high whether it's through\nA marijuana our psychedelic or even with opiates why don't why don't we don't have a prohibition against alcohol we know that marijuana clogged I'll tell you\nThis is the thing that uh you know and and for me I guess it fits be apart from a lot of talk show hosts are most young conservative radio stations because I live in Portland, Oregon where of course it's legal or both recreationally andme additionally to to to uh use marijuana use cannabis and um what's really funny is that when I was a teenager\nA and of course one of the rights of passages that in some in some areas is to actually smoke pot\nAnd ah when I did and I was a teenager I smoked it and of course Scott Hi a couple of times but I never touched it again it was funny is that uh you know after you know you make a pact with you so I'm not going to touch this is not good for me to do this I think it's good for my body to do this then I got cancer right and uh when I got cancer\nIt became a so difficult\nTo actually a deal with the law did every day the feeling of a\nA foggy had all this stuff felt bad and one of my friends came by and he says hey I Want to have you tried something I looked at it oh no no no I Can't do this and he says what's wrong he says by so I did it in high school it's silly you know no big deal I'm not going to\nAnd he said no give it a try ... uses and and then he was a guy that it was just completely out of character\nFor him to suggest to me\nThat I should try cannabis and so I did and uh it it it basically took the pain completely away and he was not like some psychosomatic deal where you know some of your ... helped me that that came to me because I was totally against the idea\nAnd I I certainly changed my mind in one of the things they found that in studies with older people who have had these hang ups about uh things like a cannabis that\nThey ah let them use CBD Oil Somalia does it as an elite meant on their joints and ever ... ever since they've been given it or if they're given it to end brownie form or an edible form\nThey find that it's far more preferable to the side effects they get from a using a kind of a a a a ... an opiate\nAnd so that's the problem is that it has such a bad rap and drugs for this country have such a bad rap scene other countries in Europe in England places all over the world they they treat or
