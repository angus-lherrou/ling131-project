also tend to look at the numbers in words and the new American values in order to try and interpret the words God has given them through contemporary basis and\nSee the other night or last night I I'm just a lot of about blurred together there were those who are trying to\nTell me that the Internet it's six six six WWW fix exit what that is is that it's\nYeah it's kind of a B y ... type thing\nAnd so I was thinking that if people are going to call the show and they're going to bring into the mix this idea of six six six or the idea of six to ... I thought it was time to\nBring it a few things and talk about a few things and talk with a few gas because in recent decades the private in philanthropic sectors have carried out experiments using mathematics and other Kodak's defining detect technological signatures in frequencies\nOf what could be extraterrestrials or could be God or could be any of those things I mean you look at what they're doing at CERN you'll go they're doing the the way of computer I mean\nThey take these numbers in inner jurors they take\nMathematics even consider the number pi for example three point one for this number equals the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter\nAnd it's interesting the philosopher versus the days of ah the tigers\nHe and many other ancient philosophers thought of numbers is having a higher reality above and beyond the physical world\n\nI don't know if anybody has seen the movie ... movie Nineteen Ninety eight this is one of the films that in all of its confusion touched me to the very core spiritually because it was chilling that an independent film had such an impact on me and my balancing between science mathematics and God pie tells the story\nI'm a mathematician named max he's working in number theory and his work attracts the attention of a sect of Orthodox Jews strongly interested in neurology and the mathematicians computer turns out there's two hundred sixty three digit number\nThat apparently has some special powers significant the orthodox ... believes that one particular two hundred and sixteen digit numbers properly translated he's the true name of God and as soon as a mathematician has found it and the struggle for control of the number of ... a coincides with the map\nPetitions own descent into madness so the number two sixteen\nIs the sum of six to ... to find the cube of number acts we'd raise the number ... to the third power or the component of three making it\nSix six six six times six is to sixteen\nIn the book revelation chapter to actually tractor Twenty one for six to sixteen [noise] we read this and he said to me it is done I Am alpha and omega at the beginning in the end and that will given to him that is a first of the fountain of water of life freely\nNow what's the most intriguing is if this voice of God Speaking from the cube meaning that it is done I'm the opposite omega beginning in the end equals to sixteen and full reduction English or ...\nSo voice of God Speaking is the sacred number of two sixteen or six cube decoder key in the biblical tax has a relationship to the number two\nSixteen and the cue ... six six six and this is the key\nThe cube or the black cube was cute but that was found in the holy of hobbies\nNow I Know one man that knows a lot about this black cube and uh we wanted to come on ... quite a recording us where the Ryan gave all of course veteran radio personality the secret teachings on the program was that we bring them on right now Hi Ryan how are you\nI'm doing great quite as well I'm Glad to be here thank you very much for having me\nSo I'm sure you've looked over a ... my notes for tonight and you have your own notes oh this is very important because I think people are beginning to see that like we were talking about the arch of bail and how that has a representation that it was directed during the time to a vet Kavanaugh Ford are discussions\nThat it represented sexual perversion uh the killing of babies and sacrifice\nNow we're getting into the numbers game are getting into numbers and we're getting into a what is coming maybe a a footing of war in the future and these numbers are all adding up give us an idea of what the black Cuba is and what it represents and how it is\nSort of a a a voice box or recorded for what is going to happen\nFirst off on the subject of ball or bell ball or bell in relation to sexuality is interesting because ... is a fertility got down to act of the black cube if we look at\nReligion and we look at history we fly if we find the black ... all over the world we find the Jews used the black Cuba called the capital and a little kid where they have a piece of paper inside of it with a prayer on it\nWe have the holy of holy and Solomon's Temple the perfect cube we have the ... is a black cube located centrally within all ... all around the sacred site of Muslims that mecca\nAnd then we have the cube in a modern day Azerbaijan which has a fire cult I'm an area where there was a fire called\nA and historical days and that Cuba's representation of those fire deities so you see this throughout a religion you see this throughout history but when you start to break the cube down it takes you into more magical and more a cult\nStudies and one of those studies is the study of what is called the magic square so you have each of the seven classical planet that has its own magical square which is derived from the number of that planetary intelligence and it said that each of these intelligence is has a\nForm of consciousness that is free from the body free from flash it's immortal ended assists and all things that are\nThat are of God if you will and so physical son is typically broken down for example into the spiritual Sunday intellectual sending the materials ... and then the Hebrew ... ... you have a mix of Muslim and Jewish belief there\nThe intelligence of the sun is called ... which is a name and got metro area equivalent to one one one the spiritual son is known as so Ross\nAnd that's new at that numerical value is six six six and both of those numbers both of those spiritual essence is\nDerived from the magic square of the sun which is a square with six columns and six rows\nEach line all of the numbers in every direction add up to one one one and every row every line one one one time the six\nColumns in rows equals six six six so that is a number of the sun than there of course there's the magic square of Saturn which is a square with three columns and three rows each line adds to the number Fifteen and numerically the number Fifteen if you look at that numerically and apply it to\nThe ... when you count to ten and just start over again one to the republic Seventy nine\nTen is one again and so on and so forth a number Fifteen become sick so Fifteen Fifteen Fifteen for each of those three lines equals six six six and that's where we get\nThe magic square of sat there and ... six six six Saturn is the father I heard you and Alex Jones earlier today and you mentioned Jupiter and it's interesting because Jupiter is Jew Peter and Peter is Potter father as in the dark father or the dark lord the lord of the rings Saturn the black cube is a representation Clyde\nThe material world and it is on the hero card both the

triple W. dot the secret teaching style and\nAnd the secret teachings focus on the elevation of the soul spirit from materialism the four corners of the earth the cube the square\nTo a ... if you will\nIt is a form of transcendence a form of al chemical trans mutation and when you look at religion you find in Judaism to black he was warned by Jews known as the capital in an Islamic has known as the ... in mecca and you can also play that through ... law\nAnd then in Christian belief and obviously all throughout the world you have to cross which if you fold the cross up ... fold up into a

fallacy of the challenges and so\nIt is the goal of the outcome is to transform the base metal led into gold or to slay the grade beef and achieve in late ... through this trans mutation and so what all this means\nIs the base metal is the base shock rough and through that rising of consciousness that some called the ... students are able to transmit led into gold known as the ... and the rising of this consciousness is the movement of the solar spirit through the seven spheres or gates\nI Will live and everybody else will be subservient to me but and that is ... and\nThat is true and and you

where we get as you said Christmas ... a celebration of Saturn Saturn's also a fertility God kind of like ball or bell right and I think one of the things that's very very simple and important to recognize about all of the things that we talk about ...\nOr that yes a character like Saturn is a symbol of death and destruction right but again it's a necessary evil it's unnecessary destruction and there are those that don't see it in a balanced way by bringing together both of those opposing forces in the super imposed star of David or the heck's\nWrite it you know it's a graduation process

I mean sure a lot of ... street maybe dark a lot of problems she may not be good but there's always hope that as a lead with it as well and I correct\nOr I think the hope is the real thing and I think the ... the minds of men are given hope and working for a positive future we can we can make major change in the ... and what's happening right now in the world and it's not like we're\nNot we're just one person or whatever\nWe can work together on this and we can make big changes of the skull or you know when you some people see it they say they don't think of it as something positive because they have these thoughts and their mind about a scars but when you see that especially in the Mitchell heads ... and you see the workman ship and the love that went into it\nAnd that uh it just there's a special energy that you you can you can feel the energy and it's a it's a really really neat so that's what we do\nYeah and every time I mean this is an amazing ... this is the one that ah I've always admired for its work which ship how beautiful it is and the power it certainly possesses who sends through\nAnd uh with the power in the room we have tonight and what we're feeling it's certainly a is inspiring a and\nAnd I guess for people who know nothing about the schools why is this crystal skull so important and why is this president so important in the room tonight\nWell it's a considered one of the ancient skulls and\nLike you say the skull stores knowledge for everything it's seen been around for all the years and so uh it's believed to be a rich ... of mind and it is ... mind has been programmed by the ancient masters with the knowledge of the universe so\nUh it's it's here and it's it comes through it's very very a shuttle but very powerful\nYeah certainly I'm sure it has a lot of

he has a lot to say about my that's what I Would I think it'd be interesting to hear what he has to say\nOr even a drop out let's go to let's go to jump right no job you there yes I'm here\nAnd it's good to have you on the program Vancouver being on the program with us we're here with the bill and of course the crystal skull or tell us about your interest in how your interest began in this in this subject\nWell it began the emotional experience in Nineteen ... listed the Nineteen Ninety four I met\n... well at least I didn't know what it was but it turns out to be a crystal called at somebody put in my hands\nAnd a ... disclosed eyes are asked me to feel last pilot to cry like a little baby\nAnd that was a reason to stop a ledger and he goes why would a grown up guys are crying is something he doesn't know what it is and it turns out to be a crystal skull as interesting because of those are all temporary crystals called it was not a lot of that ancient walls is a lot of information and\nYou may understand that I couldn't do anymore\nThat is how I started to search to wheat and it is interesting in that time develop any fissile calls route and so on the Internet ... which was the first of all I'm that it appears\nThat Michel ... is the all I'd had this fascination that one day I Would need an angel and just a ... to ... thousand tests on bill and bill came for the conference that the\nThat I co organized and that is what I saw this call but in the meantime I Would be studying calls I'm trying to understand that was interesting what you were saying about the ... the black box\nUm but ... is that's the name of that\nLike ... like you know\nUh because the key words\nI think as soon as you start working Lewis crystal skull is consciousness yes you were mentioning that's absolutely true you also work with material that calls for a mother earth so it links and to the earth but it also links into the fact that the ancient people\nOr putting information in a system is while the best systems or you are without technology where you can put in isolation and that is quite right or they use these ancient courts as a storage of inflammation that'd be now try\nTo access and a lot of the interesting things and that is is\nWho we have not being very successful yes there are channels and that it is and that are that is far more information and officials call so people are searching for how can you access even this information because and Michel ...\nContains Charlotte's inflation I remember a story of a company which which a company was working with the courts and they were putting inflation into this tiny piece off artificial and crystal\nAnd they say that it is science over ... chicken put almost whole life very\nWell and you imagine\nAnd looking at the ... Michel ... how much information that can be an adult brain no human brain that can really get all that information\nSo I think the reason why there are so many crystals called out to the mall nuns asked to give people the opportunity to train\nSuch as what we had with the idea of the photograph or the or the or the digital recorders these role in technologies that came from the original preschool for many original port and so it's important to understand that some of the ancient technology like what we find in the crystal skull not being utilized in our technology today\nA doctor

feel in so far about what we're talking about that I mean there are many people coming to students like\nPutting their hands up against the skull and feeling the power I mean these are experiences that I remember one time I had my hands there crystal skull and king towards the\nEnd it in when I walked away from him move towards me so for some reason I had this magnetic attraction to the school is that it does that signify anything in your opinion at your magnetic personality I [laughter] I\nI don't know eight certainly a happy a completely mesmerized\nAnd baffled I'd never\nAh had an experience like that with any inanimate objects so to have a school moved towards me after I put my hands near it um it it certainly had the healing power and uh\nYou know I remember when we first had the Sean Roscoe in the studio I was not convinced that this would be anything you know worthy because he was with the school itself is a visual thing okay and we will be doing a a ... will be doing a lot of it will be doing a Facebook\nLive so you can see this but it it is a visual thing or you have to see it to believe but first of all then to be near it is to feel it and that is the second part in many of you are not going to be able to feel it and then comes the idea of communication and experience\nIn that comes with both internal tell a path big feeling and spirit\nWhich of course you get from it and of course tonight we're going to also bring about the new technology with the old black cube\nSo we're going to have the best of both worlds here and and bill I'm so grateful for you to

said that's okay she said well I'll bring it over and she set it on the table and the [noise] the people I was with with the kind that see things and everything and they were saying\nYou see that the alien oh you see that ship you see this and I'm going uh-huh\n[laughter]\nYou know we really well when I don't agree [laughter] property ... shop and I I always say bless your heart [laughter]\nHa ha ha ha ha ha I\nSat with my I'm On the ... the dumb rest to adjust to sail and put my head in my hand and I thought I close my eyes they'll think I'm doing something profound and\nThey leave me alone because I don't see anything in this thing and I but you know just so the next thing I knew\nI so so I sleep because I had this noise snoring\nOh have you know how do I get out of this so slowly opened my eyes and they were saying that was wonderful that was terrific and I guess it was [noise]\nAnd they did you hear that said ah it was still on a tape recorder and I said what did that\nCome from thinking I was definitely asleep and they said that she said no that's not me it's not even my voice and they said no it's definitely you and\nWhat has happened as I thought I had fallen asleep I'm so much of this information to pull it out through a couple of tapes without stopping and um I was totally freaked out actually it\nWas you were to channeling you were traveling a yes or no just go\nTo a that kind of situation I'm used to being sort of in control of the semi and control are giving my commission and allowing a ... none of that has happened today it was just boom\nAnd um that that was my first introduction and a semi seemed to be happy because it started to give its history and I was not happy and so okay it's goodbye we won't do that again\nBut right now to get what I I remember I was in fact one time I went through a trembling session and it scared me so much like throw away the tapes of the recording I look back and I regret that now 'cause I remember was so amazing\nYou know some of the things that are my ... my body did they have on tape and like just the terrified me to the point where I didn't want want anybody to see it nor do I want to experience that again but now looking back I'm thinking if I matured\nUnderstand what this is an hour an hour to operate\nI I Belong back to the time when it happened to me and ah would which would have kept a recording but maybe somewhere out there somebody's got a recording of recording some of my old shows what it was something definitely the traveling aspects are are are really amazing what can be done through the human body for human horse\nYes absolutely so that that was my first initial I'm meeting with the skull and um\nThen they asked me to go back like two months age I said no no no no\nNo and then sent me had started calling me which struck up a friendship and and she was saying oh if I wanted to see you Dale and to to come up and sent me cold you jumped [laughter] I\nDid go back a second time and I said okay I Know what you're about so I didn't look at it I I kept my eyes off it and everything and [noise] and Sammy said well let's see what the scholars say today\nPuts it in front of me and I'm not looking I don't get involved and\nUm the people that had come what kind of expecting something and I said I'm Sorry but I Can't I don't know how to do you know\nThere won't be anything\nTraveling on command and starting to do well even though I may ask you to do it later Sobhy\nRestaurant accepted I put my hand on the skull and that's the last thing I remember\n[laughter] on my bike [laughter]\nAnd so I said semi I you know I Can't do this and I can't do this anymore is this is a tricky for me and a look at all these things you said anyway it went on for many many years and I they\nAre being me I I like to prove it and I don't know if I told you about the storms so they had this panel of experts\nCome there was a physicist a scientist a medical doctor and somebody else and they would be all out and touch me she things and um\nTo see what happened you know basically it was fraud if it was fraud and but I think anyway they\nThey during the session they said the instrument you're working with um you told us that this could be used to control the weather so we'd like to see that demonstration and it said oh OK storm\nSo within minutes\nA storm blew a lot of really bad stone and then it said stop stolen went away so when I came back they told me I thought well that's good that's that's some kind of proof the next time we were up there\nSaid well that could be coincidence has been through it again so they asked for them you know to coach showed a storm again or do something and it said the yes control the weather\nRight and that we have put my hand up didn't even say anything it started to rain really hot and we had some Sonoran lightning\nAnd a pretty significant that they all took notes and everything all recorded and uh when the scarlet had enough of it it said stop and it did within\nYou know unusual amount of time minutes or the ... time [laughter] it cuts carols that yeah that could be coincidence to you know this guy\nThat I mean and that's one of the reasons why I Love you so much is because you know well you know you talk about you know these experiences you also weigh in coincidence you where you and the practical nature of it all and you're very or you have a critical analysis\nEven of your own work which I think is amazing Terrell Davis weren't take a break and then like I said I'm afraid we can do to communicate with the scope and like maybe in parts some wisdom to was from the skull on the program tonight so it'd be nice to hear that from you so stay tuned Colonel Davis where the ... one of my favorite people I always say that 'cause like every time I talk with er it's like I just enjoy\nWell ... around the kiss\nThe experiment was done many many years ago and face a plus it it will just kind of [noise]
