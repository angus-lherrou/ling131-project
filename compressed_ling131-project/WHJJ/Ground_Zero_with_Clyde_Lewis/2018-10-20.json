the meeting over time to the word I mean they changed which it was replaced by source ricin hopes that it would affect the authority\nOf the commandment into some it's not changed and the meeting\nAt all is just some\nIt just partly why witchcraft I think it's become a sin in the eyes of most Christians however today we're seeing a mix of both religion and witchcraft being practiced openly by women and men and a few hints that perhaps some of the old pagan imagery have\nNot left some of the major churches\nAnd and so tonight I thought it'd be interesting to explore a some of these themes and and the reason why is because well I mean last night I think kind of a tip the hat to it when we were discussing the ... sea and how means in vigils means something in how they're being used\nTo it it kind of a ... a form of I guess rich ... kind of form of witchcraft or new form\nOf witchcraft which I think a is most certainly a prevalent today so\nA new book\nThat I have in my possession a fantastic book called sorcery the indication\nOf strange thing is is written by Thomas shirt and now we've had Thomas shared in on the on the show before he lives in Ireland he's amazing we've had him on the show to comment on all things called all things bizarre and I think it's really a pleasure in ... it's an awesome opportunity\nFor us to kick off this season to talk with Thomas about his new

as social engineering political in corporate pathology\nAnd on the called foundation surrounding the emerging years of the third Reich in recent times his work into ancient mysteries and sacred locations has been featured in some of the world's largest media outlets and he's a highly sought after public speaker around the world we have him tonight Thomas shared in welcome to ground zero\n\nHigh tide delighted to be here again\nIt's good to have you and like I said ah it it's it's just amazing to be able to have you in such a time I mean\nAs I was explaining there seems to be like this shift in attitudes towards I guess you could call it conjuring attitudes towards what would be considered darker magic or some of the darker arts why do you think that this is starting up now why do you think there's a newfound interest in this\nI think people only brought these ideas for all kinds of reasons I think\nYou'll have people who will be drawn to choose things like social stairs there's a sense of that there's an insecurity within society you see that happening in Brooklyn tomorrow at these these wages are going to bind cabinet is other people look at things like you know\nQuantum physics and these ideas that reality is malleable to a certain extent and that\nThey will they literally wanna test these ideas and they want to say well you know is it you know is the five cents reality is it malleable is it\nKinda change it can alter towards my will and still the only effective mechanism out there to do this as things like magic and so people are drawn to us for that reason as well I think also there's a there's a kind of a maturing going on at the moment at its oil is living in the age where\nYou know people look the especially in recent years we've seen like the behavior of the major religions and the crimes of\n... of the Catholic Church and other organizations have been exposed quite readily and people to set themselves at these guys are appalling things and here they are telling us that you know which ... evil so\nIt'd evil really considering the source was coming from and then I I think that's got a lot to do it I think a lot of people have a kind of a hunger now to see if they can test the boundaries of reality using their will\nAs becoming more apparent that they can uh I was just talking last night\nWith Chris geo injury geo we were talking about this new medium that is on the Internet right now that certainly is causing the the left wing of the United states to be disturbed because they say it's humanizing it it's certainly\nA it's called the NBC or the downplaying character meaning they did the symbol of those who sound like they are repetitive Lee speaking from a script and it's very effective and I was saying to ah Chris last night I said is an interesting that this character\nKind of resembles the ... of alchemy and it it seems to be very powerful is just a simple self like looking character grand color a very simple way drawn but it's supposed to be there is some sort of a a I guess you could call it a ... or some sort of me that if it is spreading and certainly going viral and this is a form of magic\n\nI'd been taken a great interest in this as soon as it came to fruition on the electromagnetic spectrum last weekend I knew this was going to be something special [noise]\nThe like I I've been watching this whole thing around for ... and the way these people have been using the ... for a few years now and we are in a different world as a basically\nA a generation of\nInstinctual chaos magicians who are using things like mediums two actually mold reality in terms of the political structure medicine at this and the seeming is that is quite fascinating and not so much in its was putting out there but the reaction to it\nIt's it's it's tapped into something very visceral and frightening in deep within the people it's been it's been aimed act it's almost like the you know that that the judgment is the mirror and the mirror has been held up that these are these kind of like a\nCultural ... painters or whether you want to call them and gather not happy they're not happy because they wanted to believe they were special and certainly they're realizing that the only thing ... they're probably just like um drives\nYeah and that's the thing is that they're saying oh it's dehumanizing it hurts us but you're right it's like putting a mirror up to them and say look at what you're saying what you're doing look at what you're acting upon and it just reminded me when I saw that as a you know a several characters that have just been self like characters\nThat have been effective in the past like the ... that was discovered\nA that was actually created that are probably a a created the among kill it so he had a ... ah the ah the one that was called the way\nThat he had that look back at a huge balding kind of a self like character but it's just a simple thing it's a simple name but his repeating or at least showing them this is the mirror you're looking through this is looking through a glass darkly and it's making people uncomfortable\nAnd the simplicity of it as well it's nothing it's not like anything complex so it's almost like ed targeting the subconscious\nMind is a very powerful ... kind of aspect to all of this as well [noise] the shadow\nAnd right now we're going to

on this planet\nI think yeah I think the Catholic Church I looked at the fly on the wall\nRight now there's that you have this Pope Francis making a lot of strange statements about do you know global
