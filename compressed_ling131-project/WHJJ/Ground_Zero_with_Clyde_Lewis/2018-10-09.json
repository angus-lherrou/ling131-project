everybody and the reason why it's so fun subject for me\nOr you know one of the weirder aspects of\nQuantum mechanics can be explained by an equally weird idea but I've always talked about and that's retro causality we're talking about causation that runs backwards in time but then it can also run forward in time I and Stein\nCame up with the idea of spooky action at a distance quantum mechanics he said that's how you'd be a radical explain or\nAbout evidence to show that retro causality exists which is the particle equivalent of you getting a stomach ache today Thanks to tomorrow's bad lunch\nAt the idea that you got a stomach ache but there was nothing that you ate the gave me the stomach ache but something that you're about to eat is going to give you the stomach I does that make any sense I don't like explaining it that way that's kind of a waste science would explain I like explaining it as\nFor example you're in a bar or you're somewhere like ... ah like let's say that a guy sitting in a bar and a woman comes up to him and says\nI Want to marry you and I want to marry you on this date so you set a date\nWhen the marriage is going to happen right set a date for that and uh and she says but there's one thing you need to do you need to cut your hair is shave your beer to you to get yourself a suit and tie and I want to house okay\nSo you're thinking okay I'm going to marry this woman and this is what I got to do and you don't even know if it's going to happen you just do there's a date set ahead and that that\nFuture date is going to be affecting the president and the past okay so it'll be passed after you you know after president goes away and it continues in continues so vinyl you do go to the day and you find out that all this stuff you prep for was retro causal\nOkay so you're you're preparing for some people may not happen but it's happening it's it's because the futures influencing president passed in in that way\nWhich is you know a simple way of explaining it probably not\nIt's probably too simplistic maybe but that's that's the way I see it as the way it works this is causality you know there's cause and effect too what effect happens before the cars and that's something that's hard for science to grasp although there's a pair of physicist right now from the ... from a from the United states and Canada\nThat actually took a closer look at some basic assumptions in quantum theory undecided unless we discovered time necessarily rent one way\nMeasurements made to a particle could go back in time as well as forward so we have kind of a a shadow or an echo in transit pretty much and we all know quantum mechanics is is weird right we we know that part of that we're just comes down to the fact that at a fundamental level\nParticles don't act like solid billiard balls rolling down the table but rather like a blurry cloud of possibility shifting around the room\nNow Stephen Hawking that told me all about this when I met him long time ago when we were discussing Heisenberg and uncertainty principles and Adams and all kinds of other you know who are particles moving about\nAnd we're talking about the blurry cloud in it and and the blurry cloud comes into sharp focus will be tried to measure particles meaning that we can\nOnly ever see a white ball hitting a black one into a corner pocket but we can\nNever see the countless why balls sitting by balls in every pocket okay we can have we can face forward okay we see everything in front of us right at our feet\nBut behind as there are so many possibilities going on behind it so we don't even if we take a look back we see what's going on but with our back turned there are so many things that are happening that we don't understand\nWhere we can't understand it all at once otherwise our brains would explode\nSo this is all about maybe ... hey this might happen this could happen right so when we're dealing with maybe ...\nI mean these are these are all part of a of causal progression it's all part of the trends that the ... the transient move whether it's an echo or whether it's cause and effect whether it's a fact before cause whether or not you're going and loops so\nHave you can prevent me just a minute\n[laughter] nice represents these ... these clouds or maybe he's represents something very real okay\nPossibilities on a positive level can be very real see that's why I don't like the idea that you know we're all feeling like we're doomed to some fate\nWhere everything falls apart and collapses I mean for some for some reason we're in that mindset when there's always hope for something to go better we should always try and focus on that hope that things are going to go better you know what I'm saying so if if if if this represent something real up all the particles are like\nBouncing around and we don't see the possibility is behind this but we only see what it wants in front of a sometimes with Kevin you see behind beyond our own feet\nSo this is just a convenient representation of what can happen [noise]\nTime goes by time goes back and forth [noise]\nUh [noise] is beginning we're beginning to see that it's

triple a seven three thirty seven hundred [noise]\nLazy seven three thirty seven hundred\nRetro causality has always been one of my topic favorite\nOf mine because it it it's always kind of weird to think that yes maybe something in the future could influence the\nPast or vice versa and I and I started thinking about that back during the nine eleven days seriously um it was because of the fact when nine eleven happened I just felt like time stopped and I felt like a ... there were some things that happened during that that that era that reminded me\nOf things in the past the quite possibly were affected by that very moment in time I I and I don't know why my brain went that way\nBut it just happened to go that way for some reason I mean when you're in the round the fringe analytics I like saying that it's better that conspiracy theory we should start using that right were fringe analyst [laughter] like that idea rather than saying you're conspiracy theorist you're a fringe analyst\nAnd that means you analyze everything that's fringe including paranormal a terrible ethical\nBut uh in the realm of fringe analytics and being a fringe a analyst\nThere's a whole lot of maybe using coincidences that should never be ignored even when they sound outrageous\nAnd show when I played that audio just now the broadcast the man on the tape or the man on the radio back in Nineteen forty five he\nCould have made a lucky guess right but I'm a sucker for time travel would prophecy especially when it has that paranormal by to it and how would lead you down the roads that take you to what it's called the further beyond see modern conspiracy theory there's a a notion of predicted programming\nAnd we talk about this all the time as it seems to be upper race\nThe way to approximate or otherwise for structure of the future in some way\nIt is propose that through what is called revolution of the methods that were warned or were\nBeing prepared to accept certain ideas means er ideologies we see it in film and TV shows and many things that eventually come to pass but we\nSee it like for example I don't know about you but if you if you go on the Internet a lot you see The Simpsons predicted a lot of things even even the nine eleven attack even predicted the election of Donald Trump which I think it's fascinating\nSo\nWhen we see these things happen we wonder about retro causality we wonder how these people who are in the arts can somehow predict the future or at least give us something to think about in future tense like science fiction I remember I was at a uh a convention one time\nAnd at the convention and we I was on a panel discussing just one science fiction writers got it right there was this one science fiction writer that I was sitting there so I didn't know who he was he was a local\nScience fiction writer he's eyes science fiction has never gotten it right and I said I beg to differ man I said you write it you write science I read it okay I I read the comics I read the books I see the movies and there are a lot of things\nThat people like Harlan Ellison who just passed away got ride for people like Ray Bradbury or Isaac Asimov got right Philip K Dick amazing right he he got a lot of stuff right um and and so when you're when you're thinking about this revelation of a method it's a it's a very\nDeep fascinating conduit to time travel and to the fantastical concepts and most people considered the stuff of science fiction and while the idea that someone can Journey Through time and change the course of history\n[noise] okay

that they played their side\nDoes it have to be scientifically ... verified it's just a production of the future's all it is no I'm Nineteen forty five I mean it's just it was from a big t._v. they said it was made in England in Nineteen forty five post World war two and it's just somebody predict future having team forty a Nineteen forty five a hundred years in the future twenty forty five\n[noise] and it's something that you found on the Internet\nAnd somebody was produced it was something that was a ... released by a pax TV of England that was a prediction given ... an ounce or on the radio in Nineteen forty five\n... okay\nAnd I mean I mean it was ... it was kind of address but not really all that accurate right\nWell right\nAnd what ... what do you what's the problem we have with it\nJust because I mean anybody could make\nThat's right anybody could make the British of if this was made in Nineteen\nLives if this was made in Nineteen ...\nSixty five and it was still apply a month ago well it did it they say was Nineteen forty five\nSo I mean if it's Nineteen forty five and they say it's Nineteen forty five and the group is called effects TV and they said they had that from Nineteen forty five I mean I I Can't tell you I didn't play something Arthur ... made in Nineteen sixty four\nThey basically said the same thing with this set\nI I read Nineteen eighty four I read that book\nRight well okay so Nineteen eighty four was made what in the Nineteen twenties and Orwell to much predicted the future did he not\nWrite write questioning that soundbite that you played if it was late last month right ...\nWell okay let me just tell you this it was released by a company called apex TV saying that it was an unknown radio broadcast from Nineteen forty five\nA man was on the radio basically predicting the future and that's all it is I mean you can ... I mean I Do that of course you can\nAnybody can I don't understand what your problem is\nMy problem is I don't think that that clip that you played was originally from Nineteen forty five okay and when do you think it was from I Wonder why I think that's from\nWhen you when you think that was paid I mean I I don't understand what you don't know what the problem is with us I ... I'm really wondering what the problem like\nSomebody made it look like this person from Nineteen forty five was saying that but it was really made last week\nOkay so how much how much of that thing that he how much of that recording was that guy accurate about\nWell I Know\nThat's you know I'm asking not very much of it was not a ... I mean what he said that uh there'd be a lot of entertainment that wouldn't be owned by a lot of companies that's not true we have we have companies that own a lot of our entertainment there are independent or things that he's half right about he didn't get it all have a lot a lot of that production stuff wasn't All right he didn't get a\nGet it All right [noise] yeah they play it again and again I Want you to review it again and realize that [noise] while the golf when he got some of it right he didn't get all of it right you didn't\nKnow it is not what he said it's a question things the validity of [noise]\nOkay All right well you're questioning of all let any of it but I don't understand why it's so important [noise] I mean if if they said it was Nineteen forty five and find them you question the validity of it but it's like this guy really I mean when you think about it\nThat it might not all of it was true then he said I mean really wants to do what he had to say\nAt the point is they [noise] uh hope is something that looks kind of real\nAnd who benefits from it so I think it's like who benefits from the hopes mark here longer fear ... there was nothing fearful

though the guys do this this is big business the intent is to scare people know this is not to scare people but it's here to make you think listen to what this guy so it's like I said Nineteen forty

have got to talk about a rather serious topic to talk to your child today will make some protections maybe someday I'll come back on the production I yeah I Do know is Nineteen\nForty five hundred years from now and probably twenty forty five it is not in the state of the world and one hundred years as we have seen before the world has changed drastically and the last one hundred yes just one hundred years ago\nAnd the IAEA Eighteen ... the concept of self our\nFighting machine seems ridiculous tonight and I am about to many that's great and dust colonel revolution going I don't see no\nChange than ever before they mind as we go over out predictions kinda next one hundred and one hundred years I put it that man\nWill have all the celestial bodies such as I'm On the planet Mars

enjoy\nI didn't want a hundred years cost one let alone can be constrained cut the crowd I Will have the ability to fight and the average well and\nThe energy that powers the cost will come from the sun I get a one hundred years I put on the television sets we'll get increasingly smaller connect the television and it's hard to the point I think it's on our\n... yes but only the film cameras at every street corner they won't be put in place in the name of our freedoms really increasingly vanish we want to crate our freedom a safety wait well our rights around it because they are our hands tell us and we'll keep our\nChildren now remember I saw productions and I'll say maybe some of the future man we're back on the other day\nWell future man looking back on them and they are pretty interesting productions if their predictions that come from Nineteen forty five\nAnd a some of them are accurate some are little ... by just a tad I think but\nWhen you're dealing with something called revolution to the method we have science fiction people all the time making predictions and having them come true I mean we're warned through this type of predicted programming about how we should be prepared to accept certain ideas\nCertain mean certain ideologies\nWe see in film and TV shows many things that eventually come to pass and would they do we wonder about the theory of retro causality unreal time travel well jeez physicists have been talking about retro causality and whether or not there are things that\nShape the patch future shaping the bath time travel\nIs a fantastic concept but most would consider the stuff of science fiction\nAnd yet we hear more and more that the idea of dream through time he's he's he's quite possible actually ah but to change the course of history yeah I don't know\nI mean we're we're told that there are different timeline that if you go back in time uh and you kill baby Hitler that won't matter 'cause there'll be another time my little form after that that kind of thing I don't\nKnow but um it is possible we're hearing more and more about time travel is becoming more and more possible plausible but um there are those who before us have had insight to see the future\nYou're or they say they've come from the future to let us do you know through science fiction but time travel is possible and his happen from time to time and time after time or or timing for an item and and that's it and yet as you may know\nLike I said I Am in the last hour I I just stumbled upon a film that I saw before called ... and there was a Disney film with George Clooney in it\nAnd what I found most interesting is in the film or they discuss a secret society called plus ultra\nNow according to the fictional history of the film I did some studying
