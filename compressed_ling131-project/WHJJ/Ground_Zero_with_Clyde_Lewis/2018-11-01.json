steps where the where are the priest threw himself down the steps and killed himself in The Exorcist kind of a creepy a landmark they want to have in George to I think it should be a landmark it's kind of an interesting in fact while I was in Washington DC I plum forgot\nAbout seeing those steps where I was in Washington DC I mean you know we we'd have enough time I mean we were walking most of Washington DC is walking at the psyche part like a\nYou know you could drive to the White House you drive to wash your mind you're we parked at the Washington Monument we walked all the way over\nThere you go to the south side of the White House\n\nAnd we were there when the angle of Merkel just happened to be in town and so ah we were kind of dealing with security at the time\nAnd so it slowed down our process than is getting around and do things you started to get a chance to see those steps but they certainly are creepy and they want to make them a landmark so certainly um you know we were on it [laughter] I mean that what we know we we try and give you the best we can I mean it's time of year it's basically what time of year\nWhere we find another excuse to\nAlthough I got on my party and out on the twenty seven\nKids done costumes of course ah I was really excited when Janine sent me a picture of Liam he is a he addressed as tomato head from Fort Night he's got the mask and everything he's got a pizza suit it's it's just really cool I saw his picture and uh yeah tomato head from Port night and um\nBut those are you that um have beggars the company door for candy that's another thing that a Halloween is all about but it's certainly a tradition that has said\nI don't know Halloween is sending some mixed messages this year\nAnd what I mean by that is is I don't know if you've heard of this petition\n\nBut parents want to petition that Halloween be the the last Saturday of every October\nInstead of the thirty first asked me last Saturday in October and what's interesting about that is is that I I think people that do that people are saying that you know don't know that Halloween has traditions that are well steep it or you know the data all the way back to you know the sixteen hundreds\n\nAnd Halloween the course of the day before all saints day or the deal is one of those a day of the saints day of the dead and so it's kinda like a tradition that the day before uh we pay respects to the dead the dead walked the earth and we pay attention to\nNot only the spirit world but also some of the darker Dennis ... of the spirit world we we um we make jacko letters to ward off evil spirits but W evil spirits\nYou know they pass over our house as we do it we're supposed to that is what trick or treaters is supposed to be it's supposed to be the evil spirits if you don't give them treats they do tricks and that's why it's called trick or treating\nThis year I just think that there were a lot of mixed messages being sent it seem to you know\nWe're living in times were where there's this devil does your hiding in every discussion dealing with politics and religion\nI mean this year in particular I I've had well I really late heavy on the devilish aspects of the holiday because from a social studies perspective I think we've reached their\nTime in history where we are definitely in the shadow what can be labeled be gotten anti Christ\nMeaning that you know even though people may not be able to identify the anti Christ a\nBitch that will bear humans in heat right now let's just put it this way I mean I I don't mean to mince words but it just seems to me the dog the birth the anti Christ the certainly\nIn heat right now and and people are just waiting for this to having\nA ... the legend of the darkest one at all which is the anti Christ that came out of a desire\nTo better understand the last judgment and the science specifically those that Harold the arrival of this tyrannical figure this this anti ... we were told that to be vigilant we watching the science we're told in the Bible\nWatch the signs and they may warned of a coming of the ... days wash the science they may be the warning the coming of the anti Christ to come and go to the ... the ... the sea\nOr many men fall to to the ills of evil and scripture and ... cool commentary and never fully addresses a exactly who\nWho is figure is who who would proceed the coming of Jesus\nI mean it's really an anomaly and everyone who has a particular celebrity or politician they hate will often choose them to be the anti Christ especially divers have there\nBecause they've been rolling the dice and say my bets on this guy by bets on this guy bets on Trump my bets on you know and you just go down the list I remember when Barack Obama was president many people thought that he was the anti Christ\nBut\nI I Would say that this study or revelation of a modern anti Christ is a truly hard sell for most people mainly because\nIn a secular world and we're we are in in you know them the anti Christ is simply a marketing term it's a it's a buzz word for\nFor Christians who see that they are being persecuted in their faith is being destroyed by any number of groups and therefore\nWe can say the devil is in them the devil's in them any Mimi mighty mow the devils anew the devil is this group the devil is that drove the devil is the right the devils the lab the devils everywhere\nDon't you know this the devil is everywhere and this leads to\nNot conspiracy theory but the idea that a conspiracy exist a darker conspiracy exist but is here to bring down mankind\n\nAnd so when you look and conspiracy history you have to take into account biblical history has well this is something I mean I I think this gets confused sometimes when people say well when you're thinking of America you got to think of the Christian values that America stands on well what it is is you need to look at the Christian conspiracy\nOr the conspiracy against Christianity because here we have this this you know this all out battle\n\nAgainst people in America we're fighting against the I mean and when you're looking conspiracy history it all has its roots in biblical overtures mentioned ritual as world events are not simply circumstantial\n\nBut they are the result of an organized campaign by an elite group of unseen in widely unknown world leaders\nAnd of course we pointed out\nThey have beliefs and ancient symbolism\nSecret societal of cultures and men ritual magic and that affects us any it's not about what I Believe it's about what they believe they're the ones in power and so if you say to me well you talked about this all the time you must believe it it's not about how how I Believe it or what I Believe\nI just don't which there and I know that\nCausal engineering and ritual magic effects everyone regardless of religious believes regardless of what you practice or what you say you're ... I mean these groups\nI mean these groups they um [noise]\nThey ah they answered other philosophy secretly and [noise]\nOutwardly they're using you know new wage to use mikel symbolism and they use it to exercise absolute didn't tore up control [noise] over the world and they're trying to establish this new world order [noise]\nAnd they play on your beliefs I mean that's what you would if you if you had to have you heard the ah the media lately they've been strategically changing [noise] globalism means saying that well if you're saying that [noise] you know you're against global if that makes you an anti\nSemite will know it does not\nSaying that you're not for global as a means you're not for a world order that is going to be led by obese system certainly\nHas been part of privacy for a long time\nAnd so tonight for a little deeper is that we're talking about the anti Christ you're talking about the empire of the dark dark wave approaching\nWith dark tsunami demons that we've been warned about\nPrepared because we will be feeling the impact of this you know what I mean [noise]\nI'm quite Louis you're listening to ground zero and we'll be back [noise]\nNews radio nine

magistrate in the church so you're a manager that you're just said now you've created the carrier amid the chaos superior\nYeah I have my own my own order\nNow you know what kind of order is a visit a fee is six eight and a shorter is it a witch order wizard order what kind of magic order is\nThe case and Perry miss the most advanced black magical order in the world and essentially we see the prince of darkness as a a ... and being at a doesn't exist inside of physical space time is outside of that is not involved\nUm in just a center around the idea of worship but that to this being can actually be contacted through a actions involving um the highest forms of black magic\nAnd ah we see this being something that we can learn from directly because we can become like it it's the our position has to become God like beings\nAre in a\nIn the elation of his first foreign principle which is responsible for all ... life in the cosmos\nSo we're talking about a dark figure that you have this contact with us on its dark has its mission exaggerating right it's not safe to say and then in of itself is that\nHas a a a kind of a dumbed down I'm a\nIdea of this super consciousness inside of physical space time it's a and this guy stiff 'em rebellion\nAnd a a decadence and I'm\nA hedonism but ah the ultimate elevated form of this is a stoic looser furry and for which is where we are\nAre actively involved in so I'm forever action as an opposite ... equal reaction so as you see manifestations of ah forms going to a a higher spiritual form or as a decision to to forcefully moved the intellect and the psych\nThrough physical space toward a higher\nForm you're going to the replica ripples\nIn in its back wash that are going to manifest themselves as decadence and degenerate but we're also living inside of the cyclic nature of the Kelly yoga which is a ... and understanding of cyclic time in this position that's happening\nRight now is the degenerate I'm a sales oriented um cosmological construct within the human physical ... uh action and form that is at its lowest uh\nA continuum it's it's the worst possible position we can actually live in so they're going to see this like all across the board politics philosophy art music\nUm you know a cultures et cetera\nIs this something that ah the chaos castle ... or do they relish this or would they like to see a higher form of been lightened ... there would be more refined satanism running as a reaction absolutely\nNo interest in what happens to the rest of the world no interest at all no we we're we're we're Paul bearers of western civilization were just watching it happened the rest of us are just moving toward something that's a continually outside of that\nSo you're waiting for all of us to destroy each other than you guys moving the base and we'd be the you know\nWe're not even interested in in in the earth we're interested in transcending beyond even that position so during sending one thing and they are really unhappy about is the fact that there was so much\nA destruction of the beauty of this planet and a lot of that was manifested in things such as an animal abused child abuse is I think we think this kind of thing is really a a really horrific actually animal abuse even worse as far as we're concerned because of the true\nI'm a ... a\nHolders of the of the planet you know they were here before we were and we've come a long and we've like eradicated a their\nLand um or their\nPosition in the world you know they're they're ... they're simple rights to live so\nWell actually I don't really buy their flights to land well I guess is that the you know we've we've run lately overrun all of that and I just think that there should be some kind of vengeful action against that type of thing but it will actually give animals use some child if you do yeah absolutely\nUm you know it's interesting because I said that statement earlier I said satanism now it's harder to find black magically well yeah I mean you will for more you are you're talking about ... magic but I'm Talking about how now where the ... the definition of what satanism is it's not easy I
