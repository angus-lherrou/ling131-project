I mean the attack is similar to but rice in biological attacks had happened before the cabinet decision was made it as I reported there would be a final blow\nEvent\nIt was certainly affect us remember I said that the final blow and I said it would be a biological attack and I was asked to be on the Alex Jones show and I declared there I said it will be a biological\nAttack and when it happened I was suspicious of it because I'm ... it failed and and it didn't you know it was a biological scare okay\nThen I was thinking that this would be a trigger that would create copycat attacks\nSo I was asked to go on the uh go up to begin to go into the Alex Jones ... one of the infowars again\nAnd now he's asked me what is next Clyde what do you think is going to happen next and I said well we're not going to bend would start a war footing in the United states\nAnd he said I agree I agree\nWell today I was notified of the attempted bombing and was sent an email\nThat featured in October third at twenty Eighteen article from the Daily Beast and this was a headline said Kevin are could be the final blow\nFor Democratic Senate everything happening around the issues the final blow\nIs about cabinet ... Senate war what comes with is asymmetrical leaves me they symmetrical attempts at a decapitation strike all is it appears to be perpetrated by deep intelligence conspirators within the opposite agencies and you can call it an inside job if you want\nBut in order declare it a false flag which I hear a body calling it there has to be a suspect in order for the accusation mistake but what I mean by that is we need\nTo see what they decide or who they decided to bring forward as a suspect in so far there is no suspect which it makes it even more suspicious that this\nUh this is a bad day false flag if it if it's a false flag it all came it really did happen yes the pipe bombs were sent\nMe didn't blow up any one but I Want to know who they decide dependent on and then we'll know just how keeping how many gaping holes are are in the story there already gaping hole in the story now and I'm sure I'm not some guess on the pointed out we have um\nA few people that are well you know well versed in this stopped there not conspiracy theorists they're very uh important people and you'll be hearing from an soon\nBut the final blow issue you know whether or not you know we reached that point now I mean\nWhat does happen today I mean like I said you can call it an inside job I mean no Bob's were detonated it makes the entire attack a bit of political theater in order to create a terrorist bogeyman that attacks the left in order to gain sympathy for the vote and this is what they do and the third world you know they just in third world countries and most of the time the suspects are always traced ... intelligence or rogue military actors\nI mean like the guy who um send the for the rice and he was from Logan, Utah and I think he was an ex marine but yeah rogue military actors are rogue intelligence actors that do that somebody who was involved with intelligence or military uh is usually the suspect they they they choose or they they use a scapegoat or a Patsy\nAnd this is with a false flag starts to ... starts to materialize\nI mean these extra always carried out for what are called decapitation strikes which of course is a military strategy\nWhich is aimed at removing the leadership or command and control of what is perceived to be a hostile government or group so it's a tactic of civil war or strategist with other government plot to eliminate military generals or even political leadership now can you recall the rice and attacks\nWere aimed at the president and military leaders and the latest bomb attacks are aimed at Democrats who are former leaders\n\nSo this is a tit for tat exercises he has been copycat exercise this is part of the final blow affect\nIt all started back when Kavanaugh was appointed chief justice it all started the you know it it it it lingers\nBecause of the fact that there is this is Hillary Clinton said she said something to the effect how can you be civil to a government and the civility we'll come back if you just allow us our positions in the Senate\nAnd Donald Trump says well no there's going to be violence if if ah no matter what happens to the violence is happening\nAnd I still argue they if if we were looking in on a country doing what we're doing we would call it a civil war\nI mean think about it you got people in the streets that are fighting with one another and you've got you know presidents and generals getting sent poison in the mail you're getting pipe bombs and and I don't know if they were even capable of exploding when you get pipe bombs or what looked like pipe bomb sent

know eight Chen or on the Internet\nSaid that something was going to go down in fact they said it was some sort of a plot to stay just shooting at a rally or something like that and but there was some sort of political starting in the works up\nAnd even though you see the media going after chewing on and you go after all these others or you go after a Alex Jones\nAre a lot of liberal people to ...
