about Nancy and talks about being in the oval office and\nAll kinds of cool things but yeah I I don't know if it covered though that Reagan was the president they told us be ready for extraterrestrials because if we ever find ourselves in a situation where the entire world's at odds with one another there will always be that alien threat\nWould unite us and that's and that's the thing is that so we're we're meeting now I think we need that alien threat that Reagan talked about um maybe even uh what was it a Jimmy Kimmel Bill Clinton said the same thing but\nYou know you said like he's a daily thing or something\nTo bring us together and you know that that's the whole the president's talking about alien threats it you know it's so easy thing\nReally to search for signs of intelligent life beyond our solar system\nI'm\nIn addition to the incredible distances involved and the fact that\nWe really only have indirect methods at our disposal to look for us to trust your life and we have people who say they look up and they see the stars may may see the the flashing lights in the sky or they see UFOs during the daytime which by the way there seems to be this inordinate amount of UFOs sightings there was actually a signing on the east coast\nUm some sightings out in the Carolinas before the earthquake ... before the before hurricane Michael get to the Gulf apparently is going to get into the the the Carolinas Carolina's having some really harsh weather since um\nSince Florence and and so now Michael May give them a little taste to some more water more more rain but that doesn't mean that after the hurricane they didn't see UFOs and apparently I begged someone sent me footage\nI'm from ah Myrtle Beach actually someone saying that you up oversight over Myrtle Beach and they said it was just what the black he was talking about\nAnd um I really in Cedar you up on myself I was looking at the footage but I didn't see before I saw whites but I don't know\nThat we could call that something which outer space but you know I guess if the person you know when they heard the black to show said well you know you hear the UFO was supposed to be seen that was what Carol David Davis was saying\nThat it'd be a UFO it would seem to be at three o'clock in the evening east coast time\nSo I don't know um I don't know if that counts you know it's like I told somebody I so you're sixty percent of the time I think the cubes right now the times I don't know but uh you know it just depends on you know if you can really understanding here\nWhat's being said and so you know in and let you use something like that but then again it's still specious as to what you're getting and like you said a lot of integrate indirect methods to contact or at least try to find a\nSigns of intelligent life in space I mean there's also the small problem of not knowing exactly what to look for and I think you know\nWhile we've had many people saying well this is what you're supposed to look for these are many UFO researchers and writers that of take it upon themselves to researchers and writers scientists are going we don't know exactly what we're looking for\nSo they're arguing over synthetic lives are arguing over extraterrestrial biological lived there arguing over small cell organisms are arguing over aquatic life may be like on cell it is or you know\nOther uh ice ... ice moons like hopping Star Wars is intelligent life does exist beyond our solar system I've always wondered well okay you want to communicate with alien oh how are they going to communicate with us I mean I'm\nWould they even communicate like we do I mean would they use radio transmitters that use other forms of technology communicate I'm probably not and will be will say well they should be a bounce left in our language not necessarily I mean there are plenty of\nSmart or intellectually advanced human beings who don't speak the language you speak and sometimes we do and they don't speak our language of misconstrued is being not as smart and that and that was one of the problems I had\nWhen I was learning a foreign language and uh you know I was a young kid and I was like you know I was learning a language but I forgot but you know when I'm listening to someone else speak English from a different country you know they're trying to speak the language and sometimes we say well listen to them\nThe way they speak they they don't know language enough so we we misinterpret that is not being very smart but the truth the matter is that the fact that he can forums they can even formed sentences the fact that they can even formed sentences ... or even intelligible makes them intelligent\nIt's like the argument over whether or not millennia Trump was smarter whether or not being an underwear model major stupid and they were comparing it to Michelle Obama and I thought well God you know yeah I'm a shell has her good points uh and she's pretty smart but then they said no money Trump stupid and wait wait wait wait wait she speaks like what eight different languages\nAnd uh you know it's so ... I don't know how many that that Michelle Obama speaks but come on I mean if a person can speak that many languages are really smart and if they're able to keep track of those languages they're pretty smart in fact I envy when producers he speaks Mandarin Chinese\nHe speaks ... I Would love to learn how to speak Mandarin Chinese because then I'd be able to say I speak English I speak Spanish and I speak Mandarin Chinese\nThe three languages that most people should learn if they want to get ahead in business only got two of them Spanish and English\nAnd Spanish is the language of labor or English and men will be the language in big business because we all know the future we all know where China is in our future so Mandarin Chinese baby\nGotta learn Mandarin so you can get around and you know borders things on the menu other than general ... chicken so that that's important of course if you want to be in business but see that's the thing you know communicating with alien so that's a bigger deal\nDoing we were you when languages but there are a lot of other people's ear on this planet ancient languages would be difficult I don't know if anybody speaks aromatic I'm a you know made up languages I guess that's Broncos made up we're going on is made up you can still be going on in Esperanto\nBut ah using radio transmitters using other things are lights signals hell even smoke signals these are a ways of\nCommunicating and so\nThis seems to be what the preoccupation is right now [noise]\nI mean it used to be well we want proved aliens arrived we want them to land on the White House lawn will SETI and many\nCourses are Trish Trish with intelligence and Medi messaging extraterrestrial intelligence international\nThese groups are don't care ... plan on the White House they want to be able to get a signal a techno signature they want to be able to get something\nThat can prove that they're out they're communicating they they and and believe me I'm I'm going to tell you this today I was looking over notes and what prompted me do this show tonight was an article in business insider\nOkay Business Insider talking about what we were talking about ... nights ago\nWith regard to extraterrestrials with regard to um the numbers with regard to

it was my little shot I can I drove people there in Florida and Georgia and all the places being affected by\nHurricane Michael so anyway so what we were talking about today let me just to\nGet back to what we're talking about night so I Am really I'm fascinated here and I am not going to let up until I get to the bottom is okay I'm fascinated by the comments coming out of the search for extraterrestrial intelligence\nAnd a\nMessaging extraterrestrial intelligence that city in ... and they're beginning to act as though they located something okay they're not telling us they've located somebody they've had several meetings one in California University of California Irvine bad a workshop in Texas just a few weeks ago on how to identify\nTechnical signatures in space it's one of the reasons why we brought the black Cuban skull on because we wanted to talk about this type of signatures maybe some people out there we could pick up on low frequency higher frequency whatever so\nWe have to look at various ways aliens would be make contact with us or how we make contact with that money on this program as well I mean not just a black you but we've also at times even run brought this up we used ... reduce\nWe'd blow into did reduce and we'd blow them over the over the air blew they did reduce over the years so in hopes that the signal would go out on all the radios all over the country and all the signals all over the country we send this huge orange sound this\nAncient sound I'm sure aliens would understand and listened to\n\nAnd uh you know and and nights we do this we've had like UFO's sightings you had all kinds of cool things going on\nJust last night we had a a a huge fireball come down out of the sky silent Oregon in Lincoln county up you were telling you about it or we just got tired and Jeremiah calling the program the last star seem to be so that was the only guy to report it and they saw me wonder if anybody else thought\nAnd apparently it had an impact little bit of boom there\nBut see I've been reading a lot of things lately about this whole techno signature clues stuff and for more advanced um\nYou know what they're looking for more advanced civilizations using these take the signatures\nWell I also was reading that there are some people that are bitter believing that uh that there's more to it than just listening for the techno signatures so that we may be\nUnder the control of some of these techno signatures as a human ears picked up on the signals and unbeknownst to most people it's affecting them in different ways so far there's been no need to panic because they don't know which is how the singles affecting people but it certainly has affected people in the truth is\nThat there are plenty of extraterrestrial signals out there the world's it'd be the whole universe is awash in extra trust just single so we can't even perceive\nOr do you even know about unless someone else ... basically says let's say that you hear that that's what we're looking at right now the and so city and many the guys that runs city in ... he spent a lot of time wondering how these messages being transmitted\nThey're hoping they can find a source before more people pick up on the sound at the moment they you know because they buried did actually buried in the\nBackground of earth noise but uh\nLike I said some people were already hearing his pulse speak sound I recently there was a a story out of Sweden where mysterious humming sound was recorded the sound is a constant pulsing home but according to witnesses laughed at forty five minutes to an hour\nA there was there's a film on the Internet going by right now a snow covered mountain top out a little bit of out in the middle of nowhere you living out there are a bunch of guys on a\nOn a snowmobiles and they come by occasionally but what you hear is just a really low frequency home and here's that sound this is from a northern Switzerland or a man by the name of Renee ... Pinsky\nHad a record of this back in December after snowfall just recently got the attention of a paranormal investigator said here is that home\nNo that's not the hummus try another ... it's a wait a minute [laughter] here's behind that was from Utah here's another um [noise]\n\nShow this was filmed by a man named Renee ... Pinsky back in December mysterious humming noise [noise] that day he picked up on he said that uh it was rattling the house she said that it was a like it was rattling the sky\nOr very mystifying he said he was like something was moving from one end of the sky to the other big could not figure out what it was it was like so many visible thing will be across the sky was rumbling a sonics out\nIn August there was a report of another home near Doug we proving grounds which of course Doug way proving ground some people say is the northern arm a very fifty one it's in Utah I've been there it has a lot of ah gates in danger science don't go in there\nAnd uh so here's that sound of the home it Doug way which is a little bit more aggravating to hear but here it is [noise]\n\n\n\nThat earlier I had talked about how uh sounds like these the humming sweet and in the ... in ah Utah Doug way reminded me of a well known a recording of police officers in Saint Helen's Oregon\nUh they said they saw white a bright light on the Columbia River at four thirty in the morning or for twenty three in the morning and they wanted to be able to record the sound of this ship the spaceship as it was taking off from the Columbia\nAnd I wanted to play that moment against you can hear how it compares to the other sounds you've heard so here's that recording the police officers recording to take off his UFO

Hi I'm a ... I found this topic very interesting and uh um\nSo I did a little research on the train goes because it was my understanding that you know neutrinos generally just came from the book\nRight during my research I found out they were getting a train from a number of sources of boys are largely a jelly cloud of ... and and there were no Nineteen eighty seven\nEight mhm and and um and in\nFact a neutrino or detectors have to be buried so very very deep in the ground and they have to be extremely large or what worked where it came to my attention is this has been an Arctic or where\nAre you know at the poll a media right in in media or they're all they're they're found very easily and and it's common place there aren't any just fall whose faith\nIn in that touch reach into our planet right um so ... you know it came to my attention let what if while they were building this neutrino detector sip it has to be so deep in the ground so large\nThat they ran across something they found something that lady shouldn't have been you know ... in in ...
