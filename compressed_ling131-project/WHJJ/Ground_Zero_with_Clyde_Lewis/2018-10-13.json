I I just like it's very comfortable and uh I just thought it was awesome she got me this massive shirt because it just makes me feel on NASA like you know it's cool but uh\nA NASA gives me such Natasha ... they should call it a notch you are because they every everything they do anymore just makes me kinda\nWretched ... and Phil will stick to my stomach I Know the earliest days with us space exploration situation one of the most fascinating chapters of human history\nThat's why I like massive because I like reading about Gus Grissom on like reading about uh you know Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin Sharon in ... and I like reading about all these guys\nYou know I read about about your team um I got into my office and maybe if I get wrong to\nGet it out of the opposite I can take a picture and put on a on these ... I've got um\n\nI've got the uh uh a picture of something it's supposed to be the ... no not a problem with the Apollo fourteen astronaut and it's a little piece of the gold lamb\nFramed I have it's it's kind of a cool thing I don't have any moon rocks but I have that and I have that in my office and I uh I really liked that thing and one of my earliest producers on this program Daniel he work for NASA\nAnd\n... when I had him on working with me uh it was amazing because I got to get all this inside information and he was the one that\nWas telling me you should do shows about this shows by that asks why this isn't happening announcing that enemy big conspiracy theorists about NASA he worked for us to actually so yeah you ain't\nGoing to see first man is going to be cool because it's going to be like going to see Apollo Thirteen or any other space movie running with the historical narrative we know that scientists had a determined effort\nTo go to the moon and they have limited time table\nAnd their efforts gave us the Gemini program and the Apollo moon landing with Neil Armstrong acting is the first human bachelor to an extraterrestrial world and there's so many things we can talk about with him you know leaving the planet along with bugs and\nAnd go in and doing it and you know\nTouching putting his foot on lunar soil and all that whether or not there aliens there whether or not they saw structures they're I mean there's all kinds of things that you can speculate about\nBut almost from the point of the first Apollo mission there were many Americans they expressed skepticism\nThat the whole event taking place at all\nIt had they argued been faked in Hollywood by the federal government for purposes ranging from embezzlement of the public treasury complex conspiracy theories involving international intrigued murderous criminality also\nUsing money to foot the war effort in Vietnam this was all thrown together as a propaganda basically a propaganda scam to make the Russians feel inferior and to be honest it worked\n\nIs whatever it was I mean the Russians were ahead of us in the space race\n\nThen one day they find out that we've got amount on the moon to me it was a hell we don't want to do that and see and that's what has always bothered me about the moon landing as we landed on the moon\nAnd it's kind of like climbing Everest one man climbs up ... makes it to the top bitter several other people want to climate ... efforts to do the same age don't succeed okay some do but some don't\nSo let's look at the moon is like ... we go about every sweet land on Mt Everest and the Russians that works so hard to go about average decide that but we're not going\n\nNow why didn't they go why were they in the second on the moon why wouldn't when when the whole fever pitch was going on we were the only ones who are going to and from the moon no one else was going up there Russia wasn't going up there China wasn't going up there\nNobody cared to go up there in fact after the first three moon missions they were kind of getting bored with the moon mission\nThey would rather you know watch Lucille Ball I mean what are\nYour rather watching Lucille Ball wondering of busier near this kid or whoever it was good to have a baby or I it was like\nYou know\nComedies were more interesting than the moon landing the first one cool second one okay third one [laughter] okay about about how their lives ruined thing if you're a lot of people that had skepticism about whether it on the moon happened at all with on the\nPlanet the amount of Americans between the ages of Eighteen and twenty four years old Mrs figures from the Nineteen sixties uh twenty seven percent expressed doubts but NASA went to the moon\nAnd over the years there have been many more doubters and anymore if you express doubts you were called a science\nDinner you're up there with Blatter's right\nUh [noise] that's about the first moon landing had been on the rise for some time now and there are a lot of people that don't believe that was it turns out\nThroughout the latter through the twenty twenty century onto the twenty first\nConfidence in the United states government\nBy the American public had been in decline and does remember the Kennedy assassination Vietnam Watergate nine eleven attacks all these other scandals now fees it's\nMay find it easier to say well you know the government's lied to us about a lot of things why wouldn't they lied was about the moon landing and what's really weird is is\nThat you know out of all the things you can question questioning the moon landing it's probably one of the worst things you can do okay it's it's one of the worst things that you can do\nThat you know using ... you can question Idaho and that's that's kinda bad because people say how dare you there was this horrible event and history and you're questioning of people have died that you get that all the time you're talking about Watergate you you do some ... they don't care about Watergate I don't care about Monica Lewinsky stress\nBut yet we spent less money on nine eleven I mean ... and that's the thing is you know you look at the embarrassment of that you look at all the money put into the moon landing and we haven't gone back in fifty some odd years\nAnd the rockets so what happened to them and you know all these questions of people have it and when you start speculating they won't even allow you to speculate that it never happened\n\nThey'll tell you you're crazy they'll tell you you you need to go back to physics class\nWell\nYou look back in a bottle of it and you say to yourself well this is kind of interesting and you know with all the the deaths in the accidents before Apollo eleven we sent\nThree guys out into space and nothing really happened to them\nWe didn't lose any astronauts we didn't destroy any equipment in the process maybe on earth we did when the when the alarm on the Armstrong almost killed himself in the lab and his wife says you're not going to the moon no way\nOh yeah I Am I mean I'm going to the moon no not after you crossed the lunar lander honor as well you know we're not we crashed it on earth but we're not gonna crash it on the moon I trust me we're not going to do that\nI think the space shuttle blows up or astronauts were killed by stopping program for a year to figure out what the hell happened back then I got a timetable to meet you know Neal if you cross the lunar lander tough luck Charlie you're going up into space you're doing that one small step for man speech\nThat's what happened\nAnd you're going to do it with technology but for the equivalent of the computer technology in your toaster of it that's how we're going to do with guys and you're going to be sitting in something the size of a phone booth with those huge backpacks on your back here to take pictures of the moon was something called a ...\nOf and mittens Hi you're going to do it well we got all figured out\nNow is\nHow is this going to be done without people question is what we've got that I'll figure it out to no one will question it it'll be the most brilliant thing ever you're going to the moon and you know you're going to the moon and the American people know you're going to the moon\nExcept except that there are a lot of things we're not going to tell them about how we're doing this magic [noise]\nAnd a lot of things were going to forget about once you've gone [noise]\nAnd we forget about it it'll it'll delay our moon program for maybe a hundred years [noise]\nI'm not kidding even with the\nLawn mosque [noise] and all the other guy's trying your base I was trying to get to the moon\nIs one thing in the media is Don telling you\nNone

Bush started the conversation about putting them back on the moon and twenty Fifteen and he said the NASA with just a new spacecraft was called the crew expiration vehicle by two thousand eight and to get duct that first manned mission no later than twenty forty\n\nFour years after the fact nothing we don't we don't have men men started back on the moon again we're we're just really talking about sending the first space tourist season I mean and land on the moon is just going to go around them in\nBut the President Bush had a goal set of having a man on the moon living and working there by twenty twenty having a base there and it found out of the question I mean if you look at what Bigelow Aerospace is up to with\nMaking these inflatable moon basically I could have been done even um our space could have been done\nWell in two thousand nine we were told the NASA was carrying out the LCROSS experiment and they were lying to us about it about what they were using it for is that they were looking for ice on the move there are plenty of missions prior to the moon landing plenty of missions like the Clementine mission whatever scouting out of the moon finding ice pockets\nAnd so they didn't need the LCROSS mission but ah and\nOf course NASA had five hundred million to spend on a rocket who's going to slam into the moon blow up and then a cause of created it's about six miles wide\nAnd uh you know people say oh my God they're going to new moon and they were going to do this two days or two days shy of the forty F anniversary of first landing on the ...\nAnd there was a lot of stuff about that and it shouldn't have been all adds up didn't make any sense\nAnd\nTwenty love and after the LCROSS mission failed rock Obama cut funding for the proposed constellation program and the space vehicles he he basically cancelled the five year nine billion dollar effort to build new uh Ryan spacecraft an aries rockets\nNew space vehicles were slated to replace the masses three aging space shuttles and launch astronauts into orbit and onto the moon that was the thing but no Obama pulled the nine billion and they put the money towards better than I thought about climate change climate science\nSo Obama killed the space program in order to turn out in the climate change police and that's that's really sad I mean if there was ever a time\nBut now that we went to the moon at all that was the time because it you know they just shut down you know here we have this dream are gonna polish money forward then Obama says not not that we're not going to go so here we are and twenty Eighteen\nAnd we'd again been told that the moon is the goal and later march\nTo news stories today that I Want to tell you about that really helped me excited but ah some bad news first of all a Russia seems to be out of their minds are apparently may have detected what appear to be to colliding stars\nI think somewhere I have the sound of the stars I'll Try and dig it up but uh yeah they they detected these stars are putting off a sound gate of weird sound and are there going wait a minute or these really colliding stars are we looking at a space armada coming our way\nAnd if they're moving us after we think they're going to be here by twenty twenty two\n\nI'm getting I'm not kidding Russia found these colliding stars\n... before them out there saying well these these look like cutting stars but the sounds are giving us she may have intelligence in them so they may not be colliding stars at all what are they well they are um are there are no mater of of huge space craft coming our way\nUm\nNASA also reported today that Seventeen scientists\nOften to report stating that searching for signs of life should be part of every future national mission\n\nThe briefing was offered by the national academies of Science Engineering and medicine it emphasizes the importance including astrobiology the study about life originated on her than how it might evolve elsewhere in the University of every phase of all NASA missions destined for space from inception conceptualization they're planning to development and operation\nSo once again we have Seventeen scientists saying guess what guys every mission that we do from now on is going to have the purpose of finding life out in space\nOnce again every mission is going to be about finding life in space to have to have a question of finding life in space Russia says they picked up on to quote colliding stars that may be a space our mother heading our way\n\nSo I Believe that the reason why this is happening why they're saying hey every mission has to have a fact finding like giving whatever is because they\nHave confidence that there's intelligent life out there and the recent reports of techno signatures in fast ... actually fast radio burst\nOr the motivation behind the quest\nI don't know that it\nHas anything to do what he's claiming stars are possible are modest coming our way but it certainly has a lot to do with a techno signatures\nAnd get this astrophysics says are now saying\nThat with all the thousands of exoplanets out there and and how they're uncovering new insights into a complex the diversity of life on earth the authors also sit in the briefing that not only are you going to be looking for techno signatures guys we want you to look for bio signatures\nSo this is pretty amazing don't you think I mean I think it's cool I mean this bolsters the chance at life could exist out there\nAnd therefore all space exploration missions shooting corporate technology the fines traces of alien organisms ... signatures take those things I mean look our president of the universe is more crammed with plants never before\nWe have two thousand three hundred confirmed exoplanets discovered by NASA's Kepler Mission and that leads to efforts to six out of every ten stars could host Earth like planet\nSo the sheer number of known exoplanets operas exciting opportunities for finding ... signatures fighting chemical markers indicating that yeah there's live out in space\nIn the report scientists recommended at NASA accelerate the development of technologies to detect microscopic organisms citing the current lack of a single flight ready instrument but can travel to a distant world and measure the composition of its elements minerals in organic matter\nReport also suggest that direct imaging systems that suppress star light should be used outside our solar system to improve detection of ... ... signatures from planet that might or but those stars NASA could also plan more missions that the peer under the surface of exoplanets\n\nWhether another rock the icy or ocean worlds to find some journey alien life according\nTo the report however [noise] ... located are extraterrestrial neighbors either in our solar system are light years away [noise]\nWe'll take more than technology alone and all of these advancements will cost money and guess what guys [noise] masses only plan [noise]\nTo return astronauts to the moon after nearly fifty years just got slammed by an internal auditor [noise] that means [noise] we're not going to the moon anytime soon and we're not going to the aliens anytime soon [noise]\nWe're using fatty and Matty [noise] an astronaut some really excited about the possibility of life out there [noise] but [noise] our rockets CFL last rocket who you're working on guess what [laughter]\nThe report even calls into question the sustainability of the entire project meaning but even with all the right ideas and design but rocket won't even make it off the launch pad to the moon making making this newly manned moon project a pipe dream\nMean auditors put so much blame for the high cost some delays on going [noise] one\nOf the contractors the company is responsible for about fifty six percent of the new rockets cost but it's years behind schedule and delivering the biggest section of the rocket [noise] and [noise]\nI mean there's just as you off I mean does it does give you more jobs as to whether or not we went to the moon in the first place [noise]\nGone if we're supposed to be on the moon and twenty Fifteen according to George Bush brought rock Obama signed it away now we're saying twenty twenty we've got based so we got to you on my cell will be able to do that I don't buy it anymore [noise]\nNot when we have like extraterrestrials knocking on our door and humming [noise]\nHow fast radio burst flashing techno signatures being sought after by Saturday and we have nothing to fly out to those guys

Bush said we can do it in twenty Fifteen he said back in two thousand four we can do it in twenty Fifteen ... says oh no we're not we're going to focus on climate change\n\nPresident Trump's sprays force everybody goes [laughter] and then they say no wait a minute we can go to the moon we can't go to Mars we're going to do it we're going to do it and then of course now we can't do it we can't make the rocket we couldn't sixty nine we can't now\nWhat the hell's wrong you're just makes you doubt even more so when you go see this movie is this the first man movie it's just like what we saw in

sort of a science ... convention and\nShe said to him she said you know Mr Aldrin you know why have we gone back to the moon and buzz gave it gave him gave her this look like well that's a question that you know little girls don't ask you know this is a big question and\nI have I have my reservations let me let me play you a little clip I got it right here hold on one second Michael play for you

Marcus hill on UK ah he's the guy to\nPut the next just magazine together\n... years ago I remember that magazine's great magazine yeah\nHis men in the moon landing ... they wouldn't landings compilation of evidence of interviews several scientists including James McKinney who stood originally oh he just\nPresumed it did happen until he like UK\nProfessor of physics also on you to a YouTube channel that guy is better mankind that tr mankind ... and it's titled national admits never gone to them a lesson which never gone to the most\nSo McKamey\nLike this guy that she came across a better Mick Hi [noise] I'm less admits never gone to the much they oh Lucy the various lawyers\nOh that would have had to been um [noise] uh [noise]\nGo on through right okay and uh then they break it down according to the metallurgy up pretty is the various medals of the space capsule\nAnd of course the space to by the time the cap so the astronauts had gone into like the third or fourth later they would have been vaporized they are right\nAnd that's that's the story I remember the story of all I can remember like the Russian dog [noise] I don't quite adult whether Russia is set up a dog called ... and like it was a dog they set up into space to see our dog react to go into space 'cause they were losing a lot of astronauts aspects\nWere dying on the ... the old story about how there's probably some astronaut floating around in deep space somewhere that's Russia ... died\nOr what happened to be sent Mike up into space and um Russia reported that uh the dog was doing okay you know dogs great out in space or being space\nOr they didn't tell us is is that when I went through the Van Allen belt die to horrible death and a baby and announced that are for the longest time and and finally they be classified as anything with a good couple of years ago that\nBut like actually did a dye or maybe ... yeah\nBut I got a real quick in that in that presentation a NASA ... they they

official tear up your guy for NASA said it's a hard thing to admit but we destroyed the old technology yeah it's it's an even tougher little back to recreate the technology but these other astronaut said well\nIf we're ever going to go to the moon we must ensure that the electronics can survive [noise]\nAh the Van Allen radiation field of course he asked for I mean\nTalk about disclosure bike without without declaring disclosure there it is we never went it's impossible [noise]\nAnd now they're out there and we can't even get to them and that doesn't that suck we we got married I Want to
