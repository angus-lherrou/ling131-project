God because our God is the right guy the God of Abraham in the right got\nSo this is not a God Jupiter is not a guy but he wants to rule like a God but in the counterfeit God\nThen we have the arch of bail a horn God in Washington DC a horn guide which represents sexual promiscuity and the sacrifice of children\nThat discussion so we're having between ah forwarding Kavanaugh deal with sexual

you can also fake the signs in wonders of the second coming\nHow you can bring on these ideas that maybe we are in the last days or this could very well be the way it's supposed to be and this is the business confusion I have is the debate I had with my soul as to whether or not this is\nScience and and and consider writing a consideration for those signs but then I look at it and say this could all be one big show that they're\nPutting on to scare me or just scare everyone else but it just seems to be working all the plots all of the dark guards all seem to be coming to fruition like I said if you want to talk\nOf the looming Audi on this this is very much aluminum process will be back\nWhat happened you used to go hours without visiting the bathroom now it seems like you're constantly

just that I've been watching too much American horror story apocalypse but my dad got if you watch that\nThat's a lesson in in the fight between what is the dark powers and whether powers out there in the midst of an apocalypse\nPredicted programming revelation doesn't matter if it\nWould be increasing ... a globalization of political and economic institutions it's becoming easier for a relatively small group\nTo deceive itself into quite staggeringly influential positions and one couple in particular reveals alarmingly what another small group will do is driven by financial belief systems and a cold things and all the things in the shadows all the things that can reach out and grab you from the darkness\n\nAnd while there are many conspiracy writers and observers that tend to talk about the material world within the conspiracy history\nWe always seem to point to whomever we hate has control over the world\nThe spiritual realm\nBut what is it the thriving right now in the midst of globalization a lot of frightening and somewhat complex things that are difficult to understand even I sometimes have to go back and read and understand that's why I come in every day early\n\nAnd yeah you can go through all of the bad guys the masons the Jesuits accusing them of controlling all of a spiritual realm of what appears to be the imperial called however it becomes more complicated\n\nWhen you deal with witchcraft or priest craft that takes place within the spiritual matrix of the elite\nAnd a lot of this I mean I'm sure many of you don't understand it and you know I understand a little of it\nBecause of what I've studied my my entire life what I what I put into this program every night every major step in the development of the new world order from simple ideology to a worldwide super states can be traced back\nTo specific ideologies which uphold ruled by a chosen body of spiritual elite secret Brotherhood's from behind the scenes the Brotherhood whatever it may be or the sisterhood if you want to be equal\nAll plays a role in the hidden hand the guy just towards disorder and it can also be seen as a manifestation of elusive theory and spirituality the professors to enlighten practitioners through mysticism and magic\n\nAnd I kind of alluded to it in the last hour I used the word finicky\nThere was a guy by the name of a choice of Alexander say knives\nAnd he had an opposition to the rise of anarchy in the second half of the nineteenth century and to him the ideal state was a rigid social hierarchy topped by an elite that is pretty destined to rural absolutely at odds with the band emerging concepts of democracy\nAnd so he decided that the only way to win\nAnd to gain power which do you use the supernatural as a weapon\n\nAnd so\nHe wanted to transmit the secretive synergy throughout the ages basically coming in coordination and cooperation with a divine rule meaning that some spiritual fathers do not exist on this planet and they must be conjured up contacted\n\nAnd one of the spiritual fathers or some of the spiritual path as the ... of course the knights Templar\n\nAnd other groups that you know actually spawned and and and new ideas and and mysterious mysterious subjects and hitting meanings and certain conjure rings and all of these things\n\nAnd I said before that it seems to me that you know be beyond the deep state in the dark state or whatever state you want to point to as a problem there is a darker type of rule\nOf dark command that actually uses the darker powers to create a sin arcade that may be in power right now the government it's run\nAnd it's not our government into towel but what it is it is a government of some kind of group a conspiracy of men or women that form of priesthood and are ruled by a secret society open societies are not always the ones\nThat are named by conspiracy theorists all of them however it played a role in establishing\nTheir power plays within the United states and in the world\nThe formation of this nation was perhaps the mother of all conspiracies but from there there were other conspiracy groups other secret societies and I know many Christians in America believe that you found was really the United states was based on Christian values and ideologies business half true because\nThe rebellious nature of the insurrection was purely suffering any bordered on things like her medic arcane them enough to system so from the very beginning we've always had that group\nThat are simply observers baby there custodians and they make things happen and they call themselves into a different opinion that of the Christians or the Jews are the Muslims and they're in systematic opposition\nTo the apostles to the disciples to those
