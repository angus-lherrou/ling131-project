C.\nAnd you know I'm\nThe FBI now is involved with this and they they're actually been called in to\nLead the investigation into the packages which are addressed the secretary of defense James Mattis and she's a naval operations admiral John Richardson and of course there was a letter sent to the president um here's the FBI statement they said uh this is the FBI or the statement they they issued\nOn Tuesday October second twenty Eighteen and coordination with the Pentagon force protection agency FBI special agents to possession of too suspicious armed groups that have been screened at the Pentagon mail facility those on the lips are currently undergoing further testing as this is ongoing we will have no further comment\n\nSo as the Washington DC area work to determine the origin of the rice that attack\nNews also broke out the two individuals have been hospitalized after being exposed to a powdery substance in the mail center the Texas is set to Texas it was a actually a ... it wasn't in Texas it was I'm\n... I'm trying to figure out it was his office said Cruz's office where it happened yes there was in Houston, Texas Houston, Texas they sent a Senator Ted Cruz is off as a a rice doing as well or two people were hospitalized or we don't know um how they're doing\nA cruise office said they received a piece of mail\nAddress is Senator Cruz this morning when the male is open to contain the white powdery substance the ninth floor of the Phoenix tower was evacuated after the packages found the Pentagon also reported that rice and was attacked that in the mail and of course the rights from since President Trump so um\nYou know so as we predicted um this has happened much like what happened I mean if you remember half a dozen leather letters um\nContaining anthrax spores were mailed to journalism politicians beginning one week after the nine eleven attacks for leaders were spores and threaten messages events that were recovered all were post smart from Trenton New Jersey which meant that they had been process of the postal distribution center in uh actually near Hamilton\nTo it as opposed to mark September Eighteenth one address the Tom Brokaw NBC TV\nAnd another was sent to the editor of the New York post the other two letters were stamp October ninth an address to senators Thomas natural and Patrick Leahy so as people became infected in September October and November local\nResponses revealed gaps in preparedness for biological attack for example the first confirmation of anthrax case was on October fourth\n\nIn more than two weeks after the initial letters were mailed so I mean we look at the retrospective assessments of all this and um\n\nWe we learned that nine people\nThey were exposed to um\nThe rice in ... I'm not the rising and sorry the anthrax\nThat already contract is is the fear their illness previously had been missed identified because faulty diagnosis erroneous laboratory\nTests but in the end the final result at the end or in the end twenty two people to become infected\nFive of them died meanwhile they were buildings that were\nBelatedly found to be contaminated with anthrax spores and

research I found out that I did not know about I I did not know there were plenty of other buildings that were leaking some of his uh\nSome of his uh you know biological a powder and uh the anthrax

for Giuliani Giuliani had wanted to have it extended\nYou want to have the time extended\nAnd I could speculate that\nI guess regulate perhaps maybe this was what was going on today with the rice and but I'm also curious as to how this was not considered a major attempt at trying to kill the president\nBecause if he were joy inhaled rice and I mean sure he could be treated he could have a you know

everything else points to rice and there was rice and it was also found a it in a Ted Cruz's office\nA rice is a popular a way of ah actually it's it's a very popular biological to be used because it's easy to make fact it's a\nIt's one of the few poisons is actually found significantly in a in a lot of qualities are they big quantities in nature the um 'cause it's found in caster beans a and they grow all over the u._s. um [noise] yeah it's one of the few poisons that actually a\n... that are basically uh you can make or the or the rights of itself you can make in the kitchen\nUm oh you got to do is you make a much I guess this is my Breaking Bad news [laughter] this is my Breaking Bad knowledge you make it with much you make it into a marsh and then you keep pressuring the beans pressing they'd be then you have castor oil\nMany of us remember castor oil rights and stuff they used to make you poop Castro it's it's all accident well basically what you do\nIs the reason why this poison works so well is because what it is the gums up the protein building machinery and yourself goes right to your DNA that is if you ingest it okay and\nIf it harms cells that are dividing quickly and then it takes it goes to bleeding swelling your blood pressure goes down your organ failure happens then it's pretty pretty nasty but\nThe the ... the specific symptoms depending on how a person is exposed to the rice and and how big it does get that's according to CDC inhaling it can cause\nBreathing problems to build up in the lungs will pressure and that but it's not taking care of\nIf you eat it well you're in big trouble because you start vomiting or diarrhea you go into seizures organ failure [noise] and man that maybe maybe not but if you injected weakness muscle aches vomiting fevers organ failure\nAnd [noise]\nSo um [noise] you know this is the type of poison that can kill me not killed depending on the dosage\nAnd it can cause all kinds of above reaction would be in fact

you know and this was any threat to the president Ted Cruz's office said they received a piece of mail it was addressed the Senator Cruz happened this morning when the male is open to contain white powder\nAnd so the night for the Phoenix tower was evacuated after the fact that just found Pentagon also reports that rice and was detected and that uh and and so we're having a full on biological attack biological a poison rice and\nAnd just reminded me if you remember when I was talking about the project for the new American Century I said something to the fact that uh one of the other ways that they can change\nThe direction of anything politically is to use biological warfare and even biological warfare that has a certain abilities to mark\nA you know biological markers that would do would actually activate this stuff and and rice and acts upon your DNA if ingested\nOr if it's injected have you inhale it it's a you can survive a inhaling a rice and it's just that you can die if you're not taking care of\nSo uh it's just some uh pretty scary stuff going on right now and so you know timing is everything and uh I think that uh once again we're seeing history repeating itself because remember back in Nineteen eighty four the Russian each called here in Oregon tried to poison the group of people to try and change the vote\nOr in Dallas, Oregon and uh\nI think here we're seeing a somebody trying to either stop the investigation into cabinet or to believe that the investigation into Kavanaugh or what they're doing is they're trying to find a way\nTo um distract us from it ah there's there's a number of things you know especially going down during this time is that I think is volatile time in this country and ah I said the other night on the ground zero lounge they probably will have this investigation wrapped up by Wednesday they'll\nHand down their decision and the American people probably won't hear what the decision is and they don't have to be happy I doesn't have to reveal anything about their investigation they could put it to a vote and cabinet can be confirmed and I think it would trigger a lot of anger\nWith a lot of people in this country if Kavanaugh actually becomes chief justice\nSo tomorrow it to Eighteen eastern time they're gonna be doing that test and emergency test on your telephone so as I said timing is everything just as peculiar\nAnd uh I think we should have a discussion about this because I think that uh you know as we were predicting it I predicted on ours Jonah show I talked about it at great length on this program for a good long time and people who is this program know\nLived on this people who let's this program know that if I'm On to something and I see the patterns these things go down and when they go down it's not necessarily to the exact 'cause I remember we talked about the pope stepping down when Ratzinger step down\nAnd we said oh you know he would probably lead retired die within three months he left the ... he left the papacy the one of my friends is really blown away by this but it was because we can see you know the talk we heard the\nYou heard the Marines and rumors coming up from Rome and there's several other times in instances where were you have a pretty much reported ... be prepared for the students out but we're not always right before damn close believe it or not or damn close and so we're obviously seeing the beginnings of what would be the final blow if\nIt gets out of hand said be prepared because if the work goes down tomorrow back cabin uh [noise] some

Facebook you know everybody seems to hey Ted Cruz even though he's not really in the U.S while it anymore\nAnd the other interesting thing is is that Ted Cruz at one point wasn't he kind of\nA a guy that would have been considered to be a good a Supreme Court nominee so\nWell I don't know if we're getting to bench a secretary of defense James Mattis was targeting also chief of naval operations admiral John Richardson was it was also targeted\nRight sure yeah I don't I don't know where their political affiliations law but\nBut see that's the thing is that if this was I mean obviously this is politically motivated\nUh we don't know do it for what reason it was politically motivated I Would say it was just work the investigation and devote a confirmation vote\nI think that yeah it would give them a reason to we're going to stop this right now and we're going to investigate who was involved with sending the rice and but it's not going to stop the FBI the FBI's already made the decision\nAnd and I know they've already made the decision because um you know uh actually we were to ground zero allows discussing this and somebody said to me they said well they're going to wrap this up by Wednesday they don't have to wait till friday they said well that week's time they don't have to wait all they have to do\nIs go back over ... existing papers get all their ducks and rode dot the I's properties come back give their decision to vote goes down he gets confirmed the American people were dumbfounded they don't know what's going on people who don't like the idea get angry\nAnd he started harassing people even more and maybe even worse than that\nAbsolutely and and the other thing is it's it's just um\nIt it it's interesting that the whole I mean you know you are definitely you know obviously you try to stay out of the political game yeah and I you know I tend to lean right or whatever you want to call at I mean nowadays that's totally got a horrible\nAcross the U.S we've built our reputation on having the best built best looking and most convenience sake what great surface and warranties and you can get online financing so go with the best\nAnd get style convenience security and true peace of mind with rhino safe dot com today that's rhino save dot com rhino safe dot com\nThinking about life insurance what if you could make one free phone call and learn your best price for nearly a dozen highly rated price competitive companies well that's exactly what happens when you call to quote life\nFor example Georgia's forty\nHe was getting sky high quotes from other companies because he takes meds to control his blood pressure but when I shopped around I found him a ten year five hundred thousand dollar policy for under twenty five dollars a month I'm select quote agent dance to being out and believe me\nIf collect quotas and shopping for your life insurance you're probably paying too much\n... more you're free quote call me in Seventy one forty eight eighty eight hundred seven to one forty eight eighty eight hundred seven to one forty eight eighty or go to select quote dot com and since Nineteen eighty five we shop you say\nGet full details on the example policy of flood hotel complex commercial surprise could vary depending on your health and human company and also\n[noise]\nThe heart radio we can sport time capsule\nSports fans are Sandy Waxman I'm here to take you on a journey back to this week in sports history start back in Nineteen Twenty one and the first broadcast of the world theories on radio in New York Yankees beat the New York giants three zero [noise]\nThis week in Nineteen fifty five Baltimore Colts pulled back Alan and meet she becomes the first rookie in NFL history the top one hundred yards rushing in his first two games get a hundred and sixty three against Detroit Lions pass or his one hundred Ninety four yard performance review against the Chicago\nBears huh it's Lincoln Nineteen eighty four Walter painting\nThe Jim Brown and the NFL career rushing leader this week in Nineteen Ninety One the New York rangers ...

you're on ground zero\nAnd I think it's kind of weird you know the the ... percentile you see the day and they were saying about it and ... was in Philadelphia out of the\nWell they plaque them so that that's the thing they flag them and that kept them from going anywhere near the White House so they were sent I'm sure they were sent yesterday\nOr the official announcement income today because they were wanting to inspect all the mail to find out of rice in was involved and made the announcement the rice and was in the package is one of the of course\nSend to the president United States but what I find interesting is no reporting of this on other major networks none in fact that they're focusing again on the ah there was a young cabin on board\nIn fact right now they're talking about the protesters I just talked about confronting of course to Mitch McConnell and others of course giving into faces I mean like they do with the quake without getting into faces of the senators\nAnd basically blaming them and saying that the Republican Party is the party of rapists and and this is this is amazingly out of line in my opinion\nYeah it totally out of line\nSo I mean who knows a little though she was responsible for these rice it and who knows what the motive is\nBut it just all sounds like it like I said the Nineteen eighty four tempted thwarting a boat or changes says you're not a vote by the Russian each called in Oregon in Nineteen eighty four it's the same ammo\nIf the same purpose to somehow stall or otherwise uh for the efforts of either the FBI investigation or the voting for senator cabinet\nYeah\nSo yeah the timing of everything and I like I said there would be a biological attack there has been now we have this cat's do we have to deal with with the phones tomorrow to Eighteen eastern time I'd be happy to see if there's any other timing that goes with that too because that would be that would be even more interesting if I went down\nTo both of

when you call a program stick to topic it's going to talk to you how you feel drunk ground zero\nClad high up I think it it had a memory\nOut the story that nice story that were going on in the summer of two thousand one right before nine eleven and a matter of fact that morning at nine eleven before the plane tower\nHad hundred reporters standing outside a Democrat Senator name they're getting ... ... and and the investigation under ... shouted lady\nRemember that yeah I remember that it it after the planes hit the tower and\nThey lost like getting a function of the art but after the towers that story was that was God like you didn't hear about it\nOr have you been to say oh I Love you I mean she she disappeared in May of two thousand one right and uh yeah I mean that was a the hot news item until the the towers went down and then that everyone was like by after that you know no more are talking about Gary Condit\nI'm thinking this is comparable to what you have enough for\nWell I I yeah I got but Gary wasn't planning on a or B being achieved justice [laughter] which one did again we have an extramarital affair story we have\nA a dead woman Chandra Levy a we have an investigation started in may and probably just disappeared off the map after that no one cared about it because of the nine eleven attacks\nAnd you're right you know there's a ... that's a pretty big deal to cover up bad to have a bat but uh I Would say that you know\nThey're not connected but I Would say that something like this once again distracts people from other stories and of course I'm sure many people lost track of what happened was John relieving the Chandra Levy case would Gary Cohn did that is if we were able to look through the ... the nine eleven attacks\nRight okay well I just wanted to put out there and I'll let you get good\nVery good point though very good comparison in history you get your brownie points for being a story about I think it class that you've been I Love you too man go to Jay in Rhode Island I pay under either I'd\nProbably be quick as much as I can be bought you obviously ... what does two plus one plus eight at up to\nTwo plus one plus eight yep eleven\nThat's right and what does two plus arrow plus one plus eight add up to\nUm eleven\nOr try and win was nine what was what was that date back in September and\nThen I had an eleven went into it when I was\nOne plus one add up to\nNine plus one plus one yep twelve\nNine oh one eleven sorry that's right although nine eleven had the total eleven twenty Eighteen eleven you have this thing going on at two Eighteen as you said right which is an eleven\nEleven yeah and we just had a job or who was murdered in DC not too long ago\nRyan Miller to what was discussed just recently by the previous caller right Kentucky yeah it does have an eerie quality to it and\n... and you want if you want to get technical when was the brown broken from the Pentagon\nWhat I've what was that September eleventh All right yeah I'm\nSaying just one thing but I was calling up about the rice said and to to go on Ben and I forgot where the young man was from but when he was speculating on it being possibly from someone on the Republican or or Republicans sympathetic side because if you recall back in terms of predicting programming\nWhat happened to them Adderall in Venezuela where they accused him of staging his little assassination attempt with that drone ... might have tip their hand right they're letting you know in advance what was coming\nWhile I mean you can see that there was something going on with these are called these gain and function exercise I Believe the Emirates plane was part of that\nI Believe that when you have a group of people on the on the plane and they all complain of flu like symptoms all at once that's not a flu that's something else and it does smack of a rice from poisoning and I'll just be clear Nineteen forty one nine eleven September eleven Nineteen forty one was in the Pentagon\nRound was broken for the Pentagon then so I Know nine eleven to be a talked about two\nMen then remember over says there's a lot of provocative behavior taking place upon the part of the United states where they're already threatening to strike a Russian missile or install installation because of start treaty violations and they're moving a shift to the ass off the ah off\nOf the Ukrainian coastline over there in Crimea right and so I mean there's a lot of powder keg occurring right now within the world\nRight and so there are a lot of distractions but the thing is is that how are these distractions affecting them both how are they affect you invest\nThe vote I Would tell you you don't have to I wouldn't even worry about it because I'm already screaming now the court has been de legitimize by Mitch McConnell's machinations and when something comes down that's going to be a dramatic decision that will be the battle\nCry because armed yeah and when he finally does make a decision for something that will become a fifty fifty unpopularity then it will be pointed out that while you can politicize a court you can't make it political\nHow we feel though if the FBI did not release the information about cabinet and his activities when he was in high school\nOh I Would be I wouldn't be ripping but I've also ripping based on the fact that there's this ... this a speculation on the part of Fox News that they're gonna already be finished by ...\nNow you have the ... not a nation TJ I'm Sorry to tell you what's on speculation in fact I knew it was going to be done and over with on when I'm more finest news that I heard it already from inside or that I have\nBut the speculation will be now that Mitch McConnell pressure them to wrap it up to a quicker than would necessarily be a\nNecessarily the FBI are quite frankly all they had to do is just a value wait a certain times in certain other things he could be guilty as hell wouldn't tell you\nOh yeah but now Mitch McConnell has to take the fall based upon the fact that they'll say his fingerprints are over this\nAs a matter they're getting what they are getting and the American people are going to a prize over it and that's what I you know\nAs you when you when you start playing with the very last word because it's not right because that's the last word but it's ... it's the last it's ... it's the last word not because it's right but because it is the last word once you start making something from politicized the political that nobody's going to have faith\nAnd or in in the integrity of
