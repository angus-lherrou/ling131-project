timing is everything once Halloween and I was in the mood really to do a spooky showed at night and I just didn't know where to start you know you got so many things to choose from you just don't know where to go sort of funny [laughter] today I was I was I was looking over my science articles for my coping service\nI saw one of the most God awful looking creatures today oh my gosh I drink is things with skin crawl is thinking about it okay so\nThis creature looked like a bright red chicken without a head and was swimming and writing in water\n[laughter] by ... it gave me the creeps it really did\nI mean this this creature okay I'm not kidding he looked like a floating chicken with its head chopped off\nOkay it's strange it was it was the was pinkish read it was an entity with a body like a slump breasted in decapitated chicken ... and they called it the headless chicken monster\nThis is true it was the mice I that science clippings it I mean scientists that he is if it's all you know true science because you have to look in the true science to see if anything's ... so I saw this thing and I'm thinking it's gotta be CGI it's gotta be crazy right\nBut you know [laughter] I spent\nI spent the whole afternoon\nLiterally reading about the headless chicken monster you're probably laughing but it's true headless chicken and you know ... chicken those who have listened\nTo my show know about the famous ... if I can find it I'll play it they know about the famous chicken rent okay it's a well known story it's a legendary ground zero story about how I went to a Halloween party and\nI came back just a little bit tipsy went on the air it's first time I've ever done that 'cause I don't\nGo on the air and drunk or you know high or anything but I went on the air this was when I was local and I was feeling a little test you went to a great party in the afternoon it was one of the afternoon parties thought I'd be okay came on the air\nAnd I just started you know talking shooting from the hip shooting from the hip I started getting to how terrified I was of chickens okay and the reason why I'm terrified of chickens is because when I was a kid\nI once tried to sneak in my backyard from a field okay and there was the barbed wire fences next door to this this family that we because we lived out in this rural area called mid veil Utah\nAnd next door to us was this a Mexican family I mean they were they spoke Spanish they just beginning of she kept the kids spoke English but uh just barely and uh I used to have a kid named junior but he was really Jose and he spoke English ... broken English but I decided\nTo sneak home from school and go through the field crawl through the barbed wire barb wire fence it was to keep that roosters and the chickens from getting I crawled into the barbed wire fence got attacked\nBy the head rooster just poking my face just eat the debt tacking me and it was like I'm bleeding I'm getting attacked it's like something out of Alfred Hitchcock's the birds right but it's chickens\nChickens and most are just attacking me right and just talking at my face\nAnd Iran to my mom Iran and my dad I'm bleeding and so my dad goes over\nOf course the old man's over there man he's drunk the easiest drunk and my dad says your rooster my son in law is new\nAnd so I guess Miguel who is one of the older\nKids saw me bleeding and he said that's it so he went and he got himself a rake and he went any chased after the rooster what the raking finally hit it and there'd been goes\nAnd it just stops\nSo he grabs a knife and he grabs the nicotine chicken ... which is ... head off the chicken right and then the damn rooster comes\nAfter me [laughter] you know you're a little kid right to things coming up you will do anything with its\nHead chopped off and these are bad enough Jose thought it was funny he went he grabbed the chicken or the chickens foot\nAnd he found the nerve on the end of the chicken footing pull on the chicken ... the chickens handle it would it cost you know it costs these poor women are terrifying as a kid right terrified\nHad experience with ... and we went to a place called we were farm where to go visit my folks at Christmas Time I told them it was a Thanksgiving when you go totally am today we'll get a ... a a nice uh uh you know pumpkin pie good wheeler farm hang out go see the animals there were horses or anything and so they weren't chickens\nAffiliates like what four or five years old six years old at the time and he thinks the rooster chase after me scared of the good and I said you know what\nYou like me you're just like me man we have problems with chicken so we're we're going to do is we're going to go to KFC [laughter]\nGet some chicken even told me he has his great idea for a horror film with chickens so he and I both bad week we've had our experience with chickens but seeing this\nHorrible\nBreasted that cap and David chicken swimming through the ... I spent the whole afternoon just looking for information on this creature because how terrified I Am of chickens and I was thinking of this creature was from my nightmares materialize in the real world and after a whole afternoon of obsession\nI found out the creature how to name it was a real thing it wasn't some you know optical illusion CGI it's called\n... ... is a senior and it ... me that's a Spanish she does and it ... states and it being asked is ... or\nThe sea cucumber it's called the sea cucumber\nApparently scientist recently caught video of this\nCucumber it's bizarre hen mimicking aquatic demon in the southern ocean it's sort of looks like it's like it's quite a demon uh it's in the southern ocean Near Eastern Antarctica\nIt's never been seen that before they've been seen in the Gulf from what I understand so footage is showing this colorful\nSea cucumber drifting through the water fins at the top of the bottom of its TBI translucent lab body but just ... it looks

long time to get here oh I get them excited the first is not that far away and then she today and she and then we take\nIraq I should get out and have fun and put those catch frog declined trees yeah on\nSo they're really fascinated by the sea cucumber gave me the creeps ... really weird\nIs that uh it got me thinking about second genesis and what's second genesis is is well scientists have said\nSome have suggested that there is there was a a there is a world where was the second genesis that took place in the beginning in the beginning God created having the you're got also created and having an haven't and heaven and heaven and earth and urge and earth an earth meaning there were several genesis\nUh beginnings several different ones ah where\nThere's a fifty percent chance of of the life forms which opposed the norm and they do exist and sometimes they show up and when they show up we don't know what you call the window would do with him and I'm not talking about big for it I'm not talking about the Loch ness monster I'm not going to any of those things I'm Talking about things that you know you look at them and you get a second look\nLike this chicken swim so that set chicken feed this set chicken monster type creature that I have in my uh uh I have in my article today a but when you're looking at the multiplicity of creation and you're looking at how the diversity of multi versus unseen and the multiplicity\nBe anxious would call that the underworld creatures from the underworld they'll come up from nowhere like the Demi Moore gone from you know stranger things or you know I don't know if anything that\nExtreme but still I mean stranger things called the upside down we called the abyss or\nThe timeline of creation and the ... we here too are the ones that have been handed down through millennia and each one is unique it's interpretation of where the concepts pretty much\nAre the same wherever you look so scientists are speculating\nSciences are speculating that strange organisms that might be alienated nature exist on the planet and\nThere isn't a very far jumped to suggest that stranger life exist on the planet that well you've never seen before and that if you were to blow up in the shadow biosphere lurks every monster ... no one even wants\nTo see or or take on or have contact with there was another creature that I saw that somebody was kind enough to actually send me a picture of this thing it's called the bangles one I don't know if you've ever seen a penguin but uh I saw a Bengal\nEnded they for the first time I've never heard of a penguin in my life it looks like a mini Godzilla with armor\nLooks like something from a Japanese horror film tiny thing it looks like a cross between ... and even an armadillo\nAnd uh so he says will bring up the ... the ... isn't terrify but I I think the penguin it's cute but it's also scary looking because I have this armor all over its body and it kind of like conscious over like God ville it looks like it could take out a\nA you know it it was big enough you could take out Tokyo that that's how we're to see these ... we're creatures that nobody is seen before or they've seen them or they\nCan identify but didn't know what they are and this is what I mean by second genesis these are things that\nYou know you've heard of unicorns yeah right well you know this is a lot different than I think there's a lot different than that you okay you know and I'm not talking about big for it I'm not talking about the Loch ness monster this is beyond my band is beyond the plot which monster these are things that you see and you're like going what the hell is this and it's something that's never been seen\nOn in search of somebody's never been talked about on coast to coast day I'm not saying that it you know I've talked about really right and I know about that I've seen and you know that ... this reminds me of the mist gave the movie the mistreatment of missed\nIt was a it was a novella and it was also a a movie okay and the idea that\nYou know there are some quantum joke\nScience can beat us with dimensional theories the point to the possibility\nThat there are areas of planet wear the veil is spinner or\nSome extra dimensional board checks for a second genesis occurred parallel to our own and their locations throughout the planet which suggested to be the most powerful due to their position me be appropriate which will perform there by the right to fish it could actually be a cleansing moment for the planet\nIt could open the best new creatures could come out and take I mean we're being warned\nThat there are wormholes reporter was that could be open through ritual or through the auspices of super collider is like CERN and those real introduced can pass through and hot mankind and change the direction of the future\nAnd as I said you know the mist they had a project they're like ... it was called arrowhead arrowhead project and\nThe whole catalyst for the story was a dimensional breach\nProject arrowhead actually creates this miss and rain that involves a small town in during the night large insect like creatures are seen and Tara doctor like creatures attack livestock and small pets eventually these creatures attack humans as well\nThose horrifying creatures from the film we're known as the great would a worse and it can only be described as deadly spider like predators each about the size of a small dog\nIn these creatures produce corrosive Web strands which burn through materials like coughing flesh and both\nThe book in the film great widow where's simply killed their prey would they're acidic Web strands but in the film they also have the ability to capture and hundreds of eggs in the living human host\nThe eggs say goodbye the data hatch and they multiplied quickly now the looks of these creatures were terrifying and there were even some\nThat were the size of a human being Ruben ... remember the there was a show called mimic I didn't know that uh don't Toro did the show mimic is one of my favorite scary movies\nBecause of the fact that this is Roach or whatever it is\nGets to be the size of the human and you get to see it looks like a man in black standing there in the subway but it's not it's a big mop like creature scary looking creature\nSee when you're looking at these creatures in the midst are you looking in in in the movie like mimic these creatures or turn up by the end and and you know if they're the size of a human being even worse than it was explained by the producers okay other movie\nAnd then they said we based many of the creatures\nOn supposed a second genesis creatures that were proposed by ...\nThey were based on real animals but from an alien ecology admittedly dangerous wild animals promote more brutal ecosystem that we are not familiar with but still basically just animals\nOf flesh and blood nothing supernatural about them okay but they are from a second genesis ecosystem\nBrutal ecosystem is the same ecosystem that the scientists at CERN and when a guy by the majority rows\nHave talked about with regard to opening dimensions and allowing these wild creatures in for study journey rose is a co founder and chief technology officer of the wave\nWhich is a Canadian company sewing machines that he claims exploit quantum mechanical effects to solve
