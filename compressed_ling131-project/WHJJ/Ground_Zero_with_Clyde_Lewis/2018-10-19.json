the arrival of something called me and PC although NBC's had been around for a long time what they are really is the computer controls characters in video games and the problem\nWith it that they have these limited scripted responses like they show up when they go here try this or here here's buying three or would you like to go here that's what it is it basically gives you an idea where you need to go next\nAlthough I I don't know if there are any and PCs in Fort Night because I've been watching we in place for it I don't really know of any real because it's not like a squad they're all\nFighting everything else but I mean like in skyrim or fall out\nThere are characters that are known as NBC's they basically babble scripted responses they're limited they don't really do any me just give the parameters of the game\nSo that's why they call\nThat's why they're using this and PC me which is basically this nondescript looking character\nTo describe those who repeat the script or the left and what we're talking about is is like for example you know orange guy oh it's orange guy you know calling President Trump orange guy that's an NBC term or um what's another one a dog President Trump doesn't like immigrants well why is his wife\nAn immigrant you know NBC\nOr it's just a bunch of things where you you've heard them right like you know KKK everybody who's outright as KKK everybody who's the conservatives KKK or they're they're racist that's an NBC\nMeaning these people have a limited they have a limited fountain to draw from and that was dropped from the same things and they always say the same things to people who are trying to express themselves and it and even if you sound just a little bit on the right\nThe un PC lap will come in and they'll say well they'll do that so that's why they're called NBC's may have caused a lot of anger\nThose you see them feel that they're ... the humanizing well this is a humanizing us that's the point I mean yeah if you don't like the main create your own\nUh yeah it is there to the human I'd been basically saying you're robots your robots they're following a program and you're listening to the program\nAnd it goes on the other side too I heard so many programs responses whenever you say anything that he was in this little bit of criticism to Donald Trump people go how Jared you he's a man of God and you like what\nHe's the president of the United states he's not\nA man of God he's not the messiah he's not going to turn water into wine\nAlthough he can't turn wine into something else but the catch [laughter]\nI'm just saying you can't do that for some reason in this country so the NBC name mocks left basically making them out three expression listed appearance by like in behavior I mean that's when a causal\nObservers right they just stand there occasionally say oh this is the door make all up here it's like it's like being one of those talking maps make a left three hundred feet ... that's kind of a an NBC just kind of given you directions that doesn't have the limited script they said the same thing over and over again\nAnd so if you go to Facebook or if you go to your Twitter or read

that it's all pre programmed response is and they\nDon't I don't know if you're getting or you want to say\nYeah I'm understanding that said but it's going to be said that basically what they've done is they've created this nondescript I call it a monkey was looking type characters ... it's a great pretty much a grave faced ... character\nTo dodge ride down seven nose and mouth really plane just to stay there\nAnd they basically put it over the basis of those that always give out the same program scripted line like you know fascism or not the or whatever\nAnd uh and I think it's very effective because it basically explains that people are tired of hearing the same old lines from people on Twitter and Facebook Twitter and Facebook are responding my saying well this is sort of an

into perspective without letting anyone know that secrecy tucked away and all of our utility drawers he's a tinfoil hat that will probably where it because we know that no one truly lives in the universe is fully objective\n\nI mean what we're seeing limited concepts of time or hearing about how there are different dimensions we're hearing about there are different ways of thinking we're hearing that you know we're hearing in the quantum immortality I mean science is basically going all paranormal\nAnd they want to quantify all the paranormal in a scientific way scientific way like ah they want to be halfway with their religion and they want to eat half way with the conscious if they want to do ... and this is where I was looking for about how\nHere we are in a ship this ... this is a a major paradigm shift\nAnd we have a temporal blind spot in some regard because events happened or we perceive they do\n\nAnd then later we're schooled on the idea that everything we perceived\nAs wrong\nIs that what we think we know is not exactly what is in that somehow we reach a point\nWhere we're satisfied with their opinion and then all of that it's based on his bowl nebulous stimuli we all agree to this and it's like this is my opinion and this is my truth and you say\nWell it's not true if it's just what you think it is see it's all about your selective perception\nAnd we know that selective perception is necessary because we didn't have selective perception we wouldn't be transfixed by the hyper reality and sensory overload we're now getting today our brains are being filled with all sorts of sensory overload thing about it we have simple perceptions of light\nLifelike love survival spirituality God you know and then we're exposed to media print television Internet videogames\nCell phones many other things that you know that are pushing the brain further and further\nAnd all that stimulus his place in a limited area known right there and compartmentalize area called the brain we don't know if the brain is limitless and we have we've learned that in old age would be [laughter] whose memory\nAnd we lose perception of time I mean the brain can be objective it chooses to however it's emotion that is driving these guys and so there's this war going on between the brain\nAnd subjective experience and this is what they call the explanatory gap where we've had to bridge the brain conscious is experiencing motion critical announces we're struggling with primary consciousness right now where we wonder if the experiences worth feeling it all we get this shoveled in this disenchanted experiences and feelings we get now are both natural and organic\n\nAnd of course now we experienced virtual meaning hyper reality from electronic illusion and it's unfortunate that we're seeing more and more people\nResponding to the electronic illusion they're becoming a non player they're becoming a person who just sits there and watch it watch things or you know go in front of them they they they decide that you know it's better to read the script that it is to follow the follow their own hearts follow their own minds\n\nSo there are a lot of people that are getting ... right now\nOver what George Orwell called double speak double speak actually disguises the nature of the truth\nGiving new meaning to words with what appeared to be scripted dialogue and it's provided by the party and it's never ending propaganda that keeps pushing and pushing and pushing see many people have\nNot had the the time nor the guests desire to read the book Nineteen eighty four uh by George Orwell usually you know they say things like a big brother's watching you ride ha ha ha you know or you know ignorance is strength or you know that kind of stuff they they know a few lines right\nBut big brother was not only watching in Orwell's dystopian he was capable of brainwashing and skipping the drones or groom to follow the wishes of the ministry of love\nThe George Orwell was a British Intelligence officer and with his ability to see the possible future he predicted a totalitarian world where the government had corrupted the language forced the citizenry to believe lies as if there were truth and they were being tracked with a ubiquitous tell a screen\nThat was basically extent in every home place of business in public facility today we are still the screens that are attached to our hands\nThere and virtually every communication device so you're the first thing we look at it in the morning there the last thing we see at night\n\nThey are programming the masses with emails music can means and with every algorithm we're slowly being coerced into following anything that seems to be calling our confirmation bias\nSo this process we're not only beginning to wonder if someone is watching us we're also noticing that somebody is scripted us or is it Lee ... some people and acting like\nWhat are now being called non player characters see non player characters are NBC's or the newest me that have appeared on Twitter and Facebook and they seem to be a form of kind of propaganda against the liberal left\nOut\nAnd NBC has a mean there are there are NBC's in games gamers though an end PCs are okay I'm actually NBC's or computer control characters and video games with limited scripted responses I'm given the parameters of the games which they appear for example NBC's may assigned missions to a player like skyrim\nOr they joined a player as a companion like in fall out but they create is NBC mean\nAnd what it is is that it's basically there to um to attack or a mock what it's called left wing propaganda\nAnd I think ... cleverly I I think it's being used cleverly to explain what we usually hear his program responses regarding things like fascism\nWhere it's like not being overused outright connections to the KKK and the NBC me mocks left us and they make it it's basically getting expressionless\nFaces kind of like I'm a statement face of it and you can see these things on Twitter read it in ... and over the weekend Twitter responded by suspending more than Fifteen hundred accounts associated with the MP seem as they claim it violated the terms of service namely intentionally misleading election related content\nSeveral months ago unfortunate and read it online you know where you go to look at messages on the porch and read it they started using the turn and PC\nTo refer to liberals and these people said well they said that you know they've joined the anti Trump crowd because they're sheep\nThey're brainwashed she that's what they believe in and they'd been conditioned to pair it left wing orthodoxy in the matter of scripted characters so when you look at one of these and PCs they're basically this crudely drawn great cartoon avatar has a pointy noses in a blank face\nAnd it's just like a stick figure face in fact if you remember back in Nineteen eighty four when apple had their little commercial about uh the computer and all these people are sitting the masses we're seeing that they're all balls and kinda like staring like zombies that's exactly what this is\nThe actual symbol of at that sort of big brother drone image if you show a [noise] this is a program in a counter programming who left and ah it's certainly a\nIs working [noise] there's really irritating view it what it says it is what's really interesting it's got me thinking a lot\nAbout how this kinda simplify things that makes it appear like we are easily program was born

letter forward NBC is mob one letter a woman or backward that's just amazing did you did you come up with that\nI'm no somebody else I Can't take credit for that one but I it just goes to show in my humble opinion the um program nature of reality in itself\nDuring the last segment you brought up the movie pie and within that movie they talk about the code that exist within the Torah\nAnd so every letter within the Torah is assigned a number and then those numbers um you take mother an added up to the number that father is and then you get I think it's like one forty four and then child it equals to one forty four and so it's really a string of code that we're looking at here\nAnd everything is built upon these numbers um as I mentioned before professor gates had found this computer

was all a big joke then Trump won the primary\nAnd I thought hey that's a coincidence then he became the candidate and I thought things were getting weird now Hillary\nHe's getting sick again I Know you know she's she's been coughing and they've been getting it on on on\nOn TV lately\nAnd the thing is is that this all goes back to Pepe the frog\nWhich was a character that they were using to a ... that was I guess a precursor\nTo the un PC and they're saying you're you are ... with the fabric of reality this is black magic please stop you are\nAt being with powers you don't understand if you keep this up you could me must all out of existence [laughter] Christians do I I mean is this a form of\nBlack magic I mean I thought about that you know I never did talk about Pepe the frog and the reason why is because I Know what the frog represented a lot of people had mixed\nMixed feelings about ... was another one of these meetings where they used ... to represent a lot of things from\nRacism to what have you it was kind of ... he was just a stupid frog but he was a menacing it was a medicine type of me now they have the monkey with this balding it looks like actually one of the characters that officer Crowley and that kind of dreamed up\nWell\nYou know what's interesting is um it's central magic as you mentioned before and essential is when an outcome Mr Black magician will take a series of letters or symbols\nAnd you may not necessarily recognize them but I notice that this Pepe the frog guy he was he was drawn very strangely just like these NBC's The NBC means are trying very strangely now\nI'm not that familiar with a cult symbolism but I'm pretty sure that if you look at ... work or something like that you can find something similar with a similar type of symbol\nThat's being blasted on the human consciousness him over and over and over again\nAs a matter of fact I'm Crowley how to spell that he used to do and this was something that he was very famous warm it used to be able to take control of the body of one of these and PCs and he was why there's a story of him walking down the street with a some prime minister or something like that and he says watch this\nAnd he points to the guy in front of him any needles down and the guy in front of him starts kneeling down almost as he is controlling them like a puppet\nNow if one person can do this and matching what's going on through the Internet through the mainstream media so on and so forth and people have lost their ability to think if I can take a political here for just a moment I'm coming into this\nSelection I've just been so jaded by the oligarchy that we've had that I thought I was just going to be the same BS coming through the pike and then when Trump got it I was still a little skeptical but I'm looking at Trump and thinking wow I Can't find any fault in this guy\nI mean you know I don't agree with everything he does but considering what we've had in the past Trump is has actually done a really good job the only thing I can fault him for\nIs that he likes to eat a steak well done with ketchup which to me I think should be an impeachable offense to ruin an outbreak like\nThat I mean you look at is ... times but you know he's the president and I mean president said act that way before I mean Bush acted like one Cheney was a bigger one of the magic Cheney president\nBut the thing is we're not voting at a personality were voting in somebody you can be the commander in chief and that's what I look at it or not we you know everybody wants to have that

intelligent program or we have no it was the power of means symbols numbers and coats\n\nAnd this is white tonight the argument that we're making Chris Jewish Riggio her on the program Dr ... the argument that we're making is that we live in a matrix and the reason why is because in PCs\nPlaying characters are easily programmed to put the organics the ones that are ... they use a good I'd say

will go back to ground zero it's good to have a year\n[noise] um let me finish up this point I was making real quick about the politics because here we have the mainstream media\nI'm putting out a program and the program has been racist racist racist racist thrown at the White House right and then all of a sudden Kanye West shows up and he has this meeting at the er at the White House and what I saw was the dissolve meant of the ... agenda [noise]\nUm to divide on race and then the mainstream media turns around and uses a derogatory term against ... that I Will not repeat on this brought

seat\nOn CNN calling ... n word that can read is what he said\nExactly and so all of a sudden what happened is that the script just changed on the PCs and they don't know how to handle this and it just goes to show they're just running a script or that they've been pre programmed with\nSo um you were talking about numbers and number so symbolism and numbers play a big big role in this you were talking about the ... and PC means the way the means or ... and so on and so forth I mean there are so many different levels that we can take this too and I'm\nFrom what direction do we break this

other magical terms of people are more familiar with like ... ah there's a ... a mind form that\nThat when you manifested becomes an ... which is of course another recalled concept which is a thought
