were saying that what he did was unconstitutional and and would be a and I think there is somebody actually suing him for what happened there but we also have a governor here and that is very corrupt she's actually a bear a lot of things that she's doing right now\nBut in my opinion uh would would probably weren't arrest as well for some reason we have two very corrupt leaders\nA mere Portland it's a corrupt leader and the mayor and a and a new governor of Oregon and corrupt\nAnd both of them are in power right now and so even if they're gonna wait it out to the election but in my opinion something's got to be done sooner than later and a ... and this is why we're in the position right now and I yeah I don't normally I don't normally talk about local politics I leave that up to a guy
