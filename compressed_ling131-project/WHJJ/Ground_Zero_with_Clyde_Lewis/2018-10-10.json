was that he has been out in the middle of his towards the end of their civil war that was there the dirty war but it was more of a civil war\nI saw civil war and a whole new light it was different than the two sided civil war we have in the Eighteen hundreds it was or something else it was civil war in\nContemporary time it was it was civil war in a in a in a major city\nWhen I say when a Saudi as I'm sure many of you think that it's just some backward city in South America no it's it's actually a South America is\nSpain or France or or or it it had the feel of Italy or France or or Spain or

control\n\nI mean we have new laws and you have executive orders that pretty much have all the president\nThe act of emergency powers act I mean he can make plans any time to just\nArrest people you know and I've heard the rumors that that's probably in the works some sort of a\nArrest structure somehow they're going to go after they're just making the plans to see if they can legally go after

not really yes liberals are doing it more so we're seeing more of the liberals doing it because of the unpopular votes and the unpopular choices that they don't particularly like and yet they are going psychotic\nBut there are some that are responding bitter justice psychotic levy a those are the right there responding so\nYes everyone is driving a nail into the cockpit of America\nSo one side to the other teams actions that we're ... we're basically motivated by sure emotionally now been motivated by fearless rage it's beyond emotion now it's all about right and this is getting dangerous while it would be prudent to tell people\nThat perhaps it's time to heal and choose our battles no one will listen because there are been debt is to be settled in revenge is a dish but his best serve cold in America\n\nSo whenever I speak of civil war ... civil of people in America I often get told that it will never get that bad quiet and then I fear mongering for the sake of quakes are ratings or whatever you think I'm doing well I always say back to people\n\nBut it certainly cynics bitter theory in order to keep telling yourself in America is still United however it appears that that ship has sailed and they're living through a civil war in South America can teach you what to expect and it just a real experience that I talked about that and the first hour\n\nI mean I Want to make it clear that during a civil war in a modern day in a modern city modern city like when I ...\nI mean life was normal except for little things would make you wonder if you would make it through the day or if you will be able to do routine things I mean I can imagine the United states the civil war would be similar\nExcept that we have the Internet that's the difference say I mean the outbreak of a civil war in the United states wouldn't look all that different to the normal news cycle\nRegularly you know and that's the thing that I think people don't understand it doesn't look different than the normal news cycle and what they would regularly report it's the same thing I mean it begins with something like a politically motivated mass shooting\n\nAnother example would be a biological attack on the United states either in a major city or direct you to Congress or to the president\n\nI Know I've talked about the final blow I don't know if that was the final blow but he's certainly sent the ball rolling\nBecause there was a political attack using rice sit a poison that was aimed at certain people including the price of the United states if they would have sent all that their members of Congress we would have had an attempt to the decapitation exercise\n\nWe all know that the anthrax attack happened in two thousand one after nine eleven attacks Seattle we have the right to check that happened just before the cabinet vote\n\nWe talked about the Russian ... called an al ... tried to use biological warfare is a way to get people not to vote or to somehow change the direction political you have an area here in in Oregon I mean these are simple politically motivated attacks\nAnd these attacks are usually supposed to not only change directions politically but they're also there to generate copycat attacks\n\nAnd these can be both domestic terror attacks in foreign attacks whose sole purpose is generating a backlash they're simply done in order to provoke a response if the response is overwhelming and police departments can keep up with a politically sectarian violence then we will see the next phase of civil warfare\nAnd that is the domino effect if there is an insurgent\nAnd a domino effect you shouldn't play military crackdown on any kind of insurgency will be inevitable this will be your martial law scenario except it will either be the military working with an already militarized police or the police working against the military\n\nThere are also be restrained to start with how or if it\nIf there is an insurgency there will be some re straight at first but then the insurgency military weapons martial law all these things can be applied to a situation I\nDon't know if they'll go that far but it can be applied I mean there's a misconception that in a modern civil war there'll be two sides\nAnd the reason why we think this\nIs because we look back in history and we all know that it would be union believed to be into less slavery and the confederation really being more slavery but most people are thinking right now but if there was a civil war in the United states it would be two sided and that's it\n\nLike Republican against Democrat conserve against liberal know about how it's going to be a stop with civil war will be in the United states if this happens you know it's not modern civil war would have many so called sight\nSeeing the dirty war South America there were several sides were fighting there were the parent it's kind of nice fits the radical threat of cottage the communist called me and he steps but not seats the Catholic Church the Jews sewn into the police the moderate in a plaza I could go down all the list of who are fighting against to\n\nThe each group would have their own band of terrorists carrying out executions abductions and torture\nOf course the government had access to the police they had access to corrupt cops had access to ... military and so of course the government utilize them whenever they could the church would utilize them as well you're pope by the way was part of that group\nFeeding America we'd have a left wing group incite violence or insurgency that which Parker response from black lives matter or me too but all eyes would be on anti ... because they're usually the ones that carry out all this stuff\nOn this stuff hits the fan\nOver the weekend there was a vigil in Portland, Oregon for Patrick ... there was a black man\nWho was shot by police afterwards members of anti ... block streets directed traffic getting harassed drivers and other people the police booked on and allow the harassment to happen it was horrible\n\nAnd elderly man who made the mistake of not following orders of anti pot what's called a racist at a Nazi among other things and there was chased down by an angry mob where they proceeded to use ... times and other weapons the damages vehicle\nBut police looked on\nThe driver says he was following two other cars that made the right hand turns instead of a left when one protester stepped in front of his car or the other surrounding the man was out numbered\nProbably scared and did not know what you did wrong the truth is he did nothing\nWrong and it could have wound up\nWith him being beaten shot once again to police book Don didn't do anything didn't intervene\n\nYeah I got about three thousand dollars worth
