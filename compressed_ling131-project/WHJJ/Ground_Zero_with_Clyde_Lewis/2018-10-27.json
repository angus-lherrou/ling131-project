felt that uh to me\nSeemed like an attack by an entity um so uh I was on the year when it happened in um it was terrifying\nAnd I and I I always tell a story that when I was there and it was all going down\nUm\nI feel a little sick to my stomach because it was like a something was or something surrounding me and I could not break away from it and I started crying I was on the air when it happened\nBut I always tell people the reason why I was crying was not because of the fact I was scared I mean I knew something was going on and it was like it was uncomfortable because it's the thought of not being able to say goodbye to your wife\nIs that was in California and uh I was on the air and uh just the thought of not being able to see my wife\nAnd if it was going to be the end of me I I just thought it would be so devastating that um\nYou don't get a chance to say goodbye to both my mother and my father\n\nMy mother in her own little way had a chance to say goodbye to me

two was going to be removed he'd die and he didn't want to be resuscitated\nAnd so he passed away\nAnd uh you know a lot of people have had those moments where after a loved one has passed away they have contacts somehow in a dream or they seem in a crowd or something you would have claimed to you know gotten a phone call\nAnd a lot of people of course you know they say hey you know this happens but I never got maybe it's because I got the good buys from my my parents before they passed if some people aren't that lucky they don't have the goodbyes is so sometimes I'm sure\nAnd they say sixty percent of the time this happens is that most people you know come in contact with a dead loved one within days after they pass away they come to him in a dream or they appear to them in a room where you see them in a crowd or you know something indicates sat there with you that their presence was there\nAnd\nYou know a lot of people say well there are new such things as ghost well I I Would I Would beg to differ there's something about\nThe other side there's something about the spirit realm it's it's fascinating I mean go shore spirit mnemonic communication they show up often in classic literature including mythology there in the Bible\nUm I remember Shakespeare utilize go a lot in his place and you all it back to uh go back to a Victorian England India was fashionable then in many

they were used to try and conduct the dead Edison actually Thomas Edison created a um he's tried to create a Mickey as we could use ... contact the dad and what happened was instead of contacting the daddy he created somebody can record the debt\n\nAnd what I mean by that is that we listen to a Jim Morrison album we know he's dead but we can still hear his voice Patsy Cline like a ghost you listen to her on a record and she's singing crazy\nIt's like you're listening to a ghost mean prince Michael Jackson are both gone but yeah we're hearing them on records they're like goes\nGoes on phonograph dose recorded for posterity something that Edison had done rather than communicating with dead we are able to keep a dead in a bottle we can play them or listen to them or talk to them in that way\nAnd then of course there are those who say they preserved a lot of what the dead think a lot of what the dead possessed by writing pages and pages\nOf what can be called automatic writing I mean a psychic chains allegedly guide the ghost to convey these lengthy handwritten messages and said since that time since the time of all the you know the communications\nYou know go seem to have lost their will or ability to writer even communicate effectively now so we have to use electronic voice phenomena ... electronic voices and so the spirits can be channeled through mediums or they can be channeled through electronic means that can come through your computer or your phone but everybody's had this experience because we've done these shows about this before\n\nBut see\nA lot of the time

I didn't get a chance to ask you we um did you have you ever used the board at all\nI'm usable many times and what have you used it for\nFive used it to try to talk to friends that have asked them and study the board of my uncles told me\nAnd he was more he was ah my grandfather was was kind of an old school guy but the young my uncle was more of a funny it will actually he said that\nBob shed that close to every murder everything is in the board so I've been I studied the board at all these years really since the seventies\nAnd I figured a certain clues in the board there all these little if it's it's unusual you look at the border all the\nAll the little clues but I don't have the answers to\nTo most of them the one I just got the longitude and latitude one crime scene is on the board [laughter] that that I see I think is true and then the uh he said the eyes monkey felt that the eyes all the sets of eyes\nIn front of your credit score a what a difference a lower interest rate makes one thousand dollars in monthly savings and even greater savings over the life of your loan folks don't wait any longer it just takes ten minutes to get started and you may be able to closing as fast as ten days\nCalled eight eight eight nine nine eight eighty twenty eight eight eight nine nine eight eighty twenty or online at American financing dot net American financing and in my last one to three three for ... consumer access that [laughter]\nI\nRemember hearing about I'm pregnant with her by providing\nArms are hungry for power provider problem like on my car reporter for less than\nFive\nDollars and I was ready to move on board is by the along with him and bring them bomb bomb bomb or earlier with him about his life and how we seem to have this war and how we inherited\nIt from his great uncle and you were saying also that ah\nYou know you have a you know that you said you have a skin so affected disorder\nAnd and you said it and I was talking with a friend of mine and she was telling me about how some people when they're touched by mental illness some of them believe that they may have been touched by the spirits in other words they have just open contact at all times\nAnd I was just curious if you know you said you use the board and you said you had contacts with friends who have passed do you believe that outside of the use of the board that perhaps you get messages are you sometimes get word from either friends who have passed or maybe even some of the victims of Bob\n[noise] I think you know the the main thing they say when you and schizophrenia is that if you have it as a child that's the worst kind that I didn't have it as a child and so I didn't get it wasn't until later that [noise]\n... ... down to [noise] you know a number of them said that I had to affective disorder which is\nUm characterized by a lot of depression and and you kind of seeing elusive nations and things [noise]\nBut if you have if I'm On my medication it's not that serious with me so I Can't blame it all on that you know and I am a I can tell you\nMy intuition\nIs that it really is working 'cause I've I've talked to people I mean I I had I put it this way I had some celebrity people came to talk to me personally you know and I I'm just ... I'm just an average person\nBut I had some celebrities talking and they wanted the board and one lady who who son committed suicide had the board and she ... originally the board was just\nThe same image but I put it on would ... with blue you know what I made a color copy ... [noise] and so I ... a lot of people in Los Angeles used it\nIn one very famous actress and his son had killed himself and she reached out to us meaning me and my friend and I sent the board\nAnd she said that she had spoken to him repeatedly and thanked me and she's a very famous she's dead now a convention or if you if\nYou don't you go ahead who is the way she was from the tech Van Dyke show Mary Tyler Moore and she was very sweet very kind Rosemarie no she was Mary Tyler Moore\nOh Mary Tyler Moore was on the Dick Van Dyke shattered show on her own shows weren't time and more\nNow but she was very she was searching for ways to communicate\nAnd just understand so it is out of it so in other words what I'm saying is is to not just the evil you can you can ... you know to channel would you want I think um [noise]\nWas naive and he put he put this together to talk to his victims and then you realize they're going to come and they come back\nAnd haunted him and he kept on driving around at one point in my grandfather who was who is in one day and then a month later he was in another town another town and then it caught up to them and that's [noise] um I think that's why he just and he killed himself he drowned himself\nAnd his body was never found\nNo but he turned my he sent my grandfather a note I saw the note than it was typed because he never would write in freehand bomb number wrote anything down and he were type it or you stand so\nWhat did he say what was his last words in the letter\nSaid that he can't take it anymore because of the\nThe the stress that he's being haunted he says he made a mistake by making the board and people were haunted him that he has hurt and then he he went into it was a Jersey beach town and walked into the water he said he was going to do it anyway and the letter\nAnd no one ever saw him again so my grandfather who was a much ... are held to a man like stable man and he loved he loved Bob for all his faults and he said

said that he will hardly think I shall meet the test is power disclose the path to forecast the future\nSo we know that the industry of the the talking board enter into the community of the spiritual Smith meant and also in the United states only that it was an Eighteen Ninety the we used to board that we know today got its start\nIn Eighteen Ninety One it was patent and trademark and was in production at that point so there's only so much interesting stories about that but an Eighteen Ninety to Canada\nBought some rights from us the United states to sell their own version of the leader board and so they started making ... an Eighteen Ninety two and the rest is history and so bored such as Bob sports which again falls into the category of talking boards\nA lot of sports after the ... made such a prominent splash into the market I mean everybody was buying them and you know at the heyday I mean this this has been a spiritual moving with going make time and\nI was going on with their communication at the time that people started making copycat boards and started doing different types of their own type a board and of course we get the trademark patted her name they couldn't use that name\nRight so you have to use different names but I mean this is the story behind this board is rather unique I've never heard anything a particularly unique is the story of of Bob being a a suspected serial killer or making a board ah basically feel that it's almost as if it's penance for him to make this board so that he would feel right about himself\nOr what have you are in his own special way\nI'm just curious if there are any other unique stories behind certain types of boards that have been released in the past\nThere there are many reasons that people make their own boards and as you mentioned earlier people do make their own and start customized and selling them but the degree of this type of story no I've never heard of this story but there are reasons why people make boards and it could just be a personal their own little\nPersonal portal or they want to communicate with the deceased one or they see an opportunity to make money ... there's a lot of different reasons but this is a very unique case um and it's I haven't heard ever heard of a serial killer making aboard before or I shouldn't say he was in a secular he was posted a legit or we don't know if he really was or not\nYeah we we don't know if he did he tricked into somebody mental institutions right in fact a you know\nThat's that's the that's the thing is he avoided a any kind of prosecution because he checked in a mental institution I mean and and since you've been using the board you've gotten longitude and latitude of you submitted any in any of this information to the authorities and if so did they take it seriously\nWell which is kind of awkward because I haven't really [noise] you know this is really just a small thing that I was just selling on on on we just put the color a Xerox is on on board and then I met this guy\nWho used to work for current which is an old TV show or on the wishes on like channel five or something right in the east and um he was really for years he was kind of trying to do something with the board\nAnd he worked on hated like um the show he could like producing I think mhm\nOn current affairs and then he was the one who introduced it to the guys that make these um [noise] it's a company called allied board and they make different games and things and they took it to another level I think it's the same image to same exact\nYou know but then they took it and they just put it on what qualities thing with boxes and everything\nYou know I mean in the background to write the background history\nYeah and they told him everything you know and they put it down to they made it more like a sophisticated I guess\nBut I'm the same story and it's a very good I tell people you know\nNot to I ... I made them put on the heavy under Eighteen years old\nBecause this is real this is really happen this really works\nAnd it's a very scary and if you if you have the wrong intentions and you know everybody is recall goes the same place at the end but says some bad people that are around and they go to you know so you don't want to some of them back\nTo always say that it's a joke ...\nNo I'm a ... and I wanted to ask her and you know I have some idea of criteria that I have you know if I ever use the word I use the board in a long time let's be honest with you to board a gosh I Can't count back maybe I I I've been president during other sessions with boards I mean I Know somebody who has their own board they brought it in one night and they used it wasn't really a board it was just\nSomething that just rolled out like it was a laminated or lemonade peace that had a a crystal glass so they use I mean you know boards can rudimentary like that even even when you see the TV show stranger things that you kind of a mix you bored with Christmas tree lights\nSo that her little boy you could go to the uh the little boy can communicate with his mother his mother\nUm you know ... it doesn't ... we really don't need boards do we care and I mean even the boards of bear a you can channel on your own and you can use a you know automatic writing and other things in my right\nYeah that's a good point and the board is really not doing the work we're doing the work ourselves to pour just becomes a permission slip if you will or it becomes a stepping off jumping off point a springboard and to be able to to access your own ability to this work\nA lot of people don't think that's the case and I didn't think that was the case for many many years but when I realized what was happening here\nWhen I started working the board was at my own six cents ... he started developing really started really being fined tune and taken aboard the way I can still do this work and pay a lot of people and ... and the old days these typewriters [laughter]\nWord processors now they use computer keyboards and the channel that way\nThat's what I find it to board with people at the tactile experience and the movement movement itself that kind of opens up the receptor so you could start bringing in the information and so again I Want to be clear the board there's no negative energy with any board that's why I have no problem\nHaving any board at my home something I got an ... even this board that I'm that great uncle made 'em for his purposes I have no problem with that because I Know nothing negative will happen\nUnless I Want that to happen unless I Try to bring that to me or that my desire or that's how I view the world so people doesn't mean people are scared us even talking about this on the radio or I have\nAre do they they they bring in the they don't understand and and this is what I Want to try and bring out with this whole conversation and they don't understand that a lot of this has to do with what's inside of them and then it's eighty or motor responses are that are basically muscular suggestions are subtle suggestions in the mind that come from the unconscious\nIf it's from deep within dream scape time it's like you're in there and and things come out of you I mean the human body in the brain are big transmitters\nAnd so the only way this can work as a transfer through the body and then the borders you say is like a permission slip but it's like a way to to view I mean people would use pencil but I I used to know a media embed would or would he would do his thing he would just scribble you\nWould take hensel and he would just scribble on a new bad or you just scribbling scribbling that'd be scribbling for some reason just doing the scribble\nHe's looking at going all I see a scribbling but what I what he saw it was something else and so this was his way of I don't know what it was but it was just his way of kind of doing something with his hand Louis mind was bringing in the information from getting it\nFrom so either you're scribbling or using a pendulum are using something else but it certainly is there to have the mind generate or push through the body the motor response but certainly is a interesting when you see it in an action\nTonight on grounds that we're talking about Bob's warrior care and a dominant
