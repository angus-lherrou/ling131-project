{"month": "10", "state": "RI", "station": "WHJJ", "content": "Get you emphasize having a strategy having a plan each and every week here on the show what a strategy that included\nWell there is no cookie cutter for everybody making sure will know it does depend on the individual listener\nBut the key components of a retirement strategy could include of course your current financial picture you know what are your income expenses cash reserve not worth that fix cetera what are your fish and what are your goals was there was a short term a long term\nYour protection needs no insurance to address or most pressing risk you know do you have the proper life insurance so you have proper health insurance is disability insurance something that would be important to you along with the typical you know your home your auto cetera soul looked at\nAnd then your investments are they appropriately position based on your comfort level with risk and now they spread around enough so that we have good asset allocation\nNo retirement income strategy is the key to making all this work because you're gonna have a lot of money but if you don't have a set retirement income coming in is harder to to budget for your retirement expenses and then of course we always want to look at\nTax mitigation as best we can because many people come to us with the largest single asset being their retirement plan which was all pre tax which means what when it comes out it's fully income taxable\nAnd when we look at that and we assume our clients are gonna live twenty plus years what are the tax rates going to be five ten Twenty years from now\nI'm willing to say clearly they're going to be much higher than they are today because of where the federal deficit is says it's been building up\nNot just for one president but multiple presidents over decades you know it's been building up it's not anybody you can point to currently it's been building up for many many many years so it's important to understand that\nAnd understand that if taxes go up you're going to pay a lot more in taxes from your retirement accounts we have strategies to help you kind of\nIn the long run reduce or tax exposure so it's about wealth preservation and wealth transfer that we talk about a lot from our clients to their family\nSo having a well thought out retirement plan intrigues you a number of years for a one three three three eight thousand\nIf you save two hundred thousand or more for your retirement please give us a call we'd love to sit with you\nSee what your vision and goals are for the future and if we might be able to provide some assistance with that if we feel we have a chance then we'll gather your statements do a full report and come back in a couple of weeks and say look here's what we see here's what's good here's what we feel might be able to be improved\nAnd then you decide what you want to do from there are number again for one three three three eight thousand if you save two hundred thousand more of your retirement we look forward to your call\nJeff when you have that strategy and you you're looking at that road map I Would think having an actual strategy something that we can refer back to that is really going to keep people on on the right course her retirement\nAbsolutely you know becomes a lot easier to stray off course when the stock market is behaving rather unpredictably\nBy off course I mean people tend to make financial decisions in the moment that might not be in line with their long term goals so having a formal strategy and plays helps you refer back to it and say oh yeah that's right you know we did talk about there can be some ups and downs on that portion\nSo we're not going to jump out the window because snakes aren't that bad [laughter]\nYou know and so having that they're\nThinking of it as as a providing a certain level of comfort to you because you know it's part of the plan and you know it's been addressed\nYou know not having a financial strategy for retirement just helps you to know all the noise that day to day week to week movements of the market and of course the media attention that is paid to them I keep in mind when it comes to the media\nAre they telling you like all good stuff no their job is to get your nervous so that you tune in whether that's on a TV show a radio show even or the newspaper their job is to try to get your back\nAnd get get you connected so that you're constantly turning on the TV show listening to the radio show or reading the newspaper\nSo when you have a plan you can say yeah we have a plan we've got a professional taking care of us were in good a good place we can kind of relax a little bit let the professionals do their job and will our job is to have fun retiring [laughter] that's your job when you were as are\nStill a big picture of financial strategy that is a great thing to have a leading up to during retirement and pretty much at any stage of your life for that matter so get do you suggest that we sit down and we hammer out a strategy on our own if that ever had that idea\nOr you know if you listen to the media you know do a YouTube or Google you can do it yourself with pretty much everything you know there was there was a story of of a doctor who was up in at the north pole and his appendix burst and he was the only one there\nHe had to operate on himself oh dear I don't know if people remember that we put literally this guy had to take out his own appendix 'cause he was the only one there otherwise you would have died\nNow let's face that is the ultimate do it yourself\nKidding not that he had a choice but my God that's not what you want to do with your investments for your retirement lifespan\n'cause we're looking at making key decisions that are not just for this month this quarter or this year we're talking about potentially two or three decades that can be impacted by decisions you do or do not make appropriately now so what's most important\nIs to sit with the professional that specializes in retirement income planning\nBecause that's the most important thing that you can do so that you have a plan put together that will help keep you focused on the long run and less focused on the day to day ups and downs in the market because we know the market will do both oftentimes that does both in the same day\nRecently there was a big drop like five hundred points midday and then it corrected most of it but it was still down at the end of the day but those are big swings and those I think it's just my personal opinion I think it's more the traders that are causing those bigger swings\nRanching segment of the country not not a big deal here on the east but out west it's a\nIt's shooting writes\nA where they raised on federal lands hello federal lands that means land that belongs to the people of America\nBut a ranch is get to turn their cattle and sheep and whatever are free to re engage\nOn these lambs\nTake it fairly\nNegative in fact the fat or negative\nWhen their animals have to compete to any extent\nWith horses that also Gray's on these public lands\nSo they have a whole segment of the\nGovernment under the department of interior that's set up just to control regulate these wars populations\nBut more often all it's done is the horses are called a wild\nGroup sauces are called using a air planes and helicopters\nAnd an cowboys on the ground\nAnd that corral and instead of some type of sterilization and a implementation of\nA better husbandry\n\nAnd adoption\nUses for these animals\nThey're just corral and a and a huge expense to the taxpayers of the government as well and uh when their numbers become overwhelming\nThe folks at the department of in\nSyria plea to be able to sell them off to a slaughter houses in foreign countries to come back as a food products here and are in the rest of the world where they're\nNot a pretty picture at all\nBut uh not nearly as scary as a recent study that disclose that for the first time\nA wide range study found that there's plastic\nPlastic is almost a big with is almost a hundred percent of the human waste samples that were tested contain tiny bits of plastic\nAnd this is the first time such a study is disclose results like this and it certainly does not bode well\nFor the future of our environment\nOr\nIt is estimated that by twenty fifty\nThe amount of plastic in the oceans will outweigh the amount of fish\nNow that figures extrapolated from car and asked them if some calculations and share it might\nBe a a\nProvided is a bit of drama\n\nMaybe it's not true\nBut just the idea of a area\nThe size of Texas\nThat's a solid mass of waste floating\nAround in the ocean this island the debris is very disconcerting\nAnd it also of course I'm recommends going forward\nThat the health of our planet and consequently the people of Libya\nMight well be compromised\nSo I'm\nSome dangerous times\nI'm a judge last week up held a verdict or\nAgainst a Monsanto\nRelated to a a\nA herbicide\n\nBut yet the three hundred million judgment\nAnalysts predict the eight hundred billion\nLiability\nDown the road for ... who recently emerged with Monsanto\nSo I hear echoes of the ah\nTobacco laws\n\nAnd it's worth much choice or [laughter] they won't win\nIt won't end well for or the chemical companies the liability claims all stack up and they'll mount to a overbearing degree [noise]\nAs they did with the tobacco companies as people continue to suffer the affects of a\nChemical exposure\nBut there is a bright side there there is a\nA bit of a good news out there the offering and that is in Japan\nWhere agriculture is very very intensive\nAs an alternative to a herbicides and other kinds of chemicals or they're actually using ducks [laughter] get this now they're using ducks\nTo eliminate the weeds in the paddy fields and the rice fields because the ... the rice they eat the bugs they

in the basement and they're not getting naturally enough sunlight so I was\nWorking on line to purchase a a girl light and uh\nI was just totally amazed that this one so many and also to grow lights only covers such a small area once you install them at a relatively high water which can you give me a little insight on that please\nOkay the um [laughter]\nNo all mixed panics of um [noise] indoor growing has changed Bob drastically\nUh from what it once was a it used to be that a a sunny window a with an overflow of plants in the space that uh\nWas a constructed with rocks and a sections of artificial illumination\nConstituted indoor growing\nWell now that's all changed\nModern technology has made huge strides both with the type\nThe variety uh the cost of the size\nOf this artificial illumination in its ability to grow a wide variety of plants and I think we have the um the really I Do I think we have the cannabis industry the the homegrown cannabis industry or to thank for this a\nRe utilization if you will lose inspiration that indoor guiding has a felt as a result of the uh increased interest in indoor plants are but still the take away from all this is the best products\nAre wrong with natural sunlight in most cases although the results\nCan either be a map or exceed it many times with artificial light it costs more it takes more time and more work and uh\nIt's a relatively uh less enjoyable I have no say her\nThen working with directly with nature and natural life\nAnd the light cycles and that that's pretty much my take I'm not going to get into I think it's a um a topic well beyond the scope of ... program of the different types of lighting is Ellie will eat lighting there's\nThere there's the traditional lighting there's all kinds of a fluorescent lighting this combinations of lighting a this is fans and humidifiers and and you\nKnow if you have an appreciation Bob for the ability to mimic if you will natural conditions are in a greenhouse you can do anything you can go by and I never appreciated\nThe fan as much as I did mark they started doing the research yeah again I couldn't believe that the Sunday paper so powerful and I never took it for granted\nRight well everyone does\nOr what but when you consider this people growing incredible plants are\nIn basements and garages without the opportunity to utilize any natural light whatsoever and the results in many cases a stunning stunning and before the uh the the candidate is\nThe principal motivated the drive was I have to say was the ... the orchid collectors orchid\nA cultivation lent itself a very much to uh the uh artificial\nUh home guy being sucked a more than any other type of plant\nOr that would make sure yeah and and now we've got people growing
