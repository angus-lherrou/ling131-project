A. S. S. E. Y. and yet for folks who are just tuning in now\nMaybe you could take us back to your check list and you shared this terrific checklist that we should run through just to help assess whether the guidance or getting financially is really solid it's good advice as we transition to retirement\nSure it will just kind of click them off or are they do share or they require to work and your best interests first that that's the key point versus suit ability\nYou know determine if that'd visors currently providing you with advice has the skill set in the know how and the experience to help guide you financially to and through the next phase of life called retirement\nGain assurance of your financial pros looking as the entire retirement puzzle not just a piece of it\nDetermines the financial professionals focus on an overall process you know strategy and the dressing or individual needs or do they seem more intent on making product recommendations before fully understanding your goals and your objectives\nInsists this do you have a written strategy for retirement and have the showed you the results in the analysis that's so important\nA nexus gauge whether you're getting skilled transparent service from that financial professional you work with in Leslie assess whether you're currently on the right track financially for retirement or might this be a good time for a

from me but just because somebody is on the radio it doesn't mean that they have the right fit for you I mean we might be and I hope we are and obviously we are for a lot of our listeners when they when I meet with let's say like but we showed them\nBut it doesn't mean that everybody on the radio is giving you accurate information\nThat they have the proper credentials or they have the focus of retirement planning only as a fiduciary level advice or so so important to dig into that\nAnd then interview a few and pick somebody that you think office in your opinion the best combination of skills services resources and the ability to convey that information to you in a simple matter you know bottom line is is\nYou want someone who's trained and experience in handling the types of retirement issues that you are currently facing\nAn advisor who's there for you to talk with by phone email or in person when you need them you know and do they have a team and advisor who's looking out for your best interests and one who has access to a full range of financial investments and products to help address the unique retirement challenges that you are facing\nAnd then an advisor who sees the big picture not just one little tiny piece of one of your puzzle pieces you know in a device or who be your ally in your guy we consider ourselves like retirement tour guides\nYou know think

get to know each other better see for a good fit and then from there will gather your statements do an in depth analysis so we will come back to you and show you what's is highly technical information\nIn a very simple manner will will pull back the curtain led to peak behind the curtain and see what might happen in the future would rising interest rates be a good thing for your portfolio or a bad thing what about if there is another major stock market decline how might that impact your your bottom line your dollars that you have for your retirement\nWe have software that can actually lay that out for us so it it opens people's eyes and it tells you what your level of risk is on a scale of one two hundred\nAnd we do this on the complimentary basis because we have a passion

certificate down to a\nSimpsons spring in eastern mass right near Stonehenge college and they continue the meticulous restoration of the bottling facility the oldest in North America where they make their a water and their water products are from the spring\nRight in a building that has over six thousand years old and an Saturdays they have their farm to table marketplace all kinds of foods and crafts that uh locally sourced available on Saturdays as well as a tour of the facility\nSo twenty five dollar gift certificate for the correct answer the following question\nOne of the worst leads [noise] you'll ever encounter\nThe most stopping this assistance [noise] difficult to eradicate [noise]\nWith white flowers\nAlthough it doesn't always bloom [noise]\nFoliage that uh [noise]\nAlthough not unattractive [noise]\nJust becomes overwhelming and the guy\nAnd that starts from a cause these ... these tiny rise homes the traveling to the ground and it sprouts up all over the place and uh actually like so many other problematic plants was introduced originally\nAs an ornamental was introduced intentionally as an ornamental or brown cover even so name that plant and it's a twenty five dollar gift certificates\nDo a Simpsons spring market place a good there on any a purchase\nThat you like to make twenty five dollars worth of groceries or especially their water products the legendary a cream soda coffee soda made with real ingredients real a fruit extracts and\nA carbonated or without gas Simpsons spraying the oldest ... in North America so when that gotten a begins to go away right behind the a vegetable plants that are now a born\nTheir products for the year a clean up that area a again compost if there's no disease or insect problems because otherwise uh you provide a habitat right there for potential problems the following season\nAnd of course next year I think about a rotation in the vegetable garden\nThat will change the location where the particular vegetables and herbs and other plants have been wrong and that causes is called a rotation crop rotation on a very small scale\nAs well as on very large tracks of land\nThis preserves a lot of the nutrients in the soil and does not deplete the same\nThe same a vital nutrients year after year which deplete the soil and consequently a diminish\nThe productivity of you're a guy and then areas that are left open can Sylvia Plath and there's still lots of crops that can go on the ground all the leafy greens in the world all the leafy greens in the world\nRight now I'm you know if we run into a ... to whether a between now and\nAnd uh in mid December uh there's always mulch is there's always ... but you can get greens in in in a week or two especially just started already are indoors or you find style of plants a nursery are gods and they can be planted\nAnd some plants like the Brussels sprouts the uh the Swiss chard or the spirit of broccoli or all these planes these actually are enhanced\nBy cold weather some amount of frost actually makes them more delicious obviously not a eggplants and the cucumbers and tomatoes and peppers and stuff that needs to be picked now and a broad indoors and and there's ripening process the ripening process is actually\nContingent upon temperature nothing else\nKnows signed a son a light on no light it's\nSixty five Seventy degrees temperatures above that were ripe tomatoes\nEven the greenest ones without a problem I especially a piece of newspapers is a good idea and that turned the fruit\nAnd a cause a than a fire up the cattle and make sauces and different types of products uh most of which you can freeze wonderfully for use during the winter you walk them butter not send you a hobbit and your other squash is your acorn squash is or winter squash is\nThey can be picked when they do pot easily from the plant don't\nPull them away caught them leave a portion of the stem attached\nA wash them cleaning them drive them and store them where they don't get bumped around and you'll be the squash right into the weather right into the woods or a delicious and safe and nutritious\nFood source so ah the vegetable garden doesn't have to wind down because uh it's not done yet\nIs not done yet cause delicate things like the the bay's only needs to be removed and you should dig out some of the chives and some of the ... pot that I bring that indoors sooner it'll be time to bring the Rosemary and the ... going to win but they're still doing just fine outside\nUh it's not a ... it's it's not a stressful time\nThis kind of cool weather actually enhanced says most plants still uh of course the window was wide open for all kinds of transplants trees and shrubs except for those that are fall houses and up perennials alike\nCan be dug divided and planted at this time Dave in Bristol Rhode Island you're up next with Jim Hi Dave\nMy gym I I'm Sorry I'm well I'm well thanks I answer maybe her that question I go for it go I'm thinking it's not like ... to may\nYeah a little bittersweet except there's not a roundup of bittersweet as more of a bind\nI may have our bank yeah more of a\nVine and boy you you've got it was bittersweet being a problematic uh uh we do a ... that stuff is murder murder\nRobbers because that's for sure [laughter]\nA popular beverage and it has all obvious are beneficial how beneficial properties are\nNow there's a lot of conjecture whether ... anything at all or cause is good or bad for you but I don't think we'll see the day the one will go away so Arizona's a little bit about the [laughter] don't do a model\nAbsolutely so um it's where the company itself has just turned a year old\nI'm ... so we are still a very new company and working hard to to spread awareness and spread worried about what we do but basically um the comedy started because\nA woman in taxes uh named Sarah shy next who is a lawyer um had a passion for wine and spent several years studying to become a suddenly a\nAnd so um she\nUh along her path you know started to get really really debilitating migraines where she can she would have one sibling wine and couldn't get out of bed I'm\nAnd she was actually hired by a e commerce wind business out Napa Valley\nAnd she went out there to work for them and she noticed that um when she was traveling in and scouting for why and\nShe would get these reactions in California but when she'd go to France or Italy she went and got the same reaction\nLong so she started to put two and two together she she met with\nNatural have slipped doctors with winemakers and really wanted to get down to the root cause like why is this happening\nSo essentially along the way while she was talking to all these people what she found out was that in the United states\nThe FDA does not regulate wine near anywhere near the way that they do in Europe which I guess you know we kind of know that that's true with most things like even skin care products or food here in the United states\nWhere are you a whole we have a very lax regulation\nYeah so\nAs it stands right now that the FDA allows up to two hundred and fifty chemical compounds we use in wine making process that your marriage or if\nYou can add in during the bottling process\nSo many people who have reactions when they drink wine they assume it's probably the sulfites you probably hear that a lot you know oh I got I had a hearing it rashes I Can't drink red line especially because of the fall fights\nThe chances are probably much more likely that you're reacting to another chemical that's in that line [noise] but there is no nutrition labels there's no there that we don't they don't have to disclose what's in that line at all\nSo there's not audio locker compliance there is all all levels ... there's no no statistical requirements for the ingredients and never come usual even here but I noticed a since our relationship\nSpock the ah won your right doesn't tell you about what's in his other than just moved from groups\nThat's right yeah and it's very interesting because\nI'm tied to a lot of people when I'm ... I I really try to educate the about the difference between what we call a mass produced fine which if you think of it this way is is usually a larger company a larger wind lay a ball\nThat has many many acres of a great finds that they are trying to have a pretty use\nYou know thousands and thousands and thousands of cases because they're going to be shipping out to the big wind retailers\nIsn't it true and that even now some of the wine and even some of the small\nUh manufacturers don't even use actual grapes any more but uh the ... or all the concentrate that comes from the graves in other words they're not even signing off a ... at the base ingredient level\nThey're coming in at a level above that when these grapes of already been a squeezed out and even some chemicals added to it\n[noise] yeah I'm so glad that you asked that cause so\nI was just doing an event last night where we were talking a lot about this so [noise]\nIf you think of it this way um they're calling it the McDonald's ... line is what's happening right in the in the wine industry because to me is larger companies and I you know not to I don't want to use any labels her\nName or no it won't disparage anyone\nReally yeah but if you think of it this way if if you go to the to the ... local wine store like a wines and more and you pick up a bottle of wine let's say it's a cabernet solving yacht and you get home and you really like the taste of that line\nAnd you go back there six months later one year later and you pick up the same bottle of wine and you get home and it's Ninety eight percent going to taste the same\nAs the line that you had six months ago a year ago that's a great clue for you that it's mass produced so wine is\nMade by formula me but\nYeah yeah exactly because just like McDonalds if you go to Hong Kong you're cheeseburger\nIs going to the same as it does here in New Jersey right\nAnd that's what they're going for it they want consistency bay why I'm\nNo customize Asian\nNo hesitation engine if you know you know I've been\nAll the products or the ingredients like if they come in all Roma tomatoes plump tomato them a fourth of July tomato or you know these are all using sauces and the different ... but when you change the tomato or apples\nEspecially different varieties of Apple's covered the students to different taste and ... should grapes based on where they come from and what kind of rapes they are so that's an indication right there there should be a variance between there is a blend yeah if they're really made from ... Roche\nAbsolutely and there should be a variance depending on the ... the the uh climate that year right so\nThe hottest scout and saw\nA differ from these other wine\nOr produces all these won a providers in in the types of wines that they offer and in and how can people find out more about scout and cello and ... and the winds so if you are just so yeah\nI mean I'm trying to tell you um [noise]\nBut I just want to do a quick circle back to you were asking about the concentrate that go in right so um what happens is a larger company doesn't necessarily\nWant to have the time to create a really nice\nWe aged bottle of wine especially when we're talking about red wine so like you know Marlowe ... should sit aging in the barrel for eight to eight months to two years is a really extract the right color because\nThe color in your deep dark red wines comes from the contact with the skin civil longer that the line is fermenting with the skins and the seas the darker and richer the caller that's the natural pigment that in that line\nWhen you're talking about a large corporation time is money to them so they're not going to necessarily latte or wind set for two years in a barrel before it can be bottled\nWhen they pulled the wine out usually they pull it early it almost looks like a rose anyway\nIf you can imagine it's a very weak pigment of red so they have developed a concentrate called mega purple and they weren't you're\nIt's a broadcast or in your product a perfect model and uh we're proud to have acquired\nA scout and cello as a partner for the show and going forward or people will become more familiar with the product or but right now how can they find out more about Scott and cello and how to acquire Skelton subtle wines\nAbsolutely so I wind are available online and they are available to ... house on and you can go on to scout and seller dot com so that's scout as the O.
