{"month": "10", "state": "RI", "station": "WHJJ", "content": "Additionally it helps us build a relationship with the non financial spouse so is the financial spells passes away we can better transition\nThat non financial spouse into handling their assets like they never had to do before\nNow one of the things we can do we have a find a family organizer so it's it's like a four page or in\nEven if you don't want to come in and meet with us look just just call and for all won three three three eight thousand we'd be happy to send out one of these hard copy to you where you can list everything that's important to you it will list whether or not you have legal documents your real estate holdings do you have government savings bonds a brokerage account\nOr do you have long term care insurance heavy lent some buddy money that needs to be repaid\nDo you have any ... bank money what about your retirement accounts\nAnd life insurance it lists all of those things aren't that organizer in one simple place if you can do that that is a huge gift for you to give to your family if something were to happen to you because then they know where everything is so I'm not here for one three three three eight thousand\nIf you call and ask specifically for the family organizer\nHim give us or your name and address and contact info and we will send that out too hard copy free of charge\nGet these are all such great ... strategies where do we go from here well\nYou know if we're if we're looking at trying to get organized in case you pass away\nThere's other things that you should consider now many people think that life insurance has for younger people that have a mortgage they're still raising their kids and that is an absolute correct way to think about it\nBut it doesn't mean that as you get older there's no good uses for life insurance so whether you're in your fifties sixties and seventies and older\nWe have put insurance is in place for people to really to leverage what they can pass on to their family so there's two two things that you want to look at uh you want to take care of your spouse number one and if it's important to you to pass on the legacy to your children\nI've trademark something called the IRA leveraged legacy plant\nAnd that is discussed in my book if you happen to go to Amazon dot com or mass and money dot com and click on the the book button it'll bring you to Amazon and you can purchase that book and it fully explains what that IRA leverage legacy plan is and it is so effective for passing on\nMoney from you to your children\nThat's income tax free and it's a wonderful plan and it has so many other benefits that you can pull into that as well it's such an important thing to look at\nSo if you care about somebody having life insurance provide some some dollars so if you want to have a plan on yourself so that your spouse has more money to live on in their last year's that's a great\n... a perfect place for life insurance also if you were to have taken a retirement a pension plan\nAnd let's say that like many people think that sixty five years ago and thankfully I haven't seen this in quite a while back but years ago I met with so many people that were Seventy five years of age and they were their pension was ending and I'm like what is going on why why is this happening\nWell these folks these guys primarily said you know what I was sixty five I could barely get out of bed in the morning I figured there was no way I Would live past Seventy five and here I Am I'm healthy as a horse and my pension has ended because I took more money for just ten years instead of doing a lifetime guarantee\nSo if you took what's called the life only pension and you have a spouse then you should consider having insurance in place that will replace that loss of income that your spouse will have to deal with if you pass away in your pension goes away with you\nAnother key areas that we look at to make sure that the spouse if if one passes at the surviving spouse has what they need to live a you know a nice life for their final years as well\nGet conscious about the importance of naming beneficiaries\nYou know this is a topic that I talked about every time I get a a group of people together whether it's a public seminar a client of and I always talk about this because it's something that people tend to overlook\nUm by naming beneficiaries you know as as part of the whole decision tree that you go through as to who will get what\nYou know who will get this account gets that account or all the accounts going to be split evenly you know after you pass away you name them on insurance policies annuity policies retirement accounts pick cetera\nThey also will supersede what used to be put you put in your last will and testament so simple example let's say you have four children and you say in your will my kids split everything equally\nBut uh let's say on your um let's say you have an annuity that is going to have some cash when you pass away but you only put one of your kids' names on that and nobody for whatever reason they get it it doesn't matter that the wolf says it should be split equally among saw for children\nSo a beneficiary designation will always take precedence over the last will and testament as my attorney or when he's talking to her clients he says look the will speaks last and the will only handles assets in one person's name\nThat does not have a beneficiary list it and that's what has to go through probate court and deal with all the delays and potential pitfalls with dealing with ... that's why we suggest you name beneficiaries on everything and it's so important to look at your bank accounts because those seem to be the most overlooked [noise]\nSo what do you have savings accounts checking accounts CDs make sure that you've got\nBeneficiary designations on all of those now we're getting some feedback that there is some financial institutions out there that limit you to one beneficiary on and like how I you know in today's world the of supercomputers in software\nI ... a it boggles my mind that they're restricting people's beneficiaries like that but just just know whether your financial institution limits it or not and then act accordingly so you may want to have you have four kids who might want to have for accounts and have one go to each of them\nYou know it's very cumbersome to do that for me no maybe change institutions that's always an option as well the one that's a little more flexible with what's going on so checking beneficiaries is always part of our conversation with the folks that we meet with\nOr whether you become a climate that we will always say look check your beneficiary designations it's worth the few minutes and it takes to find out what you've got\nAnd then how it's structured and then fixing it appropriately now I remember when I set up my trust in my forties I mean it it's a big thing to sit there and say All right if something happened to me what do I want to have happened to my assets\nIt's weird to do that I get you know I I Do I'm going through it but once it was done I have to tell you that I just felt kind of relieved that it was all laid out\nNow as I say this I'm like I maybe it's time for me to relocate in mind too because it's it's been a while since I've done that\nI Would suggest that you look at that at least every five years or so or anytime that there's a major\nA family event if there's a birth if there's a doubt if there's a divorce et cetera\nThen you may want to re look at your plan to see if everything is still appropriate the way that you have it established if not well take some action our number here is for one three three

and uh make sure though that the overhang or the the structure of the house I'm\nIs such that it does not\nOr impede the ability for the plant to get natural occurring moisture in other words rain and

the plant will go dormant\nOr it will be are able to be a place away from a harm's way if you will a foraging or animals or the worst weather or just make sure it gets enough water over the winter and
