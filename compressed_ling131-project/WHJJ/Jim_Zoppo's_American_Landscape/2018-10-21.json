{"month": "10", "state": "RI", "station": "WHJJ", "content": "The assets that you had together are no longer the same amount so what are you going to do how do you better prepare for that how do you make sure that you've got income you can rely on so that you don't become a bag lady and I I only bring that up because I'm Amazed at the number of times that I hear that and I heard just last week\nYou know they said look I don't want to become a bag lady I Want to make sure that I have enough income\nWell that's what we specialize in\nBuilding an income that you can rely on and that's her specialty so so looking forward to taking all as David information and being able to share it in the local marketplace here for ladies that are near or in retirement so you know stay tune if you have an interest in that would like to get on a mailing list for that seminar\nSend an email or call you can call for a one three three three eight thousand or you can email\nInfo at Massey and associates dot com that's all spelled out and just put David Baake in the in the topic so we know what it's about and just say you know please send me an invitation when you're ready to send those out and we'll take care of you and make sure you get an imitation\nWhat an incredible that I'm so excited for this cat I Know the women in our community are female listeners they're going on at ten that's\nBecause it really does speak to the unique challenges that they face and I ... well I'm Glad you partnered with David back on this I I'm I'm just thrilled thrilled because this is not something everyone's doing but boy is there a need Jeff\n... you know I I really think there is an ... and I have a passion for helping people as I Hope our listeners or get that passion they understand that you know I'm really driven the help as many people as we can so I Do believe that offering this type of a seminar for the ladies that are our listeners\nAnd their family members and friends that may not be listening\nBut may want to come to the seminar because will allow you to invite your friends as well as long as they're about to retire or in retirement because that's geared specifically for those women that are that are near retirement or in retirement\nGet one of the questions that I Know those are female male listeners has is when to retire you know that seems like a simple question that as you're printing today it can be more complicated than I think a lot of us would anticipate\nI Want to talk about the risks that can actually help us determine when we can retire\nWell you know the more you can protect yourself and your assets against certain risk the better chance your assets have of last thing you throughout a nice long retirement now and I say that and I talk about it often as as you know making about longevity in our living longer\nWell recently the Providence Journal our number one newspaper so the state because it covers the entire state because we're so small\nBut I had an article about a woman that is a hundred and ten years old right here in Rhode Island and and I was like wow that is amazing now oftentimes I talked to a seminar is how we are you know living into our nineties a at a higher percentage than any prior generations but when I saw that a hundred and ten\nI was pretty impressed site I had helped classes that Rhode Island college for a while back and there was a gentleman there who said he helped care for his aunt and then the ultimate ... she went to a nursing home and she passed three months before her hundred in fifth birthday\nNow to me that was the eldest I'd heard or seen and then we see a hundred and ten years of age men\nHow do you make sure that your income is going to last that long well we know how to do that and we use specific products that are geared to do just that\nAnd that's what I think makes a special because we do focus on getting that income that you can rely on for the rest of your life regardless of how one that may be sore number here is four oh one three three three eight thousand we look forward to your call\nWe will sit down with you get to visit get to know each other a little bit better determine what your goals are for your retirement either when you may started or what it might look after the fact if you've already retired\nAnd then we do a deep dive an analysis of your portfolio come back at the second meeting and they lay it all out for you and say look here's what we see and at that point in time we should both know\nIf massing associates and can help you with your planning as you move forward so it's pretty straightforward we we cover a lot of ground and those two meetings\nAnd we are looking for people that are serious about their retirement planning\nSo if you save two hundred thousand or more of your retirement our number here is for all won three three three eight thousand\nGet are there any risks out there that you think people sometimes forget about [noise]\nYou know the one we see the most or hear about the most people don't pay attention to the health care aspect of retiring early\nBecause if you're not sixty five yeah do you do not yet qualify for Medicare part a and R B so then you've got to take that out of out of pocket and that's a big deal\nSo it's important to keep that in mind and for those people that are nearing sixty five or if you're already sixty five are older and you have a Medicare supplement plan\nNow is the time to give us a call for all won three three three eight thousand\nAnd we can help you with making a decision do you have the best plan might you be able to get a better plan for yourself or for those that are already clients of ours 'cause I Know we have clients that are regular listeners if you have a Medicare supplement plan and it would just like us to take that over for you we'd be happy to do that for you as well\nSo if you're new to the Medicare plan you can give us a call if your existing on Medicare and have a supplement plan already we'd be happy to evaluate it for you and perhaps help you with that going forward now is the open season it started October fifteenth and we have a couple of months to get that done for you\nSo what people forget about the health insurance if you're if you go to health plan through your employer you may only be paying a portion of that but if you have to buy your own plan and you're in your early sixties that a good plan it could cost you eight nine hundred thousand dollars a month for each of you\nSo that can take a big chunk out of assets for those first few years until you get to age sixty five\nSo whenever possible we encourage people to at least shoot for sixty five\nHowever we can do a plan if you want to retire at sixty two we've got plans were folks are looking to retire fifty seven and fifty nine\nBut we worked it all out and say are you going to have to draw more money for the health insurance until you get to sixty five and then we can kind of turn turn down the withdrawal rules from your accounts because then you'll shift over the Medicare part a party and the supplemental plant\nSo those are important and if you do not have a plan a physician foxtrot or a plan season Charlie Medicare supplement plan they will be going away after the twenty ninth team season if you will so they will still be decent plans available but the better plants in my opinion or see an F\nAnd if you don't get them like on this go round you may not be able to get it out\nAfter twenty Nineteen so\nIt might be a good time to consider changing so now is a good time to really evaluate what you have\nAnd we're in the open season so coal four oh one three three three eight thousand then we'll have you sit down with one of our professionals to review what you have to see how we might be able to help you with them so you know make a great segment with David Bach and I do look forward to helping out with his workshops in January and February\nOf ladies only workshop so if you want to get on our mailing list\nEither call for a one three three three eight thousand and ask to be put on the list or send an email to info at Massey and associates dot com that's all spelled out and just in the subject line for David Baake\nNine to zero nine four or five five are of course by this time of after tonight if not um the tend to plants and the veggie gotten will only be remnants so wasted no time uh they are after\nCleaning up what is now the debris of the previous season obviously we want to leave in place the Swiss chard and the college and the ... oh Kay ill and the radical shown the\nBroccoli in Brussels sprouts collie flower\nSpinach cabbage leafy greens\nThose plants that actually enjoy\nEven cold weather\nOr carrots pizza the lights were crops most of them can be stored a in forty degree temperatures a winter squash is the wall and brought it up a hostage\nBest to cause clean water wiped clean before being stored they we saw it in the sand or or saw a stove\nWood shavings and it's better that uh they not be a an extremely warm temperatures on the other hand the tomatoes that we're attempting to ripen\nThat have been picked prematurely in anticipation of\nA this cold weather [noise] need to be exposed to temperatures above sixty eight degrees\nAnd they will gradually ripen beautifully just like on the vine eight six six nine to zero nine four or five five on behalf of American Landscape tours and uh we'll hear from Peter in just a few minutes a I'm sure he will reiterate\nThe ah accolades\nThat uh I have for\nA our most recent tour and uh the folks that were nice enough to patronize\nOr I guess everybody had a great time unfortunately I was not able to grow but everybody had a wonderful time and a plans are in the making for a new holiday excursion we'll hear more about that later\nEight six six nine to zero nine\nFour five five so the extent to which we can clean up that God in areas that are not being used anymore rake out dig out move all of that spoils vegetation to the compost\nWill enhance the ability of keeping that area free from disease and insect problems are going forward next year and now of course relieve the ground open\nFor a either a cover crop\nSeaweed or calm poll stole my new uh fertilizers that women have forgotten or the next season and our attention will turn to probably the laughs crop that well planned for this year\nA lots of fun if you haven't tried to garlic rough neck garlic\nOr you can buy the stars or you can use a close of organic\nRough that garlic you buy\nA store and the separated and planted\nThree to four inches deep six to eight inches apart\nIn rows will begin to grown now and one of the ground freezes a protected over the winter and then we'll resume growing next spring until sometime mid summer there will be harvested next year\nA fun and a delicious and very helpful crop\nAnd not to be in a big big hurry with spring bulbs for about the same reason if plants do early they begin to make growth above the ground this season\nOnly to be damaged or killed off by January when the temperatures for extended periods of time\nAnd and the um\nAmount of mulch of protection and the work that constitutes\nA\nReally does mitigate the um value [laughter]\nHave and those are beautiful spring flowery\nBulbs plan from WETA\nFifty percent of bulbs a\nPlan for the New England actually on the ground after Thanksgiving\nSo that might seem colds and bleak to people outside\nOf plants or ... in these temperatures and these weather conditions moist cool weather as having a pronounced\nEffect costs on turf grass which is emerald green\nOr not seeing no of course I especially here in southern New England is a dramatic leaf coloration\n\nBut the\nBright foliage or not it certainly is fall and that means that there are certain our guide maintenance\nTasks and landscape associated maintenance fast that need to be undertaken\nOr to have a successful\nConclusion to the gardening seasons and ah except for one\nAccessible water\nOutlet the rush should be closed down and wind dries\nIrrigation

funniest part of it is and I don't know if there's any correlation there has been my husband cause of starlings he knows more about Britain deal but any way that the landing in picking at around\n... wonderful that that may be doing there aren't enough wonderful wonderful\nSo Betty we can uh examined the dynamics of ah this ah\nA brown situation on the lawn off from a couple of different perspectives but one is we could determine with a fair amount of accuracy what's causing the brown spots and uh that can be done by making an excavation\nA of one of these brown areas as it merges or a bus an area where it's not brown\nOkay and see if you find a significant grub population charge you need is appointed shovel and you slice the top of the turf off a few inches deep and look for evidence of grownups or if in fact\nIf in fact the rock rubs because um [noise] one just one of the contributions or that the Japanese beetles make and they're only one\nInsect that are responsible for ... that eat or damage lawns the roots of turf grass India was once\nThey're already one there are many others are but they're the most uh let's say they're the most conspicuous they lay their eggs after a a Labor Day in the turf grass areas usually where they were born\nAnd those eggs hatch become the ... or the robs that then feed upon the roots of brass um until the weather cools at which time they begin to migrate and they go deeper below the ground level for the winter\nThen he ... and the spring of course they migrate back to the surface or they continue to feed again but in the spring it's not nearly so conspicuous because the grass usually grows faster\nThan the ... population can consume so the damage is not as conspicuous is not as evident that said if you do to determine that there are lots of grubs now not talking about finding one or two rubs that that's not going to be an easy answer but if you find\nA significant population rubs all on my advice to you\nIs to let the birds continue to eat they will eliminate more like robs more effectively\nAnd sooner than any type of lawn chemical that you don't apply that doesn't pose a potential fresh do you are the environments yeah I did completely um\nThing I didn't know if there was a connection 'cause I looked out my window and\nWell sure and I'm telling you it was like Alfred Hitchcock yeah well there probably are connection from them\nThere is a good action and they're probably looking for jobs and\nThey they they uh are accompanied by a moles which also look for jobs and perhaps a pa so those are really happy at all yeah all kinds of the credits but that said they'll do a very effective job eliminating all the uh uh grubs and then\nYeah even in the worst of cases I've never seen a lawyer area\nWow all these uh chemicals in addition sometimes to others\nUh [noise]\nWere present in samples that they tested\nSo another reason to be very very selective about the food you purchase a at a supermarket and subsequently consume and served to your family I mean it's it's a very real\nA potential\nFor on how the situation\n\nJerry you're up next to a gym minding again um I have a question about a high discussed tonight on yes\nI'm four years old every every bringing on the ... if you'd have fun and it's really beautiful violent on it\nAnd now it's time to bring them to get out and play into the lives lives you know ... um I Want to cut it back to back because it's getting pretty ... and ... wanting to cut it back\nNow well it's still have filled balloons on the part that I caught by or should I even got it back\nSo let's let's let's I'm In a lot of people are faced with this same problem Jerry ah and it is a you know a significant\nA twist on indoor plants because these plants as you indicated sometimes tend to be a big scale and it's difficult to continue to accommodate them indoors but the amount of pruning that you do at this time of year\nWill directly relate to the amount of blooms that you have until next a march or April yes I thought\nBut I I kind of ... and I bring it in ... I don't care or any ...\nAny harm whatsoever no harm whatsoever but a better better better strategy okay Jerry is next year\nSome time during the summer July August even September do that amount of pruning that's necessary to reduce the size of the tree and then by this time of year it won't have\nRe grown significantly and it will be substantially smaller and it'll still flower just as well\nThroughout all ...\n... I ... I trim it feminine kind\nRight when it's accidentally growing\nRight but I I'm going to end the ... now ...\nYeah nominally and and the ... will have some blooms drastically you'll have five fewer blooms but in any case you won't damage the general wellbeing or the health of the plant at all\nOkay great thank you sound like I'm\nAll right no thank you for your call and a lesson or why don't we uh send you out a twenty five dollar gift certificate to a vehicle restaurant Norwood\nYeah if I\nLike Italian food you'll love Rico on central street in Norwood so we'll send you a you stay on the line and get the information to the cause greater or we're going to send you a gift certificate to veto restaurant or I\nCan never to call\nMy pleasure you as well so today's high stakes political question a maybe a drum roll\nA [laughter] I'm already give we don't have to have a drum roll 'cause it's All right this particular plant a is edible\nUh and it's native to a central and western Asia [noise]\nIs it in your old [noise] and grow up to thirty centimeters tall [noise]\nUh it may survive even over winter [noise]\nIn uh some temperate regions\nAnd leaves all of a sudden it's simple\nTriangular [noise]\nAnd they vary in size from a two to thirty centimeters long and wanting to Fifteen sending me this broad\nWith a larger leaves at the base of the plant and smaller leaves\nOn the stem name that plan and it's a twenty five dollar gift certificate\nTo the marketplace at Simpson spraying\nNow Simpson spring is a unique destination for those of you that have been I'm sure a you have been\nPlease those rollers surprised daunting to even\nBy the quality\nOf the food products that they sell and of course you've undergone the experience or if you take a tour of the facility uh this is the oldest bottling company in North America\n... here in the east the town of southeastern Massachusetts on the stone held college um they have a spring there just print producing the finest\nDrinking water the finest spring water\nFor over six thousand years you have a carbon dated the spring\nAnd it's still there right inside the building bubbling away six thousand years old and they produce a whole line of a water that's a natural\nObviously no additives whatsoever and sometimes a carbonated they ebb carbonated line or with different flavors that are real fruit flavors\nIn addition they have ...\nThat ... days sugars but also all natural ingredients like birch beer was made with real birch extract ... grapes soda orange soda\nWith real ingredients he's additives are genuine and the way they during the marketplace they also bring in locally sourced products food products like passes in cheese and honey and stuff but also crafts and that happens every Saturday\nSo they've provided gift certificates for us to give to our listeners and we use those promotions as prizes for a high stakes shorter culture question\nEvery week so uh twenty five dollar gift certificate to Simpsons spring market place for the correct answer to today's first high stakes for their culture question and will continue to give some clues\nAre obviously as the show continues or the idea of pruning comes up very opposite at this time of year\nPeople talk about on deciduous trees is it okay to prove Robert evergreens well on flowery evergreens\nLike azaleas mountain laurels in drama there's a\n\nOther flowering evergreens the flower in the spring\nIf you prove now the flowers are they out the bugs that will be next springs flowers are they are now president of the plant so significant amount of pruning obviously will eat the minimize or eliminate\nThe flowering on these plants other plants that are evergreens but they don't flower it's fine to uproot because they've made their growth but this year and the usual rule of thumb is to prove back no more than about a third of the plant\nAt any one time sometimes uh you can go more than ... depends on the specimen and its exposure and the condition of the plant\nNow for some other plants that are early spring flowering that are uh just send us like lilacs and ... they too have their buds in place now for next season\nSo it's obvious that you need to understand a little bit the growth of the plant before you begin to prove\nYou're listening to the gym Zappos American Landscape of the American landscape radio network we'll be right back\nAfter these important messages eight six six nine to zero\nAnd then uh\nIt was a\n\nAlso introduced to Nepal\nSubsequently a it was introduced as

don't know if anybody's heard on the news or in Yellowstone National park uh guys that have been dormant for about sixty years are up to which is a interesting but\nWhat was ... kind of I'm not so interesting is the fact that with it interrupted garbage and trash going back a sixty till the Nineteen thirties they dated a cement block cigarette butts\nAre no wrote an aluminum cans coins plastic

got to put some of those ... archiving some of this trash and they're going to put it in their little museum so that's a\nYou know ... nature is amazing and uh you know one of the [laughter] one of the more amazing facts I realized it was\nA you know just a few weeks ago at the tops field fair\nThey have the a prize winning pumpkin was over a ton it was like Twenty one hundred pounds and I guess a world record pumpkin a comes in over a twenty five hundred pounds that's a that's a huge profit but during the growing season\nPumpkins can grow by fifty pounds a day fifty hours a day\nCan you imagine a put on weight at the rate of fifty pounds a\nDay so it makes anybody that needs to diet [laughter] it's like it's not a large shot at he wore a eight six six died\nZero nine four or five

some of the specializes involves or you spend some time or doing diligent research if you expect to have a of a bald guy and that will bloom every year\nBe very very careful because the majority of
