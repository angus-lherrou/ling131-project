those who are out there many attorneys do not transfer their real estate in for them so how do you actually transfer real estate\nFrom your own names into your ear evoking\nWill trust okay so you're talking about this irrevocably type yes right although it's not entirely different if you had a revolt couple trust so I just thought I'd throw that out there it's it's really the same so the deed work we prepare because we can do that so we prepare new deeds that actually say you know\nTodd blood ski here by transfers and conveys too you know Billy trustee of the\nTime lucky family or a vocal trust is right on your feet\nYou guys will know that because you can go look at your real estate tax bill and see that it comes in the name of the trust and not to the LA well lightening days you All right you get scared 'cause you'll see his name it'll probably say Billie trustee and you'll say oh how come it's in Belize name it's night Billy trustee\nOf the drums sometimes they can't fit the whole trust name on there so you might just see Billy as trustee that means that title has been changed and it's now owned by the irrevocably trust good\nBut banking investment accounts same thing you need to actually go to the so like for you to go to your financial advisor chairs and you get forms\nAnd you fill out the forms that actually say I'm you know\nTrade changing title to the account to read\nThe maybe Todd let's keep family irrevocably trust mhm put your name it\nAnd then it's in there and you also know what's in their cars you will need a separate tax id number right or the ear of a couple of trust what you would not need\nFor the ... of a couple of trust you just use your social but you're still needs to change the name and that's really how you do it and make sure you look at your statements that you get and make sure they come in the name of the trust under the new id number then you know they're in there\nAnd sometimes when you are putting real estate in there you know it can take a couple of months even though that deeds been recorded it can take ... a couple of months for you to see that change reflected on your your ... your tax bill and so forth but don't panic if you don't see that\nSo once you actually put your home in your ear evoke about trust taught him for a lot of people that's their biggest asset is there anything that you can no longer do with your home\nIf it's owned by the trust are you giving up any rights to anything\nI Would say the only thing you cannot do\nWould be re mortgage it okay now you can keep existing mortgages first of all most people that are doing Medicaid planning don't have a more they're not concerned but ... but ... yeah and getting a new thirty year mortgages not high on there to do list mhm so\nProbably not an issue but some people still have the lingering mortgage that has been very off get it home equity line of credit or blame it on the line of credit what we do generally is we reserve a life a states this will be one of the times where we actually would reserve the life of state in the deed by doing that\nYou know preserve the mortgage meaning they won't trigger the due on sale cause you didn't give it away remember we're not giving anything away we're keeping that President right to live there the rest of our lives which is what a life of status mhm\nAnd that means that you have not triggered the due on sale cost so you can keep that existing line of credit or existing mortgage you just can't get a new one\nWithout taking it out of the trust once and it is and restarting the clocks sweet and then you could get it but you would have to restart the clock\nSo you so if someone doesn't have a balance due to a bank or they don't have a mortgage or they don't have a line of credit would you recommend that they establish a line of credit before they transferred in knowing that they're not going to be able to\nGet one after isn't you know what I thought kind of a personal matter it really matters up to the client you know today field you guys feel like you need that security of being able to borrow money in the future because if you keep the line of credit you can always write the check\nTo borrow up to the limit that your cat 'cause you can use it you can you can weigh line immigrants just can't get a new one right now you can keep the one you have up to the credit limit that they gave you end the term that they gave you because you preserve that in the life of state\nSo it's really a family matter if you feel that you need that comfort level to say oh my gosh if I Need a new hot water heater I Need a new roof or I Need something that causes a lot of money\nAnd I don't have it otherwise\nThan yeah OK otherwise mostly no\nOkay you know so there's a lot of questions that might be going through your mind at All right well what else can I Do when my houses and the trust can I sell it can I can I I'm Still have to pay my taxes and get the right off for that kind of put

as they blaming process once again here's a lesbian Susan's\nKind of a few questions from listeners for you first question comes from\nDave in Boston mass and Dave writes I Am the trustee of my mother's irrevocably trust that trust has been enforced since two thousand nine and has two properties in it\nShe has a number of CDs now can I put those in the same trust if so would this adversely affect the trust and if it is not adversely affected\nHow when with these CDs be protected would there be a five year clock started for the CDs or would they immediately be protected using that trust original two thousand and nine start date days looking for a loop hole hair\nAnd I'm Wondering if you ask just a few more questions because there's only about Fifteen pounds\nOr my own heart here he's looking for a loop hole you going to back to you\nKnow there's no loophole here for your buddy but I Do have good news for your overall depending on how old you are I'm In and this is really\nThe question right so he so I'm Sorry how old your mother is to have 'em and and so this becomes a question for all of you when you're doing you're planning and this is why when when we do planning for people\nWe put as much assets as we can in the trust all at one time\nThat being said it doesn't mean you can't add to the trust later if you want to so you got to see deep question here Dave and we certainly can add to the trust later\nBut I'm going to explain the ramifications so depending on mom's age hopefully you put everything and you want it in at one time then you have one five you're waiting period running on the whole thing mhm let's say mom put it in at sixty five\nAnd now she's Seventy and everything she initially put in which is what the two the two properties yeah right those are all protected\nSometimes they're not comfortable learning about how the trust really doesn't cause them any problems at all and then after this five years went by and they say you know and then I kinda forgot all about the trust it's not hurting me at all\nIt's not changing my life at all mhm maybe I'll take some of these CDs and put 'em in there well in my hypothetical for your mother in this case Dave she's now Seventy catch you put the season yes she can would create a new five you're waiting period for her yes it will\nBut only on the new edition the new money so at least you can rest assured that the two houses are protected\nAnd you'd only have to deal with mhm perhaps undoing are dealing with that money that you put in if something happens in the next five years but now you have to get to Seventy five right\nProvided the increase provided that had an increased the waiting period between the time you contributed your house and the time you contribute CDs\nSo the answer is yes you can new five year clock\nThink about how old you are when you start this right 'cause they did this planning ten years ago run mom while ago\nSo it was Seventy at that time ...\nIt's a little harder jak doesn't mean you don't do it no I think you're still step back and look at her health and say you know well she's in pretty good shape let's let's get another clock started do it\nSo what do you do Todd if Dave puts the CDs in there and now in four years down the road mom goes into their thing and they don't make that five years\nThat's a great question I Would have to decide by looking at and this is where last minute planning comes into play right\nNormally there's things left out of the trust look at this case the for example she left a lot of money out of the trust or CDs it and go and\nI'm sure even though she's putting the CDs and now Dave that she left out of the trust her IRA money and any other money that she just didn't feel comfortable putting in ya mhm\nLet's look at how much that is if she left about a hundred grand outside the trust\nAnd were four years into this new five year waiting period I'm likely to tell or the mother in this case or Dave if the mom's going in the nursing home\nLet's private pay with the money you have outside the trust mhm why it's at risk anyway and if I spend a hundred grand to protect all I don't know another five hundred thousand of CDs that I put it in the trust I'm OK doing that\nAnd that will get us past that one more year waiting period that we need to get to ... to protect it all otherwise\nOf that five hundred thousand is protected so think of it as being pro rated in the sense that yeah I've got four years under my belt even those zero of those dollars is protected yet\nI'll pay for a year mhm just to protect the balance of the money that's in there so lots of options get the clock running never a bad idea\nYeah and you know what folks ideally you're going to do your planning in advance\nEducate yourself before you start the process so you know what should and should not be in your trust in how these trust operate on a day to day basis Todd's guide for the month of October it's gone back in

in Newbury port ... writes\nI Am single I have two kids and three grandkids and leaving my assets equally to all five of them\nI haven't ... trust that holds my home should I named my year evoke about trust as beneficiary of my IRA what are the pros and cons of this [noise]\nSo if it's an ear Reza ... trust I I'm a first I think we need to figure out what size of the IRA meaning what percentage of the IRA makes up mhm the trust or makes up the entire state I think\nWith Iraq a couple trusts not replicable ... radicals a whole different animal but was irrevocably trusts well with a ... a couple of trust you could name\nThe designated beneficiary of the IRA such trust them with a\nReplicable trust I worry a little\nThat the language I have to put in there in the trust to allow the IRA to be a beneficiary\nAnd the way the states are scrutinizing every application yet for Medicaid and trying to find ways to poke holes into these trust that somehow they may say that the principles of veil of all to the tone or\nBecause of the language you have to put in for an IRA so as it's not paid out so you could stretch it over the individual's right on the fisheries lifetime my my inclination is\nNot to do it have I done it in the past yes it you know I I think the ups the upside is in this case this person's single", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Real Stories of The Legal Exchange",
