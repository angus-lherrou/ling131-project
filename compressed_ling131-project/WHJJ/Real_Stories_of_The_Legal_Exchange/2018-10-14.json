should make\nThis a book [laughter] the uh the big lighter that's if if I follow along correctly in the book as a matter of using it as a wedge basically right against a tightly gripped finger around the bottleneck\nExactly after grip correctly or it's all laid out there um with illustration diagrams a and everything you need to figure it out but yeah you're actually using a the lighter as a as a lever a lever and your finger as a full\nUm so it's all highly scientific as you can do\nEnd up for those in desperation mode even holding up a piece of paper super super tightly can function the same

beer bottle with a piece of string that you guys didn't ask to tone and awaiting it on fire [noise]\nUm so that was you know one of one of the more enjoyable testing phases of creating this book um but it'll basically sever its way through the beer a and you can turn it into a glass of drinking glass to then\nPut beer in um I'd recommend you know sending heavily the uh just to protect your mouth\nUm they can create tiki torches or that you can put outside to ward off ... which unfortunately um scientists haven't figured out exactly why I don't know that they've been spending all their

the bottle next um that you've severed off\nFrom the bottle and yeah I think there's like some it's some fun stuff to do and I think all these things or you know better than getting five cents or the

Oregon Public service announcement brought you by the national Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the ad council\n[noise]\n[noise]\nShe's now back up here in mass and she's going to go into nursing home and ...\n... what can we do what's the situation here well I started asking questions and say well here's what we can do you think about this is this something you can get eligible for Medicaid last minute what these kinds of assets adds a lot you can the answer is absolutely yes how one of the business property ... right that's a business\nSo it's a rental type kind of place right it's a bed and breakfast\nIt's non accountable because it's generating in Comedy Central to self support so we have a provision a regulation that allows that to be non accountable so we take eight hundred thousand off the table\nWould that be true if it were just a straight business Todd and not a rental property type situation\nI think so okay yes I Do I Will comes off the table now they're going to put a lean on it mhm that's OK the liens always your friend because it's going to be at a much lower Medicaid rate than the private pay rate for the nursing home mhm way lower some like fourteen Fifteen thousand a month down to six\nPlus you get to use the ... rent\nTo maintain the property right so you get you get you get the rent to maintain the property and it's the ... rent that you give the nurse so after all your expenses that's ... and even that that rent along with your Social Security all goes towards reducing\nThe amount of money that the state would be paying so that lean every month is smaller clean get smaller Zachary ... okay\nSo I've got the business a property off the table [noise]\nWhat about the south Carolina property normally that was her home\nWell homes or non cannibal for single people\nUnless they're not located in the state oh remember that they have to be located in the state so that's the first issue but then I find out for single people if you move out of the house you can treat it as a former home\nAnd then the former home requirement does not require you to be living in the state ... it just as it has to be the former home and doesn't say where it has to be located flu song so now I Believe that South Carolina property will be protected from the nursing home and\nNot even sure they can put a lean on it because it's out of state there's some gray area as to whether or not and Massachusetts or any state can lean\nOut of state property interesting so at least we know the south Carolina property would be non accountable because we were checked the box that it's her home it's a former residents and she intends to return home even if she can't [laughter] wonderful so the ... so there's a million six\nOff the table already [noise] we got a hundred and sixty thousand and cash yeah he can only in two thousand 'cause she's single it's exactly right Susan so we're stuck with the two thousand or how do we get rid of a hundred and fifty thousand dollars\nWe can either buying annuity or use a pool trust mhm so probably depending on her age will take the money and put it into a pool trust might be easier um and and I would do that if I Would probably only do the poll trust if\nThe annuity doesn't work number wise meaning she's probably over Ninety so let's say she's eighty five I might do a pool ... I might do an annuity mhm go out by medicated annuity convert the asset into an income stream and she'll receive a monthly check\nAnd now that hundred and fifty thousand is no longer an asset preventing her from becoming eligible for Medicaid but instead ... was converted by buying the annuity into an income stream for her\nNow we've got her on Medicaid or there'll be Alina pay back actually but so what I might not do the poll trust because\nThe pull trust while it also would protect the money it not only has the pay back but it also has that little charitable piece that you got to pay ... depending on how long you live there either twenty percent to the charity if you live in the nursing home more than two years\nOr ten percent to the charity if you live in the nursing home less than two years so I should say two years or more you pay twenty yeah less than two years you pay ten\nSo you don't have the charity piece what the pay back on the annuity mhm so that's the difference between those two\nSo now you see we actually can get this personality trouble for Medicaid that all sounds great right\n[noise] except what I saw going on in the bank accounts for the business\nA lot of times the people that would work there would want to be paid in cash oh so there's withdrawals if for cash checks to pay the cash and ... and then she would pay the cash well\nAlso there would be checks to cash or checks written to the son\nWho's actually working there doesn't plumbing the opening the closing but if it's a check from your bank account which really was just in her name yet\nTo the sun that's going to look like a gift\nAnd now you're gonna have to prove that all these transfers we're actually not gifts mhm\nYou might be able to prove it you might not be able to so be careful how you operate it you're going to pay somebody to give them a W to write the check from the company you know show that it's reported on their income tax return show that they work there\nThese are things to think about operationally now having said all that I Am going to just gives you this last thought\nIf they had done all of this and put it into these trust in advance the house and the vacate or the house and the rental property would already be protected ...

included in the estate planning process once again here's Doug loves the Susan followers\nQuestions from listeners for you first\nQuestion comes from ... in Dorchester math and fell writes my wife recently passed away unexpectedly\nWe were in the process of drying up our trust but we never got to execute them before she died is there anything that can be done now to save our state a state tax exemptions we were worth around one point eight million when she passed when he got give us now\nA magic wand and ... and they were actually in their defense they were in the process of doing it\nTrue true true and and this is a\nReally a great story in the sense that that it can it can really help us understand how not planning is harmful mhm right so if you have one point eight million and you were successful at setting up to trust\nOr say to irrevocably toss it could be one replicable either way or that has a marital sharing the remainder share built in what that means is it's it's easier to explain what to trust say where I put\n... put nine hundred thousand dollars of assets in one trust and nine hundred thousand in another ... when the first spouse in this case died say the wife if she had done the planning right\nThere'd be nine hundred thousand dollars in her truck whether it's revolt ... irrelevant mhm what matters is there's two buckets that form inside her trust\nPeople need to realize that this trust doesn't fold up and go away and everything flows out into the spouses hands no the whole point of the trust is that it does not die mhm it keeps on going and\nWe then take the nine hundred thousand dollars of stuff that's in the trust and allocated to a share called the remainder share or to the marital share of the trust so romaine or the bypass shared gets the amount of assets\nUp to the state exemption mhm a million in Massachusetts yeah or your state exemption\nAnd the amount over that can go to the marital share in the marrow share allows us to make tax elections which I don't need to get into right now cause in this case there's nine hundred and the nine hundred would end up in the remainder share for the benefit of the surviving spouse mhm\nAnd because of the way that remainder share is drafted you would end up having those assets not just flowing into the hands of the healthy spouse but there for the healthy spouses benefit yup or surviving on I was just ... right but she doesn't own it\nAnd so she doesn't own it\nIf the surviving spouse doesn't own it\nThen when the surviving spouse dies it's not taxable what if it grows though what if they're hurt your his trust grows to be twice as that\nDoesn't matter never doesn't matter how much it grows it will never be whatever's left in there when the surviving spouse dies is not owned by the surviving spouses therefore not taxable and the surviving spouses estate\nBut because of that it would have been caused to be taxed in the\nFirst spouse to dies estate but it's nine hundred thousand you said hey we got a formula built in there that says hey the amount up to the exemption goes in this bucket mhm oh look it's less than a million\nSo while it's subject to tax in the first spouses estate to die\nThere's an exemption to use it up so we file a tax return but we don't have to pay taxes good question and the answer is no if it's less than the million dollar filing threshold I don't even need to file\nNice the estate tax return and there's no tax too so what about those folks that didn't get around to doing their planning we know federally you can use portability but is that available in the state can we do ... on the state\nSo you lose that and just to play out the string what happens right because if you follow the string I just did with the planning mhm\nNo tax on the first death less than a million\nSurviving spouse dies I say there's nine hundred thousand and her trust mhm less than a million no tax yep period\nThis way because no planning was done everything will likely went to the surviving spouse mhm [noise] surviving spouses now worth one point eight million which again this is why the marital deduction is so beneficial for the government not for us right it pumps up the surviving spouse is a state\nWith the deceased spouse has assets mhm so now she's at one point eight million which is greater than the million dollar exemption so when she dies there's about an eighty thousand dollar Massachusetts a state tax liability do anything to be done with that now\nI Can't think of anything I assume they just have simple whales that leave everything to each other so if they have simple wills that leave everything to each other the only thing you can really do at this point would be file a disclaimer saying ... made surviving spouse as if I died\nAnd then everything would go well that was going to come to me would go to my kids and now it's not but now you don't have the ... right yeah well you might be able to I I don't necessarily think I liked the result of that\nAnd you know folks filled clearly they put off they're planning a little too long I Know that his wife passed unexpectedly but get your planning in place folks there so many benefits they can come from that and if you're concerned not just about estate taxes and bloodline cleaning and boating probate\nMaybe you're concerned about depleting those assets impoverishing your spouse if you go into a nursing home\nFind out how these eerie vocal tries to operate find out the information that absolutely must be in your trust as well as those clauses that absolutely must not be included in your trust call right now to request you're free copy of Todd's designing ... guide\nAt eight six six eight for eight five six nine nine that's eight six six eight for eight five six\nNine nine or download a copy on our website legal exchange show dot com taught our last question comes from Karen in brain tree mass and Karen writes I transferred money into my ear evoke about trust four years ago\nI'd like to lend my daughter's some money to buy a house can I give her a loan from the trust that can be forgiven if I pass away and consider it as an advance on her inheritance I don't need the money so I'm fine if she doesn't actually we pay it to me [noise]\nSo you know Susan this is a great example just to show a and really it goes to the materials how flexible\nAny revoke will trust can be right 'cause all the operational things that we do for the trust from day to day are also laid out on our material and so\nI Want you to see how something that seems like you when you read the sewers and you might be saying you know what it doesn't seem like you should be able to do this with a narrow vocal trust mhm but you can\nYou can explain why so in this case the trust is allowed to lend money\nBut never to the ...\nOkay so you can't lend money to the person who created the trust of all that's okay that's mom mhm mom doesn't want the money mom wants to lend money to Karen I assume from the trust yes so the answer is you can do it you make sure you prepare all the proper paperwork don't cheat", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Real Stories of
