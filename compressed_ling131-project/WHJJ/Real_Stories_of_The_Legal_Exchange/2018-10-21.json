the past few years knows how expensive it can be is the price a little more worth it if your team wins recent research takes a look at which NFL fans\nGet the most further football money market watch says the best deal goes to Carolina Panthers fans who not only\nSo you just sparked two questions in my head when you said that one and and I don't remember if I share the story with you if I did apologize I'm doing it again [noise]\nI have clients that come in with that exact mentality that you just described shared about the irrevocably trust him right and this particular person had worked at Polaroid\nAnd retired and came in with that attitude\nCan't I Want to do it but I Know we were vocal trust just like you described Susan ... and I said to him\nYou worked at polarized right said yeah I said did they make a camera you said yeah I go to make one camera or did they make\nLots of cameras he said oh we made all kinds of cameras and I said there's all kinds of irrevocably trust out there and we can't come into these meetings with that preconceived idea about one kind of your vocal of trust and that really helped him understand\nBecause a lot of people they hear little sound bites if you will about different types of very vocal trust and it's not necessarily ... only correct\nAnd so now to answer your question that was one that sparked in my head enough to answer your question yes there are things that can be changed and the trust and again I think the flexibility is really similar to the flexibility of revolt will trust I mean let's face it\nWhen you want to change or revoke about trust and I have lots of clients with revoke about trust\nThey come in and what do they want to change not paragraph thirty five right of the trust they although they could\nThey come in and say you know what I Want to leave a little more to my grandchildren that I was leaving before them a little bit better than it is it cut I leave some there are or I have one child now who's really doing well and one child who's struggling can I leave a little more than one child than another\nWell yeah in the revolt will trust world we make that change for them and that's really all they ever want to change right or maybe the trustee\nWell into irrevocably Medicaid trusts world they can do those same changes\nThere's a limited powers appointment that allows them to rethink how they leave assets to their children mhm maybe two grandchildren maybe about two one child more than another\n... and maybe they want to remove and replace the trust the Caesar changes that they can do even an irrevocably trust yeah so they're really similar mhm not so different\nSo All right so let's go down the path that someone gets beyond that word eerie Vulcan when they decide they want to do their trust planning Todd ... and they're totally fine putting their primary residence in there and so they they fund their trust with their primary residence only\nBut they're still skeptical and fearful that their life will change significantly\nBy having this trust him play and they say I don't want to put any money in the trust now\nAnd then after a year goes by they say hey that's not so bad I Wonder if it's money now can they do that and they add money down the road\nYou know it's funny you asked that because I guess clients would think that\nYou know it's I guess it goes back to that you're a vocal trust mentality where it's etched in stone I went and I\nKnow we just got done explaining some flexibility that exists what these documents but but also we we have the ability to add to the trust so the answer is yes you can and I've had clients who have realized after they've put their home and they're like\nWow my life hasn't changed at all mhm I still live there I still pay all my bills my taxes I come and go as I please I could sell tomorrow if I wanted to and they're like\nI'm really not doing anything right right so ... All right well maybe I'll put some money now\nAbsolutely you can add money to the trust later with one ... one cautionary word\nWhen you add additional gifts to the trust\nAnd they're really incomplete gifts are not just but when you put additional assets in the trust you're creating a new five year waiting period\nBut only for that new item okay so if I put today my house and vacation home in\nIn five years that will be protected mhm\nOne year later mhm I add a hundred thousand dollars to the trust it from my investment portfolio yes five years from then that will be protected now that sounds like a lot but play out the string\nWhen you get past the initial five years yep the house and the vacation home are now protected mhm\nWell folks you only have one more year to go because the other five your clock was piggybacking around the same time table as the old one okay and so one more year later after the initial five years\nAnd you've protected the hundred thousand so it's not so bad just be mindful of how old you are when you make that a\nDad in your family your how do you want to put as much as you can end up front when you're initially funding it but I Know that it can

I I think that in of itself enough\nReason why people would want to write not do that so All right so now I've I've got to the point where if avoiding probate is one of your concerns than that and that's your only concern that a revolt couple trust will get you there you don't need the irrevocably trust\n'em now also the revolt will trust\nWill allow you to direct how when when your\nNieces and nephews get the assets rang\nAnd and and that's important because you know maybe you want a divorce proof for for them maybe one creditor protected for them maybe there's things you want to do with these assets to protect them or to control them from the grave\nAnd the revolt ... trust in this example will do that now when you were a vocal trust would do that as well\nBut I'm Still kind of focused on the revolt couple so those would be too important reasons probate and how to get it to them maybe help excluded from their state for a state tax purposes as well as skip a generation maybe control it for the uh great nieces and nephews as well\nAnd if she doesn't have any plan in place right now including a well those assets those wouldn't land when her niece's they will go to a different succession plan right well\nI'm not really sure if you don't have a well you're you're you're correct you'd have to look to the interstates succession statute and it might be they would go to the next closest next of kin which\nYou know probably not parents if she's Seventy nine but that would be next right then it would be siblings so the fact that she's got nieces and nephews were telling me that she does have siblings and must they pray to sister\nUm than\nThose assets we'll go to siblings first right and you're never really want to leave it across a generation you always want to leave it down a generation to save taxes\nAnd not to mention her siblings are probably the same age that she is in maybe\nHave issues with nursing homes you know it could be a nursing home issue and the last comment would be why not do that your vocal trust what she does have a decent amount of long term care insurance coverage which I think is helpful number one not enough to cover the full boat\nBut again having no immediate children her immediate need might not be all yeah it's very important that I save assets from the nursing home for my nieces and nephews more you know whatever's left they can have\nWell if that's the case then you don't coupled with the long term care insurance I'd probably be leaning towards the revolt couple of trust plan for her okay are based on this this fact\nBut some type of trust plan Brenda because you want to avoid probing you want to make sure those assets go where you want them to\nFolks if you are considering creating ... trusting you're not sure really what you should be looking for when you sit down with the attorney that's going to draft your documents\nTodd has created a guide for the month of October it's titled designing and income only irrevocably trust and it includes six provisions that absolutely must be in your ear evoke about trust and sixteen\nProvisions that absolutely must not be included it's a great baseline to educate yourself on how these trust work folks\nYou can raise questions are free copy of Todd's designing your irreversible trust guide\nBy calling eight six six eight for eight five six nine nine

rights\nWhat does Medicaid consider fair market value when selling a home would it be the assessed value I'd like to purchase my mother's home from her and she is willing to sell it to me at a discount however I don't want to run into any issues down the road as she is in failing health oh\nDon I'm going to start off by saying I'm not loving the idea of you buying the whole\nRight I mean can you buy the home and in fact I I had a student in my class asked a similar question what is fair market value and you know what if you sell the home right before you go to the nursing home is that going to be a disqualifying transfer\nIf I sell it for fair market value or if I sell it for less than fair market value\nWell certainly if you do anything in terms of transferring assets and not get back fair market value it will be a disqualifying transfer mhm so that's number one\nIn terms of answering that kind of question number two what is fair market value the assessed value will do it okay mess for a mass health purposes anyway for Medicaid purposes so they only require the most recent real estate tax bill value okay to be considered fair market value\nWhich I think in most cases probably less than less\nThan what I could sell it for I think so you get a little ... discount by buying it uh at at that value I wouldn't go lower than that because then it would fall below what is that fair market value threshold and it would create", "show_name": "Real Stories of The Legal Exchange", "year": "2018", "city": "Providence", "day": "21"}
