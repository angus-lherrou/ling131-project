as a she was the UN ambassador was doing a great job she decided to resigned today so there is so they're they're they're working over time trying to come up\nWith ah with with lead\nLinings for this well can we started with my conspiracy theory what's that my conspiracy theory\nIs that he fires Jeff Sessions is a G appoints Lindsey Graham is the new attorney general uh than the governor of South Carolina McMaster appoints Nikki Haley to be a senator or she waits and kind of like the underdog league until it's time for her to run the Senate and twenty twenty four\nOr ... or us we're sorry for president maybe maybe she's a vice president for my pets\nYeah but I see I don't think Lindsey Graham wants to be in the cabinet oh I don't either he said as much yeah so I I think I said why were thrown out crazy conspiracy theories that's mine right well the ... the craziest what I heard was that she was going to run against\nTrump in twenty twenty ... wait a second she's ... she's going to cut up the big anti Trump voted the Republican primaries with Jeff Flake who is probably not going to run now ... and John ... is that why is that the thing yes\nGrace I think she's going to be BP in twenty twenty four or tiny last\nFor Kanye West see this is another see this is a whole nother theory is that you know Kanye West is going to have lunch at the White House on Thursday so they ... this

the ... out on the street corner\nAnd hasn't been burned and went back here at all I'm Talking about the Kanye West theory which is he's a Trump is invited Kanye West\nTo the White House to offer him be ambassadors shipped to the U.S\nNow I mean you know what I I don't know about you personally if if I was offered the ambassador ship to the un I'd say this is a gag right breakfast\n[laughter] I

I'm just saying there's a lot of weird weird leap going on by the way many cheated from signing a\nBit of trouble about your well I think the the thing that was crazy it's to me was all of the never Trump present in the moon batch trying to find some like proximity reason why she left like oh you didn't like the way he talked about Brett Kavanaugh last night didn't like the ... or she didn't like the confirmation\n... sometimes I think the weather is really overrated in terms of you know we I mean we certainly we talk a lot about it on this show what rush talks a lot about it like it's really like you know setting the pace for others to follow as they used to say on the radio but I I don't see it\nEight for four or five hundred forty to forty to another theory another Nikki Haley theory\nNikki Haley wrote that op ed piece for the for the New York times and but the ... ah that Rod Rosenstein he was going to out her\nAnd so that's why they fired her and that's why that's why he went on the plate right because they had to discuss the black male material she had on one of a a one of the president's favorites\nI mean I could see that happening felt like she was on the Trump train from the very beginning yeah but I think she's come around though you know I don't know I don't know that she has because remember she they they don't some kind of policy about Russia sanctions and the White House said well Nikki Haley was confused and she fired back I don't get confused\nYeah but I think that's like that's that's kind of a minor thing\nI mean you know and again you she's in a foxhole with the guy I mean look what the New York times tried to do to her I mean that was probably one of the biggest examples of fake news\nWell before the capital H [laughter] every the kind of pales\nSince the since the Kavanaugh a you know on a slot uh all\nYour ... no time will take some calls we come back eight four or five hundred forty to forty to race will be here with some more news we've got a lot of stuff to get to hear today and the uh the the VIPs came on a very good day 'cause we're going to have some\nMeat deliveries from butcher a box oh boy this good stuff\nFor four or five hundred forty to forty two um how we [noise]\n\nFox News on the hand by FEMA director Brock Long surveying the damage in the panhandle area today caused by hurricane Michael\nGot a long way to go the hardest mission is going to be a slice of fame and getting thousands of people out of shelters in a more suitable living condition\nBut ultimately there's going to be a long term housing mission or mental that lies ahead and it's going to take many months\nPresident Trump made additional disaster assistance available to the state today the death toll from hurricane Michael is estimated at Eighteen election day fast approaching how's the journey leader Kevin McCarthy predict how the Republicans will fail welfare\nI say this is going to be a battle because of the financial resources the Democrats have against us but the number of our candidates are doing very well and have gotten a bump in the last couple of weeks\n[noise] McCarthy on Sunday Morning futures Fox News [noise]\nNow you're storm team ten forecast powered by Dunkin' Donuts sigh of maple pecan or pumpkin ice coffee only two dollars from two to six PM\nStars in high clouds near seasonable tonight increasing clouds overnight low forty two to forty seven\nCloudy Monday rain showers develop mid morning gusty and milder in the afternoon still cloudy and its steadier period of rain at night southwest wins Fifteen to thirty five miles per hour in the afternoon a night daytime highs mid to upper sixties\nOvernight lows in the mid fifties before we clear at the sunshine on Tuesday I'm storm team ten meteorologist RJ high a news radio nine twenty and one of four seven FM news radio nine twenty and one oh four seven ...

whether it has no desire to die in the hands of the squirrels or to live in a life of the land well let's close close enough pretty damn club so Florida general [laughter] okay and also in the news is Taylor Swift and she's been non political forty\nYears and years and years and now she's come out and said that she's on endorsing a Democrat in Tennessee which is where she's from I think and so they asked Trump about it\nYou are or what what has opened up what appears to be a four point lead based out of doors but she's running she's running away with it [laughter] you know that can neck a week ago\nHow ... how can the mood about to be all excited about Taylor Swift invited endorsing a Democrat when he said openly he was going to vote for Kavanaugh so he's not like a a crazy Mazie not exactly in Elizabeth Warren [noise]\n[noise] yeah it was just\nI mean he put it but he he's a guy who go with this ... put it into the Web I mean he's he saw which way the weather was why they didn't do any good like I said he's lost another four or five points since that\nI just don't think\nOkay if you're if you're kind of an nobody ... it does make sense to come out politically and say you know I support Donald Trump because then you do get a big fan base like Scott what's his name Scott bail\nYes like no one really knew him 'cause he was on TV so long ago I'm Joni and talk to you whatever I don't know I was not even I was not even close to being born thank God um but anyway so he can don't endorse it's kind of a sudden he has all these people who like like Scott that's great but if you Taylor Swift\nWhat do you have to gain from that besides losing people like everybody loves you know what I mean you're not like trying to gain one side so you have both sides and then you know everybody loves Taylor Swift\nWell like anybody love Taylor Swift loves her gee how we car\nI ...

is a this this is what the this was before the boycott may just what I think of boycott of banks\nJane Mayer Ronan Farrow ran with Kavanaugh hit piece in the New Yorker to show a pattern of behavior\nPatterns of behavior\nSo so in other words they knew that they couldn't find anybody to back up this woman ... story which he couldn't remember 'cause she was so loaded and she she she had to talk to her lawyer before she could even come up with some kind of a memory gaps about what the cabinet had allegedly done but they wanted to show the pattern\nOf behavior I\nThought you know a few ... if you'd try to stay there was just another story and one of the papers today in LA there are ... there are sheriff's deputies are being accused of stopping Latino\nZ it's called racial profiling right\nBecause there's a pattern of behavior the deputies are saying so what is the difference between a\nI don't know of behavior for ah for Brett Kavanaugh I bet you think which it turns out it's not even true at a pattern of behavior for us stopping drivers are stopping anybody because you suspect that uh they're they're uh they're engaged in the various activities\nSo that Ronan Farrow he's shot we're going to need a new poll question or a Steve someone just ... yeah the uh one of our other questions was will be ah well the teacher in Minnesota or be fired or resign and I said no this is the uh this is the teacher\nOr she's in rows amount which is I guess near Minneapolis rose mount educator this is the headline in the uh the Minneapolis Red Star Tribune as they call it out there a rose mount educator on leave after tweeting kill Kavanaugh\n\nArose out special education teacher has been pet placed on paid administrative leave after posting a tweet Saturday that appeared to call for the killing of new Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh it appeared here's what it said so who knows that's by the way I spelled W H O s e\nWho's where\nDid she go to college by the way they wouldn't have any information that you go to college with Christine Blasey Ford at my alma mater so who's going to take one for the team and kill capping off\nSo that it appears that she was calling for someone to kill a cabinet because she used the words killed Kavanaugh in there\nBut so are we I was I was expecting but she was just going to claim but the you know she was suffering some kind of breakdown and would have to undergo two hours of counseling before she could return to the classroom but apparently she resigned so we're gonna have to come up with a new question\nAnd a John Heinz Iraq was on the show sometimes from power line blog or he says I'm so old I can remember when teachers knew how to spell\n[laughter]\nYeah you are showing your age their job and when you talk about that who's\nGoing to here's a a poll question uh this is a CNN of all Paul's by twenty eight points independence approve of a Democrat Kavanaugh tactics\nIndependent voters are expressing overwhelming disapproval of the way the Democrats handle the Kavanaugh's confirmation fight\nThe uh the G O P didn't fare much better oh how how can that be fifty five thirty five disapprove that's that's I I don't okay it is a CNN poll aid for four or five hundred forty to forty two did you hear about the Facebook executive is they miss cap what\nAnd he's apparently a long time he's in he's based in DC I guess he's basically a lobbyist for a Facebook and he's a longtime friend of a of Brett Kavanaugh go probably going back to Bush White house days and so he ... he decided to come as a as as a as a supporter of Kavanaugh\nWay better you know like I read the copy I say I don't know if my people killed ought to be healthier but they they are concerned that pace\nThe taste is incredible um yeah so grass fed basically the animal just lived on grass for his entire life um and going back to your question\nThe challenges this country is set up for a couple of things one nobody cares about the farmer anymore to um everyone's trying to get the cheapest price possible to you I'm basically\nFeeding an animal grass takes a lot of time or in the system is set up to incentivize the farmer to get rid of the cat right it's actually kind of crazy like even down to the loan so\nFormer gets alone to take the cow between six months in Eighteen months that loan expires at Eighteen months which means
