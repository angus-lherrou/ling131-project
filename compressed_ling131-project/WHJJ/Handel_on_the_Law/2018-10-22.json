I liked the Peruvian\nPart because remember George Zimmerman the guy who shot Trayvon Martin he was ... his mother was Peruvian and as far as the mainstream media was concerned he was a honky he was a crack that he was missed the trolley was the man\nSo now though they're using vis a vis a\nColombian Peruvian Mexican a DNA because they say there's not enough but the the the bottom line here is that under bureau of Indian affairs standard she couldn't get a card\nRight that's a that's a federal regulation under the bylaws of all\nThe Indian nations that she claims to be a a ... be a member of our claims to be a a tribesmen of or whatever you call it\nShe she's not an Indian she's a white woman\nAnd Harvard University describes her in Nineteen Ninety seven when they were trying to wiggle out from under some discrimination or allegations they described her as a woman of color is she is she a woman of color\nNo she's not a woman of color air go she's a fake Andy\nAnd you know you want to talk about it we're not going to be talking about a much today I was planning to earlier but I Will get to it later in the week it's going to go on for a while this is the day of the opening arguments or the ... I don't know if it's jury selection are opening arguments and the Harvard University case the Asian students against the Harvard University case\nAnd they're they're accusing Harvard of the ... in Denmark\nRacism in ah in passing over a qualified Asian Americans in the admissions process to\nTo admit\nLess qualified blacks and Hispanics and of course this has been going on for a hundred years a hundred years ago it was a juice that were being passed over now it's Asian Americans but it's the same it's the same game and\nSo now now we have this this other a racist scheme that was going on to\nTo uh to to uh identify Elizabeth Warren as a as a woman of color and so they are so but you know this is not for you and me this is not for people who follow the news\nAnd who have jobs this is for the credit journalists Democrats\nOperatives with press passes in the major media that's who this is for so they can say well there is this study and then they'll never they'll never mentioned that the study proves that she's not in India they were there is a study that's all that matters so so\nThis is good but what's in the studies is going down the into the black hole of memory\nAnd I actually the the globe has been trying to rehabilitate her uh her her phoney baloney or ethnic heritage now for well they they did it from day one remember when the six years ago the New England historical and Jeannie a logical society was asked to what check her out\nAnd they said they could find no evidence of any ... any a Native American heritage\nIn her background and so the globe just pretended that the\nSociety had found out that there was they just kept report it they they ... the society said there is no evidence the globe reported for two or three weeks that they had discovered evidence is that because that's that's the way the globe operates I mean she is in the Senate seat once held by Ted Kennedy and every six year\nAt this time there would be running stories Senator Kennedy turning his life around Senator Kennedy is stop drinking Senator Kennedy's on a diet is this is the same thing it's just a different list with Warren has taken the test Elizabeth Warren is\nPart Indian okay one one thousand twelve Indian but she's part Indian she's not telling a lie but she releases her DNA how can we how 'bout you\nRight highly highly I remember six seven years ago whatever what she said poppy or whoever\nPop went set it\nTo the other community and then you know because they didn't believe in an interracial ah type a marriage is whatever you want to call this right you know so it's\nA it's like she's only like three steps away and grandparents that high sixty eight to ten ten ... years ago so there's a little bit of that at all so why Harvard announced we have a minority a woman\nOh now I've got to get into the heart of the characters on wire that we had her senator and the state of ...\nAnd and you know the the first the first the apology or whatever you want to call it the excuse alibi that the global brand they actually had the documents from the University of Pennsylvania where she\nChanged her racial racial classification from white two woman\nTo see color whatever the hell what ... what the hell is colored by the way aid for four or five hundred forty to forty to hear about this during an interview with the globe published last month Warren explained that she identified herself as Native American in the late eighties and early nineties as many of the matriarch\nOf her family were dying and she began to feel that her family

makes it even more appalling at a ... that she would try to commit this kind of ethnic fraud with no no basis in reality\nYeah it's it's also just so weird that\nShe would continue this and like Blumenthal is a liar but at least one Trump makes a jab at him a kind of died off afterwards because he's not like actually I was there at one point at some point you just have to say you know what\nI lied and own it and then and then and then it then it's dead it's not dead if you if you're like well technically I didn't lie\nYeah I mean bookers not good Cory bookers and claiming to be Spartacus anymore but she basically went up today and said I'm drawing them all\nBut ... that's ... ... ... he's on fire today but it's true I Know and when you really think about it okay so she has maybe according to this guy\nWhoever he is some tiny tiny percentage does that mean that she should be checking things off because if that's a new standard than kids applying for school everyone to check off that they're Hispanic or that they are black\nAnd you really can't get mad at them because Elizabeth Warren who is probably going to run for president did it oh she's running and the media to plotting her for it like you were so proud of her she is a tiny tiny tiny tiny percent Pocahontas no she's not\nSo I Want to see what I'm looking forward to seeing her FCC report so to see where the expenditure is paying for this test how much do you think they paid for the test\nOn I'll go down a lot more than we pay for our test let me put it that well if the guy did it for free than he is an kinds cause and supposedly he didn't know that he was testing Elizabeth Warren's a spit right right we believe that the ... when\nShe called them up she was so smog and proud of herself so the president always has called my mother a liar but what you're saying is she was telling the truth he's like yes there is absolutely chance that millions of years ago there was someone in your family may may happen a Native American\nMaybe potentially and oh by the way the woman the woman that they're linking linking him to is this woman the\nThe overseas Sara Smith Crawford now there's no evidence that she ever claimed to be\nAn uh an a Native American and and oh by the way she married a guy by the name of a William J Crawford do you know with William J Crawford's a\nJob was it was the

really the childlike amount of you and a calculator\nIt's worse than I\nMean it's like your shoes the child of a slave and a member of the Ku Klux Klan yeah according to her according to her own testimony\nCrazy max and her father's parents must have had such antennas up to know that the person their son was marrying had such distant maybe Native American like what did they maybe\nTo a point it was like one five hundred twelve yeah so the SOS boy I mean you talk about the ... you always talk about gay Darby that was bought gave these people had Indians are yeah they could they could spot

Native American it it it could be Hispanic so her name was ... she can change your name from Elizabeth\nWarren to Elizabethan war and like the a bust out the Texas Senate candidate whose pretending she's pretending to be an Indian and he's pretending to be Hispanic so\nMy question is if you were one sixty fourth Asian is that enough for Harvard to discriminate against you\nRight I Will but anyway listen so here it is so so then I buy like an hour after they post the story they say a correction\nUm\nRange isn't from one thirty second to five hundred won five hundred and twelve bits from one thirty seconds to one one thousand and twenty four and so again I'm not a\nI'm not very good at math but I said to myself well if the if the upper range is faults that does it the bottom range have to be false to I mean it's not like basic\nMath\nBut the you know so we used to I we started referring to what his one sixty fourth and the Breitbart News started referring to it as one sixty fourth but the globe kept running with it because they want to allow all the moon bats\nThat put their Facebook page postings up saying that it's one third that she's she's got evidence such as it is claiming but she's one thirty second but it was false so finally about a half hour ago they posted a second correction saying but at at most she is one\nSixty fourth India\nOr Native American or non white and of course here's the thing the average\nWhite America and the average American or European descent has more Native American blood than she apparently does but she is claiming to be an Indian and she is claiming but she has a right to uh to have gotten and affirmative action position first at the University of Pennsylvania and then at Harvard University law school\nAnd of course we have ... or ... what the\nOne fifty five Elizabeth Warren she's a member of she's a Cherokee according to this was before the Cherokee and her uh her her she's got several recipes that you're there all lifted from various places my favorite is called omelets with crab meat which lifted from uh New York times spreads\nCookbook All right uh [laughter]\nYou know this is this is just such a such a crock ... and it's so classic of the Democrat Party and the mainstream media to print fake news and then correct the fake those after the uh after\nThe lives have gone around the world and are are already posted and so tonight I guarantee you if you go to the the usual left wing cable news cast they will still be repeating ally which is already a been retracted\nBy the uh additional fake news outlet to report it the Boston Globe that she's one thirty second India but you know what it doesn't even matter if she's one thirty second Indian that's not good enough the claim to be an Indian\nWhether it's a bureau of Indian affairs standards whether it's the a tribal role she she claims she's part Cherokee part Delaware that's not good enough she's not in India\nIf they if they were printing truthful headlines in the in the top left media the headline would say white woman's DNA tests prove she's white woman or a DNA test confirm Elizabeth Warren\nFate is a fake ending 'cause that's what she is she's a fake Indian\nDidn't achieve some a text there says didn't the Cherokee Nation state that done our ancestry and could not find any connection\nYes of course yeah she's a she's a fried she's a fraud and now they're saying that the oh she's she's proven that she's an indie she she's proven she's proven she's not in India and we don't even know where this DNA test was non\nShe gave it to some uh Stanford University professor who's a a I guess he's a biochemist he's not even a geneticist these of I think a biophysicist\nAnd ... he they let him do the analysis the quote unquote analysis of the DNA and he's and he's given her this uh this this bill of health although it's not a bill of health is just proving she's not in India\nAnd yet they're gonna yet this is going to be this'll be today's big lie from the all left media Elizabeth Warren proves she's an Indian\nHey how are you still listen if that if that is correct and the African American or European descent has actually more\nPercentage rate than she currently is saying she had right how will areas but at the ... well ... task and he had a higher wage ... and she did\nWell I I think he I think his family is like ... they've been over here that long and ... his father is German like ... second generation German and his mother is first generation scotch Irish\nSauce Scots Irish so I Would think that he's probably like maybe a hundred percent the European but you know you're right I mean he might as well take it I mean the you never know what's going to turn up\nAnd uh you know that was that's the thing if she took the same pass that all of us talk you know just for laughs you know she would shoot people would have more belief I mean I don't I don't think the the test would be any different it might even be even more damage than the one that she but she put out there but\nAt least people would believe it we know ones whose believing all these tests that these Democrats are putting up now you know me as a Christine Blasey Ford's a\nTest or you know ... and and be the recovered memories of all these other people I mean they've they've kind of a reduced the credibility of ah of people like this in this
