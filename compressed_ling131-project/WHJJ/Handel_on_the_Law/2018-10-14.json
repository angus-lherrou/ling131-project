the law Chris oh yeah there's\nA new tax law that allows me to a ... tax return from Eighteen years ago they tried to get a refund paid on military severance pay back then I was married to a someone that I cannot locate now are hiding from having to pay ... or\nSo I have no way of contacting her and I haven't heard from her and like sixteen years [laughter] I don't know how to amend a tax return that will join with only one signature\nAh there there has to be a way of doing that\nBecause if the law allows someone\nTo file an amended return Twenty years later Eighteen years later a there's a a decent chance at the other partner their spouse or ... is not around\nEither can't be found a somewhere out there on remarried died whatever so I there there has to be a way within the rules of the IRS\nBecause uh the Irish is pretty good about issuing five thousand new rules every other minute\nSo the trick is to find an accountant straight out accountant who understands these rules and now when you file your tax returns you have an accountant\nChris yeah yeah have you asked your account about this\nYes and he wasn't curve any way to do it then he had and I happen to have an appointment with the Iraq on friday\nAnd that is under yeah that's the way I'm Glad you're asking me because of my vast\nExpertise with not only this is tax law or this or tax returns and of course I you know when I have a complicated problem do you think I sit and researcher look it up now I go to my account and Chris\nJust like you did not what you did is you went a step beyond and that is what I Would tell you if your account and doesn't know or several accountants you make an appointment with the IRS and yet and you might have\nRejected that I actually just fine at myself and a maybe a picnic or just magically appear\nNow now I I I don't know if I I don't know if I Would do that I don't know if I Would do that what I Would say to the IRS is do I have to find her and uh then I Will then I'll go to extraordinary lengths to find her and that's when I go out\nThat many grand behind it All right that's another issue and I mean there's a new and and you may be able to get\nThe whole thing okay based on the child support order\nSo I the magical signature ah she's she's still entitled to half of that yeah now they're", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Handel on the Law", "city": "Providence",
