I I think it's too easy to argue you're a liar on this one mark 'cause you don't have to have the proof not that you are\nOkay I'm not at all to saying you're a liar although you do sound like one a but it's just too is just too easy to uh attack you on this one so argue the fee you obviously you totally collection easy to go pounds ... pounds sand on this one tell them to sue you and uh then you have to defend yourself it'll be a small claims who probably\nAnd uh then you have to worry about your credit being dangerous ... even a disputed has your credit already been attacked right yeah\nIt probably will our our credit yeah probably will you got a message on your hands and there's no there's no good way out of this\nI mean half the money to alert\nThen maybe you want to pay the other hand it was just negotiate with them and the judge said I'll give you half the money now\nI have and but there are I I mean it for money more than anybody I wrote or giving them the money or\nCurrent well then you negotiate it on a payment you tell them to go pounds sand or you look at your credit you got your choices none of them very good unfortunately I'm not a good place to me sometimes and I often say this is a everybody looks to the law as an answer\nAnd quite often the laws very sloppy that it's not very clean ah for example what's what's clean about all I have you committed a crime yes or no right it's very clean the jury determines yes or the judge determines here's a statute\nYes thirty five miles per hour is law un thirty six or thirty seven boom you violated see that's clean stuff I loan you a thousand dollars you don't pay me there it is now dogs barking next door because they're too loud\nAnd I want a restraining order what does that mean\nOne is too loud it's just a sloppy way of of dealing with things and this is one of those where the to answer this is just there's nothing clean about it there really isn't so all I can say is I'm Glad it's him and I'm Glad it's not me\nThere you go silver lining every moment okay or\nAlexander Hi Alexander from where he is or what can I Do for you\nOr I had a debt owed to a credit card company fifty nine hundred dollars or judgment was ... years later that judge back this up here at our receive a cat's always ended up that from the IRS showing Nineteen thousand nine hundred\nOkay way to say I view oh hold on are you a cancellation of debt for Nineteen thousand nine hundred dollars correct so you're so you're dealing with the IRS that's you're not dealing with the original credit card company you're dealing with the IRS someone ten Ninety nine you for Nineteen thousand dollars is that correct\nYeah okay so the IRS is now saying you will or you're forgiven this much\nDebt and uh and they got a judgment against you correct no they didn't they sue you or they just wrote it off\nMe a original credit card company I owe Fifteen\n... did they write it off\nOr I don't know if they did ... were you ever sued or no but there was a judgment so that means you were that means you were sued okay All right\nAnd so uh you got a judgment against you in a ... it's a little complicated because ah they forgiveness of deadly\nLet me tell you the whole story okay if you\nYou can follow it a little bit better be original that fifty nine hundred I received a judgment the Ira among the credit card company after giving up years later the IRS\nYeah no I understand sent IRS a ten Ninety nine on your behalf because like with\nThe ... the amount that they said I owe you said Nineteen thousand dollars the original that fifty nine hundred I\nThink are are they are or if a copy of my credit report showed fifty nine hotter it\nDoesn't matter I ... it doesn't matter I don't care that\nReduced the IRS then reduce their mind think power than nine hundred back the fifty nine hundred I paid the debt off so I'm square my question is Trent the credit card company and white at the debt from fifty nine and Ninety nine do I have a record\nBecause because no because you didn't pay the tax on the Ninety nine you ended up accepting the ten Ninety nine was for the fifty nine hundred dollars that was originally in default the point is there are no they they all knew that there are no damn book but they reduce city get\nNo not that I'm the eye or is\nThat right but that's the only thing you have is the IRS they already have a judgment they've given up they're not collecting on the judgment\nSo about credit card company has no recourse\nNow it's only been there done a statute is done\nEven though they play the fifty nine hundred ...\nDoes it matter lions are they inflated the fifty nine hundred on the ten Ninety nine not not on the judgment they issued a ten Ninety nine for Nineteen thousand you got that reduced to the original fifty nine hundred dollar where are you are damages\nOf the question is sent the credit card company and the way that the\nOriginal amount yes they did four times over yes there is no recourse against them only\nBecause you have not been damaged\nIf you want me to go out in dollars when I send you a bill for a hundred thousand dollars and then you end up paying me two thousand dollars I expect it and I accept that\nWell uh I'm I've been damaged Ninety eight thousand dollars no haven't you paint do thousand\nOaks oh\nGod we went through that over and over and over again I Would have been I wouldn't inflated twenty five\nThousand dollars just because of patients issue good God take me for an idiot yeah they do I guess people thank me for a complete moron bill\nLet me

[noise] well I ... a retired Fifteen Years ago\nHe's Seventy nine years old what does he care yeah matter of fact\nAh he said that he did this about fifty times in the Nineteen seventies\nNineteen eighties and during the sentencing or in twenty Seventeen he said he was sorry I'm Sorry for the pain I have caused\nBy his conviction and he was convicted of the crime but of course like I said oh I'm In jail his conviction and lack of medical license will not change his professional status because he retired ten years ago and here's the good one ah he wasn't convicted of betraying his patients\nBecause the laws not specific enough he was a convicted of lying to investigators who are investigating it and he pled guilty to two counts of obstruction of justice and received a suspended sentence of one year\nYeah pretty amazing story is that and incidentally as crazy as it sounds I Know about half a dozen cases throughout the years have doctors doing this\nAll right uh let's say go ahead and take some phone calls a Ronald well certainly do Hi Ronald welcome to handle on law\nMaurice er and April I was at work and I felt when this on my right side\nThe next day I went to my doctor who immediately sent me to the hospital upon the hot water table walk and sign all or was it made it into the hospital over the course of the next six days I had a CAT scan ... MRI and a spinal tap\nThat the six day those doctors cannot determine what was wrong with me\nThroughout those six days or can can you or our basic quicker lives on the right side of my body after six days this or this charge me not knowing what was going literary saying\nTake two Advil calm airport is so we went to get a second opinion will second doctor said he didn't see the ... from the first doctor was also a nurse Ramirez certainly by the way so we went to go get those are more hours but I felt like I was having a stroke\nRights are more ... more to his arm my rights direct baseless droopy I went to a different hospital [noise]\nWithin two hours they were able to tell me that did not have a stroke that I had to bring a cancerous tumor\nWilliam and restarting doing work I had a biopsy they told me I was diagnosed with the question is if I could have gotten out earlier that tumor or not to put pressure on my brain I wouldn't not a bad a Sable\nI'm OK Now okay I got it uh so let me throw some questions that you uh during the course of those six days had the doctors are discovered\nA that you had this brain tumor\nOh I'm Sorry\nI yeah I Know the doctors and not discover it but that was so over six days to the brain tumor grow and cause pressure\nOver six days a tumor grew Yes sir and how do you know that\nBecause I ... I was able to walk into the hospital so I'm I'm a ... normally stays there that was put in such pressure on my brain dark and there was on my brain dam mhm that I could not walk I\nCould not okay and I was moving I'm assuming well uh my guess is ah you left\nYour ah neurosurgery ... surgery residency a little bit earlier so you weren't ...\nYou didn't get board certified um do you have a doctor that will say two things number one I had they taken out the tumor six days before or you would never have had these problems\nAnd you would be fine you wouldn't had slurring you wouldn't matter problem there wouldn't be pressure\nI don't know why I'm calling\nYou may not talk to my ... well being in colleges it'll be a it'll be a neurosurgeon\nWho's ... going to make that call and you're gonna have to have that doctors say that and willing to testify to that so that's one issue how let's so it was the second issue I any permanent brain damage any permanent injury neurological injury\n[noise] not that I Know it's\nOkay so what you have is you hear your damages six days of soaring and six days of a walking around or not walking around thinking you had a stroke okay what what does that\nWork six days of that when you say\nI was not able to work\nI mean I don't think you might call you miss six days at work I understand there's some damage as they are not arguing that aren't damages I'm what I'm saying is what do you think that's worth\nI honestly I don't know\nYeah I don't either so ah I I think even though there could very well have been malpractice a ... then there may be an argument that there wasn't we looked and or a doctor could have easily miss that ah that's the other defense that uh the first group of doctors said but you're making a lot of medical exemptions here\nThat ah you I don't have the legal right to make that you're going to need some very heavy duty second opinions\nAnd it's going to get very wonky and very technical and you can bet the insurance company is going to defend this thing like crazy and you're going to need a top notch medical malpractice surgeon who's pay off will be six days\nOf you walking around like you were slurring and losing six days of work do you see the ...\nAll right but that's continued to this day\nThat's what I asked is do you have any long term problems as a result of what happens and having missed the tumor for six days is that was cause the long term problems yeah okay and you know that for a fact doctors have told you that\nYes I mean I'm Still going through chemotherapy\nI'm not arguing that you would have gone through chemotherapy anyway correct All right so six days is all the difference in the world you'd be jumping you'd be doing a judge jumping jacks she'd be flying around and you'd be fine if they had discovered the tumor six days before\nOkay but I Believe so I\nWell doctor and a ... where where was your residency in neurosurgery let's go sue because we have to put you on the stand\nAnd ah we have to absolutely a approved the court that you have the certifications that you have the credentials as an expert so let's start with ... ah where'd you go medical school\nOh I'm okay how about your residency a neurosurgery record earnings how many uh\nAnd how long have you been a neurosurgeon 'cause you want to do this for years and years in order to gap

say hey you're interfering uh with my business interference with a a contractual relations or potential\nA contract or because people can confuse you and every day that's the whole issue of confusion

like anybody else would\n\nAll right oh here's a similar one Shane Hi Shane right up my alley yeah see a good segue to this one All right\n[noise] [noise] Hi uh I have a a we have that piece of mail saying infringing on a fashion Patton of fashion\nAbout what I yeah I mean what how much is a ticket for like ... ... dollars are going to be a lot when I hear you you go to court I Would just pay it but here\nYou may have an argument and you go in front of a judge you go your honor here's what happened a B C and D and die they said we should have filed a police report who helped ... police report over a stolen sticker on a license plate because\nOnce I put the sticker on license plate like every other human being who pays attention anymore\nBut that might protect every day\nYeah exactly I think it's I think pain is a decent decent defence a shirt tell it to a judge 'cause war's happened you'd have to pay for the chicken anyway\nYeah I mean that's the worst of it so it it's worth half a day in court and then you get to see traffic court and you get to see these other people come up with the most insane defenses you've ever seen\nAnd the and the fun one where are the people come up and they said you'll tea with an explanation\nAs if the judge chairs you're they're guilty or you're not so whenever you see someone guilty when the next when they are depending on the judge or if the judge allows the person to explain just to get it off his or her chest the ... you only the judges eyes roll which is always kind of fun and the judge will say\nWho cares\nYou know explain it to your pet ... because I don't want to hear it so I Would go try it why not I I think if you look at it I mean it's it's certainly a logical what you're saying\nI mean you're up welcome to Marty Yes sir\nHe built up at a question about employment ah I signed on with the company back on the two thousand and part of my original shop offer wished that I Would be entitled to a ball of a minimum of thousand dollars per year\nAh they pay that bonus for both the first six or seven years and then did not when the economy hit the skin in two thousand they\nUh they continued not to pay me that bonus for a total of nine years\nI left the company last year and I'm Wondering if I have a case to go back and and speak a little fun\nRight so here's the question All right they breach the contract or by not\nPaying you a bonus of a minimum of ten thousand years or ten thousand dollars a year which incidentally uh there was nothing in the contract that said no matter whether they make money or not or the ... the economy\nI Know you'll get your ten thousand right that's right All right so they haven't paid you for nine years in particular reason you waited nine years to not get paid\nOh I spoke to him about it and they basically said well you know our economy here\nIs ... and I understand that match and so that's the reason now I can understand that for four years when the economy tanked right I get that right but after\nFour years or you're still looking at five years of the economy doing much better\nAnd to the point where the economy has become a has gotten on fire I mean it has exploded for the last couple of three years and why have you didn't you go in there say hey guys I didn't because the economy was really crap during the recession but now that is doing great and everybody's making money\nHow about a check you didn't do that\nI did that bill and then what my ... but he bought my salary a little bit but he didn't pay any bonuses\nOkay so you accepted uh the salary bump and then go after the bonus yes\nAll right so now a let me give you a fun I'm a fun legal aspect and it's called a stop all\nWaiver and stop all that's E S T O P P. E. L. stop all which is a fun way of uh I guess the Italians say stop to stop all it is a legal doctrine that says even if you do have a case\nIf you will ... not to go forward and argue your breach you excepted that\nAnd that's the argument they're gonna make you have accepted the fact that they're not going to\nPay you a bonus now uh can you go back you're not going to go back nine years I guarantee you that uh can you go back uh maybe but they're going to keep on arguing I Would saying hey you know what yeah we had a deal but we weren't dealing with it and he's obviously he's OK with it\nSo I'm keeping talked to a lawyer how many the bonus shot ten thousand dollars by the way your belief ten thousand dollars is very interesting uh but let's say the only be liable if there's liability for ten grand and that's over Ninety Ninety thousand dollars you know we're talking to a lawyer\nYeah yeah so I talked to a lawyer and we'll see how far how far it goes in hello and welcome\n[noise] yes ma'am\n[laughter] your way and he was twelve years older than my cell and when we got married when they're gone and whatever\nWhatever I most of the ... it was fine truly here and put everything in her name and all that long story short weight when you want to turn a rate and the and the attorney paying Lake Erie though\nDid he tell you why because my husband no one from an organization and it wasn't that good old boy\nI don't know knowing that doesn't make any sense of what that\nMeant that I thought I was going to take my husband for everything and not let your children and buddy his dad [noise]\nOkay well make a long story short [noise] um my husband passed away no problem", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Handel on the Law", "city": "Providence", "day": "21"}
