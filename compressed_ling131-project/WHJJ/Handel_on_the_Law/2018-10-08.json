otherwise ... says\nJohnny drinks a lot on the street right that's a lot of help\nRight it's I'm Paul it's just like the original accusation\n... and the other thing done is they want him to say he

gonna have to vote against Kavanaugh's confirmation\nAnd are they the a percentage of people in North Dakota want Kavanaugh confirmed is even a greater than in West Virginia\nMeanwhile Mitch McConnell

Ford\nBroadcast news networks last night a continued to hammer away at the sexual assault allegations using the seventh FBI inquiry into Kavanaugh's passed this latest news fuck however\nThey devoted only a miniscule portion of the Kavanaugh coverage to the memo was released a by sex crimes prosecutor Rachel metro\nAnd of course again that was a it was a pretty thorough\nOr a deep bunting of\nOr many of her rock claims\nWe've actually got a new allegation and ... what's that there was a party at a frat after Kavanaugh had graduated that included sex acts with a stripper yes and there's no evidence they've Kavanaugh was there or that he was a participant but senator Coons has decided before the allegations to Grassley anyways\nOkay so Grassley basically just sent them back a letter that said you basically can they may\nYeah so this is this is like the one in uh in Rhode Island where he he and a judge or were charged with raping a woman on a boat in Newport Harbor and or at Sheldon Whitehouse went running with that too was to to Lindsey Graham\nValley with Chuck Grassley writes we reached a new level of absurdity with this allegation there's no evidence that judge Kavanaugh was anywhere near the party or had anything to do with it at all in fact the only person we can be sure attended the party with the accuser himself\n[laughter] if there's another one to hear I I Can't even I I Can't even find them all now but\nA ... now there's another story here this is by I think by NBC text messages suggest capital I wanted to refute accusers claim before it became public this is a Ramirez claim you know where she says there gaps in her uh her her\nMemory because she was drinking so heavily and she she had to spend six days talking to her lawyers in the ... and ... at before she could decide the cabinet may have exposed himself to her\nAnd she also was texting friends asking that I ever tell you about this and uh so so now now that now it somehow bad that Kavanaugh want it to refute the accusers claims before they became public\nSolve this I mean this is what the this is what they're up against this what the he's up against here and but I I don't think it's I
