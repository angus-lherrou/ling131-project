said\nOK okay he's alive he's willing to throw you out if he's willing to say you have to this weekend to pop off\nAnd get out of there than trust me he's going to lie about any verbal agreement any agreement you ever make it seemed writing he signs it\nOkay All right a verbal agreement you know the rules at this point verbal agreements mean zero and that goes back hundreds and hundreds of years to common law and common law incidentally the law started\nNot as human rights or contractual right at all it's a real estate property and the and it came out of that which is why in terms of common law that is ancient English law which a lot of our laws derived from\nA it says that in real property no verbal contracts everything has to be written this goes back five hundred six hundred eight hundred years\nA steamy hello Stevie\nOkay you know yeah if you're on a ... if you're honest uh what do you call it phone speaker phone get off\n[laughter] All right I'm going okay this is the bottom line I I'm going to just continue my insurance was Kaiser okay and what I wanted to find out let's say my own insurance or just me working out riding my bicycle staying healthy\nIs the federal government going to say when I Do my taxes are they going to impose a penalty on\nMe sure because under Obamacare you have to have insurance and if you don't uh there was a penalty you give up your health insurance ugly Kaiser I'm a member of Kaiser why would you do that Stevie\nOkay so so really what I'm ... well the reason I'm going to do it is because I have Kaiser so go to another so by BP oh oh yeah\nI mean I I don't understand why you know the first step is why would you give up health insurance because anybody who can afford it is out of his mind not habit and second of all yes this at this point it is no law that you must either having insurance plan or you pay a penalty simple\nOkay that's simple and I heard the penalty is based on your income\nI have no idea okay you have no idea\nYeah I'm assuming it's now it's two hundred and five hundred then it goes up to a you know two thousand I have no idea if you can have the penalty subsidize that would be hilarious that wouldn't be oh areas because they do subsidize your insurance if you don't have the money but they subsidize the penalty if you don't have the money that probably not\nOkay yeah so so I'm white now though it's an legislation\nYou know it's not in legislation there's nothing in legislation\nBut the Republicans are trying to appeal you\nKnow they're ... yeah but they have passed a law and there's not even been a law that's introduce right now\n[noise] ah so this could take this one new ... could take\nA I don't know is going to take years but a neighbor passed but get yourself insurance you know please\nHello Pam yes ma'am what can I Do for you on a tight with the heart had a partnership with the fact\nThat uh we got for nine years ago we had originally filed bankruptcy personal bankrupt before so I haven't been able to file on it but my heart or file bankrupt and stuff but they don't come back after\nA well what kind of ... first of all let's talk about the business was it a wealthy or corporation\nIf we can get that part hit\nA and yes they can't come after you are as a one of the partners in since you've already filed for bankruptcy you can't you cannot go bankrupt on it has it been ah I think what seven years since you file for bankruptcy\nIt happened quite\nAll right well theoretically they could go but once that seven years is over you can re file I mean you're never going to buy any credit again Pam that's a given but you can no re file and you could refinance at any time\nSo it doesn't matter if they're suing you doesn't matter if they have a judgment it doesn't matter any ... anywhere in the process all the legal process or you can stop it cold once you file for personal bankruptcy it's over for anything that you would be responsible for what kind of business by the way we talk about Pam\nOn it was like it was right the right ... bears wet during that practical ...\nAnd why did he go under not enough and then there weren't enough customers a or a\nRobbery I got ... right after nine years\nYou got ... what kind of a neighborhood where are you in that was so crazy\nTerrible Marino valley huh wow back\nWhy it got really bad after nine years and we get that the shut it down but I was there pressure that like my partner filed on there that that would have to take care of it\nNo because you have a partnership and what happens is I you know I don't even if a partnership can file bankruptcy 'cause everybody's into your individually responsible for it\nRight so effectively it's a it's the two of you know I don't even think it's a business it's a straight partnership where you're just personally liable why why wouldn't you do an El Al\n... or a corporation or low yeah I Do I Do yeah oh she said it you know I'm a dumb ass so I didn't have to say although I'm going to repeat it Dorsey high Dorsey\nYes yes [noise]\nAh yeah it's not a long time ago me and my girlfriend and her mother we bought a house and we all the time and there's been a wave ... well that would go with my daughter turned Eighteen 'cause we had broke government of which she turned out you know go go down and\nMake them sell the house when I went down and to the courthouse Monday and wouldn't even own a house so I was wondering\nIs there a any kind of way I could find out that I did sign on at how\nWell okay it's a I I don't quite understand that you signed on the house when you took a ownership of that house how did you get the house\n[noise] no we all went out together thriller well put money\nDown okay and then a Yahoo assuming than you all went on the loan\nOr no we didn't get along together we just put money though so use by ... by you are you outright just bought a house everybody putting an X number of dollars there was no mortgage on it right\nNow yeah didn't refinance out but um\nI Do remember signing a and I put it like maybe it was on dog didn't we find that it's only for like maybe seven hundred dollar\nYou put seven hundred dollars down on the house yeah how do you want a house with seven hundred dollars down no no no doubt that with his quarter to downpayment how much was the entire downpayment\nOh not that I don't
