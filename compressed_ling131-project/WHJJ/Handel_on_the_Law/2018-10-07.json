I don't know the answer when how important what\nI mean surely initially when I went to them I just wanted to know\nMy memory that come back I dealt with that\nI got my life back on track everything's going smoothly I married a wonderful wanna and I've got custody of my shoulder on everything and it's going great and I didn't want to rock the boat I just want her to get closer I wasn't even asking for money and when I initially went there and they started to push back\nNo yeah I Know I understand now and say you when you went through that they're not being cooperative they've gone from gee we care and we feel bad for you to ... which is a the history of ah the Catholic Church will\nActually a lot more evil and that they weren't just stone wall and they wanted to get an investigator and ...\nYeah that's what you do I mean my family I get it and my community and got\n... let me tell you I'm a big fan and I always get in trouble for this always and that is I Believe that the archbishop ships the bishops the cardinals even the pope's last several folks have covered all of this up\nAnd shut all go to jail we have a a a cardinal ... uh Mahoney who used to be the cardinal here in Los Angeles and he retired with accolades and he retired uh with the ... an eminent if you will or an eminent reputation he should be in jail\n... should be in jail for covering up what happens when I when I was also there oh here's your here's my advice if you're asking I Would get a lawyer that specializes in going after the church they know what all these lawyers incidentally are the ones that I've talked to were the ones I've heard of it I actually do care\nAnd if it's a question of you need therapy more than you need money or you need both and negotiate with the church that's the way to go\nOut and my question is do I get out because obviously to the climate\nWith all these people coming our yeah me too yeah yeah actual [laughter] and that's actually what would have prevented me from filing in the first place but I didn't want to be involved in the bandwagon\nYou're not going to be on the bandwagon and she was an individual\nAnd I do I need to get out\nThe lawyer was not a lawyer that's why you want a lawyer\nThat's why you want the lawyer who has experience and we'll sit down and give you all the options and we'll give you the options that makes sense\nTaking into account the value of the case\nOr your particular predicament in terms of your mental health era emotional psychological situation uh these guys know what they're doing you got to go there\nYou actually have to go there and it's easy all you do is throw up a ... or some uh search words Catholic Church lawyers um ride yeah law firms are suing the church\nAnd I I wouldn't put up a church or molestation ghost

way it works with professional games or or any kind of sports event on radio stations and television stations or for the most part less so is that the actual game is broadcast\nAnd then there's the pre game and post game shows\nThat they do so if you're on for example we have the Dodgers hear it on this station and a Dodger games are all day because it's post game pre game and everybody talks so I remember one sitting in the studio and I was doing some recording and I was listening for a a few minutes or to the game\nAnd I walk past and I looked at the screeners the screen which uh that's how phone calls a come in\nA cause command screener in this case Sam picks it up\nAsked some questions give you some rules that no one ever pays attention to get to the point\nI don't go on and on and on

I'm trying to figure out how\nTo get someone to live up to the other false advertising\n[laughter] she had good luck alright I'll tell you what happened\n[noise] um I had a car that I bought from a dealership in two years in the middle east they sent me a a written a letter and also emails wanting to buy my car back and they said they'd give me up to a hundred and ten percent of the appraised value my car no matter if I bought there or not\nAnd then when I went and good program on it and they have praised the car and then we out of the hundred ten percent of the car was an excellent condition\n... we'll give you the deal will give you a hundred percent but you've got about what our cars but in their printed advertising and my emails especially especially that belief that this away rates are paired up are you up to a hundred percent of the current market value for your vehicle [noise]\nIn fact we're so interested that we will buy your vehicle back even if you don't buy our\nShowcase so now the issue is the value ... you got him on that All right there's no question that this is what they said ah they're\nOut is up to a hundred and ten percent that's for one or one aspect and connected to that is what is the value of the car or that they're saying it's not that much or they say they're just not ... not buying the car back no matter what\nIt is in their ... by the ... say they did the appraisal on the car so I went ahead it appraised by car ... and then I came to them and they were the original company will show me the car two years early right\nIn are they not recognizing the ... the appraisal or they're just saying we don't care\nWhat the racial came higher than ... oh my God okay so so so they ... they print it out to me and brought it up to me and then and then I said well what about a hundred percent and like I I don't know nothing about that too broad a manager out I gave him the document\nEmail and he goes OK well yeah we'll give you a hundred percent because your car I mean you're a cart was showing initially it was ten thousand miles under ... should have been for a two year early on at least that time and he goes it will give you the deal\nBut you need to I Want our cars and I and I go out to highlight it and I think I'll go but it says you'll buy micro no matter what by yours or not and I ... and they they just stumbled on themselves\nWell I didn't get mad or anything yeah okay let me let me ask\nThis uh and that is a why wouldn't you buy one of their cars or just in I understand there are a bunch of jerks but if they're willing to give you a hundred and ten per ... percent legitimately and they give you a reasonable deal on one of their cars why wouldn't you jump on it or even though there are a bunch of lying scum\nOkay I bought two new cars within a week of each other when I bought the my Chrysler [laughter] I bought one from across the street from a to a dealership from them out of that in my truck I drive thirty five thousand dollars a year in my car sits on the garage it's I'm sitting there going you know I'm spending over five hundred\nOr you then are you are so are you not going to buy a car then you're just not interested in buying a car period I was just trying to get out of the week\nHuh okay uh and they offered a they're going to buy your car back ah and and they're releasing it too right\nYeah yeah ... yeah yeah I'm just trying to think they are in breach just one of the damages a and here's here's\nWhere I figured out the debt because it's been a year and I've gone through\nBut right now I got it okay well I haven't uh you can sell the car I to anybody else at about whatever the value is and the difference is they're responsible for the ten percent\nOkay well the problem was is that with their own ... percent I Would only had to chop up three hundred bucks on a been out of the league at that point I couldn't sell it for what that hundred ten percent would have been\nWithout you know picking up here [laughter] so I've kept the car and I just turn it in on a leash so uh what I'm really on the hook for just is eleven payments and car insurance and vehicle registration which comes to six hundred dollars\nAnd they would have been to like ... and they weren't going to let you out of that and you're but you're not going to replace the car correct right oh okay ah but you [noise] wow yeah I'm just trying to think of a of a clever way of doing this without hiring a lawyer that's the problem I mean what's the damages are and how you figure out I doubt\n... or the difference is we can try figuring out the damages in small claims court but the problem is going to be that you're on the hook for ah the lease you have to say I wasn't going to buy another car\nAnd the judge is going to say really uh therefore but you could have and you didn't have to you turned it in and you took the deal\nAre saying they'll pay you a hundred and ten percent\nI so it's a little bit complicated but whatever your damages are or you can try to take it just small claims court I but that's the only way to go I can think of and just try to figure out your damages and frankly as I was going through the entire scenario and ah the formula I didn't understand where that is so ah that works out doesn't\nTeach you can't ... when it comes to math beyond like fifty plus fifty\nOr\nA hundred divided by two I have a hard time see how that works\nTammy Hi\nTammy yes good morning go yes ma'am\nMy question is I Am one of the store owners or on a property and I had them paying the property taxes for several years I have a recourse can I put marine\nThat property you already on the property you're one of four owners nope when you when you can do is sue the other ones for their pro radish share okay that's it how much and so in terms of taxes when you say several years all over the course of those years ah how much if you pay in taxes\nUh start with a semi the forms to refuted I Want a reconsideration theirs is Fifteen Years ago and they do have the process you have to go through all of that first okay because something somebody is making a mistake that doesn't work for\nThe new the new and what we bought it and so it just starts all over again\nIt's not true well that's what they called me I don't\nDo it I Know collection agency or the credit reporting agency ... collection is\nOkay have you ... have you looked at your credit reporting out your credit report yes absolutely\nEntitled on and it's still on the credit report\nCorrect okay you can't forget about the collection agencies ah they just hang up on them that they have nothing to do with it or threaten them or I keep on telling people just say hey I'm recording this call is a Fifteen year old dad I'm recording this you have no lawsuit against meats and you argue consenting\nTo [noise] to keep on being recorded and they'll hang up on you so ah the next problem and this is the big problem is that from Fifteen Years ago a debt was unpaid is still on the credit reports vets that's an issue\nBecause that's huge damages so well could actually destroys your life effectively ... especially in this day and age All right so you go through the appeals process you say I Want to refute it sent me the paperwork and your refuting you say Fifteen Years old\nAnd you ask them it don't you have a policy of uh after seven years of dropping from the credit report and what are they going to say nope that policy has gone it's crazy\nI agree it's crazy yeah I don't I don't understand it I mean I just don't understand that happening I'm had credit and I've had clients who had a the issue with these statutes ... with these statutes that no longer fly for your statue in California for example when on paper to Crump a credit card or any written a contract\nAnd a credit card agency or collection agencies and some of them are real ... agencies\nHave called and people know there is a four year statute and they'll say hey this was five years ago there was a forty year statute they just changed the law\nWhen they changed the law last month is our ten year statute and\nWhat do you do well my clients that okay just send me just give me the code just tell me ... tell me the PIN number let me look it up right now if I owed them money will start talking oh oh oh you know that sort of thing\nKind of horrible world out there with credit ... credit reporting I mean there's a whole is I think it's gonna be a huge huge a new area of the law dealing with it already is a pretty\nGood size area and are those are people that deal with credit but it's ah it it has to explode just has to explode All right Paul Paul Europe welcome to handle on the law\n[laughter]
