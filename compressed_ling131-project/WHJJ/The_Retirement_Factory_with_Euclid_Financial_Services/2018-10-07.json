I'm not Jennifer Courtney hide her was actually just in the studios talking while we're talking about this is just fits in so perfect there so\nUm you're also going to want to make sure to to just animal proof that house okay because you know bugs and creditors and all that they're going to want to go into the warm house mhm feel bad I Wish I could invite 'em all and I\nI Love animals and I'm a weirdo I I don't kill bugs I yeah I did the other day I feel really bad about is a crazy spider killed it I hate doing that but they usually let them outside so make sure you make sure to uh this one was just so creepy but\nMake sure to let them all outside and not not have them coming inside okay so\nYou can do different things to um to really seal off the house sometimes there's there's areas where where people feed wires through a home make sure that's all sealed tight yeah [noise] um as well with former or whatever it is okay\nAnother topic I'd like to talk about before we leave you this week wouldn't be high resale areas like projects that you can tackle usually in a weekend\nYeah OK enters the perfect time following winter ...\nFantastic now whether you're selling or not if you're just curious are concerned about having a home that people like to go to or a home that you can sell for top notch dollars for a top dollar um couple of things you can easily do now by the way don't\nHack this stuff I got to tell you if you're like all painted the house and I walk in there's paint marks if he painted the kitchen bank and there's paint marks all over the the the the ceiling you know from missing color within the lines in damage pick colors that are relevant and people like\nWhen you are painting okay if you plan on staying in the house for a while you paint a rainbow pain and whatever you want it doesn't matter right but if you are if you are going to sell go to your local Sherman Williams are well local paint store\nAnd ask them what colors are hot right now all colors are in maybe bring a picture of your kitchen shows or your bathroom or your bedroom or whatever shown what you got going on they're going to help guide you in the right place\nAnd you know on a state kind of neutral ...\nPeople are always asking me what can I Do what's easiest project I could do to get the most bang for your buck it's paint\nYeah it's paying off because it makes everything fresh fresh and clean and and and looks great you know paint the base boards paint gift to give the rumor refreshed you know it smells better and they're too sometimes you know sometimes if you you've you've been smoking in a house or if there's pets in the house\nA nice thorough clean and paint can really go me painting and go really long way\nA couple of the things you can do as well as I install crown molding\nOkay but again if you're doing this do it the right way\nOr have a contractor to it really if you're I I I Can't swim a hammer without breaking something riling down yeah yeah or file yeah right\nBut not everyone's is clumsy as me and some people are actually good at stuff like that and thank you we need more people that are good in handy\nBut yeah put some kind of molding up and only hit those mean living areas like the kitchen and bathroom the hallway and don't started in not finish it because if you started in a finish it\nIt looks really it it looks worse than not doing it in the first place but the whole reason to do is because it just adds a really nice element\nIn it and brings people's eyes right up right up the ceiling it just looks good it looks really good and I and ... ... yeah\nIf you have very low ceilings don't do it by the way you\nWant to emphasize the fact that you've at five foot ceiling yeah yeah\nYeah at least you don't want to duck on their around and crown molding you know a couple of other things to you want to boost the curb appeal now I've got to tell you this is not really a weekend job but the number one complaint we have from buyers and the number one reason why homes\nDon't sell is because of poor curb appeal and there's one factor with a couple of factors but the main thing is that a roof if you've got an old roof\nSomething that is like if it if you know if it looks like those shingles are falling off or if the roof is like has had a if it's leaking\nI'm going to tell you probably if you can't afford to change it out get a new roof go with the thirty year roof don't go with the twenty or thirty roof it's not that much of a difference\nGet a few different quotes get a few different prices um you know my clients I refer them out to refers we use butter roof is the only area aside from the garage door in the main entry door that you get a hundred percent return on investment with interesting fact you know that\nKnow me up so the roof and and and then from somebody who does this every day the roof is literally one of the biggest concerns of buyers and cars homes with a new roof will sell higher and faster and price that higher in price and faster less stays on market\nCurb appeal again is important too so it's a nice weekend thing that you can do is you can take a step back\nRight from the road and then walk up to the house and then you know and then really look at the light fixtures look at all the corners take away all the comp webs clean up the house nice at power wash the house if you can now and and just try to give it that that you know it from someone else's eyes\nYou can only knew him as Russia's action ones right so in that show that the house that are on the market start with the exterior and tight yeah\nAbsolutely and uh and again with whether you're selling or not you you can do these things and they were really make the home appear nice especially for the holidays if you're having people over\nYou know it goes a long long way so I Hope this information was very helpful to you simple yet helpful but ah every week we've got some really great content here and it's always

L. I. D. emphasis on financial S. as in services dot com there are white pages there are videos on this and it it ... through ... original that's a and B it's they don't dive into supplemental shit don't dive beyond I\nUnderstand a and B once you understand the first part of the puzzle\nThe rest of the folks together very very simply because you've already been trained on it from your employers it's absolutely amazing when you're talking about moving in to be when you move into beat\nIf I'm going to have my employer's plan for life and there's a good chance I'm going to you don't have to have be because your employer will pick it up you'll have to pay that premium from your employer but not to the U.S government now if you don't have faith in your employer or you're never intend to take your be with you recommendation Ninety nine percent time is to buy be\nBy at sixty five so that you don't have to pay the penalties or premium increases once again just marketing term they call it a penalty to get you to buy it so if you don't need it don't buy it but if you needed by it because later in life is going to be more expensive\nYeah that's exactly in in any expenses one of the is that big component because it's an idea of how do I pick my coverage and make sure I'm fully covered and the other ideas how do I actually pay for it and this is a conversation I was having with Mike over the weekend\nMichael's referred to us from Eighteen tea and he's been with the company for the last Thirty years and he's he's ready to retire but his biggest concern is is he going to be able to cover his medical for himself and his wife dead\nAs we started talking I can seemed tense up as we got to the ... medical so I asked them what are you looking to accomplish by talking with me today\nHe looked down at the table and said I'm worried my wife's medical needs are going to get worse and I won't have enough to cover any increase in the medical expenses\nShe has some conditions in our life threatening but they can cause some issues down the road when Mike is going through was all too common with baby boomers the fear of unknown expenses that can cause you to focus on only the issue and not be able to see the answer even if it's right in front of you might do the right thing by asking for help\nI turned to Mike and they said let's talk about what you have\nAvailable for your retirement and what you actually want to accomplish in that time and over the next few conversations we were able to talk about what my plan for himself as well as what accounts were available to fund his goals overall he'd done a great job saving for retirement so between us four one K. has brokerage accounts he had enough to cover his day to day expenses and if you add\nIn his pension that was available as well as the Social Security he was going to be in good shape what was missing was how to distribute is money so we never felt that he didn't have enough so we went through his financial stress test and it showed him that by using his pension and Social Security to cover his basing assessed\nHe's he could then uses brokerage accounts for predictable expenses such as bucket list goals and then said is four one K. for flexible use this would allow is money to continue to grow to cover inflation\nIn those unexpected medical expenses my couldn't have been more relief knowing he had\nA plan and a guide to help them make the right choices was exactly what he needed here you could financial services we believe you need to know how much you can and will be able to spend every\nSingle weekend retirement but you need to know without a shadow of a doubt that you have enough money to last no matter how long you live these are questions you must get the answers to

less bills so you're going to turn the radio up and make sure you know what's going on the folks who are you going to ready to take your calls to give it to shut up for a one\nSeventy seven to seven to seven once again that for a one Seventy seven twenty seven twenty seven let's get talking about Medicare jostled\nDive into this outside of retirement income and when I'm going to retire this is probably the next piece in a plan that keeps people up at night\nBecause let's be honest talking about Medicare and talking about medical right now it's pretty scary we have changes going on the wave the Medicare system and health care system are being used is changing but it's not a bad thing is for the positive it just takes some time to get used to what are the terms of how does it work\nOne of ... the this show I Believe is geared towards people that have not turned sixty five yet\nRealistically because the anxiety that comes into our building of\nHow do I know that my medical is going to be covered how do I talk to my age are department how do I get my a decision of this or I Want to retire at sixty two how do I ... bridge the gap from sixty to to sixty five and if I go on to the exchange and buy it if I go buy it from the AC a\nAm I going to die I mean it's these are real questions and and I know I I it might sound like a mocking I'm not these are real real problems and I think if we can just kind of address some of them we can save some retirements just by understanding your medical insurance is a budget will item it's out there it's not scary it's in your income plant\nYeah and it's exactly the the way you explain it isn't budgetary item you know roughly how healthy or you know once you're medications are and you know what you should or shouldn't be buying\nYeah if you are just tuning in we're talking about Medicare that's a B C and D we're making sure everybody is on the same page with him give us a ... out here at four O. one Seventy seven to seven to seven that his four oh one Seventy seven twenty seven twenty seven to figure out how to get through retirement healthy wealthy ad wise so\nLet's get back to being healthy because well the unwise well it doesn't do much good if you don't have your health\nBut that's all they say you have so there's only a couple of things that you can bank on his taxes and death those are two bad time to get it wrong at prime number\nAre going to say wrong show we'll talk about taxes will come back to that it will come back I show up when it comes back to medical you brought up the health exchange right or the AC a or a health source or whatever state you live in or whatever they call it it's just a tour of you to go and buy health insurance if you're not part of a group and you're not eligible for\nMedicare right away so it doesn't have to be scary\nThe problem with the health exchanges is if this new area for us to buy health insurance but some of the old wives' tales of the old miss are still floating out there so the conflicting with each other\nYeah it's it brings up a assuming society because I have to I've always been with my employer my employer's plan is good it's United it's at nights it's well Harvard oil graduates whatever it is it's Blue Cross Blue Shield so now I actually have to understand what it gives me it would benefit there is so I have to kind of face that that maybe it doesn't cover everything I thought it did\nA good thing I never got sick but when I get tired how do I keep myself from being sick and I think that's the bucket list I think that's actually understanding your goals in life I think that's actually understanding what I'm trying to achieve and then set well I have family ailments that I have to cover later in life\nYeah you figure out ways my income coming from how am I going to pay for things and then you do in him in tore of yourself not just your assets how healthy am I what am I trying to do with my medication all that fun stuff now myself and Josh Wells it is our pleasure to be a part of the teen here you could financial services\nWe are both certify Social Security advisors with NFL say as well as chase and wells and myself I'm an IT are with you 'cause wealth management as well as an R. I. C. P. so we can help you maximize your Social Security and set up a retirement income tax strategy it's all under one roof here you could financial services\nAnd to help you get the information you need to make decisions that are both healthy wealthy and why is for you we're giving away five financial stress tests so be one of the next five callers that four zero one seven to seven\nTo seven to seven to get your free financial stress test today again that's four zero one seven to seven to seven to seven\nMen there was only five of these things left you got to get them if you're going to try to retire if you're getting ready to retire and you don't have a stress test you don't have a guideline you don't have a starting point that big acts on the mall board right that map that says I Am here you don't have that you need that before you retire you need that before you start choosing medical insurance\nYou really need to have a baseline understanding of what you're trying to achieve and we're trying to go so you really you really just got a you've got a call and get one yeah now when we're talking about health insurance original\nSo original starts out with a and B it is very rigidly was Medicare used only be two things a and B we did at sea and we added ...\nIf you have all of those they call it advantage so you have an advantage you if you have a B C and D all in one so if you are just turning sixty five or you're just going to turn sixty five and you're still employed and you take a cause you have to take a ... if you take a your employer plan becomes advantage plan\nYeah and and what that basically means is your employer plan is now complete because once you turn sixty five\nWell they realize that you're sixty five and you're eligible for Medicare so they change things a little bit they basically turn your employer plan to a Blue Cross sixty five or United sixty five and it doesn't become a complete until you add your party back into it\nThat's right when you're getting ready to retire and a lot of people do they say well window right trigger it I'm sixty four window I actually trigger my part a in part B part a is triggered at sixty five you can tell them three months in advance or you can tell him three months after but they're going to trigger it on your birthday\nYes yeah that's what he's on but I but let's let's pull back and focus for a second so before the break not sure I can I Know I Know Bob before the break we were talking about what to do with your original Medicare's for your party and your heartbeat so I Want to pick up what happens after\nYou've turned sixty five you've blown up the cake you've gotten your red white and blue card in the mail and you've officially retired and gone into the sunset now we have to pick out\nThe next tier of Medicare right 'cause we've already talked about a and B now we got to talk about just supplemental you see in the coverage and that's your regular health care companies like Blue Cross Blue Shield your United\nYeah when you're talking about supplemental let's actually to find that so if you are already retired there are a lot of terms for this there's met a gap\nThere supplemental there's parts see there's all of this it's all the same thing if that is super confusing to you and I'm Talking super confusing to give me a call for one Seventy seven to seven to seven once again that's for one Seventy seven to seven twenty seven twenty seven\nWe will walk you through exactly what that means those are just marketing terms for the combined or supplemental or additional\nFrom a and B it's see it's just the additional coverage it is Blue Cross like man he was saying it is United it is the ... the ... the you name a company it's out there they're they're trying to sell them all so\nWhen it comes down to what plan is right for you there's nine plans out there they're all the same the names are different to protect the the innocent but they're literally the same so when you go buy them find the one that works for you\nBy the services you need not by the alphabetical letter that it that are portrayed you can have a bigger letter doesn't mean it's better for you know just find the services you need the one thing I think I Want to talk about the supplemental that comes in the office a lot\nIs what if I picked the wrong supplemental I Want to address that for a little bit Manny\nYeah and well actually this is a conversation that I was actually having at one of our dedication meetings I I was talking with Wayne and Kathy last week\nAnd as we were sitting down to go through our annual dedication meeting this one was different they were both ready to retire this year Kathy was finally had enough of the hospitals ready to lead and so our goals to walk through all the time lines of when they switched from being employed\nTo fully retired and so as we were talking they can from their retirement date but they didn't seem to be as excited about it I Would have expected\nIt so I turned to them and they said well is everything okay is this something else we need to cover and they looked at each other for a moment ... spoke first she said I'm worried that our medical coverage won't cover is completely and we won't have the money to pay for it\nNow this is a valid fear what caffeine when we're feeling is what all baby boomers go through when they realize they're actually retiring\nOutside of income medical expenses or the number one fear heading into retirement so the easiest way to overcome it is to walk to your what do you need for coverage and then lining up to what your income is going to be and so I looked at him and I said I understand what you're going through\nLet's walk through what your coverage will actually be so once

I Need a cup of coffee like All right now because you touched on a really important part that Social Security is one income to that you have a retirement intentions as another your ... is also an income to everything that you're saving for retirement at some point is going to be used for income\nThe key is where do they all say as you're moving forward and that's where\nAre you roll over your four one K. why the rover your four one K. where does the ... that's where all those components fit at now I'm Manny resent nice and it's my pleasure to be a part of the team from you could financial services we're all certified Social Security advisors with an associate as well as myself who's an A R with you could wealth management\nAnd an R. I. C. P. so we can help you maximize your Social Security and separate time an income tax strategy it's all under one roof you could financial services so today to help you figure out how to roll over here for ... we'd given away ten free\nRein in income reports to help you figure out how to get to and through your entire retirement so be one of the next ten callers right now at four zero one\nSeventy seven to seven to seven to get your free rein income report again that's for one Seventy seven twenty seven twenty seven\nMany of those written income reports line up to four one K. amazingly because you can put in your actual four\nOne K. so if you bring in a four one K. statement from your employer it can go right into the income statement is absolutely amazing how to figure out what a foreign when cable actually pay out it'll lay it all out it'll tell you how to treat your Social Security it'll trigger tensions that will trigger will just any financial document you have it's actually really need to see this in one place\nAnd what it does too is is if there is a shortfall for your income it tells you how to continue saving in your ... okay and what you have to do to actually get to that\nThat missing component fell by the way there's no stress\nThat well let's dive into savings so if we're going to talk about four one K. first thing we have to do is\nTalk about employer so employers start by putting a four one K. into the business in which you are working\nAnd you have thirty one flavors you have Thirteen flavors you have a lot of investments inside of the ... I don't think those matter\nAs much as your contribution and if your employer matches\nThere could be a profit sharing there could be a major match at the end they're gonna be a match during the week there's all kinds of process sees that happening here I think we need to kind of\nWalk through a little bit of that to kind of lower this well I picked the wrong investment I I'm In ... I'm In the market I mean this kind of stuff I don't think that's as important and I just think we need to kind of get some of that on the page\nThat you're taking up some space in my head here you're you're written some space out in there so because when it comes down to it\nOh yeah no no no no when it comes to the fact that I felt really really at a\nShirt that so uh when uh when it comes to your ... like hey it's one of the tools that's easier to use to save for retirement because\nA lot of the things are done for you is it can be an automatic savings that contribution comes out of time to pay comes to you so and it's in his don't automatically so it's systematic\nYou don't it's kind of set in forget so you decide how much you can afford to take out of your paycheck to contribute to your future retirement and it does that automatically so I think it's it's the one good stuff\nYeah it's when you're talking about saving and well getting your direction around about I'm going to my employer says they give me three percent\nThat three percent of your total gross packed and then when they talk about well what you can you contribute will you contribute over three percent of Americans really need to start targeting ten percent of their total gross income\nInto a long term savings process for one case are one piece of that so if your employers giving you a three and you do another three\nThat could be counted as six total percent so then you need to make a ... percent somewhere else it can be that easy because when you're talking about retirement savings it doesn't have to be a mountain or a molehill it can actually be a pretty good lay out of where it's going to be if you're trying to figure out these calculations\nGo to the Web site go to Euclid F. S. dot com that you see L. I. D. S. as in financial S's in services and look it up there's calculators out there there's white pages on this\nThere's actually a video of Josh was waving at ya it's amazing click on it and watch it you'll get a ton of information this show is all about the baby boomer for one case say\nYeah I like the fact that you you mentioned that there's a number or target you should be doing for the ... is a baseline that's the the idea that really should be your minimum yeah that's that's the minimum baseline of if I set aside this ten percent and I just let it go it will compound over time regardless of which invest when I pick inside the former okay\nNow you want to be efficient about it\nSo if you're finding is that your former K isn't working the way you want it to you definitely want to make sure that it's set up correctly so that it it'll work best for you going forward in the future\nYeah one of the things that are kind of coming up is when people are coming into the office there they're going to the radio show and they're saying things like\nI'm trying to figure out how to get more savings in and this is no different than what happened last week when I'm Jim came in gym came in and he was talking about how he was having problems getting over this six percent thing and it's really easy to kind of ... to get in the weeds and say well I'm not saving\nHe's actually putting away four percent of his total gross income into a savings account just at the local back\nHe's literally just putting it into the bank is automatically deposited he's just not spending it he doesn't look at that as a as a retirement savings so I asked him what are you going to use this money for and he didn't have a broken up he had all this money in one place he knew he had a four one K.\nHe knew that he had a bank account but in his mind he didn't break it up into three so you're you're good we'll walk you through the GPS system and when you do\nThat what you will find is that you want to put your money in three different piles daily usage emergency fund usage which could be a brokerage account\nTo Josh back up for a second 'cause remember if he rolls from his old four one K. two new foreign K there's no financial benefits\nThat rover money doesn't get any of the contribution on mash that you would get from your poor so there's no bump up for doing it and when it comes to being restricted you're limited by what the plant guidelines are which means you can reach out to the TPA or your administrator for them to tell you what's going on so it's much easier just to go to an IRA ... understand how those work and there's no restrictions\nYeah if you if you just got lost in that conversation or you're actually thinking about rolling over four one K. and you just want a little bit of guidance or well heck just somebody to sit and have a cup of coffee with you give us a call at four O. one seven to seven to Seventy seven that again is for one seven to seven twenty seven twenty seven\nSpeaking of coffee I could probably use another cup right now what are to be ... because well the reason why you want to move it to the IRA is because you understand the guidelines on how it works but it also gives you more freedom to be able to plan for your armies coming up\nWell it's a train right so you you you invest into the employer plan\nWe call it a four one K. there's other those are the styles of this but today we're focused on four one K. so you save in the four one K.\nOnce you've left that employer or once that savings needs to do something else distribution\nYou have to roll it over just fundamentally it's designed to move from savings to roll over into an IRA I think that's always talked about is that we take it up from a savings account of giants savings account with multiple investment choices mutual funds yep and then moved it into an IRA\nAnd that is just a vessel that's just a ... that's just a glass that's just a fake it doesn't do anything it's a nurse it doesn't do any do you put water in it or coffee at AT T in it or ... I guess on Thursday but it it's like\nYou you have to it's only a vessel and or a vase is that I've had the ... vice oh that's what they owe bass bass I like vases Rick fairly\nWell let's put it another way you're you're Irish just a rapper for your money and you can put whatever you want inside of that rapper so if you like chocolate if you like peanuts maybe like ... as long as you put the inside your rubber it's safe and it's protected\nYeah I was going bore of how to distribute it I was talking about eating yeah I\nThink we're hungry and certainly heard the radio\nToday so what we need to do is figure out so we have a four O. one K. we rolled it over to an IRA the IRA should distribution vehicle that's how you take money out when it's with the employer the employer gives you loan options\nAnd you can take it out through alone if you don't have an employer or you've left that employer they're no longer going to give you a loan option you physically have to withdraw money and so instead of having to withdraw hundred percent of it you should be able to take it in bits and the only way to do that is through an IRA individual retirement account\nYeah the the IRA itself it's designed\nTo be able to take it out with pieces in dribs and drabs so this way you could control now I'm ... and it's my pleasure to be part of the teen hear from you could financial services we're all certified Social Security advisors with an essay as\nWell as myself and Jason ... a ours with you could wealth management so we can help you maximize your Social Security and separate time
