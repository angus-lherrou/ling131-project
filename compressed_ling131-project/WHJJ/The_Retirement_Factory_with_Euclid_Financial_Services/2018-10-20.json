{"month": "10", "state": "RI", "station": "WHJJ", "content": "Um but food isn't meant to make you lazy and tired food is actually meant to give you energy\nSo if you walk in the house and and let's say around three o'clock in the afternoon you eat something\nNutritious like an apple with a protein like apple was peanut butter apple with nut butter or you have some great send some string cheese or you have a Greek yogurt say between three and four now when you walk in the door at\nNight after year long day you're starving here about a five on that scale for hunger you're anywhere near eight nine or ten or being robbing us [noise]\nThen you look at your your\nSpouse if you have a spouse and our partner and you say I'm let's make something nice you know Sunday we um I went and I got this and this and this at the food store so you planned now you're going to prepare and you're going to prepare something healthy and then when you do eat on that\nFullness scale you're actually going to only eat the right amount of calories\nAnd you're going to do that based on your intuition you're going to use your intuitive eating skills that you learned from from me hopefully and on that scale from zero to ten\nYou're only going to be a five on the on the scale and if you ate too much and you're an eight on that full scale well one thing is going to happen and you're going to feel tired\nUm you're gonna feel lazy and that's not what food is meant to do but if you eat just the right amount of food and I'm not talking about counting calories are Wayne or any of that boring stop\nI'm just saying using your own brain and your own stomach and letting that coordinate so that you know that you're just satisfied from what you ate so I don't believe there's bad food there is no good food or bad food I mean food is food [laughter] um so if you want to have pizza once in awhile okay that's fine\nBut what I might do is have one piece of pizza instead of four or maybe even two pieces of pizza instead of four or five and then have a salad with it\nAnd that I'm a five when I'm done with that I feel not to fall [noise] um I feel actually feel great and that might happen says I have more energy so now the food is actually given the energy and I feel like doing the dishes I feel like back\nIn may and I feel like taking my dog for a walk I feel like going to the gym um what have you so remember on a scale is there to ten\nZero being not full at all you should always be a five when you're done eating\nIf you're a a nine or ten that can be anywhere from three hundred five hundred extra calories every night at dinner and that is really going to catch up to you\nOn and then remember too that in the middle of you know I Know some trainers and stuff they eat six to eight times a day I'll tell you right now I don't ask any of my clients all of which have potential to um eat six to eight times a day you know why\nBecause I Can't do it [laughter] I'm not going to ask my clients to do something I Can't do so I really and adamant about you know if you're not\nA big breakfast person small breakfast maybe just a yogurt [noise] um and then lunch you know standard lunch maybe a salad with chicken or shrimp or if you're a began maybe a veggie burger or whatever and then a snack between lunch and dinner and then you're done there\nAnd that dinner should always be half the plate filled with vegetables or a salad and then um for a man it would be about six to eight ounces of meat which is about forty two grams of protein [noise]\nUm and then um it's forty to fifty sex actually if you want to be specific and then um you would have your complex carbohydrate which would be your bread your past the rice or your cereal\nAnd it is just people that are thinking oh my God I thought I couldn't eat bread I thought I couldn't eat pasta I thought I couldn't eat anything white that is old school thinking guys that is someone who wrote a book a long time ago and they called it sugar buzz stars and they told everyone not to eat\nAnything white [noise] and I say that if only it was that easy okay Asians and general consumer I sat on every single meal unless they're very assimilated here in the United states um but a lot of agents still do even in the United states eat rice at every single meal and they tend to be the thinnest\nUm group of\nA society so you know the whole white very is just gone down the drain and I said don't listen to that\nUm rice potatoes I'm Brad\nAre complex carbohydrates that we needed a diet along with it's a macro nutrient that we need along with protein right fish chicken and tofu\nBeans um however you get your protein and yogurt and then um there's that and we want to limit the fat obviously right and we want to use good fat we don't want to use trans fats which are that fake classically\nMargarine that is still available and the food stores believe it or not which is totally linked to cancer [noise]\nUm it's worse for you than butter at as actually linked to cardiovascular\nDisease at a higher rate than any of the butter or the olive oil or anything like that so I Hope none of you are eating anything fake like nothing fake like um margarine um which actually if you guys don't know what happens with\nAn oil like a corn oil it's put into a process called hydrogen nation and it changes the form\nOf the molecule from assessed to a trans and those are what are called trans fats\nTrans fats are linked to cancer cardiovascular disease et cetera so none of you guys\nAre consuming any trans fats whether it's margarine or in your cookies or whatever 'cause there's plenty of other options out there these days\nBecause people are starting to wake up you know the big food companies and the big pharmaceutical company and the big associations are kind of insulting our intelligence work any smarter than than we're realizing that you know what we don't want to save five cents to kill ourselves in the future\nUm we don't want to commit a slow suicide by eating all this crap\nThat's out there we want to live long healthy lives you know it's only God that is going to determine you know there are people you know there are people that smoke two packs\nOf cigarettes a day and live and you know probably drink a couple of shots a day and live till they're a hundred and four God Bless them and then there's people who exercise on a regular basis eat really while their whole lives\nAnd they have a heart attack at forty five and expire [noise]\nUm so you know we don't have total control but we do have some control and one of the things we can control is what our hand\nAnd fork or just our hand puts into our mouse right so we are in control of what we put into our bodies nobody else just you you want to see who's in control or who to blame for what weight you're at\nOr what have you go look in the mirror because you have to take control nobody else can want it for you you have to want it just quitting smoking or quitting drinking or what have you you have to decide to make these little changes\nThat will make a difference in the long run and you know I think sometimes even on TV you know where they're going to say something like yeah lose ten pounds and you know and I'm a month and you know if that's what you want I'm not the coach for you because I Know that the dieting industry is a

happy to help you along the way I have a business coach I've spent a thousand dollars last year on a business coach you know why because I Know that I needed a little accountability a little guidance\nUm I went to school to be a registered dietitian to be a nutritionist I took biochemistry I took micro biology it's basically pre med is what it is the program that I took\nAnd so I'm I'm

thousand twenty fourth Mexican\nOne thousand twenty fourth Peruvian one one thousand twenty fourth Colombian and does she trace maybe to the drug cartels in Columbia\n\nWhy is there a dearth of Indian DNA why is there not much Indian DNA out there\nOr was the problem that bustamante couldn't find any matches for Warren using only envy and DNA so he felt he doing expanded\nTo include South America\nWhen other reason there isn't much in the DNA is because they are very very wary of this the Indians\nThemselves the Cherokee tribe the leaders will tell you they don't use DNA to determine the lineage they use junior logical trace\n\nYou know who has one of the best junior logical trace apparatus was in this country in the Mormon church out in Salt Lake City has one of the most\nAdvanced respected documented genial logical pray organizations that you'll find I have I've seen their work and it is [laughter] it's amazing and that story I get as\nMany Native Americans have been very leery of granting DNA because they're leery of how it's going\nTo be used they already feel like they're discriminated bunch of people but on the same token there are some benefits that have been extended to them as a result of this and they just don't want to upset the apple cart so they don't even realize or utilize DNA\nIf any of this but ... the media of course has a role here because everything they reported about this turns out to be an abject lie except British inclusion by the Boston Globe that there wasn't any Native American DNA\n\nBy the way this is not what Trump that her anyway Trump about her but she wouldn't have to take a test from little kit which the wandering around you can you can do a very rudimentary\nWhich means there's all kinds of stuff fraud potential
