I I think that's where I Want to stop people and say don't go there yet [laughter] go into what am I going to do when we're talking with my new purpose\nNow I have assets in in it could be for a thousand that could be two million it could be whatever your number is\nDisregard the number that's easier said than done right yeah disregard the number and now what am I going to do with my life what's my life's purpose and I know what's really big just say that because when you thought well I was going to be the I don't know the accountant for X Y Z company you didn't\nThat was my life purpose when you were going to become the accountant but that's what you did for fifty years\nYeah it's the it's the idea of what do I want to be when I grow up\nWell what do I want to do when I'm retired it's the same question yeah and so you just can we say now what are you going to do when you grow up and then when everybody ... retires start young congratulations you're finally grown up that's exactly it so now that you you understand okay I can pick and choose what I Want to be and how I Want to be it you can dive right into it\nBut the one thing that you have to remember is the beginning point of any retirement plan is this you've got to create a stable foundation to maximize your retirement income especially in a predictable fashion so\nThe starting point is understand how to optimize your Social Security benefits because at face value you can be tens of thousands of dollars on the table by employing a few little known strategies it's actually possible to generate as much as a hundred thousand dollars or more an additional lifetime income so let myself in the teen years you could financial services\nGave you a complementary customize ... income report so this way you can see how much maximizing your retirement income can actually impact your overall retirement now to get your customized plan the one of the first five callers right now it for one\nSeven to seven to seven to seven that's for one seven to seven twenty seven twenty seven don't\nLet your retirement become mediocre now Manny one of the things that are a great about this a written income report is that it really does straighten out your retirement it's it's awesome I actually we had a car call and Kathy know Jesus had to be six months ago maybe five I in Kathy called up and said\nHey I Want a written income report it that's fine with so come on and Kathy came in and I got lucky enough I got to sit with her and when she was going through the discovery meeting we were talking about how the process works we are going through the GPS system and going through all five stages and she kept on saying well well I just want to know how much money I can spend or how much money I have\nI Need this amount of money I Need to know how I'm going to replace and she was trying to replace eighty thousand dollars which eighty thousand dollars is what is aggressive but it it's very very easy to do especially if you have the asset level to balance it and so she was really\nReally concerned about her layered income and so she was hyper focused on it she said well if I turn on my Social Security and this isn't the discovery meeting when I can say well first you got to tell me what we're trying to do and she said what's real obvious I'm trying to understand my income she was hyper focused\nOn it which is great mine is the fact that she didn't have a clear inventory and she didn't have a clear direction of what she was going to do once she stopped\nWorking and she's a sales rep so once you stop being a sales rep what was she going to do after\nThat she had built up all the skills of communication with other people and and what is she going to be in and what are you going to do when you grow up like you were saying and she was really not having that conversation when they she refused to have that conversation she didn't know she was refusing she wasn't being malicious and refusing it\nShe just didn't know that's what I was asking 'cause she was hyper focused on how am I going to be paid if I stop working today how I make my money tomorrow and I would ... and I was literally telling her I said well first we have to do it written income report\nWhile still leaving plenty of money aside for you to cover the things you plan on doing in the future as well is make sure you can sleep a night even if life gets in the way it was at this point that Paul was actually able to relax she was finally able to see the missing piece puzzle and she was now ready to be ready for retirement\nHere you could financial services we believe being ready for time is more than just having saved enough money it's about knowing how much you've said what's the lifestyle I'm going to have\nAnd how am I going to sustain it for my entire life but it also includes having someone like myself in the tea near you could financial services to guide you through the pieces that are missing and now that beginning point of any retirement plan\nIs making sure that you have a stable foundation that maximize your retirement income in a predictable fashion\nSo the starting point is to optimize your Social Security benefits because at face value you can leave tens of thousands of dollars on the table but by employing a few little known strategies it's actually possible to generate as much as a hundred thousand dollars or more an additional lifetime\nIncome so come in just like Paul and John and let us give you a complementary customize written income report so this way you can see how maximizing the retirement income\nCan impact your overall retirement\nNow to get your customize your income plan you must be at least fifty five years old and be ready to be ready for retirement we have only three left to these reports so called right now for all one seven to seven to seven to seven that's for one seven to seven twenty seven twenty seven and let's get ready to be ready to retire\nYeah you really do need a written income report it puts the immature together for us so that one of your biggest hurdles is just to teach yourself how to dream big again how to\nTeach yourself to I Want to be an astronaut or I Want to be I don't know I Want to run through two states wearing only Nike's just just two states just too well for me it would be Delaware and Rhode Island ... back to back yeah but but the short way okay yeah that's a long way got it anybody's ever say\nThat that's actually so the idea is you have to start dreaming big you have to get your lifestyle in order and you have to really start giving yourself permission to really be you would get and I think that is a very difficult thing to do when you've been in a regiment for fifty forty five\nFifty years when you're in you're working years 'cause you're told well this is your purpose this is your purpose then you build your entire life around that\nYes the idea of what's my new structure which that new plan which my new routine and that doesn't mean okay I've retired I'm going to get up I'm going to have two cups of coffee I'm gonna watch daytime TV and the more lawn grow it all over it and\nI I think that's I think or nail it because that right there when when retirees say that it's that's them deflecting the conversation of I'm not really sure what you're talking about\nIt's okay to be lost in this conversation you have to say it's new to me it's okay to be lost take a second in just think through what did I give up by working\nYeah what did I give up what do I need to gain back to make myself hold again because if it's going to I'm going to fix my house\nWell that that's good for about a year and then you're either going to go back to work or you're going to really have

his medical for himself and his wife dead\nAs we started talking I can seemed tense up as we got to the subject of medical so I asked them what are you looking to accomplish by talking with me today\nHe looked down at the table and he said I'm worried my wife's medical needs are going to get worse and I won't have enough to cover any increase in the medical expenses she has some conditions that are life threatening\nBut they can call some issues down the road when Mike is going through was all too common with baby boomers the fear of unknown expenses that can cause you to focus on only the issue and not be able to see the answer even if it's right in front of you might do the right thing by asking for help\nI turned to Mike and they said let's talk about what you have available for your retirement and what you actually want to accomplish in that time\nIn over the next few conversations we were able to talk about what my plan for himself as well as what accounts were available to fund his goals overall he's done a great job saving for retirement so between us for ... brokerage accounts he had enough to cover his day to day expenses and if you add\nIn his pension that was available as well as the Social Security he was going to be in good shape\nWhat was missing was how to distribute is money so we never felt that he didn't have enough\nSo we went through his financial stress test and it showed him that by using his pension and a Social Security to cover his basic necessities he could then use his brokerage accounts for predictable expenses such as bucket list goals and then set is four one K. for flexible use this would allow us money to continue to grow to cover inflation\nIn those unexpected medical expenses my couldn't have been more relief knowing he had a
