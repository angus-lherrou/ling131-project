the tone of software to do on there it is a fantastic time here in New England\n... thank you Jennifer for being here and uh again for our listeners check out our blogger dot com they in front of a greatly You're welcome to new fan so we're in the studio with Ashley border with residential mortgage services Ashley services Rhode Island and Massachusetts works with buyers in both places to provide\nOh in Connecticut I'm Sorry I'm able to provide them with different solutions when it comes to home financing though earlier on in the show on a briefly touched upon this\nYou give a couple of different interesting\nUm scenarios about an arm chair versus predict a fixed rate yeah can you do you quickly go over that again if somebody's looking to buy and they want solutions to be more affordable\nYeah I mean I think that I'm an arm has a bad rap so people who don't know what that means nothing about Tom Brady his arm talking about a decibel rate mortgages\nWhere it's fixed for a certain timeframe it's usually five years seven years or ten years I prefer a ten year ... products where the rate is not going to change for the first one hundred and twenty months and then after a hundred and twenty months it can change based on certain\nTerms and um why do I like this product first of all I've never taken a thirty or affects my entire home buying experiences for my own why would you\nTake a long time\nFirst Rhode Island cells every two points up\nAnd you know or they change a mortgage practice every three to five so you know right now the margin between an arm and a fixed rate might be a half a percent that could you know be Seventy two a hundred and twenty dollars depending on the price range so why wouldn't you do that\nAs long as you're educated now here's why you wouldn't all answer that question\nLet's say your first time by or putting five percent down well maybe an arms are great because let's say the market does take a death and let's say values do go down over the next ten years what do they can't refinance or what if they can't sell now they're an easy so I never want to make someone an easy I Want you to sleep at night\nBut if you know we are mobile and you know that you know you're going to put some equity or build some equity in the house and look at the arm I think it's a smart move\nYeah as far as investment properties go to absolutely look at the arm if you're purchasing a three family or for family you're probably better off doing an armed making principle only payments and you can you know and and by the way once you hit that seven year or five years seven years it can only go up by like two points or something there's a limit on\nIt for them yeah I mean so much to present some most of them are five but you know most people will tell you that usually after the adjustment period begins they still stay in the arm because it's lower than market rate so just as they can go up and they can go back down so I I don't know I mean if you talk\nTo every person in the financial world and loan officers they would probably also say I only do arms because why not pay the lowest amount of interest possible as long as there's a little bit of time in security their\nPay lower interest lower payments more profit coming in and use that extra profit and pay yourself pay your mortgage down\nLiterally is probably one of the best things you can do and you are you obtaining you know actual ownership of the bank of an owner that property and you can pull money out of that for anything at all for buying other investments were for improving the property real estate is such a fantastic thing\nTo have to own to to to just you know retirement wise it's on a believable call me if you need any ideas on how to leverage your real estate or how to buy real estate leverage or how to sell the maximum price for zero one three five nine to three\nThree eight again four oh one three five nine to three three eight we've had a such a fun show today actually boarding with residents more desire and a Half Men enjoyed myself ah You're welcome we always enjoy having you hear Christina our producer Peter George with Peter George public speaking Mike\nIsland and Russell Roberts news radio nights wants the and one oh four seven FM hears what's happening but don't get base to toymaker has borough is making organizational changes that will include layoffs\nIn a statement ... says some of the changes will be difficult well not revealing how many jobs will be cut the company does say will impact a single digit percentage of its global workforce\nTheir focus we're going to pull back in ... I Need a cup of coffee like all three\nCars you touched on a really important part that Social Security is one income tool that you have a retirement intentions as another your ... K is also an income to everything that you're saving for retirement at some point is going to be used for income they key is where do they all say as you're moving forward and that's where\nAre you roll over here for a while you were all over your four one K. where does the ... that's where all those components fit and now I'm Manny resent nice and it's my pleasure to be a part of a team from you could financial services we're all certified Social Security advisors with an essay as well as myself who's an I. A. R. with you could wealth management\nAnd an hour I see the so we can help you maximize your Social Security and separate time an income tax strategy it's all under one roof you could financial services so today to help you figure out how to roll over here for Kate we'd given away ten free\nRein in income reports to help you figure out how to get to and through your entire retirement so be one of the next ten callers right now at four zero one\nSeven to seven to seven to seven to get your free rein income report again that's for one Seventy seven twenty seven twenty seven\nMany of those written income reports line up to a four one K. amazingly because you can put in your actual four one K. so if you bring in a four one K. statement from\nYour employer it can go right into the income statement it is absolutely amazing how to figure out what a foreign when cable actually pay out it'll lay it all out it'll tell you how to treat your Social Security it'll trigger pensions it'll trigger well just any financial document you have it's actually really need to see this in one place\nYeah and what it does too is is if there is a shortfall for your income it tells you how to continue saving and your ... okay and what you have to do to actually get to that\nThat missing component cell but there's no stress\nThat well let's dive into savings so if we're going to talk about four one K. first thing we have to do is\nTalk about employer so employers start by putting a four one K. into the business in which you are working and you have thirty one flavors you have Thirteen flavors you have a lot of investments inside of the four one K. I don't think those matter\nAs much as your contribution and if your employer matches there could be a profit sharing there could be a major match at the end there could be a match during the week there's\nAll kinds of process sees that happen here I think we need to kind of walk through a little bit of that to kind of lower the well I picked the wrong investment I I'm In ... I'm In the market I mean this kind of stuff I don't think that's as\nImportant and I just think we need to kind of get some of that on the page\nThat you're taking up space in my head here you're you're written some space out in there so because when it comes down to it\n[laughter] oh yeah no no no no when it comes to the fact that I felt\nReally really it I'm sure that so uh when uh when it comes to your four one K. it's one of the tools that easier to use to save for retirement because\nA lot of the things are done for you it's it can be an automatic savings that contribution comes out in time to pay comes to you so and it's in his don't automatically so it's systematic\nYou don't it's kind of set in forget so you decide how much you can afford to take out of your paycheck to contribute to your future retirement and it does that automatically so I think it's it's the one good stuff\nYeah it's when you're talking about saving and well getting your direction around about I'm going to my employer says they give me three percent\nThat three percent of your total gross packed and then when they talk about well what you can you contribute will you contribute over three percent Americans really need to start targeting ten percent of their total gross income\nInto a long term savings process for one case are one piece of that so if your employers giving you a three and you do another three\nThat could be counted as six total percent so then you need to only make up ... percent somewhere else it can be that easy because when you talk about retirement savings it\nDoesn't have to be a mountain or a molehill it can actually be a pretty good lay out of where it's going to be if you're trying to figure out these calculations\nGo to the Web site go to Euclid F. S. dot com that you see L. I. D. S. as in financial S. as in services and look it up there's calculators out there there's white pages on this\nThere's actually a video of Josh was waving at ya it's amazing click on it and watch it you'll get a ton of information this show is all about the baby boomer for one case say\nYeah I like the fact that you you mentioned that there's a number or target you should be going for that ... is a baseline that's the the idea that really should be your minimum yeah that's that's the minimum baseline of if I set aside this ten percent and I just let it go it will compound overtime regardless of which invest when I pick inside the former okay\nNow you want to be efficient about it\nSo if you're finding is that your former K isn't working the way you want it to you definitely want to make sure that it's set up correctly so that it would work best for you going forward in the future\nYeah one of the things that are kind of coming up is when people are coming into the office there they're calling the radio show and they're saying things like\nI'm trying to figure out how to get more savings in and this is no different than what happened last week when I'm Jim came in gym came in and he was talking about how he was having problems getting over this six percent thing and it's really easy to kind of ... to get in the weeds and say well I'm not saving\nHe's actually putting away four percent of his total gross income into a savings account just at the local back\nHe's literally just putting it into the bank it's automatically deposited he's just not spending it he doesn't look at that as a as a retirement savings so I asked him what are you going to use this money for and he didn't have a broken up he had all this money in one place he knew he had a four one K. he knew that he had a bank account but\nIn his mind he didn't break it up into three so you're you're good we'll walk you through the GPS system and when you do that what you will find is that you want to put your money in three different piles\nDaily usage emergency fund usage which could be a brokerage account or money market account\nIt's also then going to go into storage in storage does not mean that you're going to get rid of it it means that you're storing it and that's your four one K. that you're IRAs annuities this type of stuff long term storage\nRetirement money when Jim was trying to get his mind around this it was mind blowing for him he was nervous his whole concern\nHyper focused on it and you you know like when you get hyper focused on the up and you can't see anything else while I I was told I Need I Need and he was told twelve percent ... percent save any twelve percent say but I Need to get to this or else I Will never be able to retire\nJim was a young guy sixty two and so we walk through it in his calculation did say that he did need at least ten but he was saving six he was killing themselves trying to get to another six he wasn't counting his checking and saying you got that is a savings\nAccount too and you can redirect that money to being into your daily money into your emergency fund money and then into your\nStorage money and it's amazing how much asked that you can actually accumulate it's\nIt's amazing to know exactly what you have how you can actually spent you know the key takeaway with Jim was was let them know how much you can actually spend every single weekend retirement to know that without a shadow of delving you actually have enough money to last how long you live these are questions that you must get the answers to before you retire while there's still time to prepare\nAnd make sure that your money last as long as your retirement does\nThe teen here you could financial services\nIs giving way uh

well as the form and getting you to ask through your entire retirement if you strive to protect preserve and pass along your money that turn this radio up grab your bed it's time to talk about retirement today we're talking about for one case we're reminding baby boomers that for one case had\nThe life cycle you don't take them into retirement as a ... ... take them as an IRA were lay that out in very very Christ cleaned up a language so that everybody understands it if you were getting ready to retire we have an awesome show today we have the entire team here you've got ready to help you get to and through your entire retirement that four\nOh one Seventy seven to seven to seven or Flora one Seventy seven twenty seven twenty seven let's get talking about retirement Josh just dive\nInto this topic on for one case you know being advised here or you could we come across several large companies that the foreign Kate is probably one of the best benefits companies like since ... and every source\nAnd Eighteen T an amicus they have really good four one K. plants because well they want their employees to save for retirement besides being having a good\nWell for one case are definitely a benefit they're there to help people say if they're there to help people get in front of retirements so not just the bosses are retiring but everybody's retiring fuss exactly that\nWe have to get on the table the basic savings plan because that's what we're for one case are so the basic savings plan is how much should we be saving twenty percent\nEighty percent four hundred percent of our gross no maybe not that high but I I Would have my favorite four hundred percent I don't know that you're going to pay for a hundred percent of what they are very low yeah there's physics majors that they're going\nThat's impossible USA so the idea\nRight so when you're talking about your four one K. exactly what should a baby boomer be targeting ten to Fifteen Percent savings does it ought to be in the ... no but it has to be total gross income\nYeah and I think we also have to address what happens when you actually hit your goal when their four one K. what's that next step is it possible to hit your goal and you're four one K. is there actually is next year and now if you don't set one you'll never hit it if you're ever ever uh last movie you know that the gods stopper but there is a finish line\nToo and it's called retirement you do have a goal I Know in the eighties they everybody had to have a million dollars right it doesn't take a million dollars for everybody to retire but you have to think through where is your finish line in savings really ties into that we have to talk about four one K. rollovers we have to talk about our MDs distribution\nThese are all mechanics at work off of something as easy as an employer savings plan it is absolutely amazing if the conversation is just tuning in or if you're just tuning into the conversation give us a call at four O. one\nWhat yeah so let's talk through that because those are scary terms to so third party administrator or TPA are those are the people that that makes sure that if you do alone that's that website you go to\nIt it's not just fidelity there's another from behind fidelity or if you're in a smaller from like a a smaller company not fortune five foot of fortune two thousand then when you call up you're going to talk to the gym or you're going to talk to Bob you're going to talk\nTo a broker in the employer has to send paperwork to them so they have to sign off on it those are what we call hurdles and they're designed to withdraw or slow down the process not to hurt you but to say is this really necessary in sometimes to put walls up to say no it's not available\nIf there as a protection peace for you to be able to stop and say okay is this really the right thing for me is this and my best interests and so you do have to jump through some hoops to make sure that is the right thing for you and this is why you should always into sheet roll over with a financial professional like us here you could financial services it make sure that we can get you through the paper work properly\nAnd make sure it's the right choice for you\nYeah a hundred percent when you talk about a roll over though I don't want to make it sound scary\nRollovers are free so it doesn't matter what company use or how it works the roll over itself the active rolling over is free and that's that's a federal thing so the IRS put it all together so if you go from a four one K. or any employer plan to an IRA\nIt's free the active rolling it over findings punish should not charge you for this financial advisors should not charge you just it's an act\nOf moving it to a individual retirement account\nAnd I think the key takeaway from this is the rover from an old employer plan whether it's a four one K. or something else is natural it's part of the process of leaving a company whether you're going from one company to another or going from your final company to retirement to roll over crosses self as natural as part of the distribution\nBecause without it you can't create a stable spending habits in retirement because you need to be able to know how much you can or will be able to spend every\nSingle week in retirement without a shadow of a doubt that you actually have\nEnough money to last no matter how long you live and these are questions that you have to get the answers to before you retire while there's still time to prepare and make sure that your money last as long as your retirement does now with the New York you could financial services is giving away\nCustomize written income report just for you we have three more of these reports left so take advantage of this offer now this plan works best what those are within five years of retiring at our at least fifty five years old who are ready to be ready for retirement so be one of the next three callers right now for one seven to seven\nTo seven to seven that's four zero one Seventy seven twenty seven twenty seven\nNow many this show is all about the life cycle of four one K. you start to save you put money in the four one K. you build up this war chest right you have this asset for retirement the idea is that you're saving for retirement everybody understands that there is no joke and that\nIs every bit of literature I'm almost positive it's an every child book it's their mother goose read about a mother goose wrote about it and send the Grimm's fairy tale of retirement everybody gets a yacht and so now you have your four one K.\nYou roll it to an IRA why is it that way why do I have to rule it to an IRA or individual retirement account\nThe IRS isn't doing it as a trick it's because it's the distribution model if you don't roll it over you still have to distribute it but now you have to take a hundred percent of it you have to take a large truck if you roll it to an IRA you can take it in small bits if you get to a certain age bracket say Seventy and a half\nWill die your turn to highlight now you have to talk about taking a required minimum distribution if you ever written that down grab you know books write it down because this is a really important thing there is a huge penalty if you don't take it at seven and a half maximum\nTo be real easy to understand if you do the life cycle four one K. roll over to an IRA irate to distribution if you do that rollovers cycle if you do that for one case cycle much much easier to understand requirement distributions\nBaby boomers get really really nervous about requirement distributions you have to take them at seven in ...\nWhy don't we start talking about taking them earlier than that\nI'm actually really glad you brought that up because when you say requirement on distribution in my mind I hear your income is just another way of saying income because when you were sitting in your four one K. and then moved to
