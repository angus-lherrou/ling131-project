I don't know what is going to make you would get active or proactive I say not preventative I don't like the word preventative I like the word pro active\nGet involved in your health invest in that in your health is an investment right so I mean people like to spend you know I see women spend two thousand dollars I've never done this but two thousand dollars on a pocketbook\nUm two thousand dollars on a pair of shoes but ask them to put some money towards their health you know ask them to buy all natural products for their home asked them to bite\nTo eat organic or asked them to do something that might cost a little more and they're like ... not interested I'd rather go smoke cigarettes\nUm I don't know you know I don't get it um but one thing I Do know is that caffeine is the world's most use stimulus and so what is and caffeine right we have a magnesium which is a positive we have ...\nWhich are known to raise the LDL or the bad cholesterol so that's a bad\nWe have ... have an anti accident properties and we have potassium which could be good or bad depending on on if you have high blood pressure it might help lower your blood pressure if you have tacky cardio and may make your heart race too much and may not it may cause you to go to the hospital so it depends\nOne size does not fit off so we have a mixture of some good stuff a mixture of some bad things so the question was does caffeine or coffee consumption put you at higher risk for heart attack\nAnd I'm so caffeine is broken down almost exclusively by an enzyme called ... won a to metabolize an enzyme the rate at which this enzyme converts cats\nBeing taught more water soluble compound than that it's broken down further into and now they're Monday metabolites\nSo what does this mean for you if you inherited the a version of this gene which about fifty percent of the population has you are a fast metabolize are\nPeople here at the a C or the ... are slow metabolize ers and if you drink over two cups of coffee current recommendations by the big associations and this is the equivalent to smoking one pack of cigarettes per day did you hear that\nIt's the equivalent to smoking one pack of cigarettes per day and put you out of four times higher risk of heart disease and some people say well I don't really think I Need to know this information I say ...
