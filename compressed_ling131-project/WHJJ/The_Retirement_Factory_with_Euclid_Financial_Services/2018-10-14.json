steel reports say firefighters will be receiving super ... salary increases annually for the next three years\nIn the financial income planner\nPlanners going to be putting together a tax plan for you oh that's that's Ninety percent of income planned in my opinion ah just because it's the simple fact that you have to have a if you don't have a plan for the taxes that you're going to be paying whether they're high or low you you're never going to be able to get 'em any lower than they are\nYeah in the income plant on the tax plan is the component of it when you're sitting with your income plant or they should be able to talk to you about\nSecurity in terms that you understand like your full retirement age do they actually know what your real full full retirement ages because depending on what year you're born it can be somewhere between age sixty six in age sixty seven and that can make a difference depending on when you actually want to trigger your full one hundred percent benefit\nSo you've got to make sure they have that information as well\nYeah when we're thinking about this I think we got to tell you one step further in income planter is not just thinking about taxes\nAnd income they're also thinking about legacy where's this money going to go after I die what's going to happen after this right how is it what is the chain of command does it go from husband or wife to children does it go from life to charity to children where does it go how how many miles do we have to feed off of this one income\nThat is an important process to think through a threat is

might you good money services New England go to retirement experts we're broadcasting run you could vote stayed east Providence we have the entire team here and we're Jason the Republican votes manning uh money man resent\nI everybody and I'm Josh Wells getting you to and through your entire\nRetirement to show is amazing we're talking about Social Security we're talking about how your Social Security affects your retirement plan and how do you actually affect your Social Security\nIt's an amazing concept don't let a blow your mind grab your you know pets Turner's radio up let's talk about Social Security let's get everybody under control winner take it how to take it how sick it again and again and again no you only get one [laughter] so you can only take it when it's your turn but remember your spouse or benefits\nYour benefits and all their retirement benefits are only a portion of your income\nYou have two different times in your life to choose you can either take a pre retirement before sixty six or after you take full retirement it's so if you know when we took a commercial break we were talking about how taking early retirement affected you and we have to really go back into that I think\nJosh you actually just kind of laid where my mind was going just before you said you only get to pick Social Security once you only get one time to turn it on and the one thing that I see is a big pitfall is that people say I'm going to turn it on sixty two because well I Want to get every single dollar out of Social Security that I can get\nBut as soon as I hear that I literally cringe because once you turn it on this no going back and it can create a lot more issues down the road if you're not sure why it fits aware fits like for example we were talking during the break Bob Bob [noise]\nHe was talking to me after one of our Social Security events and he looked him and he goes hey man I Want to turn on my Social Security at sixty two\nBut I don't know if it's a good idea\nAnd as we were talking about well why is that do you need the income well no I've got a pension from oil company but I'm eligible to take it now and I feel like I should just turn it on now\nAnd I was like whoa bought if you don't need the income now let's take a look at all the recounts let's just make sure that your Social Security doesn't do more harm than good\nAnd as we went through a discovery meeting not only did he have a pension that he was collecting all of his retirement accounts were in IRAs so turning Social Security on at sixty two\nWould have been the worst decision for him his Social Security would have been eighty five percent taxable pushing his entire family into a higher tax bracket that he could have never gotten out of after we went through his retirement income report it became crystal clear the best age for him was to turn Social Security on it sixty eight\nIt was amazing to see Bob understand our Social Security ... to his entire retirement strategy but the only way he was able to see it was by sitting down with me here at the office and going over his retirement income report\nThis report lays out the most optimal time to take his Social Security benefit so if you want to written income plan you've got a call you could financial services here at four O. one\nSeventy seven to seven to seven\nRemember you only get to retire once so cost now for one\nSeven to seven to seven to seven\nI Love that you have Bob I didn't know about that story it's absolutely amazing because Bob if he would have triggered all those IRAs and his income from his employer and everything [noise] holy cow buddy you talk and that's a that's a tax burden that is a bomb\nYou can't turn back off and I don't deal with oh it's a done deal and it was absolutely definitely that's all right he had\nHis he had a permanent income stream coming in Odessa engine a higher now hard at you know turning that sets the minimum income level now are out there should be listening to this and the thing was his goal his mind was I'm going to never take the IRA money until I have to\nThinking he's never gonna have to touch it but even realize his arm decent age Seventy one\nIf he had that anti Social Security on it hadn't spend any money yet he would've jumped up easily to tax ... oh yeah and never been able to get out of it and it would have severely impacted his life he would have had more money coming in but I had left to actually spend because out of in fact\nThat his entire family values that entire family income that's right he his ... would have been yet as well so income that have been would have been crushed to oh yeah you know as talking with Bob here you know I think we're talking about pitfalls they don't think about the actual income itself\nThey're talking about missing the pitfall of actually maximizing and when people say that they believe that it's\nOh we'll just wait to turn Social Security on age Seventy ... it's really not it's it's really how can you minimize the taxes on your overall we're sweet\nSpot on your tax ... and that and yeah the taxes change but they don't change but every ten years so we know what it's gonna be next year the year after year after year after so it'd be very close [laughter] even if Trump the changes that right if a President Trump changes the taxes\n... it's not going to change the calculation and which we are talking about that's right that's right that's absolutely it's absolutely mind blowing to me that people say oh I got I got to figure this out yeah we do have figured out but not for the reason you're saying\nThat you have to just understand what is actually taxable to your you've got three things that trigger taxes it's your income its capital gains and if that require minimum distribution\nAnd the reality is you just have to understand what's coming in for income because that's the one you can truly control if you understand where all your income taxes are coming in now the best way to figure out what your income is or how it works you've got a call you could financial services here for one\nSeven to seven to seven to seven\nAnd get one of the last two retirement income reports that's going to focus on your Social Security and what your best ages for\nIt will lay out all the gory details what's what is your guaranteed income what's your predictable link um what's your variable income you need to know all three of those to know when your Social Security is actually going to be triggered and this report will do it so call and get one of the last two at four O. one\nSeventy seven to seven to seven\nTalking about planning we're talking about financial advisors were talking about retirement income advisors I think these are a lot of jargon that people really get confused on\nAnd it gets turned around when you talk about it visors there are several impacted visors so there's these girls advises the one that gets you to retirement they they got you four one K. money they got ya uh irate money they got just saving income money but they actually are never going to distribute it\nAnd he felt he was getting some bad advice so I asked credit to come in sit down let's talk about it over some coffee and just a ... you know and before crack had come in to see us his financial advisor had told him he should trigger Social Security when he turned sixty two and collect it while he's still worked\nYou know so I asked him what his plans were for work we talked about how he really enjoys his job and what he thought\nWorking till sixty six is what he really wanted to do\nAs we talked about the consequences of taking your Social Security early the different penalties this caps and all the problems that could cause a down the road for him after hearing all this correct stop dead in his tracks that he looked at me with confusion and said why would I take it early and not wait until I was ready to retire\nYou know he went on to say his financial advisor never told them anything about his Social Security and actually how it worked so you know Craig has now claimed that you could financial services and we have a Social Security plan for him he's now going to take it at sixty six you know and I just saw a correct the other day and he couldn't be happier\nSo you know if you need Social Security retirement planning help\nI Want you to give us a call here today you could financial services you know Craig I'm sure glad he did and it's for one Seventy seven to seven to seven again that's for one Seventy seven to seven to seven\nYeah Jay I Love that story about Greg 'cause I remember when you sit down with him you went through the the retirement income report with him at\nPoint blank showed him exactly how much he was going to save a by taking his Social Security at sixty six verse taking at sixty two\nMore importantly it also showed them how the rest of his accounts lined up to it how the three rows of money we're actually the biggest component of making his decision with his Social Security\nHe knew exactly where is his bank accounts were supposed to be where he was after offers day to day income he knew where his income is going to come in from Social Security and his four one K. and the small mentioned that he had\nIt was amazing I I that's one of my favorite stories there\nYeah let's give away to more of these uh retirement income reports not justice so security but all of his income it's an amazing report you have to have a\nRetirement income report is what you're going to ask for it focuses on Social Security it focuses on what ever your income process needs to be so give us a call for a one\nSeven to seven to seven to seven once again that's four oh one seven to seven to seven to ...\nYou know what I Love about that report is the fact that it actually shows you how to maximize your income so that actually winds up to the goals you have in retirement because remember this is all about you it doesn't matter what we think it matters what are you trying to accomplish and does the components and tools that counts you already own ...\nAnd up to that and if it doesn't how do you make it work so that you can have enough income and not over paying taxes and you have that weird bird you know we we all know the guy down the street who's always complaining about kids get off my lawn or why it's so difficult for us right of government is taking my paycheck\nNo it's because it's not lined up and it's it's just understanding where's your money coming from and how does it work and it's an absolutely amazing thing\nYou know in in ... well Mandy what that report what it also does it points out where the pitfalls could and will happen if you're not careful if you don't have the proper plan put together you know is it gonna you know where you're going to fall into it a tax bomb that we talk about we talked about that on other shows\nYou know or is it going to be that you're just going to run out of money it shows you all those types of scenarios\nAnd with that you can actually put together and have a plan that you're confident about\nAnd understand how Social Security and your other incomes work and how it's going to last year entire retirement\nYeah some of the ah some of the things I Want to jump off here is a pitfalls\nI Want to go back to pitfalls so when we're talking about pitfalls about Social Security\nSome people don't realize that Social Security is calculating the last thirty five years not your entire lifetime thirty five years\nSo it they and they wait differently the threat so when it's weighed a the the latter years the the older years your last year's in your career or wait heavier\nThan the original paper
