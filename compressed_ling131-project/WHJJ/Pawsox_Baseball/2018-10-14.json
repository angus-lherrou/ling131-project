[laughter]\nSo the idea is if you have a five\nGallon bucket of water and that water is drinkable and it's your water to drink you're going to use it over a period of time not in one setting so if you're going to think about it like income you've taken your entire life to\nCollect all of this money all of this water for income when you do retire you're not\nGoing to go Thursday you're going to slowly distribute this money\nWhat happens to the money that's not being distributed it doesn't sit idle it doesn't go stagnant you're going to use that money to grow in make more water collect more because you still have the buckets you still have the collection vehicle and so that is there to collect\nBut can you drink more and sometimes invite a friend over and have some water sure use it as you need it and so when you're trying to understand the usability of this money it really really comes down to just because you're not using it you're storing instead\nThat is usable money yeah Josh agree with you when it comes to usable money we like to break it up into three categories we like to break it up into guaranteed income\nPredictable income inflexible and go now to get more information on this conversation about usable income and what different types there are ... you could Web site go to U.

rival producers should be paying attention Steve how do you see it\nWas just in case of you know a movie star war which shot you know in retrospect it seemed like a no brainer a big hit of course probably Cooper directing it but I Am self as well as Lady Gaga did a sort of buffalo bit lose over the weekend I think we'll continue to do that\nAnd that will probably a lot of success of the ... and he offers and and the road shows\nOn the line but we're only about the film and about the project is that uh there's really not a lot of ... with English with work I mean for one from studio ...

you know again it was back in the mid seventies so a lot of people even if they\nAre seeing a movie with Barbara Streisand Chris Chris christopherson\nAh you know it was a long time ago and I also think the world is changing the music world that are from documents he was very much about a sort of a Mario Cooper's characters with our country rocker but with the guy with the modern a sort of pop super ... all the way to becoming that\nThat's a very different sort of set of musical circumstances in the seventies show you know just for civil remake it was a remake I think a lot to say about and

is born bucked Hollywood's conventional wisdom and succeeded anyway uh we were talking off air I told you I just don't see many movies so I sort of smeared when I saw the opening weekend box number of of ah like forty two million I don't know okay whatever too bad I voted to\nEntertainers I like Bradley Cooper Lady Gaga oh well let's put that number perspective 'cause that's not really\nYou know they weren't after like a two hundred million dollar opening weekend\nThat's exactly right I you know I think the numbers are all study where we get get gotta get inundated every weekend now we're on

be this kind of global assault on the box office the way our love affair might be for you after so ah you know the fact that he made forty two point six million when you look at\nYou know how how ...

I mean because I saw lots of tea partiers going to the Supreme Court and banging on the on the walls and by the way I have plenty of Supreme Court decisions that make me want to bang on the laws the Supreme Court right but we don't do those things because they're both were supposed to be in a civil society\nRight now I'm trying to remember I'm trying to remember all of the people to tea partiers uh chased down with their children\nYou know and the homemade signs how many people they chased down in restaurants and surrounded cannot think of one exam in fact if you want an example of this what didn't dancey below sea do during the health care bill\nShe and uh was it John Lewis marched out\nIn to the crowded\nIn to the crowd trying to get them to do that and they wouldn't [laughter] do you remember\nMe trying to get them to be violent they said all kinds of crazy things throw gasoline all over them and then they linked arms in March bravely through that crowd when they didn't have to\nThey were trying to get the Tea Party to become of violent mob they didn't\nCan you imagine what would have happened if Donald Trump and Brett Kavanaugh would have linked arms and tried to walk through the crowd in Washington DC and not have been pretty it would not have been\nPretty and by the way I mean you know you can talk about some of these things I mean ... ... ... that's not a mob they're charging cities and they're taking over that's me I shouldn't say that's a riot that is why it by a mob yeah did you define mob police look it up in the dictionary find out let's let's make\nSure we know what we're talking about mob\nMob a large crowd of people especially one that has this orderly and intent on causing trouble or violence okay and and the quote is a mob of protesters that say that their usage so is this not to a disorderly\nCrowd of people that are trying\nTo what ... cents on causing trucking tens on causing trouble yeah I mean I guess if you think well Brett Kavanaugh was a terrible person and stopping him is good so that's not the only thing trouble I mean if you go to go down that road I guess they are in that that doesn't does it say there and unless you're right\nJust as intent on causing trouble right it doesn't say you know ... with an exception of those who are absolutely right what what I'm saying though is that the media\nDoes not see harassing conservatives as causing trouble correct that is the issue correct they see this as a career I see that that's like the you know there it's basically a you know charity we're at right I mean they're they're doing good\nFor the people you're stopping these evil or old white people who have names like Cruz\nOr that [laughter] things better yeah [laughter] I mean they are by the Irish guy [laughter] let me tell you at the white people white people do ya [laughter]\n[laughter] really bad oh really [laughter]\nOkay so let's listen to a couple of things first we have CNN we just played oh you're not going to call it a mob me yes I'm going to call it a mob a now here's Maxine Waters trying to say we're trying to redefine protesters mob rule here it is\nProtests is guaranteed to a democratic society we know that this is guaranteed to us about the constitution they're trying to change the description of protests and call it a mob well no this president is the poster boy for what\nA mob a protest that looks like he is a matter of\nHe's the one who has been violence in his speech his wife I only around things like this I lacked punch him in the face Trump said that at one of his route has said knock the crap out of them are what you and says say OK tests knock the hell I mean okay alright okay we\nGot it now that's what she's saying she's saying that Donald Trump is the one who's violence in their speech\nA let's go to Jennifer ... adults are at us and she's the network president and co executive director at the center for popular democracy here's what she's saying to the crowds lawmakers and leftist continue to push\nProtests as scared to sorry\nSorry [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise]\nSo they go anywhere we see them do here's\nHere's the problem let's ratchet things down just a bit and listen to somebody who says ... I think there's real trouble on the way and has reason to say that here's Rand\nPaul\nWhen people are like Cory Booker shake it up in their face he he may think that that's okay but what are you guys have realized is that for about every thousand person that might want to get up in your face\nWhat I'm going to be an stable enough to commit violence when I was at the ball field which basically was nearly killed the guy shooting up the ball field and shooting I think five or six people were were shot [noise] usually has almost go he was yelling this is for healthcare hit list in his pocket of conservative Republicans that he wanted to kill\nYou know what I was attacked in my yard and that's why ribs broken a pneumonia lung conclusion all of that these are people that are unstable\nAnd we don't want to encourage them we have to somehow record it down and say we're not encouraging that volunteer ever OK ever reason for or a means for trying to do things I feel that there's going to be an assassination I really worry that someone is going to be killed [noise]\nAnd uh that those who are ratcheting up the the the conversation those who are actually getting their face we have to realize that they bear some responsibility of the show like to watch\n[noise] so do you remember the time when people like brick Baldwin in CNN were lecturing us that you couldn't say you're going to target a district\nBecause that of course led to violence couldn't target the district remember the lectures of your words have power because you don't know who's listening to them and we said unless you're unless you're endorsing this we are calling for peaceful rallies\nAnd they were and they were\nThese are not peaceful how many people were arrested for and the Tea Party\nRiots\nMobs how many I don't remember any\nFour hundred just last weekend on the left four hundred that's disorderly that's not a peaceful protest your words do have power because you do mean violence\nNow how can Glenn Beck even say that well I'll back it up\nThat would be the last ... others target non white immigrant workers\nWho's doing that\nI mean I guess they would claim that's like border enforcement right like yeah that's border enforcement that a lot more than ... yeah there's a law they're\nClaiming we do not know who's in our country and we're also worried about terrorism I'm a charismatic media personality with a populist message attacks religious minorities well who could that\nBe [laughter]\nI I Know I Know I went to stand with Israel if anybody's attacking religious minorities hell with that\nReligious majorities it's the left conservatives denounced the president and his allies for flouting the Constitution's during the I'd states toward socialism\nYep did that one\nBecause that's what's happening that's what did happen I got Alexandria Cosby of Cortez yeah ... it's a crazy accusations right point many on the left warn that\nFascism is taking root and America no socialism is taking root in America socialism\nYeah I mean people unless they fascist every time someone does something they don't like right as opposed to you know no ... fascism it that is it's socialism that is sweeping the nation remember the headline where all socialist now\nThat's what's sleeping is sweeping the nation are parallels between the two areas aren't perfect but the late Nineteen\nThirties way oh that\nIs an understatement of the year can you say that a lot of the parallels between the two hours aren't perfect they're not perfect but I didn't have one way to describe you've just done yeah about three quarters of them are completely inaccurate\nBut as an aide to a night late Nineteen thirties as today political rancor social division and the threat posed by alien ideologies sparked widespread unease what is the alien ideology\nOf today yeah of today or back then I mean the fact that one of the two major party has embraced democratic socialism is very alien to me yes the the the fear back in the thirties was communism\nOr the ... and the left said no it's fascism\nWell okay um\nI guess I mean it was Adolf Hitler and Mussolini that said that ah FDR is one of us he is a fascist\nSo maybe it was bad but there's more hang on\nNews radio nine twenty and one ...\nOver more than what's new today on the free I heart radio I hire a a\nFor decorating the house or just
