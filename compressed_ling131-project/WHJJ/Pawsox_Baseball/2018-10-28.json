{"month": "10", "state": "RI", "station": "WHJJ", "content": "Yes yes that's what he thought but I but let's let's pull back and focus for a second so before the break not sure I can I Know I Know Bob before the break we were talking about what to do with your original Medicare's for your party and your\nHeartbeat so I Want to pick up what happens after you've turned sixty five you've blown up the cake you've gotten your red white and blue card in the mail and you've officially retired and gone into the sunset now we have to pick out\nThe next tier of Medicare right 'cause we've already talked about a and B now we gotta talk about just supplemental you see in the coverage and that's your regular health care companies like Blue Cross Blue Shield your United\nYeah when you're talking about supplemental let's actually to find that so if you are already retired there are a lot of terms for this there's met a gap\nThere supplemental there's parts see\nThere's all of this it's all the same thing if that is super confusing to you and I'm Talking super confusing to give me a call for one Seventy seven to seven to seven once again that's for one Seventy seven to seven twenty seven twenty seven\nWe will walk you through exactly what that means those are just marketing terms for\nThe combined or supplemental or additional from a and B it's see it's just the additional coverage it is Blue Cross like man he was saying it is United it is the ... the ... the you name a company it's out there they're they're trying\nTo sell them all so when it comes down to what plan is right for you there's nine plans out there they're all the same the names are different to protect the the innocent but they're literally the same so when you go buy them find the one that works for you\nBy the services you need not by the alphabetical letter that it that are portrayed you can have a bigger letter doesn't mean it's better for you you know just find the services you need the one thing I think I Want to talk about the supplemental that comes in the office lot\nIs what if I picked the wrong supplemental I Want to address that for a little bit many\nAnd well actually this is a conversation that I was actually having at one of our dedication meetings I I was talking with Wayne and Kathy last week\nAnd as we were sitting down to go through our annual dedication meeting this one was different\nThey were both ready to retire this year Kathy was finally had enough of hospitals ready to lead and so our goals to walk through all the time lines of when they switched from being employed to fully retired and so as we were talking and they can from their retirement date but they didn't seem to be as excited about it I Would have expected\nIt so I turned to them and I said well is everything okay is this something else we need to cover and they looked at each other for a moment ... first she said I'm worried that our medical coverage won't cover is completely and we won't have the money to pay for it\nNow this is a valid fear what caffeine when we're feeling is what all baby boomers go through when they realize they're actually retiring\nOutside of income medical expenses or the number one fear heading into retirement so the easiest way to overcome it is to walk through what do you need for coverage and then lining up to what your income is going to be and so I looked at him and I said I understand what you're going through\nLet's walk through what your coverage will actually be so once you both retire your primary coverage is going to be original Medicare part a and B this'll be directly from your Social Security benefit next will be supplemental coverage and that'll be your Blue Cross a United\nAnd this will fill in what your original Medicare doesn't cover plus your prescriptions and this'll be paid with the income we budgeted from your Social Security benefits and you're I erase because we can pick the plans based on your medical history and your needs we can predict the cost of premiums co pays and deductibles last if there's any out of pocket expenses that we talked about that\nAre planned for we have flexible money to be used so doesn't disrupt your entire income plant\nAs we went through the steps interviewed the original plan I could see Wayne ... relax they were actually able to focus on being excited for retirement\nLook here you could financial services\nWe believe knowing exactly how much you can spend every week and retirement is extremely important that you know without a shadow of doubt how much money you have and that

Fox News the homeland security secretary speaking out\nThe death in the synagogue shooting coming on the heels the mail bomb investigation is something secretary ... Nielsen says cannot stand in this country she says people using free speech is a shield to hurt people is not America\nUm and what's interesting is leading up to I Would say Brett Kavanaugh you\nHad the same type of thing playing out again\nIn this time in favor of the Democrats started to look a lot like two thousand six so up until ... you had sixty three percent of Democrats\nHighest levels of interest in the election Republicans was only fifty three percent so that is a you know a big it's a type of gap that leads you to lose the Senate ... ... and lose the house or at least it makes it possible sins Kavanaugh that has changed\nDemocrats have gone up from sixty three to Seventy two percent holy cow Seventy two is the highest number for any party and all of these elections\nHowever Republicans have jumped a higher percentage point basis from fifty three to sixty eight\nSo now we have a basically a balance\nA very close within the margin of error separation and both of those numbers sixty eight would be the second highest level of interest of all of these elections so the Democrats are Seventy two Republicans are sixty eight both of those numbers are the highest of any of these elections going back to two thousand six ... two thousand six midterms\nUm and I mean which is which is crazy it is a a a ... there's a level here that we don't know what's gonna happen if we this is like you know this is territory that has not been seen before\nAnd ... you know while you can look at the polls and you can see the polls as we've talked about over the past couple of weeks relatively\nAre relatively pointing towards a Republican or a ... victory in the Senate where they maybe pick up a couple of seats and Republican loss in the house where they would lose a couple of states um there is a you know if you wanna look it's kind of be optimistic way of looking at the house right now\nTo show you how close is if Republicans were just sweep the races they are favored in okay that's not it's not going to happen it never happens but just kind of generally for understanding if they were able to sweep all of the races their favorite and\nUh and they revealed a when all of the races that they trailed by one point so all of these races are either victories are toss ups right I mean they could go either way but if they were to sweep all of those Republicans still hold the house at two twenty two Fifteen now the problem is\nThe idea that they're going to sweep all those races is\nWe know that's not going to happen it never happens the other thing is they will win some races where they're underdogs by more than one point they will win some place where there was a down by five in the polls winning some of those races\nSo the split is going to be important here but just that gets them only to two twenty two Fifteen which is a I think they lose that's been losing tens seats from where they are now\nUm but also a very narrow majority to the point where some conservative things could be derailed by just you know your generic moderate house member that you've never heard their name before um when they decide they're going to vote against the president\nSo it's an interesting a way of looking at it\nAnd it shows that this really could go either way I mean when they say that there's about a twenty percent chance the Republicans lose the Senate and about a twenty percent chance that the Republicans when the house\nThat's the way they these models are all kind of looking at it twenty percent is one in five right um so it is very possible that one of these things can happen\nBut right now it looks like those are gonna wind up getting split and then of course still has ... even though you're not gonna be able to pass the Democratic bills because they would either give each other on a train in the house you're still going to have investigative power gonna have subpoena power going to have imposed\nA nightmare it's a nightmare if if they get the house it's a nightmare okay so here's here's what I found interesting in um in watching the news and watching just the flow of it\nHave you noticed that you know places like the Atlantic and the times and the post are now starting to publish stories about\nYou know it's an uphill battle to win some of these races in the house it's an uphill battle they have changed their tone from\nUm you know an absolute positive while we're on a blue wave to now almost laying the foundation of yeah we we lost but it was you know it was really kind of a long shot anyway\nYeah I mean that's how badly I think the Kavanaugh facing a has backfired on them\nI mean it's made the Senate basically I mean again it's just that it's one of the five chance but I mean they had they had a better chance of this uh two months ago I mean they had a legitimate path to victory when Cruz was only up by three points all of these races that look like leaning Republican we're all toss up and some of them looked like they might be leaning Democrat\nThey had a chance to win the Senate before the Kavanaugh saying now I mean I think it's real I realized that income\n... to the independent power the independence feeling\nAt the ... in an interesting group because they're not as passionate as you would expect in this environment so independence in two thousand six and two thousand ten where at fifty percent\nIndependents are almost always going to be lower in high interest in partisans because partisans engage more like generally I'm the type of course a blanket robots typical um and she doesn't fourteen it was down to forty percent and two thousand eight or Eighteen up until Kavanaugh was forty two percent\nAnd then uh the jump now to forty six percent so still that's not as high as some of the earlier elections among independents and that may just be because they're overwhelmed with him and they don't they don't like either side and they just want to make them want to withdraw from\nPolio but I Wonder 'cause I Would consider myself an independent yeah and there's no way you're going to keep me away from the polls and so I'm Wondering you know would that four percent jump\nWas it a ... percent effort to preserve four percent jump I'm I Wonder how much of that or people like me who are going to vote for the Republican\nJust because the left has gone insane\nRight and there's a lot of independents that I that I mean I certainly would fall into this category as well right I Am not registered member of any party nor will I ever the tire lifelike was that being said uh you know I vote Republican\nI mean I you know don't vote for Democrats [laughter] so I mean for Republicans independents and libertarians libertarians they do vote for Democrats but yeah I mean so that's never going to happen so the fact that I'm an independent you can't look at that line as\nThese are people who could go either way at any time between these two parties that's not what that is right people who identify that way it's a group that's ... that's growing and has been growing for quite some time yes people are bailing out of the parties [laughter] um but the parties themselves are becoming\nA more rigid in Enron were\nCould come down to the independents mhm this one could come down to because you can understand the Republicans going up you can understand if you're on the Democratic side Kavanaugh driving all those people but what's driving the independent ... yeah ...\nI mean I Would think they are discussed with what's going on right [laughter] if anything or they don't like the overall system there's one other interesting ... standing here Glenn if we could yeah I'm as we're talking about the caravan of of uh immigrants coming migrants whatever\n... which will will be illegal immigrants if they if they get all the way up by the way who who said that was coming uh\nOh yeah this this burger yeah definitely we talked about ... about ... a lot about this uh interesting to see the numbers among Latino voters\nSo ah in two thousand six were coming off of the attempt at comprehensive immigration reform that fails ... Republicans very upset about that Democrats win that election relatively easily um a Latino at sixty two percent high interest in the election\nThat number in mid term elections has been dismal since ... in two thousand ten was like forty eight percent she doesn't fourteen it was forty one percent very low or in two thousand uh Eighteen up until very recently or was it was at forty seven percent that number has now jumped\nIn October of two dozen ... Seventy one percent from forty seven to Seventy one\nAnd I have no doubt that the prince was behind it okay that has no bearing on who she was we can say that\nThis was a despicable horrible crime done by the Saudis and their horrible people for X Y Z\nAnd we can say ... did not deserve to die this way nobody deserves to die that that way however\nShe's not the guy that everybody in the press is making him out to be he's not some freedom loving guy\nHe's a member of the Muslim Brotherhood\nIs the Muslim Brotherhood that he was pushing for was an Islamic\nState he wants an Islamic state in his own writing in the Washington Post says yeah we have to have a in Islam assist rule\nIf you dismiss as Islam is his rule under surreal law then you'll never have peace in the middle east well\nWait a minute I'm not against Islam I Am against Islamic rule\nSharia law tell me where it's working out show to me where is that working out where is it protecting human rights\nNo thank you I mean\nIslamic rule just by none other group of Islam is is what you have in Saudi Arabia no thank you\nI'm going to give some of the facts of of this guy and it's not a conspiracy\nThere was a conspiracy to commit murder to hide it\nAnd we have found is that\nNow America needs some adults in the room to say okay that's a separate issue\nBut let's not paint\n... into some freedom loving friends because\nNews radio nine twenty and one ...\nThree years ago making a murderer became led to a TV show than a\nForce of nature and the it uncovered a grave injustice in the criminal justice and it was also completely dishonest and I would know I'm Dan O'Donnell I covered this ... and Brendan daffy trials and now they're making a murderer is back I Am too with part two of rebuilding America reminding\nA murderer is now on the ...

with you however our politicians are becoming more and more extreme especially on the left\nThey are you know they're they are anti capitalist they are\nThey're anti constitution so you know you used the one hand I agree with you we can't be you know all about politics but at what point do you see good people say\nEnough is enough and I can't take this anymore\nYeah but then to what end ... what do we do next because what we don't want to do next is what the weirdos did a to Nancy\nPelosi and California how are you know where does did to Mitch McConnell and Elaine Chao in Kentucky exactly

they're\nDoing that I I'm In I'm In the middle of a little downtown to sort of restored downtown in Omaha right now\nAnd uh there's no end to fire here and yet we got a whole bunch of people who might be obsessed with thinking about ... today when I think we we need to be aware of this sort of media ecology in which we live so in the Nineteen fifties sixty eight percent of Americans\nAny given week we're watching I Love Lucy so that it was sixty percent of households that met an ... basically Ninety nine percent of households knew what Lucy and does he had done that week it was an important content but it was shared content\nThere was an American way when you fought with somebody about some project at work or if you disagreed with them about politics um you could still talk about things that we had in common what's happening now and why I wrote this book of them is because there is no we right now\nAnd they're the most watched cable news programming a Sean Hannity is number one and Rachel Maddow is often number two they're still\nReally only one point one percent and nine tenths of one percent of the public and so our world is so fragmented and fractured that I think it's really important to not consume our media as if the people like and to her do who are doing this to hope for a viral collapse I think part of what healthy Americans should\nDo is ignoring them [noise]\nSo what he is are are we I mean I've spent\nThe last two years and the things that I can I continually come back to every single time\nIs the bill of rights it's why people came here because they were protected they knew that they had the right to dream and create and be left alone yeah yeah is that our our ... or ...\nSo yes ... or ... soon I'm Out of the many one right we don't have a whole bunch of one right now we don't have a shared sense of what you've just said the first amendment is the beating heart of the American experiment freedom of religion freedom of the press\nFreedom of assembly freedom of speech right of protest all of those things flow from a fundamental assumption about the\nDignity of three hundred and twenty million Americans which is we believe a ... day we believe that our citizens are\nCreated in the image of God with eternal souls and with dignity that way bigger than their policy preferences and so what's unique in our moment I think the grand tension that we as a people are not really wrestling through that is so far upstream from politics is this tension between rudeness\nAnd ruthlessness almost all of the happiness literature a few well out there is confirming stuff that wise people people who've had grandparents have known for millennia\nWhich is that happiness is actually a relatively simple equation do you have a nuclear family\nDo you have a couple of deep friendships or do you have a local worshipping community do you have a theological framework to make sense of death and suffering and forests and statistically the number one driver of happiness is do you have meaningful vocation do you have shared work do you have co workers do you think when you leave home on Monday morning\nWhen you go to do something not to make a lot of money or do you have a lot of status but\nIs there some neighbor who benefits from what I Do if\nThose four things are true or even if three of the four true you're pretty likely to be happy and that those things are all tied to rudeness but\nWe're living through a technological revolution that's tempting us to believe\nThat we can be ruthless we can be place less and so a lot of what's happening is the undermining of local community\nAnd the undermining of stick relationships and the undermining of vocation or long work um ends up in a world where a lot of people are using political tribalism to fill a void of the loneliness that's actually happening in their local community I think we need to reflect more deeply on that challenge of our time\nAll right so I'm going to take a quick break and
