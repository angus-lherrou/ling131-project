talk to the gym or you're going to talk to Bob you're going to talk to a broker in the employer has to send paperwork to them so they have to sign off on it\nThose are what we call hurdles and they're designed to withdraw or slow down the process not to hurt you but\nTo say is is really necessary in sometimes to put walls up to say no it's not available\nIt's there as a protection peace for you to be able to stop and say okay is this really the right thing for me is this and my best interests and so you do have to jump through some hoops to make sure that is the right thing for you and this is why you should always initiate a roll over with the financial professional like us here you could financial services it make sure that we can get you through the paper work properly\nAnd make sure the right choice for you\nYeah a hundred percent when you talk about a roll over though I don't want to make it sound scary\nRollovers are free so it doesn't matter what company use or how it works the roll over itself the active rolling over is free and that's that's a federal thing so the IRS put it all together so if you go from four one K. or any employer plan\nTo an IRA it's free the act of rolling it over findings punish should not charge you for this financial advisors should not charge you just it's an act\nOf moving it to a individual retirement account\nAnd I think the key take away from this is the rover from an old employer plan whether it's a four one K. or something else is natural it's part of the process of leaving her company whether you're going from one company to another or going from your final company to retirement through over crosses self as natural as part of the distribution\nBecause without it you can't create a stable spending ... in retirement 'cause you need to be able to know how much you can or will be able to spend every\nSingle week and retirement without a shadow of a doubt that you actually have\nEnough money to last no matter how long you live and these are questions that you have\nTo get the answers to before you retire while there's still time to prepare and make sure that your money last as long as your retirement does now with the New York you could financial services is giving away customize written income report just for you we have three more of these reports\nLeft so take advantage of this offer now this plan works best for those are within five years of retiring at our at least fifty five years old who are ready to be ready for retirement so be one of the next three callers right now it for one\nSeventy seven to seven to seven that's four zero one Seventy seven twenty seven twenty seven\nNow many this show is all about the life cycle of four one K. you start to save you put money in the four one K. you build up this war chest right you have this asset for retirement the idea is that you're saving for retirement everybody understands that there is no joke and that\nIs every bit of literature I'm almost positive it's an every child book it's their mother goose word about the mother goose wrote about it and some of the group fairy tale of retirement everybody gets a yacht and so\nNow you have your ... your role it to an IRA why is it that way why do I have to rule it to an IRA or individual retirement account\nThe IRS isn't doing it as a trick it's because it's the distribution model if you don't roll it over you still have to distribute it but now you have to take a hundred percent of it you have to take a large check if you roll it to an IRA you can take it in small bits if you get to a certain age bracket say Seventy and a half\n... diets are now highlighting now you have to talk about taking a required minimum distribution if you ever written that down grab you couldn't do books write it down because this is a really important thing there is a huge penalty if you don't take it at seven and a half maximum to be real easy to understand\nIf you do the life cycle four one K. roll over to an IRA irate to distribution if you do that rollovers cycle if you do that for one case cycle much much easier to understand requirement distributions baby boomers get really really nervous about requirement distributions you have to take them at seven in ...\nWhy don't we start talking about taking them earlier than that\nI'm actually really glad you brought that up because when you say require minimum distribution in my mind I hear income is just another way of saying income because when you were sitting in your four one K. and then move into an IRA it was because at some point in time in your life you were going to retire and then you were going to start taking money out of it\nBecause well you needed it because you're no longer working now\nIf you're having trouble

justice system is taking over you've lost control of that again and that that also can be reached traumatizing\nElizabeth why do so many victims blame themselves\nWell we we are in this longstanding culture of sort of blaming the victim and unfortunately victims noted that since so there's a deep amount of shame often you know ... people were in a position I'm not often that sometimes there somewhere or they feel that they they did something wrong\nI went to that party I had too many drinks I walked down the street that with dark or they should be things that anybody can do and still be

if that person is a friend of relatives and pulling it like that does that make it that much more complicated\nYeah especially for young people you're on a college campus are high school you see this

also scared of being ostracized ostracized so uh you know will people again in this victim blaming society will people say that you know you you should be quiet and here's the thing I'm there's

going on I was really in the seventies that people saw that Ethiopian famine I went to India for the first time when I was Nineteen years old and Nineteen eighty three is starving children it was ghastly\nFrom Nineteen Seventy until two eighty percent of the world's poverty has been eradicated starvation level poverty has been ever advocate no Seventy percent of Americans actually think that poverty is getting worse and the reason is because it's never\nLike front page and the New York times or any of the newspaper millions saved from poverty I mean that's not\nA news story you only see the things that are going wrong but the truth is two billion of our brothers and sisters have been pulled out of starvation or poverty Glenn since you and our kids and there was one thing that did that and that was democratic capitalism and that is America's export to the world\nThere I don't think you would disagree with me Arthur um that we are not using the first task of wealth of nations moral sentiments we are we uh we have we think that capitalism is just going to be good no matter\nYou know who's wielding it and and it's just going to produce wonderful things no it as Adam Smith lines out it can produce really bad things as well capitalism depends on the people who are ... are wielding it but also uh depends on on what our goals are\nYeah slow and it's got wrapped now would you agree with that\nYeah that's well that's the problem is is not capitalism a lot of all we see today wired deals cronyism all the special stuff that's going on with powerful people in Washington D. C. and in every state Capitol around the country\nThat's actually not competition that's trying to shut competition down on behalf of powerful people [laughter] so so competition is good competition politics and economics and then the competition of ideas the fact is that\nYou know the ... the Glenn Beck show is part of the competition of ideas and a free and democratic nation barrier important [noise] anybody wants to shut down competition on behalf of powerful people\nIs not a competitor doesn't believe in capitalism doesn't believe in democracy and doesn't believe in the free exchange of ideas to compete means to do it better than the other guy\nBarely peacefully and respectfully and to win over an audience and ... that's really what we ought to be doing and that's what we're moving away from\nOkay so Arthur I'm gonna take a quick break and I want to come back with a question that I cannot find a satisfactory answer on I Am a big believer in capitalism however there throughout history\nSome people like Vanderbilt et cetera et cetera they get so much money they have so much power\nThat they are controlling things and it it just seems to spiral out of control when you have you know a just a lock on this wealth and we are creating people through Google et cetera et cetera that are doing the same thing how do you balance the power how do you\nHow do you make sure who's who can compete against Google how are you going to do that how does that work when you get to that point to that like to hear your answer on that when we come back\n[noise]\nClaiming\nWeekdays at five thirty Easter join us for a brand new program were fired\nEver wonder why we choose the stories we want to hear why not just the way that important for why he just got the thing that the mainstream media won't touch it was like it's your lucky day\n...

you're gonna find that there is a system of preferences for legacies [laughter] you know if you went to university so your four or five times more likely that your kid is going to get into that great university which all it is it's just saying you got into the lucky genetics club\nYou know that's that's actually not compatible with with a system of American opportunity with a system of equal dignity of experience so so that's actually what we need to be thinking about don't worry about Google\nWere a lot more about the fact that people at the periphery of the bottom of our society can't try is today that's that's really an American\nThing and why can't they rise\nThey can't rise because we have a discriminatory system of unequal education poor kids are locked into public education systems are parents who don't have choices number one number two\nIs we don't have skills training in our communities we tell people that if they don't go to college there is some al losers [laughter] we don't have a vocational and technical education systems which are the ultimate education reform we don't have an apprenticeship system in this country and most importantly glad we don't culturally value\nThe skills that come from actually not going to college where people actually work skills where they can get when they can get ahead if we do those things we can really recreate the opportunity society\nHow did The Apprentice system go away\n[noise] but in a way for a bunch of different reasons but part of it had to do with the fact that you know back in the Nineteen ... until the Nineteen sixties there was a parallel tracking system in America\nWhere white kids would be tracked toward college and black kids especially in the south will be tracked toward the trades and and you and I know that one of the great advances in American society was the civil rights movement where we did away with stuff like that unfortunately there were some things are we threw the baby out with the bathwater\nWhite kids black kids every kind of kid should have the opportunity\nTo succeed through hard work and skills and personal initiative without going to college\nAmazing or there but it's it's that the early I think of apprenticeships that I think you know you're going back to\nCharles Dickens times since we've seen is amazing that those that had really disappeared in the sixties and

join us ... tickets Glenn Beck dot com slash to her okay back with a Arthur C Brooks he's the president of the American Enterprise Institute\nArthur though the ... who is we're talking about is this system even worth saving yesterday in politics it was a nightmare and people are just turned off by it and I think they just don't want anything to do with it\nUm on both sides of the aisle I think anybody who is is a rational human being is like this is this is not good and none of this is good\nUm however ... we're not having any one stand up for the bill of rights the constitution that's why politics has gone awry 'cause we've deep ... you know unpaid from that\nCapitalism is is got a horrible name you now have fifty percent of young voters saying you know socialism is great I Want what they have over in Sweden but that's not what they have in Sweden isn't\nNo it isn't and and by the way there are some people standing up for the polarized by constitution guys like Glenn Beck and when you got a major megaphone and you're standing up for what's right and ... good [laughter]\nThe big problem is that are too many people in the media and politics and entertainment and aren't polls campus shows on the right and the left or orchard dining out on the fact that we have a culture of contempt in this country contempt for each other\nI mean when you and I we both have and everybody listening to us we love people who disagree with us politically out\nFine that's a good thing I mean we all should have friends and and people that we love we just have to agree with them we should disagree strongly but we don't have to hate it when there are people that are making money and getting famous and getting powerful by trying to get us to hate each other even more we should be talking about these good things that you talk about the things that really bring us together\nAnd then try to disagree in a way that the competition can actually\nConvince other people persuade other people of our ideas but that's the big problem right now too many people are getting too rich by by getting us to hate our neighbors and that's not right\nSo Arthur let's have let's have the conversation I'm I'm somebody in college and I say capitalism is evil and you know there's nothing wrong with socialism socialism is graded works in the Netherlands\nYeah I Know so I hear I hear it all the time we saw him on college campuses all the time that way not to take that on is by trying to create liberal tears that's the wrong way to do it is to attack somebody's motive and to say that their belief system is stupid\nThat will you can never ever ever insult somebody into agreement and by the way it's an immoral thing to do because these are your brothers and sisters as well\nThe key thing to start off with an any argument is to acknowledge the objective a moral objection to the people is to is to give voice to the fact that you you want these up social systems 'cause you want something more poor\nPoor people have more equality where people have more opportunity right\nAnd get people to say yeah yeah yeah okay well let's figure out the best possible way to do it and then make the positive case for capitalism and democracy and free enterprise and entrepreneurship because it was lifted more people out of poverty in any system in human history\nIt's created a system of of equal opportunity that nobody has ever thought of in the history of humanity and say\nAnd now the problem is not that\nThis is unequal but ... we haven't actually tried to make it as equal as possible and push it all the way out to the periphery of society let's do that together\nCan you give the arguments because most I think even most conservatives fold on the the Netherlands or Sweden when people say I want socialism like Sweden can you describe what that is\nArthur Brooks thank you so much for being on the program we have to have you on more often you are\nA well spoken well thought out full

[noise] ...\nAnd the Glenn Beck command All right we have a background check Trump is just a okay the expansion of the FBI background check on Kevin ... which again I'm\nSo we have that going for us uh and they were really I mean let's be honest it's important\nThat someone who is going to be wielding a lot of power especially where the law is concerned all yes we we look at every single accusation because the worst thing that could happen is you know she gets in and he's a judge and he is you know looking at some case before him\nAnd he himself was a serial rapist\nOh thank you and it's up in the area important it's so important very important if you're abusive to women you should certainly not hold a rule\nThat really closely to law enforcement doesn't make any sense right right right like judge or or ah or I'm a attorney general general attorney general would where'd you go one yeah yeah it's a great point and I'm Glad you brought that up because there's a certain candidate\nWho's running for Minnesota attorney general really who's been a a credibly accused\nOr by a woman or he was dating now there's an interesting there's a little bit of a separation and we should be fair on this there's a separation between the capital case in the house in case\nOf the cabinet case happens ah thirty six years ago the also the case was pretty much ongoing until very recently okay okay All right so there's a difference but I saw in different bug a professor Ford she had a spotty memory\nIssued a very spotty memory now the uh the accuser um who we know now remember with Ford we have no even fence that there was a relationship of any sort between ... and ... we do know that a long term girlfriend of Keith Ellison has accused him of sexual abuse\nOr ... violin okay oh okay that really got both of those little do you remember where they happened uh you know she does remember when they happen okay does\nShe ... she probably doesn't have notes from her doctor ... you know from the when she was talking to her doctor when the doctor gets it wrong of\nCourse well yeah in their words case they both have a note from there do they get around those cases you have the the forward case was something that was a Thirty years after the incident in which she referred to an attack by four people which is different than the story that she's telling now or never named Kevin ...\nThe notes from uh the uh Alison teeth Allison's I'm a former girlfriend's a doctor and June name Keith Ellison as the reason why she's getting medical attention for physical injuries um and that kind of a difference to you might you might notice the slight distinction between those two things one\nHas notes or the don't ask don't actually named the accuser and it was you know many many many many many many years before and this is I'm going to the doctor to get medical treatment because this guy you though using meeting me\nYeah and so she and you know and and one one one case you have a woman who has photos of the incident and has photos of bruising on her the other one of course does not\nUm being forced she doesn't have that now there are there's a witness situation we need to deal with the of course I'm a Ford has name several people who were at the parties none of them can remember it happening then people forward named\nCannot say that they were actually at the party some of them have said I was not there some of them that I don't remember any party like that so there's a wide wide berth there between two opinions but she has named witnesses just none of them have corroborate is your story in any way\nOr the dolphins a girlfriend has also a named sources those people say the exact same thing and say they've seen evidence of the actual a crime going down um including things like tax um writings um pictures\nAnd those are things that she showed two co workers in real time real\nTime and had several people she told about it at the moment and again we have no one that forward told about it at the moment in fact in any moment of until at least two thousand twelve where it does not appear she actually he advised Kavanaugh said the name Kavanaugh even at that\nTime but by the ... and I mean you I mean you don't have video tape ...\nTape now we haven't seen it yet though are now there is allegedly videotape that exist some one of these physical altercation we ... we have not seen it yet I'm\nOf course there's no video of the Kavanaugh thing because you know that wouldn't be the thing\nThat we have to take her word that there is video with the with ...\nAnd we don't have that evidence yeah we we have a a ton of evidence and in fact\nI don't know hundreds of times more there's really no evidence and the four case so we I mean like we have them out more we have a preponderance of evidence in in the Alison case", "show_name": "Pawsox Baseball", "year": "2018", "city": "Providence", "day": "07"}
