{"month": "10", "state": "RI", "station": "WHJJ", "content": "Cash flow when it comes to money in cash flow when it comes to pooling of that money work the same way so if you were trying to get two or three or ... factory so it gets going for one Seventy seven to seven to seven four oh one Seventy seven twenty seven twenty seven\nMan a Josh when it comes to talking about the three rules of money and getting all your cash on accounts in order I find that once you get them in that\nPerfect mix it's just that peace will easy feeling going forward and so we definitely want to make sure that we get the banking world the marsh oiled and insurance world on the table today\nYeah we're definitely do when we when we stepped out we talked about three three one and five five twenty three three one is a very very very important concept is this your cholesterol number well it's your retirement number and so when you talk about banking emergency fund\nAnd rate of ... or storage house my income coming out of my IRAs how's my income coming into my pension has my income coming in to buy new id how is that happening that is the three three one so you have to understand or know your equation number do I have three times my bills\nPulling up because that sets my rate\nOf neat how deep is my pool do I have a five foot pool do I have a twenty five foot pool or do I have a three foot pool how deep is my pool\nHow deep or how many months do I have in reserve in checking in savings only\nThat is an amazing concept that people assume they have a handle on it is the number one reason people give away stickers at Walmart it's the number one reason that people die with a ton of money and never go on vacation they stop going out to eat they rack up credit card bills\nBecause they don't know how deep their pool is but yet they bought a brand new diving board but they're too afraid to die because they don't know if they have a twenty five foot pool or a three inch pool these are amazing things to get your mind around\nYeah Josh when you're talking about that point I or the idea of pulling cash and the idea that your your income is that flow rate\nYour flurry shouldn't match just what you're going to spend every month they should be a little bit extra in there because life is going to get in the way so that you can maintain that three that that number three in your pool but it gives you the ability to increase if you need to to that max level of five\nWell I I actually have a different opinion on that so I think your your flow rate should be right at\nReplenishment rate because you should use your emergency fund for distribution of life gets in the way not your storage money or your pool of money\nAnd your cars you're going to splash the kids jumping the pool to swim around the splash it all out when you're out there but when your friends are over and you guys are just lounging and kind of doing it it's it's only the amount that you're going to stick on your bathing suits and get out in real life\nYeah if we have too much money going out we stopped going out to dinner\nAnd we do it for a week we don't do it for a month we do it once or twice we stop going out to eat we\nRethink that vacation maybe we don't need to take the Learjet we can take coach\nAnd that's how we adjust internally so flow rate if we set at a constant works really well it's the distribution of where do we take our money yeah so when when we start to overspend on credit cards in debt we don't go to emergency funds we take it right out of our checking in savings\nYou should be selling it from your stock accounts your brokerage is the stock market is where that is coming from but people get this weird heartburn and they say well that's that's protecting gets inflation that's guaranteeing my income that's\nDoing lives is what it's doing 'cause if you if that really is true in your world end you're protecting your income with the stock market remember the stock market sometimes goes down\nAnd remember the beginning point of any retirement plan is to create a stable foundation to maximize your retirement income Ina predictable fashion\nSo start so the starting point is to optimize your Social Security benefits because at face value usually tens of thousands of dollars on the table but by employing a few little known strategies it's actually possible to generate as much as a hundred thousand dollars or more an additional lifetime income what does give you a complimentary\n... so you can see how maximizing your retirement income could impact your overall retirement\nTo get your customize written income plan you must be at least fifty five years old and be ready to be ready for retirement be one of the first three callers right now at four zero one seven to seven to seven to seven that's four zero one seven to seven twenty seven twenty seven to let your retirement\nBecome mediocre yeah when you're talking about flow rates I think that's where we get really turned around so slow rates come out of your storage kept storage is that pump it's the most complicated\nBecause everybody thinks they understand it but think about it like a well\nIf you have a well at your house and most of us are in sewers we don't think about this new more but if you're out in well south county or wherever you're at and you have a well you can pump that thing dry\nAnd if you pump that dry you haven't real problems 'cause you burned out you're up to ...\nOr you have to wait because you can only have so much water per day you've got a little replenish\nThis is storage so what you want to do is make sure that your reservoir tank or your stored money is your largest pool of money so that you never run out of it is also growing that's where you're fighting inflation that's where you're fighting all these things but it's isolated\nFrom your daily spend at your\nThat's your checking in savings and stock accounts\nSo that's why there is a hard line on the right hand side that says everything to the left of this is in that taxable pool capital gain pool everything to the right of that line is\nIncome yeah it's a slow it's their only to be designed so that's where your arm D's or that's where your pensions or that's where your Social Security is that's where all of those I don't know IRAs four oh one case annuities you name it that's in there\nThat's for flow and then you set that rate to be replenishing knocked over Phil\nBecause if you're over feeling you're paying taxes because you have waste because at a certain point when you go on vacation fuel your garden hose in your pool at a certain point if nobody splashing round near your garden hoses gonna overflow or your pool is going to overflow in the garden and it's going to run

least twenty two states and just a decade ago that number was about a hundred and twenty school districts so it's really growing it's getting more and more popular and it you know it's been really on the western side of the map but now it's going east\nWhy has it been mostly in the western part of the state so far\nYou know I Know that's a really good question and where I'm from just talking to different educators it looks like it's more of a geographical situation there where you have\nYou know more district spread out more rural districts because this is something that started in rural districts in is still very dominant erode districts and um there's just a lot of lot more rural districts out west\nSo now why did the rural districts decide to go to the four day week\nIt all goes to saving money and when you're in a rural district and you're really spread out east you can spend a good chunk of your budget on transportation because everybody's really spread out\nAnd I'm so initially it's always about saving money and then they started noticing other benefits like wow you know teachers are really attracted to having a three day weekend despite what recruiting and some of the rural areas sometimes it's hard to recruit teachers out there\nI also saw one of the benefits and your story as you were absences that would be a huge one\nYes and that's it now they're unexpected benefits that some of these districts initially going into it to save money or is that while you know what it really does help for the kids to get three day weekends and you know they're showing up in the same thing with teachers you know their notice and fewer teacher apps and says\nWe're speaking with turnout hubs or the wall Street Journal now if you're a shrinking the week to four days do you add hours to the other days\nYes that's what they're doing there at an hours\nAnd you know and some of these districts they had already met the minimum uh required hours for instruction\nSo you know they might add anywhere from Fifteen minutes a day to Ninety minutes a day it just depends on where they were at when they started when they when they were all five days if they were already exceeded the hours there is just\nBasically add in time at the end of that day\nNow does each state decide its own hours and ... days I Know here in New Jersey kids have to be in school a certain number of days not ours\n[laughter] yes and and exactly and that I'm\n... and it's easier for states and Iran each state does decide you know how many hours kids are going to be in school and I noticed that the states that have the four days are those states that basically look at ours they don't care\nYou know how many days you're in school they just want you you know the the you know to be in a school for the year for a thousand eighty hours or whatever and there are some states that still\nDo base it on how many days you're in school and those are the states that it's a bit harder to go to for a day on those states because they look at days instead of ours [laughter] the ones that look at ours has you know we don't care what your schedule is just make sure your kids you know\nHave this many hours of instruction for the year\nI Would think that there would be some opposition to this plan from parents who have to scramble around to find care for their kid on that and the day\n[laughter] yeah and that's always the big issue daycare daycare on that day and what I found is a lot of these districts that go to a four day\nSo if if you know if it was made legal at the federal level you know you

human hand do you know and everyone knows humans are kind of an adult when\nPeople are you yeah of course but when people are using it turns out my research shows that the research shows when people are using something like a Google Search engine\nThey turn off the bias detectors they automatically become very trusting 'cause I think this is an algorithm not that they know what an algorithm is but this is an algorithm I can trust subjective an impartial so that when Google Answers your question about anything\nUh what what tends to happen is if people trust sweats higher up in the list they think the the algorithm has very carefully and objectively selected and it must be true so if you favor one candidate\nOr one cause or one company or whatever it may be one product in search results\nUh people tend to believe whatsoever closest to the top and and what I showed in in a series of randomized controlled experiments of it and that we've now done with for national elections involving no\nMore than ten thousand people [noise] uh I've shown over and over and over and over again that by favoring one candidate you can shift in a country like ours millions of votes with no one having the slightest idea\nThat they are being manipulated and without leaving a paper trail for authorities to track\nYou know that is scary\nIt is you um you leave this out in the in the creepy line I'm about how\nGoogle has really stripped itself a bowl ads and everything else so it it looks totally clean and neutral and without an agenda\n[noise] um and then uh uh uh how they have ... you know the\n... when you first did it I think one of the tests you did you did it where\nYou were you were clear with an agenda then you added one that might go in the other direction and then you added to search results of that would go in the other direction and you got it to a point to where Google is to where you don't have any idea you're being manipulated\nCorrect absolutely no idea of someone we we did this in a national study in the last almost no one was aware\nThat they were seeing biased or a search result socialist favor one candidate that this really creepy thing there was that the very very few people who could spot the bias they shifted even farther in the direction of the bias so you know being able to spot the bias does not protect you\nUh we did a a big national study in India right in the middle of their election there in two thousand fourteen Ninety nine point five percent of people in the study or could see no bias whatsoever they couldn't see the favoritism uh and and and yet we're still getting these big chefs\nAre in their voting preferences so you know this is this is unprecedented in human history this is this is just this is an ability\nTo shift people's thinking and behavior worldwide it's not just in the U. S. because Google is is you know use a ... you know Ninety percent of all searches conducted throughout the world\nUh you know and and it was they have the ability to shift people's thinking behavior votes purchases attitudes beliefs or around the world they are doing so twenty four seven with out people knowing and\nWithout leaving a paper trail because when you're showing something someone search results I felt like a news story than just stays there for people to look at it's generated just for you on the fly at that moment disappears gone forever stored now where\n\nWould you is it an overstatement to say whether it's um you know Wilson and Bernays a in World War one or or uh you know ... ... World War two that\nThis is the this is the system that they would have dreamt of per propaganda [noise] [noise]\nOh and this goes beyond their wildest dreams or because it's not just the search results I just published a big article\nA called a can of ways big tech can shift\nMillions of votes in the November elections without anyone knowing now that was the one we're talking about which is called the search engine manipulation of factors seem FEMA that's just one of ten ways uh that I've identified over the years in that I've been studying I'm studying seven of them at the moment\nAh that these big tech companies have to shift votes and that are unprecedented in human history they've never existed before\nUh and they they they're I mean some of these effects so that that I've discovered are among the biggest ever discovered in the behavioral science\nAs I read years\nAnd there is no doubt in your mind that Google is engaging in this\nWell into thousands sixteen early two thousand sixteen uh working in secret\nUh I developed a system for actually monitoring what people were seeing while they were using the Google bang and Yahoo search engines that was the election related so it's as if we were looking over people's shoulders it's called the monitoring system itself was a first ever\nCreated and so we actually monitor for more than five months before the election in November two thousand sixteen [noise]\nUh and we found a systematic bias in search results favoring Hillary Clinton whom I favored by the way as you mention\nA in all can search positions on the first page of search results now that's that's pretty blatant that's pretty extreme flowers these leaks these leaks that we've seen recently from Google\nA you know they're they're they count as you know that yeah people at Google will have a very strong political preferences and that they act on them and uh I don't think we should be surprised\nThat we found that and of course now I'm working with with business partners and academic colleagues on three continents to try to scale up monitoring systems like that so for the first time actually be able to see what these companies are showing people all throughout the U.S and ultimately throughout the\nWorld and will will I think be able to make these companies accountable to the public at some point uh you know Irish we well I Wish we could be fully up and running\nAnd time for the midterms and uh at this point I'd say that's not going to happen but we will definitely be there for for twenty twenty and beyond and and we're looking at more than elections because it's there there are lots of ways in which these companies are playing with us\nOr that people are just completely unaware of and speaking of which\nGlenn\nIn

have the search suggestion effect now target messaging affect\nWhat is the\nTargeting charts the shura targeted messaging T Emmy we call that is a these are all things that we study and that where you were\nYou know were quantifying and you know very precisely a targeted messing effect is really scary this this means that if a company that's primarily be Facebook but other companies to but if a company like Facebook on election day so let's go back to November\nTwo thousand sixteen is is that morning mark sucker bird\nHad chosen to just you know hit the anarchy and send out go out and vote reminders uh mainly just supporters of Hillary Clinton\nOr exclusively either way first of all no one would know that that was even occurring no one would know it was going to some people and not others\nBut if it went justice supporters of Hillary Clinton that would have given her that day and it ... or a hundred and fifty thousand votes now gosh I don't I don't think he did that because you know he\nWas very over confident or you know as as we're Democrats or I'm not a Democrat or not\nI'm I'm a ... a moderate and independent but at the point is everyone thought Hillary was going to win so I'm pretty sure he didn't do that uh but the point is we know from Facebook's own published data that that just sending out that kind of reminders selectively\nDramatically dramatically shifts boats and think about it no one knows if it's something like that is happening in fact if it's happening every single day there there were targeted messages going out to some people but not others\nAnd of course isn't what targeted advertising is all about but she targeted advertising though it's competitive but I'm Talking about what happens if the platform its shelves does something

access journals that as apparently fairly low are very low um reviews standards and so it didn't prove what we wanted to prove or didn't even really offer good evidence for what we're looking at\nIt was we learned or fun fun right hum he misses don't exist but they called it\nAll of our problems anyway right [laughter] that\nUm but yeah so we learned our lesson when we took the criticism we got from that to heart ...\nUh it was fun but it didn't work people criticized us I think fairly pointed out where we were weak by using these journals and instead we committed to a few things going into this new project one is that we would not use\nPaid published journals in any sense a secondly and by the way they don't charge like a hundred dollar they charge a couple of thousand ... ... it's really kind of a financial racket going on there it's the big problem and I hope people continue to address\nA secondly we decided that um we would use the highest ranks journals within the disciplines that we're examining that we could get into so we would start at the best journal way could find for what we were doing and then work our way down at that one didn't take it would go to the next one\nAnd then thirdly we committed to being transparent about her results no matter what happens so if our if we had gone crash and burn complete failure then um [noise]\nThat would have would have been what we report it I don't think it would have gotten much attention but we would have come out and it made it that we were wrong but it's it's not what happened um and uh early on in the process not just to keep us honest because I think we would have kept our promise\nBut early on in the process we ended up in contact with a documentary filmmaker who is interested in this stuff already but he's been recording us for a year his name's Mike ... ... and it's since he's been recording us I mean clearly whatever happened is going to come out so there it is\nOK so before we take a break a and get into what you actually got published I'm telling you about the work behind it just took a year to do what kind of time or are you looking at\nAll the easiest kind of look at what this is\nI had exactly five social outings between Thanksgiving and when uh the project came out to the public eye took may be that many days off including weekends I work probably eighty to Ninety hours a week almost every week um my two collaborators worked\nAlso very very hard I'm Peter put in at least a fulltime job Helen did most of the same time you talk to hell and the other day yeah\nUh so this was in in in the men's amount of work it required learning these field very quickly writing academic papers a typical academic all published a couple a year maybe if they're working hard\nAnd we wrote twenty\nA holy cow\nYeah it's a lot of work there was an insane amount of work and these are all fields we have no expertise and know Helen has a little bit of background in some of this\nBut this was primarily having to learn this material on the fly with no education with no teachers instructing us are only feedback was how our papers fared and the peer review process and then reading what was out there to try to emulate it\nAnd so what does what does having something published in one of the the magazines mean what does it mean to the author and to the educational community\nSo for the author it is the absolute pinnacle of what an academic is trying to do and the research side of their career is to get papers published in well established journals are for example I pay ... is one of the journals we got a paper and and I paid ... is a\nFeminist philosophy journal was probably the highest standing so it would carry a lot of weight looking at the academic community that that scholars embedded in so they could take that to their university and say hey I got this many papers published\nIf people are being considered her tenure there is a research component to that depends on how the the school wants to do their tenure in protest but typically seven papers spanning seven to ten years is considered the ... the basic research requirement to be qualified for tenure\nUm our paper spanned\nThe ones we wrote spend Fifteen some disciplines of thought the ones that got accepted spanned seven [noise] and so we've got big journals we've got seven disciplines papers got into we probably would have had more how do we not been a short\nSo there's you at the un who you are at twelve in the pipeline that looked like they would be published and then this came out and so you you hold those but you might have had as many as twelve\nI think honestly we had fourteen that weren't dead yet and I can say with some confidence I think twelve would have gotten in and possibly possibly Thirteen so I Would guess was pretty good confidence that somewhere between eleven Thirteen would have gotten in in the end we not gotten old\nOkay so when we come back we will go into and remember we're on we're on\nPublic airwaves so [laughter] so are as careful as we can to to discuss what was in each of these papers\nA and credible where they got a little gold star for [noise]\nPlan\nOn

really great rubbing one out\nOf the violence of object to vacation through non consensual masturbation uh then we get to some really disturbing ones um the progressive\nStack James tell us about the progressive stack\nYeah the progressive stacks of pretty horrifying piece of work and in fact it's evil ah fortunately it did not get accepted the journal was inviting us to re submitted and um give it another go\nIt says this this is our act says it's a solid essay that with revision will make a strong contribution to the growing literature of addressing injustice in the classroom\nYeah so what did argues for is that we take students in college classrooms and we have them go through some kind of a\nInventory that determines how privileged they are it recommends a thing called the step forward step back game as a possibility\nOnce they're determined how privileges they are the students are ranked according to their privilege um then the more privileged you are the worst you get treated in class so the most privileged white and male students are invited to listen and learn throughout the semester which means face\nAren't allowed to speak or ask questions in class they're invited to sit in the floor in chains to experience reparations and a level the the knowing field to be in a very privileged classroom learning environment\nAnd the problem that the reviewers seemed to have with this set of suggestions was that we thought there's no way this will get in we have a temporary thing we have to be compassionate to these students as we put them in the foreign teams\nAnd they used to watch it with compassion that re centers the needs of the privileged over the oppressed and there's this idea out there called the pedagogy of discomfort which means that you learn to overcome your privilege by being made uncomfortable and left to fit in that without being comforted\nAnd so they actually wanted to make\nA terrible scary idea properly evil and that was the worst part is is it's only a small step from what I already exist in a great deal of the a feminist than race based education literature\nSo this was not really terrified this was not accepted because it didn't it wasn't bad enough\n[noise] ah first yeah and then later they were concerned with the death 'cause a scholarship and and the kind of routine thing that\nYou would expect out of a scholarly paper they claimed for example that we can grew on too many concept and it would be confusing for the reader and to try to narrow it down to something a bit tighter\nAnd so on but um but the idea that they're giving students experiential reparations and asking them not to be able to speak in class or to be spoken over\nInterrupted to teach them what that feels like none of that was
