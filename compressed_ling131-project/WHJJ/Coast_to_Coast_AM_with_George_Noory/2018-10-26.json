reported or files dot com and my coast to coast AM radio broadcast than\nThat a new ninth planet or planet act was indirectly discovered at the far edge of our solar system where the hyper belt and the cloud meet\nThe hyper belt is a disc shape residue of rock dust and ice left over from our solar system creation and it extends from the orbit of Neptune out far beyond Pluto to about fifty astronomical unit from our son\nAnd the ... cloud of mostly ice and dust goes much further starting where the ... rebelled in an extension for three point to light years from earth\nIn a severe Ikle shape that surround our entire solar system including the Khyber belt\nAnd I have a beautiful graphic of this at Meyer files dot com report for people to see what our solar system really looks like\nNow I say planet nine was indirectly found in twenty sixteen because to date no human on earth has yet seen this hypothesize massive object\nBut Michael Brown PHD professor of planetary astronomy at caltech in Pasadena here and now back in twenty sixteen that he was confident there was a huge object ten to twenty times the mass of earth\nMoving in a big looping orbit all the way to the word cloud\nProfessor brown simply calls the planet nine because he's the astronomer they got Pluto knocked down to a dwarf planet after it had been the historic ninth planet of our solar system for a decade\nIt was twenty three and professor brown that year discovered another dwarf planet he cold air is out in the type rebelled and it was more massive than Pluto\nSo it was professor brown who argued that put our should be downgraded from the ninth planet in our solar system to adore planted in the hyper belt that surrounds our solar system and he even wrote a book in twenty ten that was called how I Killed Pluto and why it had it coming\nWhen I first interviewed professor brown about the massive but still unseen planet nine he told me back then quote\nIt is like chasing I'd go whatever is out there it's math is so great\nThat it's gravitational field pushes half a dozen other hyper belt object to cluster together on the opposite side of planet nine huge looping orbit or at least where they think it orbits close quote\nNow that is why so far it is an indirect discovery\nIt's now late twenty eight team after several tries at the hacking Subaru observatories in Hawaii to find planet nine invisible light and or infrared\nProfessor brown says that it is quote till like chasing I'd go after more refined computer calculations he has reduced the expected math of this unseen planet to be only seven times more massive than earth\nAnd just a couple of weeks ago I checked in with him for an update on his search for this elusive planet nine or planted act that he uh is still trying to mine and he told me that he is planning another trip\nTo Hawaii November first\nJust in a week and this time he thinks there is a chance that he'll finally be able to visually get to this big mysterious math because they've been working on computer refinement and for example he told me in a recent interview that calculations place this unseen body\nAbout five hundred times further than the distance from the earth to the sun\nSo that is putting it in a spot that is something like twenty times further than ... June ... good way out there but they have ... narrow down the focus\nSo he deliberately going on November first started another surge because the new calculations predict that planet nine is close to a constellation that can only be seen by American eyes in the winter\nHere now from the California Institute of technology's planetary scientists department in Pasadena, California is astronomy professor Michael Brown\nOr predictions are that the planet is in the region of the sky close to the constellation Orion which is one that everybody knows the constellation of Orion\nIs a winter constellation that's when it's up in the sky that's when you can observe it most to we have to wait until the ... up until the winter before we can start looking to where we think it is\nAnd in November what date will you start to remember first\nThat's not very far away what frequencies will you be looking in\nThe best way to search for this is actually just a visible wavelengths just like your eyes because so far as the brightest part do we think it's going to have is just sunlight reflected off of its upper atmosphere and so we're just going to look right at what you would see just taking pictures with ... what about him for rent\nAnd fruit is actually is not going to be a very good one for searching simply because\nWe don't have any telescopes which really massive infrared detectors that can look at big areas of the sky once once we find planet and looking at it in the in for a study of will be very important but it's not probably the best way to look for\nYou isn't it amazing that on this impact on the solar system perturbations and even tilting the playing of the solar system six degrees to the sun that he would be caused by an object out in the ... cloud that we can't even yet\nI think it's pretty fun to think about it we just don't know where to look yet it'll be easy to see once we know exactly where to look I suspect and then once we see it then we will study it in detail was probably you know every large telescope on the earth will suddenly swing enough direction so to be quite exciting when it's finally found\nThis new planet nine is hypothesized to be five thousand times more massive than Pluto that you've got knocked down to a dwarf planet\nYeah so it's a good reminder of the difference between\nThings that are not real plan it's like ... and real planets sometimes people say oh this new planet nine it's just a little bit bigger than ... like ... it's five thousand times more massive [noise] this is what we mean when we say a planet and the other part of the solar system\nWhen we last talked I think you had two categories where might have come from why use this massive object all the way out to the edge of the type of thing\nI'm going into the cloud and you talked about possibly being captured rogue planet\nHeading we inside of our solar system where Neptune and hearing is our but then he got knocked out by Saturn or Jupiter what do you think today\nI still favor the explanation that it came from inside our solar system and got knocked out by Jupiter Saturn but in ... when we find it and know exactly what its orbit isn't exactly what its composition has\nAll of this is just speculation you can probably come up with many different ideas to explain how I got there but once you find it I Hope will really start to learn why it's there and what it's made out of\nYou've been living with just now for three years do you have any sort of intuitive sense of what you could look like\nMy best guess is that it will look sort of like Neptune we think it's a Neptune like planet just a little bit less massive than up to him and so it will be a gaseous atmosphere\nIt probably won't have ... it's probably too cold to have any clouds up in the atmosphere so in fact it might be quite bland\nA mostly just kind of grayish white atmosphere with no features of it but it's easy to speculate that we're almost always surprised when we find real objects and so the one thing that I Know for sure is that there will be things about it that we never even thought about that are completely surprising\nExactly how far from earth to where you think this object is\nWe think is about five hundred times further distance than the distance from the earth to the sun so that puts it at something like twenty times further than Neptune for example so it's a good ways out there\nAnd he is that a quarter of a light year oh no it's not even close to a quarter of your it's about two and a half light days\nTwo and a half light days from er is is that the border between the hype rebels and the ... cloud\nWell that's actually really good question to which we now don't know the answer before we realized that there is a planet out there we thought we knew about the border but now that there's a planet where that border we thought was now we're less sure 'cause we don't know what is beyond that planet and we don't quite yet know how that planet is affecting what this border as\nWell the idea that that could be a massive plan it but when you read like say about the ... through scholar in the translation that we're a car and\nDon

[noise]\nSo what was something like a one and a hundred events can become as often as every other year and so these really extreme floods extreme heat they become much more ... in the future and can have devastating consequences\nRight now what our computer models showing to do is have you worked on the PCC report about what we can expect say in North America\nIn just the next decade because we've already reached another half degree warmer and it's projected that we may go up to do\nIt could be substantially worse than even those that stuff's come up\nBut the politics of the planet don't seem to be supporting dramatic reduction in the greenhouse gases in fact it seems that some of the larger nation the United states included\nMy adding coal now to an industry that we thought had ended\nThat we are going to be contributing ourselves to increasing amounts of greenhouse gases and accelerating the amount of warming so that we would be ourselves pushing the needle on the computer models in which there is even more rapid warming\nBut unfortunately you put your finger on\nMy guess is that the politicians assumed that the problems will only become more severe unfair out of office and so if they are thinking of the next two to four to six years which just or most of the political offices\nThan they are assuming that they can cope with that short a period of time and it will be somebody else's problem or two decades from now\nMeanwhile we're facing the fact that there will probably be be eat a lot of people who are going to be forced out of homes and houses and what is the United states in the world going to do with what has to be future migration away from ...\nCertainly there will be in fact already are places that are are having to be a ban doesn't both on the east coast around the Alaska duty rising sea levels and that will only continue to get worse we will have an increasing number of domestic migrants\nBut it's really the developing countries where their farm or people susceptible where there are likely to be enormous numbers affected by the level Roger and forced to migrate as their\nCities become habitable and that's really one of the things that the report highlights where you've got millions of such migrants at one point five degrees\nBut you had many tens of additional climate refugees as you go up to two degrees\nAnd that will be a problem for all the wealthy countries because naturally you want to go somewhere where there are better prospects and so I think we can expect North America and Europe and parts of Asia to see lots of migrants coming from low lying to choose\nAnd in fact I think we've already been seeing that in Europe that's part of the reasons for the Syrian civil war and intense drought all of the migrants that were coming up to Europe after that which led to a lot of\nBut she's suggesting that mean that there could be a tremendous amount of civil strife and wars over at the migration of people away from coast\nBut this has been something that has been identified by law the American officials in the defense department and in the Central Intelligence agency\nDuring the Obama administration's climate change was considered a major threat multiplier and driver of probable future conflicts\nAnd again there's kind of a head in the sand mentality has taken root now in Washington which seems to pretend that this doesn't exist but this was widely acknowledged in the defense community as we show it was for years to go\nTo global climate change in increasing more could definitely bring more wars\nYes

I Do not know this is the extremely a translucent\nAnd uh when I started reading the letters I began to see how heart felt\nThat there were people who were telling me they had never mentioned any of this parent to loved ones to children to parent none they but but I started receiving these emails and one\nCame from a a he had been a retired airline ticket agent\nAnd his name he gave me permission to use is Charles hazard\nAnd he uh let me say he said you can use my name and that I'm now from Sun City center Florida but what you're going to hear took place in Arkansas in two thousand and eight thinking about all of this\nIs provoked by two episodes of a strange smoky fog in my office when I was working in live stream and that's what provoked him and hear now is Charles hazards\nAre talking about what happened to him in two thousand and eight from his now Sun City center Florida home\nMissed was in the spring of two thousand in age and I was preparing that morning for a group to come in the next day I was mowing the lawn sure the camp area on a riding mower and cleaning up the facilities and things of that nature\nSo at the end of the day after dinner I was ready to go to bed as soon as the sun went down I was very tired\nSo after shower and I got into bed it was dark by that time I Can't remember about what time it was maybe eight thirty in the evening\nI got into bed with the poverty level my show and just lay there and looked outside the leaves on the trees were not fully out yet so I had a very good view of the night sky with new stars that I can see\nAnd then suddenly I just I was getting ready to close my eyes and suddenly I opened them again\nAnd through the window I can see this misty gray\nBall drifting in through the window and I was just mesmerized but the thing about it was that in this dark bedroom was luminous\nI could see the light within it and it was three dimensional was swirling and slowly kept coming towards me it looked like it was coming right for my head\nAnd I was just frozen fascination of I didn't know what to think and then as it reached my forehead I could see in my mind by three dimensional lighted hire a gloves passing by my field of vision\nI was mesmerized by these hiring lives and the feeling that I was getting was a feeling of euphoria and one is with this living thing\nThat was surrounding me and then at the same moment everything was happening at the same time at the same time I was getting all this information that was almost like answers to questions that haven't been asked out millennia\nAnd they were all be answered at the same time like all of these answers becoming I wasn't asking the questions they were just coming to me and be answered simultaneously\nAnd I don't know why this was happening I was just going with it I didn't even know how long this lasted it could have been just a moment but it seemed to go on forever and I didn't want it to end because of the feeling was so loving\nCan you

the same time like they were walking back and forth as they were passing by my head and as far as the information I was\nGetting it was just almost like a download information that was so quick that I was not able to grasp anything that was being given to me it was just a feeling that I was getting it was almost like I knew\nEvery answer to every question like I was as super human genius or something that had all the answers to everything in the universe was indescribable it's really difficult to explain it felt like to me it wasn't for now\nAt that moment it was for something that was
