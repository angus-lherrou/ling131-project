[noise]\n\n\n[noise]\nHey and welcome back to coast to coast George nowhere with you with Nick Perri see with us a rod Serling his life working imagination the name of the book Nicholas how many twilight zone episodes were there a hundred and fifty six\nThat's why I think ... gallery that came out in color after the twilight zone didn't quite have that twilight zone magic to it\nThat's one of the reasons I think yeah yeah the other reason is that rod really had no creative control over that series unfortunately what was his role\nWell he he created the series um he he wrote the pilot film which was called night gallery was three stories and it was a it was kind of a ... movie of the week kind of\nThing and he was hitched it he's the one who probably pitched it to the network will I bring all the\n... after that was such a success he pitched it and they kind of mutually pitched each other and\nAnd he did so he he wrote a lot for the series and he hosted it obviously but he had no say in cast and directing and editing and all that kind of thing and and you see that kind of his absence come up all the time and episodes where you say uh you know rod would have done this or you know and he didn't have that freedom to do that\nHow come the number wrote a book\nWell he never wrote a novel he did write your collections of short stories and no one's sure but I mean the closest the ever came to\nReading anything that was novel length was actually\nThe stories that made up tonight gallery movie uh they originally were Nobel as they were long short stories I'm In a book called the season to be wary\nUm some but she never had the time you know that's the simple answer he was he was so busy with tells me I wanted to write a novel he really did but she just never could get away for long enough period of time to dedicate to writing a novel\nThere's there's going to be a ... to the twilight zone\nYes it's it's already in production and it's just supposed to be coming out early next year I'm Jordan Peele who the director and writer of get out or is in charge of it he's going to be hosting it and producing it\nAnd from what little I've seen so far in terms of trailers and things I Am cautiously optimistic I think they may actually get it right to some extent this time\nWe're the what's the venue for it where they're going to hear it\nIt's going to be on CBS all access so it's not going to be on regular TV it's going to be a pay you know like um [noise] you know Netflix or Amazon Prime that kind of thing so CBS all access and the interesting thing about that is\nThey launched the CBS all all access network with Star Trek with a new Star Trek series and now they're adding onto that with the twilight zone so it's like they you know the going way back to get these shows to to watch this new network so it tells you how you know how classic these shows are they can be reenter reintroduced to a whole new audience in this way\nNicolas wasn't a rod Serling one of the co writers of planet of the apes\nHe sure was and a lot of people still still don't are surprised when you say that but yes he was\nHe didn't really get credit for it to well he did get literally get credit for you on the screen it's ... it's the the credit is\nWritten by Michael Wilson and rod Serling [noise] ah so he did get coal credit but ever since the movie came out there's always been this kind of you know what did he really right you know what what do you really can contribute to the final film and it's been a lot of misinformation and and speculation about what he did right so that's another thing that I think I clarify in the book\nSome of his is shows whether it was that gallery or twilight zone had in the era of supernatural to it what was his belief about that\n[noise] he was he was a skeptic but he was very interested in it he was a\nHeat you know Carol Serling was once asked that question and and I think the answer she gave us the best answer the gift she said that he wanted to believe he had that he really wanted to believe that you know the aliens had been here you know a thousand years ago and he was very open to these theories of\nYou know the crop circles and you know they only visitations and UFO sightings and all that kind of stuff\nBut he was also very practical guy and he was he didn't have any experience of his own he never saw a spaceship or anything like that so he was always skeptical but but he really had an interest in it and you know in the early seventies a rod narrated some very popular\nAh documentaries about this kind of thing you know in search of ancient astronauts in search of ancient mysteries which led to the series in search of\nAnd during that time particularly he really got interested in this thing but I don't think he ever you know went over to the side of being a true believer or anything like that\nNow the twilight zone there were thirty minute episodes but I guess minus commercial time they were about what twenty two twenty three minutes\nTwenty four most of 'em yeah back then now nowadays with thirty minutes she'll be twenty two but back then it was twenty four yeah a little less commercials\nThat's still a lot of writing isn't it\nOh yeah yeah um yeah and and the amazing thing is how fully developed rod certainly could write a story in a character and twenty four minutes you know he he often\nA complaint about that to some extent said how hard it is to write a fully developed story in twenty four minutes and then he went out and did it over and over again you know so he um he was able to succeed in a in a in a venue that you know it's very hard to succeed it\nIs very difficult to pin point your very favorite twilight zone episode because they were all different and they were all great\nIt's yeah it's um you know it is and and the show was so yeah but as you said they're so they're so different it was very hard to to pigeon hole the twilight zone it covered the gamut from you know hard science fiction\nFantasy too westernized comedies to you know it went across the board so um you know I you know I have a couple of favorites you know just a you know to throw a couple of my favorite at this point probably as is walking distance wrote songs for season a episode about\nHis kind of archetype all you know businessman who stressed out and wants to go back to his home town and you know religious youth and go back to a easier less stressful life was that ... that is just like well yeah it's kind of a stop it will be a kind of a companion piece to its well spent\nYeah so they both very similar and they're both among among my favorites and that was that was a big theme to Serling was this idea of going back to his innocent youth and bring him to New York\nI I I Love like I mentioned I sing the body electric uh to serve man that was the classic a\nHand is yeah absolutely a classic and and it's again one of those shows that people still know to this day they know that ended gets a cookbook you know they that's\nEver [laughter] and they're just so many good the what was the name of the one where the guy was obsessed with the ah he hated gambling and then all of a sudden he was obsessed with a slot machine that kept calling his name\nYeah that was called the fever and start a average Sloan who actually started rod Serling his very first breakthrough hit called patterns on crafts theater\nOr he started in that and you start in the fever and yeah exactly he was he was against gambling and he got ... kind of dragged Las Vegas and he became a you know addicted to this one particular slot machine thinks is taunting him\nAnd drove him crazy after a while then ... exactly right yeah\nAll right Nick stay with us we're going to come back and take phone calls next our folks so if you want to chat about rod Serling talk about your favorite episode or just talk with Nicholas furry see about some of the older type television programs

alive today watching television what what do you say about the current state of TV\n[noise] well I I think in a in one regard I think he would be thrilled with how adults television has become in you know in the in the realm of drama\nUh during the time that route throwing his writing obviously we talked about some of the censorship but not on the issues but also the language and and just the ... the subject matter in general even if it wasn't a social issue um you know today there are so many shows that are that are\nAre so adults in scope or you know I don't even have to name them but you know Mad Men and Breaking Bad and\nYou know not just cable but but um but network television I think you would be thrilled with how how uh the with the quality of those shows now of course we have many more channels now and he there's certainly a whole lot of you know of of jumped to but um but I think in general here would be happy with it and one thing I can\nTell you for sure he he would hate reality TV on the um he\nAnd and I don't say that just you know that's not just me saying that at the time you know I guess reality television for its time a rod had some very negative things to say about a show called this is your life if you remember this is your life\nUh this is your life with a show where they bring somebody\nOnto the show and the normal you know regular everyday person then you know a trot as family members out there and they would go through his scrapbook and look at you know it was kind of reality television for the time and he just\nDespise the the show or you know he thought it was just an invasion of privacy and everything else so it's a reality TV he would have but I think there are so many shows now that he would absolutely love\nAll an old time television tuned to a really did not understand racial mix ups demographics when you look at some of these old shows way gone back\nOr even the comedians are the game shows they were all older white guys you know in in I'm not I'm not talking like a middle age I'm Talking the older white guys [laughter] where did the television\nYou know it would be difficult to get that kind of a person like Jimmy Durante for example you you think of him\nHe was a big superstar very talented\nI don't think he would make it today\nYou might be right yeah yeah you could be right I mean well listen to the ... the um\nThe field as has grown so tremendously there's so much more competition\nThat uh you know there'll be there'll be but it's kind of like talking about not major league baseball before the before Jackie Robinson you know you know they didn't have the competition from the from the black player from the Latin player from all these places and they were certainly people who played in the major leagues in Nineteen forty one\nWho may not have made it in Nineteen fifty one because there was so much more [noise] more competition\nWhat would rod say about all the different channels available now in his day there was just three major networks now my God you've got hundreds of channels\nYeah well he would he would love the freedom that it that it gives to uh to writers and creators that you know in his day you know if those three networks didn't want to hear it that was it I mean you know and in some cases if he was you know had under contract to CBS\nCBS didn't want to hear it that was it nowadays you know you can go to so many different outlets to get your creation\nOr seen and heard uh so yeah he would be thrilled with that aspect of it for sure\nI mean Netflix and Amazon truly rival the networks now don't they\nOh absolutely I have some of the best television being made right now is on on those platforms\nAnd it's amazing let's take some calls let's go west of the Rockies cursed in Boise idaho or to get us started Hi Kurt\nHey George I'm Glad he got Nick I Can't wait to read the book you mentioned earlier when you were talking about the impact of the fact that the entire series is in black and white and of course Nick mentioned that you know the film or look but I've always been amazed at what I was able to do\nWith regarding the size of this sets which to me was as far as the visual impact was which is a testament to the you know there's so much talk of her and the lighting directors which I just I was just blown away with what they were able to accomplish sores ordering from Nick if he knew how many cameras used during the actual shoots\nOkay Nick do you know\nI Do not know the answer that question by will absolutely agree with Kurt that it that's one of the striking things about the series is\nIs that you know of course the production level of in terms of budget\nYou know it was a fairly of generously budgeted show at the for the for the time but of course in terms of special effects they weren't going to be able to give you the brilliance you know spaceships a shooting across the sky and that kind of things so that ... had to work with a more a relatively modest a set\nAnd the show and he did he got the most out of out of those particular sets and and every now and then to actually because budget was always a concern\nUm he would write a particular show that only took place in one the one room because it was going to be cheaper to me you know there's one room and that's it and he would do one of those after they had a couple of expensive shows like I have the Boulder or you know and I married twenty thousand feet or something and then he would do one of these shows that we've got kinda got the budget back under control\nHe jumps started many careers to did you not\nYeah I think so I mean it's certainly there are a lot of you know stars and soon to be Robert\nRedford yeah yeah I have read for\nActually got his first job not on the twilight zone but in another show that rod Serling had written cold in the presence of mind enemies on playoff Ninety it was the very first ah parents by Robert Robert Redford on television a and that was a great great show when he was a very good in it too\nYeah in the twilight zone episode he was a cop in the lady thought he was a death coming to get her yeah I'm not going to say what the ending is but that was a great show\nYeah was it was very that was written by George Clinton Johnson actually and that's a terrific show\nWhat was the name of the show Nicholas were ... more head was a woman in her house in a small flying saucer landed inside her house or something like that and she beat it with a broom\n[laughter] it's called the invaders\nAnd and that was written by Richard Matheson or the late great Richard Matheson uh he wrote several episodes of the show and that's one of the most well remembered episodes of the series is it's largely dialogue free there's almost no dialogue in it until the very end when the when the you know spin a person you know ha says a few things\nI found out who they were in the other one I like to was the lady who was having plastic surgery or because everybody thought she was ugly in she wanted to look like everyone else and uh we sure found out what everyone else look like and that's\nThat's the eye of the beholder and that is um you know if there is a quintessential twilight zone episode I think that's that's it that's that's the one on again one of the most well remembered episode\nAnd the one that really gave me the message of people was the shelter above that fallout shelter\n[laughter] yeah the shelter is a great great episode Serling wrote that one and uh yeah it's about the idea that there's going to you know there's a there's a bomb threat a nuclear threat and what this what does this commute\nDid they do when there's only one bomb shelter and they all want to get into and they can't get into it and they turn on each other and it was yeah that was a terrifically well on opposite\nRenee in San Francisco is with us Hi Renee go ahead\nHi are you know um there's an episode that's a very rare episode but it was finally released years later I was called miniature\nMiniature I don't remember that Nicholas do you\nRobert Duvall absolutely right another great you know a great actor who one of his early early performances Robert Duvall a that was one of the hour long episode was the fourth season of the twilight zone they were all in our long as opposed to the half hour oh really yeah okay\nYeah and then you sure it was one of the hour long episodes and it it was involved in a in a lawsuit at the time that\nUh the series went into syndication so it was not initially syndicated\nSo was not seen for decades or at least Twenty years or in so that was long long settled and um there was a special on called the twilight zone silver anniversary special and they showed that particular episode along with a couple of others that had been similarly left out of the syndication package\nWhat was the tragedy when they were doing the twilight zone movie a helicopter crashed or something like that\nOh he has a horrible horrible incident yeah helicopter crashed after an explosion you know special effects explosion and killed the moral who's starring in that particular story and two young children who are on the set\nA it was yeah you cast they pull over the entire movie of course\nHorrible horrible situation on Long Island New York is with us they just go ahead you're high\nNeck a couple of questions or\nOne would be the first one would be that seemed like it was very escapist were then maybe someone stay back in the sexism just speculating if you had to write for a job and he came home and watch the twilight zone\nThat would be almost like an escape from your daily reality and I guess people might have wanted that and I'm Wondering if there are any other shows really light that my second question would be about the mysterious endings which\nYeah absolutely and everybody ... already rich really nice guy\nThat's the way to do it in a sense of ... he had a heart of gold\nHe did he he really was incredibly generous with his time\nOr he would do things like that all the time he would he would marry things for you know for free for people who are people out to college or or local businesses I mean as Steve mentioned and yeah he would actually do and\nAnd you know going through his correspond to see what rod showing kept everything he ever ever sent ... every letter he ever wrote he kept and they still exist and you would think he responded to every single fan letter he ever received personally a personal letters written the sign and everything [laughter] um he took that time to do that and\nIt's really amazing that that you can't really find a somebody saying a bad word about rats are like oh\nYou really can't Nick we're going to take a quick break them we're gonna come back with final phone calls with you there special guests Nick ... book of course this call's rod Charlene is life working

twilight zone by year I'm Out of limits came afterwards but I Believe a one step beyond which started in fifty eight I think\nNext up we're going to end in Tulsa, Oklahoma and we're taking away I appreciated\nGeorgia and neck you know starting man he was he he had the ability to be able to understand human nature 'cause if you listen to a lot of his episodes and I've got every one of them and I ... about every two months\nYou know every one of these shows has a point to it but he's trying to point to you know and I think it's because of the experiences at a combat soldier during World War two and which I you know it was all about the the Nazi movement and all of that you know\nAnd the everything you've been through one of my favorite episodes is hard to say which is my favorite but I think it had to be the one that's to be twenty five Mitchell twin engine bomber\nComing home from Italy crashes in the desert the cap that airplane didn't go on a mission for whatever reason which was Robert Cummings Bob comings I'm Sorry and Bob comments just happened to be walking by seeing this newspaper of his airplane they had found laying in the desert\nAnd ah he went back in time why you went back to the desert in his mind\nAnd where you live the experience even though he didn't fly that nation you know and or any I ended up in a hospital room\nAnd haven't psychiatric care trying to find out you know what caused him to add a nervous breakdown and it was because the shock of seeing an airplane on the newspaper just recently you know and ... when the show ended close to the ending of it\nThe nurse bodies clothing out there and she said well there's sand in his shoes\nAnd so somehow or another he really transport himself back in time it would be twenty five ... crashed you know struggle with those shows that ... did\nThey had a time machine you know one of 'em this guy you know went back in time three different times and he thought he would try to capture events that took place one of them was just thinking of the Titanic\nThe guy went back tried to tried to change that well he failed\nIt one time you went back and tried to stop the uh Japanese from being annihilated in Hiroshima trying to warn them that didn't do any good he got thrown in jail for his efforts on that so I went back and he ended up in Nazi Germany they're already thought he could alter that event\nOf course but a man I don't know we it it'd be hard to say which me my favorite episode the the the Christmas Story\nThe guy that played art Carney played the ah Santa Claus in a department store I end the call Cowell was his name he wanted to be the biggest gift giver of all times the guy was all a shrine [laughter]\nWhen he got a break from the department store he went and got drunk came back he was setting up on the chairs little boy jumped up in his lap\nSanta Claus just it was through a man I mean he fell out of the chair on the floor you know where she got fired and everything he went outside and he was all down down he went in the back alley and picked up a bag and it turned into gifts mysteriously bag just all of a sudden became full of gifts that did it uh you know empty cans\nMan he went around giving gifts to everybody and it just and that story\nYou know and the guy that Rand a department store\nThey found call well given these gifts out at this a place like a John three sixteen mission Thai place you know policeman comes and goes where did you get all these gifts if you've got a receipt for all these ... and he goes no I just\nI found the bag and the give strength and I'm just giving them out looking at the police station and the department store owner came in there so yeah there it is there is the merchandise\nOh well you're a you know the guy's name was Mr Armstrong right and and empty to step out of the bag at the police station there wasn't nothing but empty and you're right\nAnd so they had to go to court store owner sitting here scratch your head the policemen ascribe it it was just recover from it they were coming out it back\nSo just before they released oil Santa Claus he raised the bag and grab the wine Nineteen thirty three and edited\nTo Mr gundy huh you know saying we got it on the wine and they walk outside and they think Santa Claus flying overhead and play with reindeer a society and that right there just it just my heart Everytime\nI live in you as you mentioned something about cans that remember kicked the can Nicholas\nOh sure sure yeah kick the can and that was actually re made in the twilight zone feature film as well about a a old old folks home where a ... one of the old one of the people there and wants to get the get the restaurant and to kick the can to feel young again and of course they do become young again by plane kick the can and\nAnd the one person who was against the whole time he didn't play and he didn't get to become young and he regrets it obviously and and that that was written by George Clinton Johnson actually that's a terrific episode\nWe're running out of time your neck but uh I I've got to tell you this is a topic that is so dear to my heart of it brings back memories when I was a kid watching television my folks were there in the living room with us those are great time short thanks\nIt's great memories yeah yeah it was a different time and you know for all of us and uh yeah it's great to ... TV can bring you back that way and you know so it's yeah it's great to think about\nLife was different too sure it sure was yeah yeah absolutely\nAs a kid that didn't have a cure in the world did we\nKnow and that's what are you know that that's something that Russia was was yearning for in a lot of us well it's not just to be able to go back to being a kid and have a being carefree and being in a sense and and a less stress and everything else and that came out and in so many stories\nBy the way you believe it was wrong about one thing you're not a bad bad man\n[laughter] I can take it from from bill moment he can call me that that's right\nThat's a classic a neck one more time you bought your website if you would for people\nSure will be a rod Serling memorial foundation or can be found just that Rob showing dot com WWW that rod Serling dot com\nAnd uh I have a Facebook page that's dedicated to the book so it's not my personal pay it just it's for the book it's Facebook dot com forward slash rod Serling dimensions all one word rod Serling dimensions ah the working title for the book was dimensions of imagination\nSo it was bad but the book is called ... showing his life working imagination\nShow per neck thanks again up next we're talking about haunted collectibles and collectibles to next\nCoast insiders the new version of the coast to coast am map is now available bribe bone and know Android ...\nListen ... on demand anywhere any time\nTo coast to coast am dot com and downloaded today\nThe movies this weekend because you're black\nBears weekends white as new releases Halloween which was ... the murder spree from forty years earlier when mass killer Michael Meyers escapes Laurie in a local cops team up to capture him and protect your family from his raft Judy rare will Patton Virginia gardener and Nick Castle also star and there's horror sequel\nBased on the twenty Seventeen novel of the same name as they have your gifts from the director of barber shop and sold for\nStar is a girl who lives in a poor neighborhood but attends a fancy prep school rather than easy balance of distinct worlds collapses when one of our close friends is shot parents of sex reverberate through both communities is dramas ...

people do I just felt that everything else [laughter] not really but you know I was a middle aged guy in a restaurant business I was a stock market or caster\nI used to that was one of these guys who told Merrill Lynch which way the market was going I worked in a think tank yeah parents got sick got called back to Connecticut and ended up in the antique business after a restaurant jobs didn't work out [noise] things usually work and life\n... that's true but people of color ... collectibles aren't going to tell you when I Wish I still have my baseball cards from the Nineteen fifties\nI don't know where they are I've asked my mother who's eighty nine years old mom checked the attic where are they she says George ... we gave them away what I had in the fifties every baseball card and clear that play during that period what would they be worth today a fortune\nWell Nineteen fifty two mantle guard was great good shape your real good shape right what would you say well suppose your attacks

two man told they're an excellent condition ask them a few questions you find out it's right a guy says listen I've been told that's where the fortune I Want ten thousand bucks for the by the by it\nI don't know I don't know until I call a guy like you\nWell that's worth a town somewhere in the neighborhood of a you know two hundred thousand dollars no yeah oh\nI get al ... mental saying Willie Mays I had him all to\nMyself I used to put those cards and my bicycle spokes\n[laughter] I had to do with kids we did it with the duplicates remember\nYeah with the duplicates in generally you had like I had Fifteen Pete Rose rookie cards from\nIran into Pete Rose a couple of years ago in Los Angeles or what would those cards you've been worse if you'd given them the him to sign even more\nNow I I actually don't think that would help the value very much probably it would hurt the value you don't want to do that with a you know you're better off having them sign a napkin\nYeah exactly now old football cards and stuff so they worth money too\nThat's what you should be buying right now really I always think if you do little things a little different than the average guy you'll make a little extra money right everybody's\nOn the baseball cards that nobody's buying football cards which means you should be buying football\n... interesting to\nWrite basketball cards\nI once saw a guy who had a complete [noise] he had Michael Jordan rookie cards that before they cut the cards it's called a big plate he had a whole plate of sixteen Michael Jordan rookie guards on got\nOh I don't know what the heck that'd be worth today jeeze basketball\nCard but nobody collects football cards and you can buy 'em real cheap and that's sort of thing you should be but you could get yourself like a ... like ... ... ... like this card right some sort of thing if you can buy that for a couple of bucks you buy it\nI think I threw away a wholeness Wagner card was worth anything\n[laughter] I don't have a an honest Wagner card did you really like a million dollars\n[laughter] yeah it thought two million if it has a a a\nA a Piedmont back gosh\nYeah that's that's the most famous uh collectible in history\nWhen what makes these collectibles so expensive and so long after\nI always say you know the way to make money in and take the Jess instead of sitting around and saying well this is rare this is exceedingly rare there's only one of the world and it's obviously a four hundred years old doesn't\nLook at how dusty it is right that's not the kind of what makes things gives things value is what I called marketability ask yourself who's gonna buy it you know everybody loves baseball\nGot its unamerican to love baseball one of the reasons Mickey Mantle baseball cards or worse so much as it
