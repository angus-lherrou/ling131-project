coast Olympic Tiger Woods Lin is one of the central voices in the new consciousness movement she's the author of several great books including the field and the intention experiment\nA way it is the power of eight Lynn is the editorial director of what doctors don't\nTell you and also the architect of the intention experiments and she has conducted many Lynn welcome back to the program hey George it's great to be back you two are you still doing intentioned experiments\nI Am I mean we just had two amazing on last autumn and we just calculated the results a few months ago\nYou know I get an intentioned a bit when several weeks ago Hurricane Florence was heading towards the Carolinas or they could see it as a category four or five and we did a little of let's bring it down in the ... a tropical storm really fast\nOr something happens it works\nAnd it does work I mean I worked with a group in Florida to keep it at the last hurricane not this latest one away from Tampa Bay and it just skirted around it\nSo there's something going on and I mean now we've run about thick piece intention experiments trying to lower violence\nUm last September we ran a six day experiment to lower violence in the violent place in America which is believe it or not a a a neighborhood in St Louis Missouri Jesse ...\nAnd we calculated the results Georgia and it was amazing um we looked and I had a professor at ... look at it from the University of California\nAnd she saw that crime went up at St Louis has a whole property crime went up in St Louis it's a whole property crime went up went up in fairground and neighborhood we we concentrated on the violent crime the thing we were focusing on went down by forty three percent for before\nAnd it just completely bucked the trend from the time we did the intention so that's going on\nHere and what do you think this is what people tapping into of course you touched on it a lot with the book the field but what's out there and one\nWell what's out there we're in a collective consciousness and I like I called it the field it's a quantum energy field\nAnd what seems to be the case if we can share what's going on with our thoughts I mean you know the bottom line is our phone everything is energy and our thoughts are another kind of energy when there\nAre worked together collectively we have an amazing power that can change thing and now you know I'm thirty three of these experiments and we've done everything from trying to make have grow faster to purify water healing somebody of PATS the lowering violent and\nYou know I'm thirty three twenty nine shown measurable positive significant effect\nDoes that trend that the odds\nWell yeah because you know there's no drug out there to be honest\nGeorge that that has that kind of track record you know pharmaceutical drug has his good record is that in terms of studies so\nSo as I say what really seems to be the case his thoughts are things that affect other things and when you get a group of people doing thoughts together there is a collective field that seems to be created that has great power to change things\nNow maybe he'll thing the experiments you been working on all boys are primarily piece intentioned experiments\nYeah we did that one we did that one in St Louis and then I tried something really amazing I had the chance to work in a studio in southern England that had where I Lived in the u._k.\nAnd we had nine different screens with the studio I can be beamed down to nine different locations so we had cameras and nine different locations\nAnd we had those cameras in eight Arab countries I was working with a guy who's like the Deepak of the middle east\nAnd also a very prominent Israeli ... a documentary producer so we had eight in Arab countries you know Saudi Arabia Bahrain et cetera on Kuwait and then the ninth one was in an audience of Israeli Jews\nSo these are guys who have been brought up to hate each other and I also beamed at this live over my YouTube channel to um my followers around the world\nSo we all did intention to lower violence in Jerusalem there was an area of the old city that was suffering on violence and we chose it because it's you know is the seat of all the major religions and we thought everybody would come together\nAnd what was amazing is afterward I could call on the people in the different locations you know I'm just calling their screen and they could talk to everyone else\nAnd the Jews started saying to the Arabs we love you it's time to you know\n... and all of this and the Arabs were saying your God is my God and everybody was crying and everybody was sending love and it was amazing it made the papers all over the middle east it was historic\nAnd it was incredible to me to see what was going on with these peace experiments wasn't just the outcome it was the effect on the participants\nHow much does attitude play ... in the if you're a beach in positive will that generally work better than someone who goes into these experiments as a doubting Thomas\n[noise] well I thought so but no I mean and and when I looked at when we've done intention for individuals for instance we did an intention once for a kid called loop who is Fifteen Years old who tried to commit suicide he threw himself off of forty foot\nStructure after his he broke up with this for a serious\nGirlfriend and he'd broken everything he had brain damage he had a you know he had nerve damage and so I got my my community to start sending intention to him\nFor three weeks while his stepfather with keeping notes and careful you know tracking what was happening when we were sending intention\nLoop got better in record time the doctors didn't even think of is going to live\nBut he got better he got out of the hospital a far quicker than anybody could have estimated but here's the funny thing of it you know he's Fifteen Years old and like most teenagers he thought his parents belief and the power of intention was pretty stupid\nIt worked for him and he didn't believe a word of it\n... with these experiments how do you start conducting them how do you scientifically put it together\nI get a team of scientists George I now I work with a lot jar ah Gary Schwartz at the University of Arizona noted psychologist\nAnd a Jessica\nToo is a very well known professors statistics and has been doing working consciousness research I worked with the late ... rural I I worked with people from from Penn State university water expert um I worked with um people from uh uh I'm from Princeton University you\nKnow just really prestigious universities\nSo we'll get an all kick around ideas with them and see what's measurable and then the team will talk about well how are we going to measure this and how to set it up and some of them you know we do it in a laboratory like with Dr Schwartz we did some seat experiments where we had four sets the seeds\nAnd we sent intention to one set of seeds and then the scientists didn't know which ones were sending intention to so we had no real scientific type of experiment and they planted the seeds and carefully measured them so it's all done with the scientific protocol that they really helped me set up because they're the scientists\nAnd then I just invite my readers all over the globe and we've had people from a hundred and fifty countries participate or I'm an audience if I'm speaking in front of a large group to to do the intention and I'll be made out of my\nUh Internet site or YouTube or on Web TV or radio you and I did one together\nAnd um and then we calculate that we wait a while and we calculate the results\nAnd the reason we wait a while is\nSafe for the peace experiments if you just do it\nA week after well could you know violence could go down but if you look at what's gone on for a couple of years before and then look for about six months afterwards if you have bucked the trend then it starts to get pretty interesting\nIndeed no bloom the title of your new book the power of each has to do with the number of people you put in the group for the test why ... why not three Fifteen\nWill tell me really came about when I tried to scale this down remember I was doing these big experiments I wanted to know what happens if we put people in groups of you know groups small groups in my workshop you know will will they keel and so this is just another experiment in my own mind and\nSo these are basically brainwave signatures of somebody who's feeling a sense of ecstatic one this\nAnd when we compared these signatures when the nearest scientists who work at the doctor said Stephanie Sullivan um we looked at other things like the work of the University of Pennsylvania looking at sue the masters and and and Buddhist monks\nAny static prayer they had an identical brainwave signature\nBut the only difference was I had you know it takes years to become a Buddhist monk or a sushi master through my guys were total novices there were students who never even done meditation and all they had was uh twelve minute video for me\nWas to do when we're going to court break we're going to come back and just a moment to talk more about your work\nThe power of each and some of the incredible things that can be done with the power of intention truly remarkable when Mick Jagger it's website linked up for you

for she hears from the hotel says we accidentally overcharged you buy exactly the money she was overdrawn\nI'm somebody else was down to her last two hundred dollars she wanted to set up a website she had a port wine staying and wanted and was wanting to do a Web site and set up a business to help other people not feel bad about their birth marks\nAnd she's down through last two hundred dollars and she suddenly here from Lloyd's of London to she had been a former employee to say that she could get a special amount of money because she had been part of this again out of the blue\nSo this happens so often that it it has convinced me it's not just luck is not just happenstance\nAnd you know universities are studying the power of what are they doing\nWill we did the um we did the brain study you know and then we found and as I say we compared it to things like meditation and we found that it's not the same ol' ... state during meditation still makes you feel like you're you\nThis what makes you feel like you're part of something much much bigger the power of eight you feel like you're part of you you kind of feel like you're part of the field that you're not this little lonely individual anymore you're part of something much bigger and grander\nUm and again we've looked at it compared to other um mystical states and its identical to a Buddhist monk and ecstatic prayer but now we're moving forward um life university the one who studied this hot largest chiropractic university\nUm has their nervous scientists and we're planning a study with their biology department to looking at immune system workers so what changes in your immune system when you do this [noise]\nUm but one of the other big pieces of this I talked about it with altruism was the University of California Berkeley who did this big study of what goes on when you do something else rustic when you do something compassionate like our piece experiments\nAnd they found something incredible that goes on a with a thing called the Vegas nerve it's the longest near the body and it winds its way from your neck through all the major Oregon's\nAnd it has a big effect on um things like releasing oxytocin which is that hormone that gets released the feel good hormone when we're when we're caring for babies\nAnd then the result of this activating is that it has a really positive effect on the immune system so when we do good or feel compassionate or ... something like that\nWe um you know we we actually get healthier but the other big piece of this which is why that Middle Eastern experiment came about and the Arabs started you know sending loved to the Israelis\nThey found that when you do something compassionate like be part of an intention experiment or power of aid group\nUm that Vegas and you're also makes us more tolerant more tolerant of people not like us so that was a big piece for me George because I started thinking wow\nAmerica America is so polarized now what if we started doing intentioned experiments where we had Republicans and Democrats together would that\nWould be your mother and I would be an interesting experiment\nWill you were doing one this at this Sunday on doing a pilot experiment like that in\nThe mail is county in Florida um we're going to do something about lowering violence but\nWe've got Republicans and Democrats as part of this experiment in the same room together to see what happens to them afterwards and we're planning to roll down in a\nBig way next next spring um we're we want people you know of the different political persuasion in the same room together to see what happens to them afterward\nYou were talking about a mirror affect what does that\nMirror effect to me was the biggest piece of this George because you know we weren't just seeing effects among the receivers of stuff\nAnd the receivers of the big intention experiments you know the outcome of the biggest change all that was amazing to me was what happened to the participants in these intention experiments [laughter]\nSo when we started doing these peace experiments I started surveying the people to find out you know what happened to them and were they able to get on the website and all that kind of stuff but more amazingly I asked him how it was for them and I'll be getting answers back like this\nUm I felt like I was part of a higher network you know my body was shivering and I was you know shaking uncontrollably and crying I felt like I was in the tractor beam in Star Trek remember these are people who were participating in their own\nHome in front of their own computer by themselves but yet they were feeling this extraordinary energy and the extraordinary emotion but more interestingly is after they participated in a piece experiment their lives became more peaceful\nThey were making up with relatives they were getting along better with their partners that we're getting along better with their bosses in their co workers\nThey were ... and they were hugging strangers about half of them said I feel more love for everybody I come in contact with\nSo that to me with the amazing thing about it the mirror effect and when we did healing experiments we had loads of healing when we had peace experiments we had loads of people finding their lives were more peaceful\nSo in a way that's probably the most the most powerful part of the intention experiment it's not the outcome that's pretty interesting definitely but it's more the active participation and what happens to those people made changes their lives being part of that\nWhen we're gonna come back in the moment and take phone calls I've still got a few more questions for you as we talk about the power of aid but we'll take phone calls in just a second on coast to coast am

I've had young people I've had older people\nAnd it it works for them I think it's all about using the techniques that I teach you know and becoming a mastering tender essentially knowing how to really focus your mind knowing how to\nWhat kinds of things too intense for and how to do it but also being part of that group and Jeff meeting regularly and I think it's that meeting regularly that does the trick I mean there's a guy called um Michel Dean I write about my book who is a\nClinical psychologist but suffered from depression which such so bad that it was often suicidal and it's not a good calling card for a psychologist\nSo he had tried everything conventional an alternative to try to get over this depression and he couldn't and so being part of the group they intended for that and what they intended for was that he would find the source of these in these depression\nAnd soon after that he got a brain wave to go to a Chinese herbal is\nWho worked out that one of his liver filtration systems wasn't working\nAnd he went and got tests and they confirmed that he that he was right\nAnd as soon as we treated his depression completely lifted but the really interesting part of Michel story is what happened over the year\nNot only did that happen but he ended up going back to his fighting weight he lost weight the it got back to his you know he is a way that he was as a young man\nHe um he is chi gung practice he was practicing ... better he got a writer's block and was able to start writing again\nUm he also developed something to help other people with I think it's with depression is special I'm a special kind of technique and everything in his life with getting better\nAnd even his training you know he's he's um he's a trainer at the gym and said to him\nWhat are you doing man you're exercising less and you're more fit what's going on with you and it was like everything in his life was starting to improve but he he was one of the people who met religiously\nIn fact one of the guys in his group Robert became a really really close with him even though they'd never actually physically met\nAnd there were times when mutual would say you know I had insomnia last night and I couldn't sleep and Robert but said during then I had you covered and he was intending for him to have a you know to to sleep better\nAnd so knowing you've got that constant support is really strengthening in every way\nOver the year\nWhen when you do these intention not experiments but when you do these intentions to do something what did they do actually I mean you sit there and think I mean what what do they do\n[laughter] okay well there's a lot of little techniques that make you a good in tender I mean you know the popular view is that you just have to think about it and believe it ... as long as your eyes or whatever you do\nYeah um but it's you know one thing to really keep in mind Georgia's that were intending all the time [laughter] you know and we sabotage most of our intentions we we think that we're just having\nYou know we we have a meditation in the morning we do a little power thought and that the power thought is the thing that's our intention and that's the only thing the universe is going to hear\nBut um as I wrote about my book the field\nYou know we are and meeting energy all the time we're meeting a tiny current of light all the time and our thoughts are another part of that kind of mission\nM.
