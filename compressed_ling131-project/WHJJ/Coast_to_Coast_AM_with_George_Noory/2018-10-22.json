{"month": "10", "state": "RI", "station": "WHJJ", "content": "Um I guess we'll have to go to the left to go back to the old the old south blood tests on what percentage actually makes you someone deserving of prefer treatment in America are living in an America with white privilege it's just that no one wants\nTo be white but it won't be admitted I won't get a job\nRight [laughter] well ... that's the that's the whole thing but the you know she's gone back to the one drop rule this is the this issues the classic Democrats right one drop makes you are right we are non white as far as she's concerned by the way here's some of the things she she advise people to tune out the lies\nOkay [laughter] hired the facts I don't understand what a lot\nOf the fact is she is one one thousand twenty four\nIn the ... expert she chose to look into that\nFor her that's when he came up with so what what is the law it's a lie that one one thousand twenty fourth isn't full blooded Indian I don't understand what the argument is here yeah\nThis was hired expert this is like you know Christine Blasey Ford taking her own polygraph and then releasing the result she hired this guy so what's the lie\nRight well she she's talking about the lives about like Donald Trump but she's uh what else is she saying he no he cheats that's another thing he everybody's\nCheating I mean she's the cheater here right she cheated us she cheated on her way up the uh the academic a totem pole\n[laughter] I mean I think I think the holy already of your longtime mascot being fully exposed to the world\nIs going to lose your mind she has been completely exposed to understand the laying of the evidence here and\nThere are no I get I get it again and I said my column believe believe in my column today was a little bit worn this bill a fake Indian I understand that I'm just saying I'm just talking about how the mainstream media is\nTrying to portray it you know and by the way here's one we this is the first tweet and they're in the series we all know why real Donald Trump makes creepy physical threats about the right I mean I think we would know about these creepy physical threats of you know\nDo [laughter] that's one good thing you can always\nFacts check their crazed claims about about Trump um but the question what do we know about this if it were true [laughter]\nHow about this one how about this when I answered you missed the ... races or or a cat a me award winning presentation this was the second point bottom line my heritage played no role in my hiring ever the Boston Globe reviewed all the evidence\nWell if that's the case the Chinese auto\nUm in their lawsuit against Harvard I'm eternally black students and absolutely Native Americans should because Harvard isn't doing affirmative action and writes didn't play a role\nYeah you know that's that's the another irony here it again\nIt's like a much play but the she released this this uh fabricated a DNA test\nOn the same day that the trial against her her former employer began in federal court here in Boston\nYou know it's it's rather ironic isn't it I mean she she's ... she's running a scam and at Harvard has been running a scam for all these years I mean hard harbored you know harbored the ... century ago Harvard was discriminating against Jews for the same reason to discriminate against Asians because they were doing too well\nYou know and they didn't want to write it and so nothing has really changed here has it\nBut the weird thing about this is I mean normally the\nDouble standards you get on the left it will be um no it's okay for a governor of a state to state employees bring a low level employee to his hotel room dropped his pants and take his it that's not sexual harassment at all and then\nWhen one Brett Kavanaugh was\nDrunken freshman in college he dropped just\nUm and I ever recovered memory of uh Thirty years later so one is is taking 'em no a feminist golf at it for one thing that's that's nothing but recovered memory of cabin are dropping expanses of drunk I'll treasure no\nThat's right that's right that's usually there you know they're they're they're separating these things are at least a few years\nThe strange thing about affirmative action flash Pocahontas is\nSimultaneously these organizations like the New York times with Jason Blair um Harvard with Elizabeth Warren\nThey brag and bragging brag about affirmative action we have lots of affirmative action just apply and look at all the diversity and we're going to pick people on the basis of diversity will discriminate against white people don't worry [laughter] um and then when they won one when we find out that one person in order to take advantage of affirmative action\nUm for Native Americans what are you talking about I mean it's it's one sentence to the next as opposed to two\nCompletely separate separate innocence is here at Harvard bragged about Elizabeth Warren being a Native American diversity diversity\nAnd how much he says it was never that this never helped me get a job however\nShe was from shows an instructor\nAt the University of Texas law school which isn't about law school from what I understand but she was an instructor\nAt ... or University of Pennsylvania\nSo she suddenly decides in the mid eighties to list herself as a minority and appears in this these minority guide books which are basically used as hiring guides to while you know do away with your diversity problem if you're the dean of the law school\nAnd all of us right she's she's working at first at the University of Pennsylvania and then at the at Harvard University law school and she and she wants us to believe but it had and the ... because she's been cleared by the Boston Globe which right\nIt's just like Jason Blair they that times bragged and bragging brag\nAbout their affirmative action program to bring in black reporters and then up that turns out Jason Blair is making everything up and what you're talking about well if they're not doing this and they're not doing affirmative action I don't think they they actually like they can give preference is on the basis of race\nAnd and no one else is allowed to notice that that's what they're doing as their bragging about\nIt and then she's she's got different stories where she said I I put down but I was a Native American because I Want it to get invited to the lunches of the nation from wrote that was the\nOne one thousand and twenty and one one thousand twenty fourth on\nIndia and then I got out that shows recipe and now she\nSays I'm ...

the show and I appreciate it\n[noise] so returning to work on big what does this feel like you're dating your ex\n[laughter] it's a it's kind of odd like you said it's it's always been doing in the background and it's something that's always had my interest I think it's an elusive topic that uh there's a lot of conjecture out there but not a lot of facts\nYou'd never stopped working on it does you know what I mean your focus may have been elsewhere but it's always been sort of a you kept an eye out for articles and information\nYou know I Can't say that I've committed much energy to it\nIn the last seven eight years focused on missing people but when you're going through the archives and you're trying to pull out articles about missing people I'm always reading about all kinds of things that I see on these first pages of news news articles and such and\nI started to come across these ah these stories about\nUm something that looked like ... when you read the articles but when you read the title of it like Ninety percent of the time it'll say wild man and\nI hadn't done a lot of archived work on the topic before but [noise]\nYou know eight years of digging through these archives for missing people articles I just started to pull them and put them in a folder and over the years that got large and eventually I said you know this is pretty intriguing I I think even if you're an optimist or a pessimist on the topic\nIt's it's convincing that something over the years has been around us\nAnd it's been documented in and it shows the historical aspect that most people don't understand\nUm ... we're going to get into the specifics articles about big foot Wildman and giants and sometimes do the same and sometimes they're different but I wanted to just for those who were not listening ten years ago when you were first year you recap the ... project how you got started on that\nWhat you learned and how it kind of got its hooks into you are all these years later\nSo I I never had a dog in the fight or I was working for a technology company I was getting ready to retire and raise a couple of kids and\nTo the guys I was working with that were super wealthy came to me and they sent me in this room and they told the story that independently without knowing each other when they were kids they had a big foot encounter in the mountains of the fear of\nAnd they found each other later in business and you know we're sort of set a coincidence I started talking about Bigfoot and they found each other and and were shocked that they each had a similar encounter and they said you know if we have Twenty years of police officer you have years of investigating an HR\nYou're the guy really to give it that independent look will finance it you go about it at your own pace you know your kids to raise that\nHelp us out with this we really we really want to find out and initially said no and they kept coming back coming back and they said at your own pace you can do it\nSo I I Wonder about looking for an area that had a few things first of all I wanted Internet I needed a hotel and I knew that there was Native American history with the topic that ran deep and I needed it within say six to eight hour driving location from where I Lived at the time in Moscow to California\nAnd according down the area to ... which is about thirty miles south of bluff creek where the Paterson given one film was made sixty seven\nSo I started to do some geographical research some topic graphical some weather\nAnd I started to bring this together and then I went up there and make contact with the group of police that a police background I approach them and I said hey maybe you can break down some doors for me\nNot going to not going to stretch the truth I'm going to tell the truth and every witness that comes forward they're going to have to write an affidavit to what they saw under penalty of perjury\nAnd I wanted to raise the bar on the topic a little bit so that that would be no question about what was stated because they sign it and there'd be no question about it for the story was fabricated because it was done under perjury\nI think it's true the reality is when it\nWas a scientist who reads that science find the paper they know that\nThose hundred and ten ... self tell a story that phenomenal\nWhen we come back we're going to get into that a little bit more and then jump into specifics from ... new book big bought Wildman and giants is Harry noon and night the night night I mean big but ... hair take us into the brick\n\nHarry

[noise]\n\n\n\nWell come back we're talking with David polite us about big wild man the giants the newest book an archive of articles that go way back to sixteen eighty a describing these creatures people whatever you want to call them\nAnd before the break David Was explaining how he and some colleagues had collected up a whole bunch of samples dozens and dozens of samples that were submitted to\nMarry a a very precise DNA kind of testing the paper that was written by Dr Melba catch them maybe had some personal um eh observations that didn't belong in the paper but the\nThe DNA evidence David Was rock solid right\n[noise] well that's the part that I don't think a lot of people understand it wasn't from ale treatment it was\nIt was the best of the best the DNA was sent to or certified lab so to ensure that there was no mistake on the Web has got the same results [noise] uh it was analyzed by a series of people it was [noise]\nIt went through so many hurdles was unreal there's a there's a couple of outsiders\nRight now doing research on DNA and you can see 'em on TV and they said oh you know the DNA has come back as bears et cetera\nAnd one of the things that nobody did that most researchers and DNA so called experts are not doing right now\nIs that when the hair samples came in they went to a hair and fiber expert before they went to DNA to ensure that they came back as big foot her\nThat you could think that you're around and maybe a coyote or bird is right near you when in reality it's going to be them and they have this incredible ability to mimic anything that they want\nWith incredible strength in size and when they said that there another tribe of people\nThis community in the big foot world that is very adamant that they're an ape\nThrows this completely off the wall and when you dig deeper in it most Native American tribes in fact probably Ninety nine percent say it's another type of people will try and this article goes right to that point and nobody was ever written a book before tribal ever brought that out\nAnd when I when I found it\nI couldn't believe that nobody was talking about it and it it's stunning still that nobody wants to talk about it\nYeah I Wonder what those tribes if they're still around would say about it now\nYears later nine years while I can\nI can tell you that being around tribes in the mid west and in the west like Harvey and I were it's consistent they still say that it's a type people\nYou know the descriptions of course as you have noted that the term big what started in Nineteen fifty eight so before then people in other words for it and it and then many or most of the early clippings and stories that you have collected they call them wild man of course I guess that would fit I mean\nThey they're humanoid shape they're out in the forest there Harry\nUm they don't know what else to call them\nSo walk for like a man walked upright and doesn't walk bent over and their knuckles aren't dragging on the ground like an ape um\nIf I I always tell people I said well if it's an animal then it's probably going to be found and it's probably going to be identified and you could probably go view and study\nAnd wild man ... that's a different sort of thing it's a different kind of topic very elusive a ... I don't know anybody that's claimed to have studied them in the wild walking into the wilderness and found a spot and studied them year after year\nSo they have intelligence that's quite a bit different than the average animal quote unquote that you see in the woods\nAnd even the animals on the eighth gorilla et cetera side of the equation totally different they they act different they walk different they look different\nAnd one thing that everyone has to think about it's never in North America have there been any wild ape gorilla bones found ever but we have how odd while or giant human bones found\nIn ... that you really make you think\nYou know some of the descriptions in the articles are ... are made me chuckle a little bit because the writers who have no ... but the topic of course because it's new to them they're they're explaining it\nMust have been old Fred's so and so who disappeared into the forest a couple of years ago and now he's grown hair all over his body\nThat I [laughter] I traveled with you on those and I think people are scratching to bring in some rationality to an irrational observation\nUm and the parts of the country where these things are seen you know get way way below zero it snows of how Fred that decided to leave his farm going to live and that type of environment\nAnd and grow hair all over his body like that a snake long hair you mentioned in the in the clip that I was reading there from the late Seventeen hundreds you had a notation at the bottom\nThat said maybe this is what Daniel Boone saw ah I didn't see the Daniel Boone any Daniel Boone story in here other than that reference that you made but he had an encounter is a fairly famous encounter right\nThat's correct and uh I I couldn't find an archive news article about it but I saw other secondary and third level things that were written about what Daniel called I I think it was a Yahoo\nYeah and the description was pretty close and I don't know it's it sure seemed possible but again if you went into the quote unquote credible archives you're really not going to find that you have to do really deep and and\nFind out what maybe some explorers wrote about that they heard in which he encountered so but again and tribal Bigfoot I've written about things where an explorer from the ... church\nWas coming across country on his horse\nAnd he wrote in his explore notes that this thing came up to them while he's on his horse and looked him I actually spoke to him\nLarge hairy by pet he'd never seen before that matched the description of a wild man or a big foot and it came from the archives with the latter day church butter de saint church and it's in there so\nTo say that these things haven't happened ridiculous\nOn the first entry the oldest entry comes to us from Jacques ballet you wrote about it and have a clip from September Seventeen sixteen eighty it was a reported in his book wonder in the sky\nA large black wildlife mass landed in a field releasing a huge here cupboard being that was seen briefly and disappeared now that's the kind of thing that will drive um big foot people who think it's an ape just crazy\n[laughter] you know I I'm not sure how many people listening actually bought a ... a book on or about this but when I was going through it\nI I like to think I'm a mile wide and an inch deep I like to read about different things that could be associated with topics I'm doing research on and what I read this I'm Phil over and said wow I don't think anybody's ever heard of this and uh his book which was a Kickstarter project\nRight um which kind of did the same thing with the UFO topic that I did on this big topic it\nWas a stunner I again I don't think a lot of people want to hear this\nYeah I I uh I was part of that project and um and supported it\nUh it's a tremendous book people can find it anywhere they should check it out we're talking with Dave politeness about his latest work big foot Wildman and giants archive articles sixteen eighty to Nineteen twenty two\nGreat stuff packed into here we're going to take a short break and come back and sometime in the next hour all open up the phone lines

nice twenty and one oh four seven am [noise]\n\n\n\n... you know looking back at your ... your original book the hoop a project that it's still all these years later I don't think there's anything quite like it in in the field and you look at these drawings by Harvey Pratt\nUh these look like human faces these are individual faces that he's drawn a forensic drawings based on witness descriptions are\nThey looked like a people are just big hairy people but people\nDo I think that's the general consensus that a\nSort of matches what other tribes have stated all across the U.S and uh\nWhen you try to find a group of people that have been here hundreds and hundreds of years and occupy the land to to find a group that says they're an animal I never could find it and you know again I have no dog in the fight I'm willing to listen to anything but that just isn't there\nYou look back at the Patterson gambling film I and it's you know if people can argue about it all they want as far as I'm concerned that has not been debunked but that that being in that film looks closer to a gorilla or eight\nNot exactly a match but it's closer to it than some of the creatures or the the beings that that that you're you have drawings up in this and the beings that are described in the in in the uh the new book as well I mean I'm\nYou know they're very close to human like just much larger\nOne I did with ah again one film it and one thing Harvey has the ability yet if let's say somebody goes into a bank\nRob the bank has a beard on as a hat on and they're caught on camera leaving larvae have this innate ability to take the beard off the face she can see what the face looks like so you can identify the suspect\nSo apply that to the Paterson given one film Harvey took the hair off the face a Paterson given by ... it's in tribal Dick for it and it ... it looks like a Native American man\nI guess the argument could be made and probably has been made there are different types there are different tribes which is why some of the descriptions are so different I mean you have\nYou know in the history of the phenomena you have reports of different colors different sizes in your accounts and news clippings from over the last couple of centuries there are male and clearly distinctions between male and female specimens that are seen right\nWell I I think people forget how different humans are\nAre in my presentation to conferences I sometimes will take a variety of photos of Amazon tribal members\nAh people from northern Ukraine uh people from China and I put these pictures up there\nAnd it's it's phenomenal how different human look they are some type of human as I think they are then it it just follows ... with what we understand about our own people\nYeah if you were a space aliens you came here and and went back home and describe what humans looked like a ... you know you might have some trouble uh they can't all look like that you know from its 'cause we we bury so differently in these clips you have some of them that are pretty short I don't remember where it is in the in the book but\nThere was a an incident where somebody's camp fire their camp kept being ... while they're out in the woods somewhere\nSo they they waited ... at work in the bushes to wait to see what came and did it and the as I recall the creatures that came it was one or two they were short they were like ... five or six feet tall not to ten or twelve feet tall but covered with hair and they were just signed a playing with fire\nTo think about\nUh let's say a twelve year old kid\nWho doesn't have much association with fire not a grown adult comes into the fire is playing with it because they have this unique opportunity that's kinda what I was thinking as I read that article from California\nUh I think from the mid Eighteen hundreds and I think it was a hunter they knew something was messing around but he couldn't figure it out for you waited on originally and they came in and he saw this\nAnd the um it's not unusual that hunters and campers and other things in the woods\nThese things do an unusual things other times or they're seen them awake\nPlaying like kids in the water um it's again the behavior that you read about reminds you sometimes have children and especially when the sizes match proportionally a smaller Bigfoot you think well must be young kid\nThe attitudes are different in different reports to a generally not hostile shy want to get away from people when they encounter him but they can be pretty nasty when provoked a there's a phenomenon it's reported in several these clubs where they throw rocks big rocks that humans do sort of chased him off\nA and there's one report I think it's I I forget where it is in the book off to look for a of a big boy that's supposedly killed a hunter right that was the first one you've found\nOh it was ... and you know sometimes I question the credibility of some of these articles because who side how did they get to those conclusions um was there any evidence left behind these older articles or sometimes tough to get to the root of where they came from or how they came to those conclusions\nAnd I don't I don't put a lot of emphasis on that but in the near term I've never found a big foot nowadays that's conclusively killed anybody and\nWhen I started writing the missing for one one books there's a lot of erroneous information that I have associated this topic on big for with missing for one one I never have I've never stayed at that I thought the big for was involved in these things\nWhy because I've never read a credible article implying that they did and since the four one one books came out all of a sudden people have started saying oh yeah you know this campsite these campers were killed this was happening and I get these once a year or say\nAnd every time I followed up I find that it's not a credible source it never happened yet the myth keep perpetuating on the Internet and they're not true and\nSome people believe all you know it's a cover up\nBut as someone who has spent an enormous amount of time in these rural areas with these rural sheriff's deputies\nOf people do not give a damn about what the federal government thinks about their behavior and trying to convince them to keep their mouth shut it's never going to happen they will tell the truth and you're the feds aren't going to be able to keep 'em clamped up\nSo when you hear these stories are these campers were killed by something really mysterious if it was happening I'd hear about from these guys and they say half the time they say it never happened it's a completely phony story so\nI get emails I I can imagine what your emails or like but I get them or just because people know that we know each other or why doesn't ... go ahead and admitted big with its kidnapping people\nAnd I I Would have to say this uh Dave there are some accounts in this book these newspaper clippings where there are references to these huge wild men carrying all women and children you know there are never any names attached to it though you know no no and that's a that's\nThe tough part of it how can you how can you leverage it as credible if supposedly they were getting carried off who shot and why aren't the names there and if somebody's writing about it and say it\nSeems to be a there are instances where and in these accounts where\nA humans who are not aggressive and don't take shots at these animals are not only do they describe them as a I think it's is gay they describe ... gay and I don't think it's in the context of gay as we used the term these days but gay humor is what they said like a friendly\nAnd the number of times I have heard a hunter say there's no way I could shoot it it looked to human\nIt ... I I have never heard of a hunter say oh yeah I had to kill this thing I shot it in the head or it it looked like an animal I've not heard that and I've heard the human side of it from a fireman\nA policeman credible credible sources that continually say the same thing and it isn't just one time in history goes way back in history or so there's something to this they got got skew where they said they started looking like him or apes in animals and\nAs you know Georgia's this segment of the big foot world that wants to go out and kill one and\nI don't have any idea why they think they need to kill one may be some kind of over loaded on testosterone but they they should wake up to the reality they're never going to kill them but it's not going to happen\nThere are some uh reports of where these people claimed to have killed one or they've captured a wild man and they brought him back somewhere on the ship or they've got him in jail and hey invariably he gets away or the evidence disappears however\nSo I'm dogs [laughter] I I think when you get the trust of some of these dairy farmers way out in the middle they are going to tell you the same thing 'cause I've heard it many times\nUm you know there are some funny stories I they're not in this book but I've recalled I think you and I have talked about before about big what are what they eat and they'll you know they're kind of particular this image of a big what milking a cow a sticks in my head but I mean they've been known to eat a lot of berries and different kinds of fruits\nUm do they eat meat as far as you know\nAccording to the tribal people who are seen them take deer et cetera they're an omnivore\nAnd many times when the natives are in the middle of the woods hunting themselves they'll come across a deer that stuck up in a tree and like a two hundred and fifty pounds here a native ... could have done it and\nThey don't know how it got way up in the trees and it's a tornado or hurricane zone so how did it get their\n... big foot wild bend the giants as the book in a moment we'll open up the phone lines are with your calls and questions and comments white flag into the break your own coast to coast am\n...\nFind out more about so many gifts to log on to ...\nUse radio nine twenty ...\nYou've taken seriously\nFrom our our nation was on a heavy heart offering harsh long slide out than all devices legal weapons into machine guns so we are not afraid of what happened was just\nSo happens here on news radio nine twenty ...\nNews ...

I Want everyone to think about what was the percentage of people in the wilderness\nIn Nineteen sixty seven they had the ability to take a film or anything while they were in the wilderness it was minute that I think about today\nNobody has ever come close to taking video or film of a ... foot in the wilderness for a minute and a half like they got on that PG film yet today there's probably close to a hundred percent of everybody in the wilderness carrion shortfall\nWhich has the ability to catch that so I Want everyone to understand that I Do believe the person film is real\nWhy haven't we caught despite that on film and that quality of a location and segment like they did in sixty seven there was something phenomenal about that event that caused that female big foot to stay there\nBecause every other time they immediately run they won't look at the camera like this one did they won't hang around and lingering knowing that people are watching him something unusual

uh had activity in one area and set a camera up it would move somewhere else and it goes back to sort of the question that one of the callers asked about drones say you had a drone that had heat

in us naval history the two authors are Sarah ... and the claim documentary filmmaker one of the world's leading experts on the USS Indianapolis she became obsessed with the story at the age of Thirteen\nAnd over the next two decades she met and interviewed one hundred and seven\nOf the ships survivors she produced an award winning documentary film about the disaster\nAnd a has a lot of other research still researching this story Lynn Vincent is the number one New York times best selling writer of eleven non fiction books with more than sixteen million copies in print\nShe's a veteran journalist and author of more than a thousand articles has done investigative pieces that have been so I did before Congress and the U.S Supreme Court\nI'm Sarah and Lynn welcome to the program uh I I'm blown away by your book grey tabby here\nRight here from dark\nSarah I'd like to start with you how did you get hooked on the story at age Thirteen or most teenagers at Thirteen or not reading about the USS Indianapolis\n[noise] well actually it was a documentary that I saw um I was watching it with my dad it was about the Pacific war and they reduced the story of the ship to a single line which was the ship that carry the bomb and suck [laughter]\nAnd I had to know more about it and so you know at the time there was no Google or anything like that so I actually had to go to the library [laughter]\nImagine that and you know they're looking to what was available at the library I still couldn't find anything so I I Will someone's got to tell the story you know from what I did learn about it it was very interesting and I think there was a lot of mystery surrounding it and so I\nYou know I thought out what I could ... I thought you know someone will tell this story before I'm old enough to do it and you fast forward graduated from college and then well no one told the story you know the right way\nSo I sat out the survivors and found Paul Murphy who is chairman of the survivors organization at the time and he invited me to a reunion and that's where I actually got to meet the man who survived Indianapolis and I mean yeah I was\nA kid who was a meeting her heroes for the first time and\nThey exceeded all expectations and they took me and kind of became like family though and they have a couple of years later after I had spent time with them and visited them at their homes they asked me to be their storyteller and that kind of the cliff notes version of it\nAnd Lynn for you how did you uh hook up with Sarah on working on this project you've done so many other books I I Would imagine that being able to write the true story and correct\nWide and great misperceptions a and strike a blow for justice for the for some of the key characters would be um an amazing draw for you\nWell it was a very high and high tech from either way I got involved when I had actually been praying I'm I pray that my work and I hope and pray to have\nAn opportunity to work on an iconic ... story and all of it that in two thousand and all that and additive I get this email from it and some ... ... well what they didn't say about her journey with an apple is with that I'm\nGoing into an apple is a storyteller she wanted to render the story as his reign play and she actually did that she wrote a part in a very interesting too and major production company and they have that that we found a brother\nThat we only they here even\nThough you're getting ready for the screenwriter I don't know how to write a family and friends she raised fat and and they contact with me\nAnd I'm you know number one that I'm a veteran they didn't know that I had and praying for an opportunity to do a story like this one um\n[noise] and\nMy only problem was is that she was wanting to fight and I wanted to help her right [laughter] [noise] so uh my\n... that I had had him and making later in the way help or fat or eventually over the course of several\nMonths we finally met and then a ... agreed to work on it together and we didn't really get started in earnest into twenty four and um and then when we get a project and a half\nSo Sarah where you are on a campaign to right or wrong that the story had been wrong that a lot of the the people who had who were key players had been treated unfairly is that how you started or you didn't know about that when you started\nI didn't you know I I knew a small part of that um that was definitely\nOf what I wanted to tell but really I mean the major objective was to tell the whole story of this shit you know she'd been reduced to\nThinking story or shark story and knowing she was this incredible ship that admiral Brent commanded you know most of the Pacific war and the campaign that have participated in from her deck\nOr that Roosevelt took her on the first cruise you know us acting president ever left the country on so it was so much more it's like well you know everyone's gotta know what an incredible shift this was in what she did a besides being sent [noise]\nWell I'll tell you you grab me ... my father was a at Okinawa and he ... he drove a landing a craft from those ships took good troops on the shores so of course you know the the fact that the Indianapolis was involved in those complex grab my attention I'm imagining him being there and some of the scenes that you describe\nI'm Lynn why don't we start with you describe in a sort of the ... the capitalized version of what the world knows about the the USS Indianapolis and then we'll go to Sarah to uh give us the version that did you guys have helped uncover\nOkay that would be great um Indianapolis as Sarah mentioned will was the fifth the Fifth Fleet flags shed and I'm\nA small park that a lot of people don't know is that she was the flagship at the battle of south now where your father drove the landing craft and I'm\nIn the weeks leading up to the the actual invasion she was participating in the shore of environment and during that time and march very first Nineteen forty five she was hit by a kamikaze\nNine men were killed twenty six injured and that was what really sent her on this fateful journey had that not happened she might have gone down in history as victorious flagship of the world war two specific theater um victorious at us and now as well as nine other major battle\nAnd and the last couple of years after the war running down all the material that they hear the Germans where you try to develop their own atomic on\nA on the continent if you're\nOne way and then burn and very component little boy on an island\nUm data idle breathing yet or you're an end the conflict and in writing the book we tried to pull back a man can bring in a

saying we tried to present the Japanese point of view in a sympathetic way I'm meaning that they were\nActing out of there since their conscience and conviction and so um we were able to make great use the ... um\nWell it was it and then more for that was published after the war who first shift in Nineteen fifty two and Japanese language and it was later published by Henry Holt and the safety or here in America in English\nAnd it was really an examination of Japanese submarine warfare in World War two that written from men are hashing modus point of view and there was a chapter on his devoted to Indianapolis\nThat because we were looking at the larger Pacific War I mean and is there as World War two in general we were able to really develop his personality a lot\nHe was the commander who cared for his men he was the commander who was very very frustrated with the state of technology on Japanese that Marines and really against protocol at the time because Japanese had a very autocratic top down military\nUm he went around Bain on doors asking for radar and more technology for his that marine because that makes that Marines didn't have radar right up until the end of the war and so he was very frustrated because he was saying a lot of his brother said commanders\nAbout Fifteen men on a floater net and those are the kinds of nets that had the cork pieces throughout the net to

rescue I mean part of\nThe rescuers accounts because by the time that they're a rescuer arrived the men were really in ... they were able to tell or know what was happening by that point in the story but\nYou know the rescuers are reporting that they're fighting off sharks are literally punching sharks in the face to be able to pull men bored\nBecause the shark attacks increased as the I guess [laughter] you know I don't know\nHow much sharks ... things but they said it seemed as they were pulling the men from the water the shirts um the attacks increased and you know this is\nI Can't

wiggling toes as bait to learn the sharks and catch one [laughter] and then you know he kind of came to a sense is that the last minute and realized oh this is probably not a good idea but you know he was nearly out of his head at this point and put a stock back on quickly and\nManaged to stay safe you know so they\nWere doing the worst thing [laughter]\nSo some of the worst effects Lynn are happen to those people who drink the water they just went completely crazy\nYeah that was really chilling to me because you know here\nYou know if you can imagine they're they're on their ship ah everyone knows it's almost the end of the war they were having this leisurely a sale they think across the Philippines the\nUm and then you know the next thing they know they're trying to survive this horrible ordeal these these young sailors who were just playing pranks on each other the day before\nAnd then by the second day forty eight hours then now we were talking about the hoarding of water but as Sarah mentioned there were only a sixteen\nRap between there were there were four groups was it three groups that there were four groups of four rap or three groups of four rats in any case\nThere were four groups of four raft but then the one group split apart on the second day okay that's right\nSo so there were so any water that was available was only available on the raft and so there were only about forty men among all these hundreds and hundreds of men who had any water at all and so by you know the second day in and the third day and\nThey were starting to get very desperate from dehydration and so\nThere were some men who absolutely knew not to drink the salt water no matter how Thursday thank God but there were others\nWho although they knew that the sun and the exposure and the dehydration itself was perversely causing them to lose their faculties lose their ability to reason\nSo some of them to come to the idea that they could strain the salt out of the water and so you see one sailor holding up the torn piece of his shirt\nOr while the other one poured the water through it into this into his mouth and thinking that that would strain the salt out well of course that didn't and then others would you take small for it is that the sea water\nI'm hoping that no one would see them and talk them out of it but then eventually they would just begin gold thing it like they were hoping it out of the mountain stream\nAnd what happened with this is a condition called ... and\nBought that food or\nBlood cell ... from the brain um brain short circuit just like when a tree branch falls on a high voltage line and they would just go out of their heads and um they die very horrible deaths from drinking the water\nYou know you have the the Japanese commander um who decides oh let's get outta here because he figures there's no way the ship is here by itself or something else has to be around you that or it was out of sight all of a sudden and he thinks oh it must have gone away or\nHe couldn't imagine I guess it immediately that it'd sunk quickly so he leaves I'm which is I guess fortunate because they could have surfaced and finished them off\nYou have a somewhere I was a pilot who winds up testifying at the court marshal later\nOr an American pilot who saw what he thought was a battle he ended up telling somebody about it but no one paid attention uh we got to go to a break in about a minute maybe a bart Sarah you want to talk about that guy\nYeah there was a gentleman by the name of Richard With friends and he was an army pilot he was transporting a general who wanted and you know that the general up in the cockpit within minutes late night patrol you know it's just after midnight\nAnd they see that you know kind of explosion coming from below and there's no reports coming in saying that there's any kind of enemy action though he thinks well maybe this is true or something of that nature but yeah I get the same kind of out of sorts for him so he said well you know report it\nAnd he did actually try to report it a couple of time\nAnd yeah the army side of things that will let the navy do whatever they're doing just ignore it\nAnd have still want to hear a navy personnel at Guam I Believe [laughter] you know hey I thought it should anyone look into it and they said no there's nothing reported in the area don't worry about it\nAnd so you know there's actually more to the story with that where you know they his son\nWho you know this gentleman Richard ... to have passed away but his son carried on a story and you know there he actually had diary entries of the time and we're at the ... and it didn't line up with it but he didn't find out and tell a few days after when were released about it that he would\nWe're talking about ... about Indianapolis the true story of the worst disaster in us naval history in a moment we'll talk about sort of the aftermath it's amazing that anyone survive but there

will be there\nAnd then you know to be fair to the navy the entire focus on the pending invasion of the Japanese home islands so all of these things along with the lack of distress signal combine to make it in Indianapolis but crack\nAnd it wasn't until I pity one ensure honor piloted by lieutenant check when um it happened to be flying over the area that the survivors but in the water\nThere is a very poignant story you tell in the books or a about these pilots that they've dropped all the supplies and trying to uh give these guys in the water or something you hang onto their they can't do
