will have like tour films since you were a kid haven't you\nWell actually and and and briefly let me just say that William Castle wanted to direct a a\nRosemary's Baby but he had such a reputation of doing gimmicky movies that they didn't let him do that but yet\nWhen I was a kid [noise] uh I was terrified of these I mean I I I was like in my Spiderman pajamas a you know just sweating under the coffee table\nShaking with year I'd have to go into the other room I was the kind of kid that when the skipper we yell at Gilligan during Gilligan's Island I Would have to get out of the real you know it was a little too little too hot when skipper with yoga and whether it's ... you know\nAnd we were watching it blew my dad and I I think what a lot of movies that bonding thing you know fathers son\nKind of on the same way I was going to talk about that and I I Will but you're exactly right\nAnd and I think it kind of a rite of passage you know and and I think originally I was watching the movie the kind of be with my dad and that he would be in the recliner watching creature features that I'd be next to him or hiding behind the recliner some time [noise]\nAnd I think that having heroic women in these movies that evening star wars you know and now a doctor who was a woman I think that you know it's a it's a it's a these are women are still spending their money on media physical media on movies\nAnd they're they're controlling that dollar and I think we're going to see a lot of wind five five films with strong female will\nThrow throw out some percentages I'm going to give you some age brackets here among those who are Fifteen Years old to Twenty one percent of them do you think go to movies\n[noise] probably none [laughter] not really [laughter] Fifteen to twenty\nFifteen to Twenty years old I I I I Would I Would say forty percent I bought that alright twenty to thirty\nTwenty to thirty I Would say uh I Would maybe I maybe I knew that a little higher maybe maybe fifty percent\nThirty to forty percent usually [noise]\nThirty to forty I Would say I would say larger I Would I Would guess maybe sixty five\nReally okay now I think it's such coming down forty to fifty years old\nForty to fifty years old I think it yeah I think it would really come down I Would think that may be may be twenty percent fifty to sixty\nAnd I would have probably even less and I don't know maybe the fifth year old might be hanging in there but I think maybe the six year olds and ... and beyond are probably a much much more likely to um enjoy a film in their home and the trouble with going to a theater\nOne of the things we'll do just for fun next hour when we take calls for you is we'll ask the callers if they want to share their age it's up to them and bone only willing whether they go to movies or not I can't remember the last movie I went to\nI mean I I look at a lot at home on video I ... when you know they come out as a news new release or something I'll watch it um but I I Can't remember the last time I was in an actual silly I\nDo enjoy I Do enjoy seeing a film and theater with an audience but a lot of\nTime that you ... and that's your ... your business so I I'm\nI'm biased because I'm watching the audience most I\nThat's what you do so that's one of the things we'll do folks who'd take calls next hour and addition to your question your horror story of your favorite film if you want to give us she'd give time your age when you call in and uh let's ask you if you will when the last time you went to a movie or you know it's interesting\nSeemed to about movies how they have changed over the years I mean in the thirties and forties you had these grand musicals and these\nIncredible songs and people were chance seen on them in the movies man those those days are gone\nMaybe it'll come you never know maybe they'll come back you know maybe George you know maybe you should talk to your capture you and I could make up all singing dancing

so um you know the the the people who are flow wall and they would they would buy the theater out you know they would they would show up in town with a film under their arm a scary movie\nAnd they they they would rent the theater out [noise] uh after hours and they would show these are shows mainly for teenagers are usually teenagers who wanted an AK ... and sometimes rowdy ah rowdy teenagers too\nAnd sometimes they did have matinees for kids to 'em but then they would they have these amazing blackouts where they turn the lights out maybe have looming asked him ghosts made out of a mop

when they have the toast everyone throws a piece of toast at the screen\nOf people have call and response where they're yelling things up at the screen or you know there's rice prone during the wedding and I think it's an immersive experience but I also because of the actuality of the film you know people who are sixteen Seventeen years old and are kind of emerging into their adult life\nIt's kind of a nod he saying that they can go into with their friends and you know they might uh accidentally see a little scanner so [laughter] so I think that all that factored in and and you have a you\nKnow people who who met that who met each other a sixteen year old a Rocky Horror and ended up getting married as adults as I've I've seen that that I've seen the shadow cast in the states for a performance that goes along with the movie performed very very different markets all over the country\nAnd ... over and over again I flew people who have met at that show and gotten\nMarried so

than three decades Dr ... serves as a president a mirror to send a senior fellow at the Institute of ... sciences at the late ... foundation\nAnd her latest work at deaths makes life possible revolutionary insights on living dined in the continuation of consciousness and Marilyn welcome back good to have you get\nThank you George it's got to be here and how are you what's new I'm Glad it's\nBeen a wild ride I think that we're living in an extraordinary time saying why now and that just trying to keep balance and stay on the cutting edge\nHow did you end up doing what you're doing how does that happen\n[noise] well I started when I wasn't a rebellious kid in Detroit and feeling like I wanted to change the world but had no way to do that and that I had a couple of experiences started with uh being somewhere I shouldn't have been with somebody I shouldn't have been with\nA closing time in the bar on the back of a motorcycle and we got hit by a drunk driver room my body off\nA motorcycle and um I had a real physical tangible out of body experience and watched my body tumbling through the air landing on the concrete and\nI think there was something in that moment that suggests that any way that consciousness is more than just their physical bloom\nAnd then I went home to heal and they had talked about possibly amputated my leg and I lay there and I used my imagination to visualize my immune system healing me and I was you know really aware\nOf the tangles up my lab ... you know now I have two sturdy legs and I think that consciousness is something our fault\nAnd we're going to talk about you your first experience near death experience you were just a year and a half year old weren't you\nKnow that's true I was wandering\nAround my family's house in my ... and being a good in Paris too which means you investigate everything\nThat you have those little feet pajamas I think so I don't really remember it but I've heard\nTales and ah anyway my father had inadvertently left a can of lighter fluid sitting on a\nKitchen table my God [laughter] and you know I did what good Eighteen month old kids do and I put it in my mouth and I ended up in and out of intense drink\nI drink it and it causes massive pneumonia and I almost didn't make it so I think that there were some seeds planted then too that got me on this path of wanting to understand\nConscious embody once you were around I guess that's a nice way to think about\nYou do know I was born in Detroit and raise their unless there when I was twenty eight years old\nI think I knew that but I didn't remember in town now so tell me where was\nThat I was born in the city and then we ended up moving to Dearborn Heights\nA war we spent most of my childhood and then my first places I was in Taylor, Michigan Farmington Hills and then worked in all three television stations in Detroit to four and seven\nAnd then in Nineteen Seventy nine I moved to Nineteen Seventy eight I moved to a Minneapolis a Nineteen Seventy nine I moved to St Louis knowing back and forth between St Louis in Los Angeles how about you know\nWell I was right in Detroit right near city airport and ah it was about the time I figured out I could leave that I left and you know I still have a lot in style Jeff for Detroit and a lot of admiration for the people that are trying to make a difference there\nFamily still there I have some family um they moved out to Paris and township where I had my motor motorcycle accident\nUh-huh airborne height really yeah well if\nYou tell me where cars you must remember the the the street\nOh I don't I doubt who was a bit was at a busy street yeah it was the history but it was late and I think the trauma kind of over are going to I'm going to I'm going to close my eyes in yes you'll remote dealing now\nThat you were on telegraph road\nThat sounds that sounds about right\nNear Michigan viewing skill new Michigan avenue\nYeah that sounds about right I Can't remember exactly to say for sure but I'm sure there's records\nOf it while you're ... you're back here my gosh\nYeah well thank you my friend I preach\nSo did this all ... really steer you in the direction where you are now I mean you've got a PHD and social anthropology you've just been elected\nVice president of a psychological shows you usually get into that this would lead the foundation for you\nWell I think it really started when I got to Wayne State University in downtown Detroit which will remember\nAnd timers the Detroit\nUh-huh good one oh really so that is right downtown no um [noise] well I discovered to books when I got into college in the first one was Thomas Coons book\nCalled the structure of scientific revolutions and that book said that we live in a paradigm or a world view a kind of social construction of reality and that that world view has changed periodically through history\nAnd that was a big empowerment for me because I felt like well maybe what we're experiencing in Detroit this you know kind of civil war that was going on the race war and class war and gender war and ultimately a world view conflict I think that\nUm maybe it wasn't permanent and maybe wasn't defined by ultimate reality so that was liberating and then that led me to the second book which was psychic exploration by Edgar Mitchell the Apollo fourteen\nNow you're not regard and I didn't apply for the job at no at sciences but it was about Mm Fifteen Years later that they invited me to come and be there director of research and worked my way up the ladder from their\nNon Europe show for your university no\nThat's right we are looking at ... personal experiences and from a psychological lens\nNow what is the trench personal cycle what is the\nStuff you're interested in George it's all that kind of notion that there are aspects of our experience that transcend the physical\nThat people can have these kind of altered states or near death or out of body type of experiences and it doesn't mean it's pathological it means that may be a catalyst for some big breakthrough to understanding more about who we are and what the nature of reality might be\nMore with Dr Merrill Lynch ... just like the beer run is really only\nWell it's you know it comes from an old brewery village in Germany ... but uh actually ... brewery what she'll remember\nRemember the Troy lists\nAnd so the beer that made Milwaukee famous actually is now a Detroit beer at least last time I checked\nThe do the huge do college which we're you know I don't know I haven't really ... yeah so I'm sure\nRight although micro breweries have taken over\n... what have you know what have you learned about near death experiences above the other side watching what can you conclude at this point\nWell I Know that culture takes a big role in defining what we experience so if we're told our entire life through our educational system and our families are work environment\nThat the only real valid reality is the physical you know that which we can measure and manipulate and touch and taste\nA son that's usually what we see and if we are brought up in a world your a culture that except\nExtended realms of possibility then we're more likely to perceive those realms of possibility and some of it may be a cultural construction but I also believe\nVery definitely that there are more aspects of our human experience than just our physical embody met\nYou people can tap into this and use it in their living life I think they can do some remarkable things without don't you\nI really do I think that if we start to own the power of our intention\nYou know the fact that the intention is a very important principle so from the morning when we get out of bed and we intend to make up a path or a plan going forward that's an expression of intention\nUh and then what about those big intentions where we want to achieve something\nYou know beyond our normal capacity that becomes a tremendous empowerment and so to the extent we can begin to cultivate these abilities I think the more we'll be able to accomplish those dreams that many of us have\nHave you come across any doing much do ... [laughter]\nEvery day more and more [laughter] I think there's just so many mysteries and again you think about what these different cultures\nExpect from the world and you know being in the Amazon for example I spent some time with the actual are in Ecuador and you know they really do believe that at night they're consciousness leaves the body when they're dreaming and\nThat makes it really easy\nFree zone email newsletters out six days a week there was a great way to keep up on all the east coast\nWe do program recaps fascinating to the street in this upcoming info and weekly free audio groups must have caused resign Oklahoma goes to goes to um dot com home\nRadio nine twenty or so\n[noise]\nWe walk home\nRock and roll lovers any west here to you on a journey back to this week in rock and roll history\nBack in Nineteen sixty two where the beach boys released their first album surfing safari which includes their debut single surface this week in Nineteen Seventy one rod Stewart started a five week run it number one on the U.S singles charged with Maggie May reasons to believe at least two sections of course\nWhich was [noise]\n\nCould be the most expensive night of your life getting pulled over for both driving could cost you a room ten thousand dollars in fines legal fees increased insurance rates nothing kills the bugs like getting pulled over for bus driving\nBecause both driving drunk driving\nRookie by the national Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the council\nFox News I'm Carmen Robert\nPresident Trump expressing confidence to send it will confirm his nominee to the Supreme Court yet as the Senate prepares devote Saturday Republicans and Democrats are far apart is process he'd been ruined by fear\nAnd under headed gamesmanship for too long\nGone boss just showed up to a discussion about\nRain by Republican\nSenator Mitch McConnell and democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren and just a few hours the Nobel Committee will announce the winner of the highly rusty just end sometimes controversial peace prize among the nominees this year the Syrian aid group White Helmets\nAnd Edward Snowden this is Fox News\nNow you're storm team ten forecast powered by Dunkin' Donuts maple but counter pumpkin ice coffee only two dollars for two to six PM some early clubs friday\nBut mostly sunny and feeling like all ties in the low sixties in the afternoon or Chile night overnight low in mid forties for most of us under mainly clear sky mostly sunny Saturday mid sixties partly sunny Sunday hides in the mid seventies I'm storm team leader all just marks or all news radio nine twenty and one oh four seven at them\n\n\n[laughter]\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n\nDo\n\nYou are listening\nTo the coast to coast\nHundred and Seventy five people to do and we get Seventy nine\nThousand of paranormal day dot com my goal of courses eighty thousand people that we've got a couple of get married it's something for you to meet people who understand you ever go to dinner with somebody and started talking about ghosts they\nMight get up and leave so you want to talk to someone who understands you go to ... dot com it's free to sign up paranormal date\nDodge car\nScience is doing some incredible things these days to make people look even younger\nAging could make a wish for younger days but since we can't go back in time we turned to products to give us a more youthful look no there is instantly a list with immediate results on bags into your eyes\nPours roast beef fine line and wrinkle know needle no pay just a simple cream applied lightly it's great for men and women and can easily be applied before makeup doctors agree instantly ageless works like this clip from the doctors\nBut I Want you want to imagine a cream that can certainly remove here under I bag we're going to put into the past with our good friend Dr Sonia ...\nProduct or even if it works it's called instantly edge slash and the idea that it works very quickly very\nSmall amount and then you pay for you might feel a little bit puffy I had just looked at what's in the products ... and one is called ... which kind of a darling income I tell her the right now at the top tier posts it actually relax to lay off the top to bottom to relax I work like\nThat and I can literally at writing and reading and it's still a cat which act like a clay minerals and they're making the tighter actually increasing tension on the end of that tiny and it had\nInstantly ageless today go to our exclusive website H.

Dutch makes life possible also consciousness and healing as well and Marilyn would you tell us the story of the reincarnation of the little child\nAnd they have found that if people\nAre you know functioning in a in a normal way and they get triggered by some reminder of their mortality it can lead to very pathological types of behaviors\nBut if you can bolster their sense of a personal worth their ... their value in the world and you you enhance their self esteem\nYou'll see that when you trigger them they actually become more altruistic they care about other people so I think if we can approach this idea\n... death and the great mystery of it with an open heart and that kind of skepticism that is productive I think you can become a great exploration and a wonderful adventure for people\nProbably could ... you know did you did you know ... before you left on\nYeah very well regarded worked\nWith him for years wonderful person and ... said in the interview I did with him for death ... possible that you know I mean I was really interested in his story because\nHe was the person who had been fighting in Korea he had been a test pilot and he talked about you know being on those aircraft carriers where\nWhen they would go off on a mission and then they had to come back and find the aircraft carrier in the middle of the ocean it was like a needle in a haystack\nAnd so for him that was a scary moment when he got in the Apollo capsule and went to the moon you said you know there were plenty of space on the moon and it was hard to find [laughter]\nUm but you know his thing that he said that I thought was so wise is that he felt that was much more important\nTo live a good life and to be a good citizen I'm to be loving and kind toward other people than it was to spend a lot of time worrying about what's gonna happen next and I just thought that ... you know its powerful notion and he was a great man\n... we're descended of evidence to prove that there's life after death [noise] if you are like quarter law and ... knew this was challenged ... was challenged ... prove that there's life after\nThis wouldn't make a great reality show and I love Ina courtroom let's do it [laughter]\nSo you have a judge and jury and you have people representing different points of view on controversial topics so take this one you know life after death and you have these people arguing their various position\nWhich witnesses the common goal\nExactly giving their own personal testimony based on their experiences\n... put it right there\nAnd then you get into this question of what one shift\nPeople's mind about that question and is it the data is it the fact that ... Stevenson collected these you know nearly ... thousand cases and showed that thirty five percent of them correlated with the birth ... is that what's going to persuade people or is it the personal experiences that somebody's reporting\nYou know I had a conversation with my departed dad and he told me to go to this closet and find something you know that's really persuasive for people much more than accumulating a lot of data I think\nI think so too ... were those were gonna take phone calls next hour\nAbout life after ... let's talk a little bit Marilyn and the time we have remaining here about consciousness and how important it please and its role ... plays with all of this what would you first of all say consciousness is\nWhy I think uh again we can have many definitions for me it's been about our awareness\nAnd also our lack of awareness of what we're not aware of so by that I mean when I first talked about Thomas Kunz book on paradigm shifts we live in a paradigm or a world view and\nThe interesting thing to me about world views is that we don't even know that we have them and yet they're the most important thing that shapes her experience so it's like we're walking through life with these colored glasses on and it\nIt shaped our experiences and so we can't see those things that lie outside of our expectation\nAnd I think part of the process of becoming aware [noise]\nIs becoming aware that we're not aware\nAnd that we have what's called inattentional blindness for example we are primed to perceive those parts of the world that we expect to see and if we don't expect to see them we simply don't see them and I think that that is a remarkable\nUh aspect of what our consciousnesses all about it's a lot of the functioning on autopilot at the unconscious level\nAnd to the extent we can you know turn the light on what those experiences are and what Shapes Our awareness where we placing our attention that then offers that's the point of liberation and two expanding what we understand to be true\nDo you believe that the consciousness live just outside of the brand\nNew consciousness is\nSomething that has intelligence is self correcting\nIs reflective and so you can go into a rain forest and see that as consciousness manifest in the forest because every nook and cranny is filled with life and with that intention\nTo manifest life and so I I Do believe that consciousness as something much bigger than our individual brain I don't think it's an ... phenomena the brain and at the same time I think the brain has kind of like\nYou know the radio that is taking the signal and so if you destroy the brain you may destroyed the radio it doesn't mean you've destroyed the conscious\nOr the signal or the signal exactly\nThat keeps coming ... exactly ... will will science ever meet\nThe spiritual ...\n[noise] I think so I mean I think we're getting closer and closer all the time I just spent time with Sophia the Android she's a robot\nNew Hartford was her yeah she'd be great for you to interview 'em and see if they would do it in a way that doesn't give me one ... the talk show host this isn't a good [noise] I don't worry you're nobody better than you are George\nWe're we're coming back with phone calls your calls next on coast to coast they\nFind out more about just don't go to ... dot com\n\nRock and roll lovers and send you ... take a trip to this week and rock and roll history\nStart off in Nineteen Seventy eight where the members of Aerosmith bailed thirty fans out of jail after they were arrested for smoking pot during and Aerosmith concert at Fort Wayne Colosseum solve them\nThis weekend Nineteen eighty six popular news anchor Dan Rather was attacked by a man who hit them from behind and repeats the phrase tennis what is the frequency hopping oriental rites a song was the frequency Kenneth\nThis weekend Nineteen eighty seven and a wild twist Smokey Robinson ... the number ... bottom hot one hundred was one ...\nWhile song about him when Smokey things like ABC is the number ...\nThis week in Nineteen Ninety two ... photo ...

people believe there's something there I think people have had\nExperiences that give them a sense of that\nI think that there are a lot of experiences that people report you know beyond the survival of consciousness or identity you know people ... reporting of like pre cognition knowledge of the future\nUh people you know doing what you did about looking into your mind for information about a geographical location hormone viewing paradigm they're all kinds of experiences that people have had that they report regularly and that\nThe majority of our population in including people with\nHigher levels of education report so this isn't just something that people experience who have no education and you know the critics would say you know they just don't know any better uh in fact what it is is something that people have very direct personal experiences about and which can change their lives\nAnd you have written in the book how some people's lives have been changed dramatically through this change\n[noise] yeah I wrote a book\nCalled living deeply the art and science of transformation and we were very interested in trying to understand how people\nCan gain a perspective on life that is richer and full or and less filled with stress and anxiety and how can we do that and we know that a lot of people can become very rigid and fixed in their perspective and opinions but it's also possible that people\nYou know began to shift their perspective and these kinds of experiences\nCan lead to the sense that the world is more expansive and more complex and more\nMysterious then we had previously understood so we started to interview people about it we talked to the mistakes and we talked to the great spiritual leaders and people representing different kinds of\nYou know traditional a ritual practice type of orientation and and now in that we really create a kind of a change model that said to us that there are ways in which we can\nBegin to bring our awareness and our intention to creating our life in ways that are are positive are um imbued with meaning and purpose and that ultimately lead to happier healthier experiences\nHound them were younger people react to these things now what do you think\nWell I think we have seen a generation of people grow up with the media with video games that expand their sense of what they're capable of\nUh there's you know certainly a lot of fascination with I you know horror movies I think you were talking about that last program\nYou know I think our imaginations are very fertile\nI think popular culture has a way of training us and we know that these kinds of topics are extremely interesting for people who choose TV shows or movies to go see\nWhat's that about you know is that about just something that is idle curiosity or is it something that helps them to take a deep dive into their own personal experiences and I think the ladder maybe what's happening\nWell let's take some calls will pick it up are going to Giovanni in Los Angeles on the wild card line either Giovanni\nHey how's it going your great I mean it's been a war yeah\nIt has been a while and I'm always listening I Love the show as always and a doctor Marilyn thank you so much for the work that you're doing on consciousness absolutely necessary your pioneer and I hope you continue doing your work and I hope that this uh this this birth more\nA wonder and and and and after you into this world\nBut uh I just wanted to share that experience of mine that I just really springs to mind when I heard you talk about the about the forests are about the jungle it ended up being a form of consciousness or out of a of kind of a a pure consciousness\nWell my parents are from Nicaragua and uh our our indigenous people are very very uh very rich culture of hum of mysticism and and also ah you know being able to travel and to you know in three dimensional and\nAnd uh and explore the potential of the mind through um through an ancient practices\nAnd so it's been in the olden me over time the practice meditation one uh one one one one moment at one time I'm\nOn my travels I was traveling Nicaragua and in ... and ... and in the correct where there's a a jungle called luck than negative or roughly transmitted the black a jungle and uh this this lack jungle is just is an illusion jungle it\nMost of it as untouched by man very rarely explored still still rich with with a with a with undiscovered I'm\nA lord knows what's out there but when I was in the jungle I sat down to meditate and bombs meditating maybe an hour into my meditation I felt what I believed to be this pure consciousness I stumped the jungle\nCalling me I mean it was so strong that I had trouble breaking for my meditation and and to a certain point I became a little bit hammered a bit fearful because I was I kind of lost control over my ability to extract myself from the meditation for a moment\nAnd I believe that this Peter consciousness was was calling me or or or trying to pull me into it\nSomehow and I wanted to share that consciousness I Do believe that there's more out there absolutely and uh the more we
