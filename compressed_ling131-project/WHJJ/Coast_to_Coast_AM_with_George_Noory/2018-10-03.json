[noise]\n\n\n\nAnd welcome back to coast to coast will take your calls ... ... of your thoughts on whether those global warming climate change we don't muscle you because people have different views Steve New book outside the green box tell me about the titles first of all\nSure well that's a ... this is a book that tells you what's your green consult doesn't tell you a written for general audiences and businesses and a one popular business a phrase use over and over his think outside the box so the\nTitle was think outside the green box because businesses today are are really trapped in the green boxes sustainable development there they are forced to do many things ah that don't really do anything for the environment\nAnd so I go through a what I call first before horsemen of environmental apocalypse a which are overpopulation the idea that humans are growing too fast and and populating the planet too fast or the second one is global pollution the idea that we're increasingly polluting the environment\nIn in my presentations that I say this is the uh the third station the United states has man since Nineteen fifty do know what happened the other two stations\nAnd occasionally somebody come up with a right answer the answer is the other two were buried by snow\nAnd they leave built\nThey built this last station on stilts at seven modular buildings and they they Jack up each building every year over accumulating snow\nAnd that's where Ninety percent of the world's ice is and the south pole climate models cannot explain why the ISIS getting thicker in the south pole but on that we've lost a little bit um if you add it all up but there's there's really no concern or that we're losing large amounts of ice\nIt's a ... it's incredible when these stories come out saying that huge sheets of ice falling off the shelves melting away and everything else\nYeah I mean well you know they knew I knew west\nAntarctic ice sheet but but usually what they don't mention is there are about a hundred volcanoes under that ice sheet so it is possible that west Antarctic ice sheet could melt if we have big volcanic eruptions there but uh this is not being caused by carbon dioxide it's another natural factor\nWhat about the city's not want renewable energy [noise] plus or minus\nYeah this hundred percent renewables thing as I was as I was mentioning the the biggest problem with the wind and solar is their intermittent and they can't read if you're going to maintain continuity of electricity supply they can't replace traditional nuclear gas or coal\n... when you put in solar\nWind or you only get about ten percent of the total capacity as far as adding to the capacity of your system\nSo if you want eighty percent of renewables or a hundred percent renewables you have to build a vast amount of wind and solar\nAnd people are saying batteries vast amounts of of batteries\nSo this means you you've just added a huge expense to your electricity infrastructure\nUh some of the studies\nSay that uh in California for example they were going to triple a the cost of their wholesale electricity and that's going to probably double or or or two and a half times or your total electricity on top\nSo this hundred percent renewable energy sounds good uh practically it's going to be very very very expensive\nLet's talk for a moment Steve again about pollution how bad is the pollution\nActually it's a pretty good news story as I talk about and\nA book you know I talked about landfills landfills used to be a mess yes\nOr no they uh all modern landfills and in Europe and the U.S are lined with a with a a waterproof barrier to keep things from leaking out they're covered with dirt every day to keep a a rats another room and the other way\nUm our air is very much a a cleaner since Nineteen eighty\nAre six major air pollutants are all down at a combined Seventy percent those are the ones that I mentioned the carbon monoxide actress oxide sulfur dioxide or water is is a is not where it ought to be but the great lakes have been cleaned up many of the offshore areas have been cleaned up\nIn Europe at the Rhine River is making a comeback the Daniel rivers as me come back as a matter of fact the interesting thing is people say well energy use as a big problem but it's funny the nations that use the most energy per person\nHave the lowest levels of air and water pollution today and those levels are declining so this idea that using energy causing ... causes pollution really is not accurate the nations that are not able to put energy use effectively\nUm can't use it to reduce their air and water pollution and so they're they're in the worst state\nSo it's really a good news story what we need to do is get get a nations have become more wealthy and then they will start cleaning up there and start cleaning up their water and uh so it it really is a good news story a from a pollution point of view\nNow what's going on Steve because regardless what side of the fence you people are on with climate change why is it so bitter as opposed to dialogue and hey this is my opinion and I appreciate yours it's screaming matches yeah it\nIs kind of remarkable I have a I've spoken at a couple of universities and done a couple of debates but I get turned down about ten times the one I'm going to be up at the grand Valley State Michigan on the twenty fifth of October\nIn it a little thing but it's fairly rare now that that a university will invite\nA climate skeptic to climate discussion [noise] um so it has become very polarized and\nDo you get booted no I've\nNever had a disruptive situation and you know I'm always very respectful and the theory is plausible man made climate change and that we do have a greenhouse effect but over the last Thirty years the data showing that the climate models are wrong they made some assumptions which are wrong so\nSo a natural factors dominate um and we need to go on reducing real pollutants but not not carbon dioxide\nWell see that's what's so important people really need to distinguish the difference between pollution and climate change brought on by cycles this the sun is heating up the solar system itself is warmer than it used to be\nAbsolutely there are the earth is dominated by long term cycles called them a lot of it just cycles which are uh the tilt of earth's axis changes over time the procession of earth's axis are\nAre they orbit around the sun changes and these are like twenty thousand to a hundred thousand year cycles they cause the ice ages then we have medium term cycles every Fifteen hundred years or so that a scientist leave the sun causes\nAnd those are the the fluctuating temperatures so we've had the medieval warm period a thousand years ago when I was very warm um the little ice age in Europe uh about five hundred years ago when they were actually burning people at the stake they thought they were witches and they were causing the cold weather\nAnd our modern warming and then we have short term cycles as well El Nino is an example than the regular cycle every three to seven years\nCycles in the Pacific cycle so the in the Atlantic so the statement climate change is real is like saying water is wet\nLet's come back in a moment Steven open up the phone lines and what people participate with you\nSign up now for ... zone

back Steve Moore I'm with a ... what are the views worldwide about climate change\n[noise] well the uh the world leaders are\nYou much signed up to this more than a hundred and Ninety world leaders of a a signed up to this ah the ah ah most of them signed the Kyoto Protocol and Nineteen Ninety seven\nAnd um it was I was at a conference at the University of Chicago today and they mentioned it all the nations of signed up to the Paris accords even\nEven the the President Trump has said he's going to withdraw ... a lot of\nIt is kind of a universal thing um but uh you know the uh the members are not living up to their\nTo their uh commitments it's very very tough when you need to uh\nTo impose a things on your nation and you and you are a half to impose costs on renewable energy\nAnd also there's there was this big demand that the world set up to the United nations they wanted a hundred billion dollar annual climate payment to go from the wealthy nations to the\nDeveloping nations a hundred billion annually quite a big amount\nAnd a year and has that has\nCompletely collapsed a matter of fact the guy who was ahead of that just resigned this last summer and with the with the United states cutting its commitment uh they're nowhere near that they're down about four or five billion dollars a year\nSince ... scandal among some of the scientists who were ... you know pro man made climate change with the emails and things like that\nYeah the ease the climate gate was called the University of East Anglia back in two thousand nine\nOr they don't know who ... somebody released thousands of emails either an insider or a hacker\nAnd these emails showed some very bad behavior\nUh there were a uh guys that are\nOr were saying I'm a don't tell anyone that the United

process I'm\nJust I'm just not a tough situation you know and and my thought is my interpretation is that that the scientists to these things and by the way this was a this was the primary I mentioned before the climate research unit which is the primary keeper of the world's temperatures\nAre these folks I think we're we're trying to do whatever they could to try and save the planet to try and

Streever wrote a book called the coming global superstorm and that inspired a movie\nCalled the day after tomorrow and while I was wondering was\nOr is it remotely possible that\nIf things ah keep going the way they are or with art and uh what is predictions could very well happen that the events portrayed in that movie as well as the events portrayed in the movie two thousand twelve with\nYellowstone popping the cork in blowing Wyoming and the Kentucky or is it very possible that the ban in both of those movies could very well happen\n[noise] yeah I don't know about the two thousand twelve of Yellowstone and met for Kaine although I understand there's a big went under their job to call during\nThe day after tomorrow is based on the idea that\nUm manmade warming would would stop the Gulf Stream basically slow down the Gulf Stream which is part of a of the uh a global uh uh overturning a circulation there's this huge ocean currents\nOr which which carries a millions of square miles of water of the gulfstream goes north goes up to Iceland and then it sinks into it slows down deep and then it goes down into the deep underneath that goes down to the south Atlantic the Indian or the Pacific the the theory basically was\nThat are warming would cause a cause or water to melt up there the ice caps to melt would stop that current and it would cause a U.S move us into the mix the ice age\nUm I think most scientists now realize that that that is very unlikely we just don't have enough ice up there um to to affect the current so there was there was a fair though a number of years back that that was slowing down but after they looked at the data they found that the no the gulfstream\nWasn't slowing down it's really not happening\nThere was a good movie though [noise] yeah okay this whole thing right\nLet's go next to John in Hawaii west of the Rockies John I'm not hearing much about the volcano these days what so what can you give us an update on that\nOh they'll make you\nStill doing the whole thing well okay go ahead John\nYeah ah my dad who ah who quiet down I just want to stay you we're we're talking\nAbout wind bills when I\nWhen I was living in Oregon okay and I used to drive by the wind will that they had\nAnd I could see out in the meal that they had a big fat and there was plenty more black boots lame you know they were were burning off the methane\nGas or were you now why go to put a generator on Mac\nAnd where do you know electricity now come back and they said no no no it's going to cost ... anything out now that can't be the only land they all in the United states we know that\nAnd they're all going to be burning off methane gas now I Want to go why has there been anything done about that\nWell I think they are recapturing that are in some place as a matter of fact that's a big push in California they talk about they talk about that being renewable gas [noise]\nAh they also want to get methane from water treatment plants and even a dairy operations and and uh uh agriculture\nUm the problem is though it is really more expensive um gas from landfill is about twice as much as our natural gas regularly and it goes up from there um water treatment or three times as much I think there he gets up to about ten times as much\nSo they are capturing that in some in some places are capturing the gas from landfills a but it does tend to it does tend to add to the expense of things that's that's the only issue\nNext on let's go to Michael in Virginia Beach I'm Michael\nHi are you arguing thank you for having Steve von Loor spoken to him several times that\nHurt him on many shows and he has a breath of fresh air in inside and that\nAccuracy or there is one point that ah other guests on coast to coast have brought up in the past and I think we should warn are good friends she\nNot to make the same mistake that these climate change hopes are\nAre are using a ... I Believe me I Believe you said\nA one point three billion people on this planet live on two dollars a day is that correct\nYeah I think it's about it's I think it's actually about two billion dollars I'm Sorry two billion Peebles it's quite a few of those are those are United Nations numbers I mean I haven't gone out and counted them\nOkay well I was using the one point three billion a papal so two dollars a day comes to point six billion dollars\nThey are we what had just spent nine hundred and forty nine billion dollars a year\nTo double their two dollars a day just four hours a day and I'm going to come to the point that people like frosty will reject may end or a ... a a young child than a\nHere's the point is you've already said they were willing to do a hundred billion they're certainly not going to be willing to do nine hundred and forty nine billion right and and so\nSo what's frosty has told us is that isn't just set in thinking that we can see your ah that by doubling people's daily\nA dollar allowance or would somehow going to a massive rally improved airlines they're doing All right I was out as this last world which a lot of them are\nAre turning illegally into

they've written a three hundred and Ninety feet a hundred and twenty meters since the last ice age no scientists can tell you when natural sea level rise stopped and man made sea level rise began\nUm right now the rice is about seven inches per century that's been\nGoing for the last a couple of hundred years or any politician hotels you he knows how to stop sea level rise I hold onto your wallet oh we need to adapt to rising oceans oh we're not going to be able to stop that and that is a largely driven by natural factors\nWould obviously has happened in the past because there were\nDiscovering the ancient cities that are under water\n[noise] um there have been some well\nYeah there were a if you look at a I think it's emphasis in Turkey a if you look at a a piece of both of those cities are about um uh there are some some um indications that the seas were higher at one point in time as well\nUm those are about five miles from the coast with historical accounts peace it used to be a big court or a big port [noise] um in in the\nNorthwest Italy an excuse to be a port as well so there was some\nTimes when the oceans were higher but again this is something we need to adapt to a we're not going to stop the sea level rise will matter what the what they think in California\nRoost in woodland hills California is with us Hi Bruce go ahead\nGeorge thank you for taking my call Hi Steve I'm Bruce you know before I ah I Want to talk about the word climate change but before I get into I just kind of like to mention I perhaps to a lot of listeners that aren't aware is a\nGlobal elites that run this country who are masters at keeping us completely oblivious and gun what's really going on\nThe word climate change is a narrative we hear all the time the weather stations and news articles scientists that is not the proper word the word is\nAbrupt climate collapse and we never hear about the word climate engineering\nThese are programs now that have been in effect for over seven years and they've been ramped up over the last Twenty years and this is the aerosol injections they're spraying God Knows how many millions of tons of aerosols anyone could just look up in the sky is the no doubt\nA lot of ...\nHarp technology is and you know if anyone wants to prove this kind of self I can tell you how to do it first of all\nAny time you watch the news you are watching at Emanuel factored why you're not seeing the real no a weather satellite map that we used to the many years ago we're seeing animated cartoon but\nThere's a site I it's a YouTube one Pacific redwood that this guy is obviously a former meteorologists he keeps on him is his name but he is showing actual weather satellite map but here's the thing that's interesting\nYou can see storm front hurricanes tropical storm low pressure zone coming directly into California and they're being blocked\nAnd it's being blocked by heart technology which our ground based atmosphere heaters anyone could look this up very powerful I Believe they can put out as much as three billion watts of power\nIn the upper atmosphere to Fifteen hundred degrees they can steer hurricane they install hurricanes they can blast thunder head they can break up low pressure zones and this is what's happening this is not\nAn act of nature it's an act of the military industrial complex would have in our with our weather\n... when I hear about it and the new Luskin Steve's reaction to that Bruce like you\nSaid something I'd have to research I'm really not up on that I Know there's been some quotes eating attempts but to the rest of it it's not something I've run across um and there's been a lot of discussion about climate engineering but to my knowledge there's not been anything done on a large scale that something I'd have to look look into further\nLet's take one more caller may be too if we have some time in in Tulsa, Oklahoma he said go ahead [laughter]\nWell is it going man just said is exactly right I'm One of these conservative it happens to believe\nThat the way to address is being gay oh engineered the came trails or a proven fact even the discovery channel show now George should recently at gentleman on his show talking about can't drill team put out a video called Franken's guy\nAnd the idea behind it was to create a canopy over the body out son well people have so much shoes were hate\nAbout the fact that they're doing this so they're going to back off of it now what they were telling us that they had they were going to back off the trail we don't have the weather's going to get real radical now they have they have the ability to geoengineering this weather\nDown to a science I mean it's to the point now where you can go to the street and bet on the stock market on the weather they want or against it they want to intensify the hurricane through the aid to park\nAnd now on top of that then you got the geo engineering of the soil and the crops which is destroying the honeybees are almost becoming extinct and if they you know that's pretty much gonna destroy everything\nNow I Do agree with you about the nuclear power plant that was a foolish idea that may never come up with man is not smart enough to harness that kind of power safely okay now I Do agree with that\nBut here's the thing with Trump I'm proud of him he got us out of that climate accord 'cause it's a sham meant they weren't they were doing a stripping the oil industrial nations away distributing it into the pockets of the global elite\nAnd laying out China's there with their sky completely online with collusion not paying a dime into it either is Russia but the United states of America but it going to play the oh I Know now I don't blame a Trump one bit I grew in fact I was proud of him for backing us out of that sham\nLonger he somebody had to wear out of time Steve and ed thank you for your comments Steve thank you good luck with the work outside the green box

oh well this gentleman was a canoeing in a creek up in Vermont and really he was poured urging stomping when he came across some nice holes that he felt he could get some good trout and\nHe sees something going up and down in the trees that he described as like a chimpanzee so he's watching this thing going up and down and thinking to themselves\nWhat on earth is a monkey or a chimpanzee doing up here\nNow he couldn't cross the river and when the thing came down on the tree it went into the the trees that surround again in other words there were like low boroughs ten Fifteen feet and then this big tall tree standing in the middle so when it was up in the high tree he could see it\nAnd went to climb down we couldn't see it so obviously you're out there this thing has your attention when he's watching this thing going up and down and at one point it comes up\nSits there and one position and staring at him so now he's looking at it it's looking at him and then it lowers down again well moments later he sees some ... in the bushes on the other bank which kind of came down a hill alongside the fool's\nAnd here is this little big foot sitting on the shoulder of daddy\nAlong the bank and going out of sight in front of him into the woods so you had one tearing the other one\nWho knows it's anybody's guess what this little critter was doing maybe it was like you know I I Know it sounds ridiculous but I think of it in human terms like when we used to go down to the monkey bars or something to play with your kid in the park you know\nThat's right now you mentioned earlier about a couple that moved on to their house to get away from big what happened\n[noise] well I've had a there's been a number of people that moved houses are a\nUnited sooner aren't and rural areas right\n[noise] ... yeah for the most part are people who have backed up against a wilderness areas or for instance when we talk about I mean this is a very interesting a story a involving no sighting but evidence like it's nobody's business\nUh these people and when you talk about Maine George I don't know if people really realize this Maine\nIs the size of the risk of New England combined\nAnd you know Ninety percent of it is on inhabited so when you talk about wilderness it's not just the Pacific northwest British Columbia Canada here we have a lot of wilderness in Maine we have a lot of wilderness right here in New York state [noise]\nAnd so these people had moved from one house to another house in northern Maine\nUh the money was right the property was right the people that had lived there before them we're gardeners they will gardeners this was like a match made in heaven\nWell as it turns out over time they found they were accusing each other of using the gardening tool the wife hissing the husband was to shovel wisdom rate was so finally the husband get the idea\nThat they're going to gather together with the tools they have to an inventory and then they were going to keep them all locked up with the exception of two small hands spades\nSo having accomplished that they realize they were missing some calls and they started they leaped to hand spades on what she called the ... the wife called the heat stroke table on the patio and they were using them for partying plants\nAnd no sooner had they left them out there a couple of days went by and now these hand spades withdrawn they it actually called the police report on the property of you know tools and this and that\nNumber and understand who would come on their land and take tools and take two of them is ridiculous you're going to go to jail for taking a shovel\nYou're going to Rob the place Rob the place well [laughter] bright ... and things like that [laughter]\nSo they actually went out into the property in the woods [laughter] they found one of the shovels leaning on the tree and the wife spoke out nine feet off the ground one of these you know what one piece\nHand garden trials with a rubber handle on it\nShowed into the side of a tree nine feet up\nNine feet up show they went back to doubt they got a right I guess an iPhone ... took pictures of it they brought a latter route the husband couldn't Bush this thing it was buried in the trees several inches thick couldn't budget [noise]\nSo they had recalled the police and told them the story about finding the shovel in the woods showed the cop to shovel when the ... everybody was baffled by you know this turn of events you\nAnyways the long and short of it was the cop told them look if you have any other problems get back to us I'm not sure what happened here I'm going to pass a law to the detectives\nWell as I said the long and short of it was a couple of days later\nThey came outside and the guardian behind the house\nHad been trampled down there were huge footprint in bed or tomatoes were taken the head of lettuce one mashed\nAnd whatever had done this which was obviously a big foot I stepped right over the fence not using the gate there was a gate on the garden and it just step right over the warrior\nWinning at it's full of feed and then left they recall the uh the police over to see what had happened that would have transpired\nAnd he actually told them that this was pretty much the best evidence he had ever seen a and that they had had reports periodically of people saying they show these big ... creatures coming in their property of walking here and now for\nJohn it's convincing\nYeah it's not like it's not like these things on being seen it's just not being talked about which\nIs a very odd

[noise]\n\n[noise] okay\nWell come back William what's his William the abominable snowman the lady from the Himalayas is that the same as the big ... we talk about here in North America\nI don't believe so uh although I'll tell you something really interesting\nUh I had an account of was told to me by all things a Russian professor who was out hiking with his landscaper that he had befriended because of his vast knowledge of things but time Nicole\nAnd they form this unlikely friendship and turned that into a hiking partnership\nAnd they had run across a couple of big foot ... messing around with some trees are in the woods and they got close enough to them whether they could hear them ...\nAnd the professor\nSaid that it sounded like a Siberian dialect that he was on familiar with now this is a Russian speaking immigrant saying that what he was hearing sounded like some type of Russian that he was on familiar with\nSo when you talk about the the Eddie in uh the abominable snowman\nIt's hard not to think of the land bridge that was once they're above the Bering Sea\nAnd did these things or or had these things go back and forth I have no idea but it was just really unusual to hear this gentleman\nA speak about this on dialect that other people have said they've heard a voice as I had a couple that uh was canoeing and Minnesota and they talked on a pulled the canoe up on a piece of the lake where they thought the look clear and they could sit there and rest for a little while\nAnd they ran across some sasquatch and the trees structure in there\nA day will unseen by them they walk by through the trees they heard them ...\nAnd they said it sounded like when you stand at the counter and the Chinese restaurant and they're shouting orders back and forth to each other\nSo it's very very odd but as far as the uh the uh uh yesterday in the bottom level below snowman I have no idea uh I have a ... book the abominable a snowman come to life\nAnd uh you know that thing is like reading or an encyclopedia on the creature a\nAnd yet getting back to what I said earlier none of this stuff means anything to the majority of people around the globe\nThat book is a hoax all of my stuff is a hoax all of the conversations about big foot or a hoax the film is a hoax all of the uh uh a durable\nRidges on the footprints taken everything's a hoax to them so you know we have to just keep doing what we do a in spite\nOf ... what the majority of the people out there I think about it and that's one of the things I Love about coast you know a a we'll\nTune in because we're hearing things that we can get in Oklahoma Tunisia's nobody's talking about what you're talking about\nYou and photos and big could encounters where's the Tania\n[noise] well I've had a couple of them are one of them are called the ... falls incident but one night I'll share with you a ... was named the orb\nAnd it's really interesting uh these three scout leaders had four young boys ... working on their uh Eagle Scout badge\nAnd they decided to take them or to this mountain in a mountainous area or in uh Pennsylvania to do a weekend of survival training\nOr on the first day they were pretty much focusing on building huts lean twos and and different things like that and and the second day or the focus was on that of ah getting attention being saved so they were\nSpending their time in an open area spelling out the words held than SOS uh using branches and bows and then they were making Smokey fires using a green a green bows\nAnd that night they decided to go on a night hike to see what it was like\nA navigating around in the dark a now during the day they had climbed up the sides of the mountains to look down and\nSee what they had made to see what it looked like from a higher elevation and they had gone up into the same area or at night\nSo the I ... well when they got up there it turns out that the one scout leader was a UFO enthusiast which was very bizarre considering what you're about to hear he had a pair of military grade night vision a by knock you lose your own mind I'll kill or\nA that he had brought along now when they get up into the trail\nOne of the kid says hey what's sad and they noticed in the distance a light moving around in the woods\nNow of course the first instinct was it somebody with a flashlight or a you know battery operated lantern but then they realized that this things started to daughter around in a crazy fashion which immediately told all of them there's just no human being and what it is we don't know so they started moving closer\nAs they got closer they got the night vision on it and they could see now that was in orbit around bluish white light moving around in the forest\nAnd now this really had their attention so they got even closer they've been trying to get ever closer to it they didn't know how big it was because they didn't know how far away they were from it finally they got to a place where they believe they were about Seventy five yards away from it and when they put the night vision on it\nThey could see that it was about two feet wide bluish white or but it was about uh ten to twelve feet off the ground and it was a looming aiding the trees around it\nRight so that the parents and the it\nWas that bright yeah I mean it it it's a glowing orb of light darting around in the forest and now it's stationary and what happens next is absolutely out of this world [noise]\nThe one scout is holding it and he says to the leader hey Mr so and so you better take a look at this thing it's still something really weird [noise]\nHe described a picture this George a two inch wide let's just say beach ball a two foot wide beach ball he describes a globe ... coming out of the size of this thing as being like when you blow bubbles through want as a child okay\nSo this thing is coming out of the side of this or and making its way down to the ground [noise]\nAnd what blew the mind was the fact that what was coming out and go into the ground was like twenty times for thirty times the volume of the orbit self and yet the war was on changed and this thing was attached to it\nNow they don't want to see a big foot appearing in secondary glob coming down and they described it as being like in his state of suspended animation that wasn't moving whatsoever but they were certain to what they were looking at [noise]\nAt some point the glob separate from the org and now you have like this power of blue and white light was this big foot in it and the\nThis week in Nineteen eighty four
