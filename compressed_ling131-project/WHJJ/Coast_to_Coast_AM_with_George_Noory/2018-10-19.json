thousand and two silver was four dollars announcing there at the cost of production we predicted silver would rise to thirty dollars announced within ten years people thought we were absolutely nuts nine years later silver hit forty eight dollars an hour and we weren't so nuts anymore\nNo not at all so what made you so sure that the price was going to make such a big move\nAll at the time silver was trading near its production costs an industrial demand was absolutely skyrocketing\nIn why do you think a hundred dollar silver is possible now\nSolar in fact China alone is expected to need an amount of silvery equal to half of the global annual mining production that just China the whole world is moving to China just recently California's now requiring all new homes to have solar panels there's just not enough silver supply that kind of demand\nSo we're going to see a shortage Kevin\nAll I can say is that some smart people like J.

Morgan has accumulated the largest private stockpile of physical\nSilver in the world more than a hundred and thirty million ounces that's over two billion dollars worth of silver I'm sure they're not doing it because they expect the price to\nGo down you know I guess not but could silver reach higher than a hundred dollars announced\nYou adjusted for inflation George Silver would have to be about a hundred and thirty dollars announced to reach its all time high so we think are one hundred dollars is well within reach\n... when that happened over the next seven to\nTen years but we believe most of the games will happen over the next three to five years just hard to ignore the potential in silver right now\nKevin our listeners are passionate do you have anything that you can send out solicitors so they can find out more about a hundred dollar Schober\nWe do George or to make a special offer for you it's our latest sky high silver report listeners can learn more about China's massive move into solar and why experts the silver rising to a hundred dollars announce\nThe reporters a twenty dollar value but it's free for your listeners by calling one eight hundred to nine nine Seventy four hundred one eight hundred to nine nine Seventy four hundred\nFolks this last week even for just came out with a report saying China was leading the way with solar and\nThat in two thousand Eighteen global investments in the solar will outstrip coal gas and you clear combined let's get Lee or sky high silver reports it's a fascinating report and don't miss out on the ... revolution\nGoal now to get your copy it's a twenty dollar value free with no obligation call one eight hundred\nTo nine nine Seventy four hundred that's one eight hundred to nine nine Seventy four hundred [noise]\n\nSeven Daniel full flooring yard sales going on now with incredible deals and lumber liquidators we've got hundreds of floors on sale up to fifty percent off in stock and ready to go see big on waterproof floors all on sale from just thirty nine cents skin would look limited flooring all on sale up to forty percent off\nFree finished hardwood and bamboo starting at Ninety nine cents plus special financing south by your local lumber liquidators store or visit lumber liquidators dot com today\nNo commercials breathe video on demand TV channel completely devoted to him the best movies on us lose inches conspiracies print science is called us ... all of us who can be all access is now living in the Amazon ... apple groomed UFOs\nDot com and download the ... and I do go to us ... dot com and describing now for universal access across the world into the\nHow do you know the real Joyce as opposed to being some some ...\nYeah but you know it's very very hard to tell the difference it's very strange or you can't really differentiate what's real and what is and\nBecause the the the frauds are very good at what they do\nThat's the thing and you know what I watch shows on TV like about oh how magicians are pulling in public and I say this is so bad because they're so good at this and it makes all of us who are legitimate look really really bad\nAnd it looks like we're all doing trickery of some ...

you're with in there or field is that what you mean George\nYes oh wow that's impressive so if you're with the person who's not that good to step away from them you would pull back right\nYeah absolutely now there are some people who what I call psyche a\nVampire ... or ... but they're not necessarily bad people they just have the ability to dream people's energy I Try to work with those people by the way I Try to help them and I've had some stories where they've changed and people began to like them again and surround themselves are on the person but\nI get a kick out of trying to help people who want to help themselves but just don't know\nThat's a form of hailing and that's terrific that's really really great because they don't know how to help themselves and you come in and it could be training for you but it's not because you know how to control your own energy which is really extraordinary for that's a wonderful form of hailing\nLet's take some calls are lining up here for you I'm going to give you a name and the birth dates ... the ... billion a year and then I just want to ask you a question to start would that be appropriate choice\nHere that'll be great how

at that point you have to force yourself to do something you really don't want it to like whatever that might be\nA ... you know just just do it and go out you fit your energy will change change your energy though and change your life and try prayer and meditation\nThan what I'm really stuck\nAnd bring me something fresh and something no on spirit will work with you\nDo you work with people

pronounced clinically dead and then they look to get and they said oh you boy died and he came back so that is why do the experiences of my life involving the stuff that goes into the new books\nI must tell you George I don't remember anything much from what happened when I was out of my body age three members rubber a living on his uh afterwards what happened afterwards when I was eight nine\n... died again pronounced dead again on the ... and the conditions and this is an appendectomy in an operating room at that time I remember what happened it sounds like the classic empty to

back eventually opt to the evening\nTo live a whole life of Ninety year old so and I'm shocked to find myself in the body as a kid and and now the hospital and from that George comes my lifelong understanding there will be on the physical you know nine years old who do you talk about this she tried to talk it out that the medication you're hallucinating or something\nWho could explained to me what happened in any way that made sense was an aboriginal kid from the indigenous tradition but you know yeah we do that we get sick really thick we've got to live with the spirit and then we come back and sometimes with the same\nAnd sometimes we're not so the gift of these experiences which rings my goal but so the Asian ... ability to travel beyond the body traveling consciousness without psychedelic drugs ... wait an understanding that there are well beyond the physical and they are the people\nYou must have been an amazing little boy Robert\nWell I'm not alone in little boy you know I was sick I on my father's in the ... moving all the time I'm Brett situation I'll tell you all the things that kept me going is it amongst mind ... companions a phrase probably most of us remember from childhood was a big man but a lot of white hair and a pig face\nCome and sit on my that you'd say backup Robin you know you're going to make it through you'll survive I can promise you that you learn it now but you know go and they'll like you and one day all day you can't tell your dreams are easier right now people want to hear you\nBad invisible companion George was the older rubber younger than I Am now traveling across time to cheer up his youngest filth and help him come through one of the things I've learned is\nWe got time travel in our dreams and when we developed the out of conscious or active treat me as I call it\nCool things we can do is we can actually go back to younger self and be cheerleader and counselor to them in the right time and going the other way we can sometimes managed to talk to a why is the self who sees what life looks like a bit further down the road that we've gotten and can help us to get the right perspective\nAmazing now let's get into your latest work of course mysterious realities dream travelers tales from the imagine all realm you call yourself a dream travel or what is that\nWell it means that one of the things going on in dreams is that we traveled beyond our old and read dimension of reality in two of the world we traveled the parallel worlds for example\nBut it will lead in parallel lives this isn't as weird as some science tells us in the many worlds hypothesis to do and I live in right now in one of many parallel worlds well how do we know about that in human terms while we might know it from our dreams in which we find ourselves for example\nIn consecutive episodes living a life a bit different from other living right now on may be radically different so that's part of a dream traveling mainstream traveling Olson means\nThat in our dreams in sleep dreams event and conscious elusive dreaming we made travel to places where the dead or alive and this might be the source of understanding the solar consciousness survive physical test so this is a pretty pretty important area\nUh so the idea of dream travel goes beyond the routine idea about dreams as the little bubble up from the personal subconscious and that's all that's going on a this was the ancient an indigenous understanding as lived in my life and told and stories from that life\nBut in dreams we traveled to other places and we received visitations from people who've come cooling those people to come calling my enclosed cleared the loving family members around says to the spiritual guy some kind or another\nSo dream travel means we get out that we get you on the body in the brain we get into that whole field of non local mind the science tells us about getting the condom information field to get into the ability to access sources of information on the old ... and also proud of this is that we are definitely time travel is\nAnybody who follows their dreams for wild and write them down will notice that they dream of and before they happen as one function of time travel we see the possible future we can reduce the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead but we all said traveled into the past from this my mother lives you learned about connections with\nDrama is playing out now the reality is now the time periods in the multi dimensional universe so this is the key to the U.S tend understanding of what the multi dimensional universe is all about this is a puff of direct experience this path of dream travel\nAnd my stories in the book come absolutely and entirely from my own experiences in these areas and the experiences of some other people who work with me and they're giving me permission to use this story\nRobert if we didn't dream of course we all do not everybody remembers them but if we did not dream what would we be lacking as human beings what would happen to us\nI think like they're locking quite often a sense of purpose a sense of Seoul since the spirit because you know one of the things that dreams do is they connect us to keep a source of knowledge of wisdom actually beyond the old remind this is one of the reasons why\nMost human ... human couches across history a valued dreams and dream of they believe the dreams put you in touch with the guard or got us if you like\nBut you can talk to with nature with the ancestors with the big self all the highest ... so we might be lacking that I'd say terribly relevant to our times is that we might be lacking conscience because dreams\nCan be the voice of conscience and dreams can be\nA ... a magic mirror that shows with our actions and attitudes from Baton and more objective perspective that we can manage for our cells in indigenous people say if you lost your dream you've lost a vital part of your sold your dream sold in fact has gone missing\nAnd probably the scariest story in my book mysterious reality is that the one called ...\nAnd ... which takes a look at what that might begin to mean if you live in a society where people are divorced from their dreams have lost the sense of conscience have lost the sense of a deep up to ... percent of that by a gun to lose the sense of what it really means to be a human a fully a live human I think it's actually as important as that\nI was mentioning Robert that some people don't remember their dreams what makes them not remember\nWell first of all we haven't made it socially rewarding often to share dreams I mean we don't have good ways of talking about dreams most of us when we were a member of something a bit embarrassed how do we talk about this how do we tell us\nSo one of the things lacking in our society is a way that makes it fun and as I say socially or what he can bring a dream to the table I invented the very simple full step process to sharing a dream of a story that makes it on you can get it done and minutes you get some help ... feedback and your guide to towards action but there are other reasons\nWhy we're losing our teams I mean bad habits of pots and that is part of it to be let out so the rushed out of sleep by the alarm clock but the need to get jobs do deal with a family\nWe think that we should lie in the church in bed and don't pay and it took eight dollars or whatever and they pay any attention\nTo those in between twilight states of consciousness you have between sleep in the wake that's a good time to catch a good time to back and listen dreaming but many people don't realize that it just seems because they're awake in the middle of the night yet ... set of losing that others\nSometimes we close off our dream because they're scared of what they might be telling us we don't want to know that we might get sick we don't want to know that our actions may not be okay we don't want to know the relationship is in trouble so he'd slam the door and say no more dreams shell sometimes this is very interesting\nOf what's going on in other times altogether in those parallel times we're leading a power life this becomes very interesting when you begin to look at give some lessons you might have learned in a parallel life that you can apply and you present life and how to avoid things went wrong and not at other parallel life\nI think it's very interesting when you discover that you can go back to younger period of your life and reclaim something you lost the best time\nWill be a guide to that younger self or you find yourself also in the lives in situations of people in far flung places fill out of your multi dimensional family I'm a bit of a an agnostic about reincarnation but I firmly believe

I was ...\nAnd a graveyard this week and I look at him and I was in a grave yet I've never been to before never been in this place and just having a walk\nAnd I'm thinking about a girl I loved and could never have from Thirty years ago and I looked down on the name of a head start is her name the full name and there's the dates this person died last summer and I can't believe it or what I call\nShe's never beat him the air as far as I Know I make some calls I discovered she died last summer and something drew me to head start he says what do you think about it that the great story but very great story I mean that introduce of hope things about\nYou know the energy and the connection that might exist between the living in the dead and how someone who has died my coat him to sudden goes to a certain place might even be an age of the ... but\nAs I'm telling us it's also an example of how like attract like I like stories so even on a day when I'm staying at the airport I don't need a new story today I'm given what else to live as a story immediately just like that and that these examples proliferate so\n... you know what it how it works is that the the attitude of the energy you're carrying again to have results your attitude travels ahead of you in life\nShaping what his waking ... waiting fuel round the next corner which is a very good reason every tuning in life to pause and check your attitude check what is playing when you're in a soundtrack check what you're saying to you so Trump the negative mantras self limiting beliefs\nAnd be open to something more positive coming into your life\nRobert is there anything physical about this I mean I Know we need the brain the dream but we're also tapping into I think the subconscious and it does its thing outside of the physical body but how important is the physical body to all of this\nWell I think about is very important that the first of all I mean scientists telling us there is no barrier between mind and matter anywhere in the universe mind to match up into leave at every tuning every level in fact some scientists tell us about how to matter of reality as a dense of consciousness so\n... there's no hope of separating mind matter they're always play together\nBut when we think about the kinds of messages the kinds of discoveries where exploring we have to remember the party has its own messages his discovery is that the phenomena but used to be called pre sentiment which I experienced a lot maybe you do to what\nIt means in terms of the body is the body sometimes seems to know things that are going to happen before the the mind of the brain can recognize what is\nGoing on the body reacts\nTo something ahead of time for example I go to the doctor for routine annual physical one time my blood pressure is much higher than usual even though it's controlled it's surprisingly high and there's no explanation for this until the nuts trying to do uh get get some blood for a blood analysis hit but gosh are my blood is bode again it's\nAll I knew lived in pants and after\nThat I'm completely common my blood pressure is normal and she and the doctor trying to understand what just happened\nI said well this is pretty sentiment it's what's called an Alice in wonderland the the white creating can but the white queen screams\nBefore she ... fingers so she doesn't have to scream when she actually picks a thing where I just did the same thing I had a reaction in my high blood pressure to it in the Ford took place and the doctor says my goodness that probably is a scientific\nProof of a sudden the phenomenon ... sentiment or anticipating ... says but I couldn't possibly report if people think I was looted you\nWell you know I said so I think the ... we know in our body all sorts of things we know thing we know what the bleep we don't know that\nWe know enough about it in all of a sudden medic response was we pick up things from a distance from other people and we feel with the feeling in our body as well so that's part of the story\nNow you teach active dreaming what exactly is that Robert\nWell active dreaming is way of getting active with dreams in the sense that you again to remember your dreams are going to share them the right way to you and it could take action that will empower your life and bring some elite energy and guidance in July from your dreams I mean that's one aspect of it\nIt's also method of looser dreaming you would call the ... medical use of dreaming we ... my favorite way of ... going to loosen treatment venture\nIs to start out loose that didn't stay loose at what does that mean that means that we use shut many drumming and the workshops\nAnd we might take a dream that we remember as a starting point we might decide okay this romance an adventure still in the stream let's go on with the dream let's get back inside the treatment have more we might decide okay it's time to brave up to a nightmare terror and stuff that stuff's going on\nBy going back inside the dream and facing the scary based on his side and grounded might mean I'm going to talk to someone who turned up in my dream whether it's spreading Merrill someone else\nSo that's an example of traumatic loose a dream yet another example is that I encourage people to spend a lot more time in that risky try lied state\nTo eat and sleep and wake because that's where creative connections made where we are extremely psychic an intuitive and creative naturally so I encourage people to instead of complaining about being awake in the middle of a nice\nRelax into that state make it a state of horizontal meditation if you like I tend to the images of Ryan's unfold and see what he wants to make one of the scenes that will come to you the pool to loosen dreaming and finally\nActive premium the method is also about treatment with your eyes wide open we got the how to look to criticize the outlook for signs and symbols in the world around you so this is also a program on a method of attending to the dream like symbols of everyday life\nRobert did the dreams ever mislead us trick us basically\nI don't think that dreams themselves misleading I think that a spin on the dreams can often be misleading we might be in a rush to interpret reminder to interpret according to the wrong standards I think that didn't think the dreams in themselves as a deceptive\nI mean we can pick up things in the night of the problems that are floating around that we don't watch around we can pick up pigments from other other entities from whether they're just a bit confused or militias\nThat that can be confusing or deceptive but I think that any image that belongs to us it is truly our own\nCan be worked in the service of hope and healing it might not be great to begin with it might be horrible my tree but some horrible beast but by learning to go back inside the dream and confront the issue on its own ground you might find that behind something that's scary you know learning\nAnd you and your dream is a power power of understanding of power that might might give you a kind of spiritual ally or life guide a life coach if you're willing to work with the material I I think as I say that the dream is not deceptive but a rush to interpret according to a narrow understanding what dreams is about can be very misleading\nYou got a Robert we

boss back with us as we talk about dreams will get your calls as well Robert you write about Carl young a lot in he even had some of his own situations didn't need it didn't they\nWhat do you mean he's in situations joke in his dream life\nOh yeah he was young young was inspired by dreams I mean he said\nIn memory streams reflections but he has interesting thoughts every day but he takes up in his work and study only what comes to him\nAnd dream so here is the man I mean a titan of scholarship in science who is driven all his life by his dream of the stories in my new book mysterious reality is it involves humans passage into the afterlife and actually what he might be doing now it's a pretty interesting title\nBut at the part of that is in the previous documentation is the human dreamed again and again before his death but he was living in a Bush and all his retreats on the lake come legs Oric\nWhich was called bowling get out from the nearby village is living in another balding guy on the other side of death and those close to him said that he lost all the or death you absolutely confident and he knew where he was going to a towel on the other side of death on the lake and in\nA story in a mysterious way out of his cold the other bought a gun I follow you on\nTo that possible afterlives situation and I actually give some insight into where how you'll miss mind might be working right now is he works on a great new books are you in the off the life I mean some people might be shocked and surprised\nBut to Robert his crazy enough to think that you would have an audience with him from the other side of death but you know you'll himself to a great deal not always the publication about his contacts with the deceased he talked in his in his memoirs and in his red book about extensive conversations\nHe had with the power to the shape your view of reality and he was one of those are always understood the one of the key things about dreaming is this that gives the U.S had the ability to understand what happens to mind go consciousness off to death because didn't dreams as yoga understood we receive visitations from the departed I didn't dreams who made travel\nInto the realms where they are at home ... very briefly one more thing about him\nAnd his relevance to this book in my approach to everything\nHe came late in his life to the conclusion that one of the things going on in dreams is that we live I'm quoting you continuous alive and other realities that we perceive and dreams so I'll dreams maybe memories\nOf ongoing life situations nothing this reality but somewhere else but we visit again and again when we when we slip out of the body and go into dreams\nSo this is a great a dream Sherman of the west he knew and the manager of a ... is it ... to to deepen horrifying experience of an under will journey and he paid the price of surviving that and coming back and adding his science\nAnd his scholarship to what he knew firsthand about deeper realities and giving us an incredible model of understanding of all the things we're talking about some of the greatest Monrovia\n... wasn't young flows who'd Sigmund Freud and then eventually they broke often had the disputes\nFreud regarded as his ... his ... year old was your most Freud favored apprentice but they broke because young because Freud although a tremendous scholar and pioneer of understanding dreams in his eye and writes who made himself is number one study which\nIs what you need to do to listen to anything on dreams from someone who is not a dream of despite all that Freud adopted rather narrow view of what's going on in dreams or rather narrow theory and he tried to apply to human streams\nAnd you only had famously a dream in which he's in a house that has on many levels and the basement area fall below the comfortable ... upper level is as a a floor and bones and skills and something primal\nAnd Freud insisted on interpreting the dream to Yom as something to do with you know among the complex and the desire to see somebody dead ...\nAnd Yom didn't break with him at the moment but then eventually he did because he felt that Freud was putting his dream experiences into coffin of narrow understanding\nAnd that breakup was very interesting because the company by synchronous stick phenomena you talked about the body and math uh in relation to these things and one of the conversations with human Floyd approaching that stuff\nThere's a tremendous crack in a cabinet and\nYou avoid stop so scared and confused and\nAnd and and you wrote in describing this he felt something boating in his belly like a hot sun us and he was going to happen again and there's another huge bang for the furniture sounds of blowing up hot so what we're seeing in that episode is something that goes on in the form the phenomena since ... which is the thoughts and emotions we are carrying strongly\nCan have a physical impact on the world around us so it's a very interesting thing in my story about you'll you'll says from the afterlife but Freud has changed his opinion he's evolved has come a long long way since he died but they don't have much contact together now\nI Love it in your book mysterious realities the subtitle of dream travelers tales from the imagine all realm what is the imaginable realm\nI imagine it around is a space
