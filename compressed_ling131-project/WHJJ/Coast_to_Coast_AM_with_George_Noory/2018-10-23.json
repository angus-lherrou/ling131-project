O. two [noise]\nAnd if we produce them on Mars and they called a a floor carping cast says we sometimes manufacture them on earth for use in refrigerators and air conditioners um the the uh but we didn't put them in such machines and said we just released them to the atmosphere\nAnd we were producing them at the same rate we're producing them on earth right now\nIn fifty years we'd warm bars by ten centigrade bats ally okay that's an awful lot that's ten times as much as anybody is talking about global warming happening on earth and the the uh\nAnd if you warmed Mars that much that warming itself would force carbon dioxide to come out\nThe soil because it's been sponge to and it would outcast and ... with thick in the atmosphere a lot with C. O. two which is a greenhouse gas\nAnd that would warm the planet even more so much so that the frozen water those those glaciers that we're talking about they start to melt they start to flow and this was much Clinton freshwater in most places there is a north\nAbout oceans fall I bet\nWell planet why there is in those particular glaciers probably as much as to the American Great Lakes [noise] um and the the um but yes\nThe waters on Mars it's frozen at all kinds of places would start to melt the dry rivers on Mars would start to flow the lakes and seas would start to fill up and they would also be rain\nAnd once you have that kind of planet with a thick steel to atmosphere liquid water rain man you can start spreading plants around\nNow if we were using that kind of plants we have on earth now which are only about one percent deficient in in capturing sunlight and I'm doing photosynthesis or it would take a thousand years for them to make enough oxygen from Mars to be brief ...\nBut if we're talking\nA hundred years from now it's really not too far out to assume that we can do genetic engineering of plants to make them instead of one percent deficient five percent efficient\nAnd in which case this thing could happen much much faster and um so I think Mars is going to be tariffs foreign within two hundred years and my guess is it'll probably be done by ways that are more efficient than what I just described to you because they're going to be doing this with technologies we don't know about\nAnd who's going to do with the Robert what country\nThe Martians\nAre they're going to do with themselves no when we talk about competition I don't see Russia as really pushing it space program which I mean they chose to the ... are you assess and they bring us back\nA well most of the tragedy a few weeks ago with a couple of their cosmonauts an astronaut that had to abort\nBut I see China and India is coming along strong how about you\n[noise] well uh here's the thing I'm the revolution in space flight is really going to put the question to these people I'm a I think India's gonna rise to the challenge but now China and Russia both face it a real question\nWhich is are they going to allow private space launched companies my guess the Chinese will because they've seen the benefit of a of privatization in terms of their very rapid progress since they moved away from command economy\nUm but Russia [noise] the the issue there is not allowing a a private space launch companies but allowing space launch companies to believe that if they got started they wouldn't get stolen by the government [noise]\nUm and because you know the Russian government is is basically a organized crime I mean\nYou know Russia is not a country with an organized crime problem it's an organized crime family with a country [noise] and uh\nThe the uh and so if if if they are going to have their own space sexes and they're going to need to have them if they're going to be competitive that's the thing [noise] um [noise]\nHold on Broadway and we're at the top of the hour we'll come back we'll talk more about this and will open up the phone lines with Robert Zubrin next on the coast to coast they\nSign up no go zone or free email newsletter today it goes to goes to um dot com\n\n\n[noise]\nSports fans and the west and I'm here to take you on a journey back to this week in sports history\nA certain way back in Eighteen fifty seven were the world's\nFirst soccer club or football club Sheffield that's being founded in England\nThis week in Nineteen Twenty one the Green Bay Packers play their first NFL game seven six when over the Minneapolis Marines\nThis week in Nineteen thirty nine NBC become the first network to televise the pro football game the Brooklyn Dodgers beat the Philadelphia Eagles twenty three to fourteen Brooklyn Ebbets Field\nThis week in Nineteen sixty six ice hockey legend bother your scores his first career\nYou wait for the fire archive of thirty for thirty dollars\nComes when our family\nWas traffic and whether they should use radio nine twenty and ...\nWhen you're waiting for\nEye on radio station\nAnd the University of Utah was on lockdown I'm Carmen Robert Fox news the manhunt in Salt Lake City for a gunman who shot and killed a woman on the campus of the University of Utah\nShall I put out from I think if I said I never get out your spouse email or credit card again you talked to identity to stay safe secure and download my you know from the store today and get more than you're free\nTo use radio nine twenty ... [noise]\n\n\n\nWon't go back to coast to coast Robert ... with us we'll get to calls in the seconds Robert we're talking about the other countries that are out there are vying to do things in space or how far advanced is China right now\nWhat I say China right now I'm is about where the U.S was around\nNineteen sixty seven um I mean in terms of manned space flight you know they've been to earth orbit me there are a bit\nBeyond that I mean they haven't gone to the moon of course on the other hand they could launch a small space station which we could not have them and\nDo they have the rockets and the capability to do that\nTo go to the moon ... um they can have it pretty soon I mean but the thing is fish okay\nOnce again um\nA new paradigm now and then these are ... space company which has shown they can do things\nThat a state run space companies can't too and they can do the things that those companies can to you in one third of the time at one tenth the cost\nAnd uh other countries took on it uh keep up with the United states right now they're going to have have their own space access national space programs are not going to be able to match them\nAnd um and that means that for example\n... is going to have to come to terms with understanding that they're going to need to have rule of law there that they cannot have a government that simply steals whole industries for people because I'm no one's going to make it if someone else can take it\nAnd uh so if ... once Russia to remain a ... I'm a strong in space which by the way is a military necessity or if you're going to be a first class\nPower much right now\nYou have to be first class in space um Russia's going to have to change and it's interesting I mean you know a a a reason is still coming in a certain I mean ... the reason why [laughter]\nThe um the Russian government or promoted mass literacy is and the twentieth century illiterate armies can no longer cut it well they're also going to have to go beyond that they're going to have to enter the modern world in other ways\nAnd um so that's another good thing that that Iran must has done for the world\nThat's pretty dramatic I think the fact of the privatization as doing what it's doing do you ever see the day Robert The privatization could backfire and all of a sudden some of these companies could go rogue doing all kinds of things\nGo rogue I don't know about in a like a James Bond movie where all of a sudden they try to launch a weapon or something like that\nWell I'm a I I Know I I I don't think they're going to launch weapons or\nThe um [noise] you know I'm\nAll of us who you hire them to do that well yeah well it's it states that want weapons\nOkay I mean 'cause what after all is a state but it is a a military force that exists well a ... presumably to protect its people but also it controls its people by having a monopoly or a near monopoly on force\nAnd um the you know um but no I I don't think that means ... a different objection people sometimes have is that uh\nYou know if if space becomes totally privatized then gee it'll just the uh the rich that get to go to Mars well [noise]\nUm [noise] it's frankly easier to get rich than to become an astronaut or right and um\nAnd also I think that um you know if they open the path to the moon and Mars it will get cheaper it will become something that I'm increasingly not just the super rich but then the rich and the middle class and ultimately the working stiffs walk to go [noise]\nAnd um you know he once upon a time you really had to to to be in the high income level in order to fly on airplanes you know into [noise] and now everybody doesn't\nWhat about propulsion we're ever going to do better than the kind of propulsion rocketry propulsion we have today\nWell sure well I'm now ... there's two different issues here one is earth orbit and the other is in space propulsion now earth orbit is is a pretty hard thing to do right now the only thing we know how to do is with rockets [noise]\nBut um if we could create air breathing propulsion that can operate at those speeds or they would launch vehicles could become much more efficient because most of the propellant you know in the rocket is the oxygen it's not feel [noise]\nIf you could get the oxygen from the air the way a jet does it become much cheaper to fly to orbit [noise]\nUm that's going to require some um technological advances but you know who knows uh\nThe you know the next new kid on the block who may ah ah you know knock you out in Moscow office a perch by saying well I'm going to do something that you've never done I'm going to create air breathing propulsion door but\nI'm so take that Mr mosque um and ah because you know there's always something new and then in terms of space\nTravel [noise] um [noise] well um we could I mean the the ultimate would be in my

and\nYou can even make an argument that what we did to the American to nature wild nature on America was wrong because you have these magnificent herds of buffalo in redwood forest and all this and

not\nUndo the settlement of America but on Mars\nThere are new Indians there are no\nBuys in herds there are no red woods there's just a desert with maybe some microbes in it and and I submit to you

political therapist author Paris psychologist residing in the northeastern section of Ohio\nHe has a graduate degree in clinical counseling from the University of Toledo\nPsychological research methods from the University of Edinburgh, Scotland is research at the University of Pittsburgh centered on EMS environmental sensitivity in ghostly encounters\nBrandon has been fascinated by the paranormal for years and here he is with his work called the ghosts studies Brandon I'm looking forward to this welcome to the show\nIt's great to be here George I'm excited to\nMy guy shot in a clinical therapist get involved in those studies\n[laughter] um well actually I was interested in a go for the parasite college even before I was actually a clinical therapist ah yeah so it actually\nI actually got a day job and then I studied the parents psychology and goes part of thing\nWell that's something then you went to the University of Toledo which is not too far from my hometown of Detroit\nOh okay yeah yeah I spent a lot of time at the casino in Detroit but we won't get into that\n[laughter] how'd you do by the way not very well [laughter]\nThat's good well let's see they they didn't have casinos there when I left I left in Seventy eight when Tommy apple is for a year in the at that time it was just a booming city but what we do have is the Detroit Lions and that's the great thing there\nYeah yeah good good teamed up their sports why\nSo tell us a little bit about your work and then we're going to digest ourselves into the Gulf studies book but to give us an overview of what you've been doing Brant\n[noise] well um\nYou know I ah I have a degree in Paris psychology or when I was at University of Edinburgh I studied uh I'm basically at the environmental sensitivity and goats counter um and then when I got back here to this day I got back into the critical part a thing\nAnd then that's what kind of got me going and and I'm interested in and writing a book and that's when I came out with a go study and you know I'm sure listeners to your show no it's um no mystery that science is sort of dropped the ball when it comes to explaining goes by encounters\nA oftentimes mainstream macadamia will explain these things away if I lose the nation yup interpretations are overactive imagination which you know it's not really true in my eyes\nSo individuals who have these terrifying and counter kind of struggled to find answers and they're kind of left with reality television shows to provide insight into these life altering experience\nSo you know there's millions of people out there including myself who are looking for things OR Books with more than jets ghost stories tales of locations are outdated views\nUm and that's when I wrote the book and I just thought you know I combine real life goes the encounters with it that faction of some new perspective and insights and the cause of these throwing encounter\nUm it ... the book comes up with concise and competing theory and what's great about it is it's based on data rather than faith or belief or even experience and you know ... you know these go I've been picking our interests for millions of years\nAnd if and I think we're at the point where there is becoming new perspective on these things and that's what the book really goes over\nYou know there are several first hand account of goes the encounter um you know I spent years just getting first hand account of going to anyone he would talk to me about goes on all of a convention of everywhere and then I started noticing similarities and that's what I came up with some of these maybe theories\nAre and that's what I came out with the book so you know I really combined a little bit of my I took elements from psychological research clinical interviews I witnessed the cow\nAnd I sort of piece them together and come up with this uh these new theories of thought I also review the right the greatest or the latest research in a ghost encounters book well\nThen you bring a dose of real science to the picture your brand and then I think that's important\n[noise] [noise] yeah yeah and I think so too I mean the great thing is is out there you just got to look a little bit harder um the journal articles or perish psychological journal articles and even some great you know I'm narrow psychology a fitness a physics they're starting to kind of go into that realm of consciousness and\nI'm In tangled non locality out electricity affects us and I'm ... and what it does outside the body so there's a lot of that research out there it's just you know I think a lot of people\nMaybe don't know how to find it or when they do find in a hurry to research article what kind of like oh this is boring and I\nDon't know what's going on but I'm a lot of great research is out there are just a matter of finding it\nWould have you concluded today Brandon about what the grossly experience might be for someone real big into their imagination what do you think's happening\nI actually think a majority of it goes the encounters there that are out there I Believe are there are some paranormal phenomenon happening\nI'm you know I think that when it comes to ghostly encounters it's such a complex process\nAnd there's so many variables going on um you know there's environmental stuff there's um a internal bio electrical stuff going on\nUm but you know for the most part these these experiences are genuine and um you know obviously there's some fraud and there's some misinterpreting stimuli or whatever but I think the majority of these experiences are actually like I said genuine experiences\nAnd what do you think causes them one of the\nI think there is I'm In my in my view I take the more by ... view on goes so that's a inside is basically um telepathy extra sensory perceptions those types of things\nI I really think that a lot of goes lane counters that happen out there\nUm the base of it has to do with um telepathy or I'm sort of 'em are coming in or being real sensitive to the environment and picking up something that's in the environment and other people on\nMy main theories in the book over um what I call a uh tell a path distress signals and sort of how they play a role and goes way encounters\nA so I really think that um people's telepathy a is a real or it was a real important part of it goes to my encounter\nHow important than the person as opposed to the vet or something like this\n[noise] um I I think that it's um\nIt's kind of a fifty fifty thing and I know that's kind of a weird answer to say there but uh I think there's so many people out there I think there's a lot of people out there there are more prone to go slowly encounters but I also think that the event is sort of a catalyst to everything that's happening so when I say that\nYou know I I think if we look at a lot of the ... counters that are out there the catalyst is usually a crisis of some kind right I'm a death\nOr life threatening events\nOr some sort of trauma or something like that is the catalyst to these ghostly encounters\nA so the event is an important part of it it's what happens after that event\nUm and I think when you have the events when you have this trauma I think it it it sort of there's a lot of things that happened after that\nAnd one of those things is um you know emotional distress so you have an event you have an emotional distress from a life threatening or going to have all these emotions that are associated with it\nAnd then that leads to sort of these by energetic shift that happen inside us I mean we're all electricity and when that happens I think that it actually triggers sort of our innate ability to\nSend a distress signal to somebody else and and the great classic example of this is the crisis aberration All right so we probably heard of these\nThis is when I'm sitting in my room on a random Tuesday night and I look to the left and there's a an operation of my aunt and she says you know um I Love you goodbye and then I get a call the next day saying you\nKnow my aunt passed away right on time that I had that and I and I and I think that that\nYou can sort of see there was a trauma life threatening event with my aunt she was dying and somehow she sent 'em a top athlete distressing they'll saying to me\nAnd I picked up on it and it showed up as an aberration of some kind\nOf as you say some people do get these experiences why not\nWell I I think it actually comes down to something I'm pretty mundane [laughter] I there's a lot of research out there in something called environmental sensitivity All right and um\nWhat environmental sensitivity as it's not like psychics sensitivity it's not like I'm chip coffee and Sylvia brown and and those types of psychic sensitivity where your mediums and\nUm you have psychic abilities but something as simple and concrete as sort of our ability to taste touch and smell and that's what environmental sensitivity is I'm so those who are environmentally sensitive are simply picking up on the environment to a higher degree than the normal population\nSo if you think about this as humans man you we both experienced the world differently we're both affected by and react to the environment in different ways\nUse radio nine twenty and one for seven to him

why do I feel this way and my dog was to be on the same way to normal she's pretty calm in the morning but she was like scratching they get outside\nSo I'm like yeah well you know my scientific brains going just take a shower and go to work and don't worry about it you know and I'm like you know what I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to follow through with this\nSo I open the door the dog went outside in the back yard and she sniffing around and I'm like I still got this feeling and then I looked over at the pond and I saw something like in the pond floating\nAnd I started walking and then I started running\nAnd it was a ... cat had gotten into the pond and and somehow um you know drowned in there like\nYou know like dove into the ... you know all that stuff [laughter]\nBut I put myself this is it's not so much scary looking back on and it's a little scary but something drew me out there you know I I go to work every day you know it's the same thing and I never got that feeling of that desire to go outside but something happened and I kept asking myself\nWhat what happened what made that day different and was there some sort of like the stress signals sent to me with the cat and distress and that kind of linked with me and the dog and then I you know but that's\nIt's not scary in a sense but looking back on it it's kind of like this so many cool things happen there it's really an amazing experience\nHow many pure noble experiences occur Brandon because the person who\nDied comes back\nNever had someone tune as business had they had to tell somebody wanted to get something done\nI you know I don't know percentage on that um I I Would say that you know a lot of the a lot of the cases out there of ghostly encounters have\nTo do with easing are coping with a psychological injury like the staff of a father or something\nYou know I'm ... you know you're sort of struggling with the death ah there's all these emotions happening um so you know the body sort of\nThe the electricity or the emotion signify a psychological injury and that sort of sets in motion of plan to sort of ...\nPsychological wound through what other whatever means possible so maybe if you're not able to cope through normal means you might use unconventional means you know and if if collective unconscious or collective consciousness exists the memories\nOf personalities and experiences of all of our humans are sort of stored in the atmosphere um you might be able to tap into this field um and and get some sort of resolution like or your father showing up and saying don't be sad I'm at a better place\nYou know and and I think these things [noise] I the research out there really says that\nI think it's up to eighty percent of elderly people experience these um bereavement operations associated with their debt spouse one month after their death um so that's a pretty high number eighty percent of the huge no\nYeah yeah and and perhaps these bereavement operations er visits from it deceive shortly after death are are kind of more important to our individual psyche and perhaps ... could be sort of a way\nThe process emotions and ensure that our cycle like psychological well being of the survivor you know a final goodbye from the deceased could help us move on through crisis or grief\nOr maybe if we didn't have that when the person died it might be a good way to sort of moved towards resolution and well and when I talk to this these people that have these encounters they often report feeling more at ease or accepting of a loved one step after the evaporation\nAnd I think on TV usually ghost or negative negative negative negative negative but there's a lot of positive I'm can come out of a ghostly encounter you know this idea of wait a minute there is something more to life where there is\nUm something to look forward to it's just not all negative and demons and things like a\nFriend who would have you concluded above the people who are more receptive to these guys reparations ... what's so special about\n[noise] uh that is a that's a great question I Wish I had a definite answer for that um I think [noise] you know something narrow biologically is different about them you know when they put 'em\nThere's there's some test out their specifically with people who claim to be really sensitive to electricity and things like\nThat like human magnets or something or\nYeah yeah exactly you know I ... the research is kind of sometimes fifty fifty if you want to think about that thing that this phenomenon exist and and it doesn't exist but there's\nSome some really unique experimental designs that um you know where they're actually doing I found out FM our eyes and eat jeeze and what they're finding is their their brain is actually and their bodies are reacting to this electricity at very low levels so there's some sort of\nObjective evidence that they can detect things that are more than ... other people and the general population can't you know so and this is true for less than we all we all experienced pain differently right and they've shown that throughout um our eyes as well so you you know I might get\nPoked with a pen and to me it's a horrible painful event for you it's not really\n... with us brand and we're going to talk more when we come back we'll also take phone calls getting another couple of stories of some of your studies when we come back\nTo ... to nice gifts to log on to ...

Brendan that you don't have the answers you wish you did\n[noise] ah well I'll be honest with you I think ah any type of um\nUltra guys activity or recurrent spontaneous psycho cases where objects are moving and I really don't know what's going on and those types of cases\nYou know they do humans have the ability to move objects if they're um in distress um you know to me it's hard to\nFathom you have the ability of like where the poetry guys I'm a you know we'll call it a goes moving objects when they can physically touch them and things like that\nI really don't know the answers to that um so you know it it's it's something I always read about that go back and forth on well maybe that's true maybe that's not but yeah that's one that's always baffled me\nMore new girls seem to move our car keys [laughter]\nI don't know there's a whole book in that George you should get on that\nMission smokers or something else so give us another story if you weren't\nSure um I was lying awake in bed for hours\nI could not fall asleep when I could not understand why I was very anxious and felt as if something was not right\nWithout warning a soft glowing light up here next to my bed the light gradually morphed into the form of a man who am I recognize instantly as my ex husband he did not say anything and appear to be just staring at me\nWhat was bizarre was that I wasn't scared and I had little reaction aside from being curious the next day I got a call from my son my ex husband's child\nDating my accent died the night before unexpectedly is death occurred around the same time I saw the image in my room I think he wanted to say goodbye one last time\nSo this is a case of a crisis operation that we talked about\nEarlier so we've all heard of these but it it illustrates the role of pull up as the years five phenomenon and operations so as a man was experiencing a tense emotional stiffs related to the process of dying in a in a way set up\nHello Patrick distress message to his ex wife who we felt linked with\nIn this case the woman witness I'm the typical soft glow in the white operation or those types of things um and what's really fascinating is since his death we don't really know the time of his death you know we know that this happened around that time of his death we aren't sure if this is\nI'm a ghost or pull up to the er ... phenomenon my suspicion is you know as a person is dying and these crisis events there are kind of a in a life threatening situation they send something out into the environment\nLike a message ... if you want to think about it like that and it resonates with people who they are linked with in this case you know the wife maybe I'll maybe the son got a similar experience that night as well\nBut this is a great example of a crisis aberration sigh phenomenon but it also bags that question you know was this did this happen after he died or did this happen as he was dying or before he was dying and you can never really pin down the times to the exact moment 'cause obviously we don't know exactly when the guy passed away\nAnd you find that energy and electricity has something to do with this is well\nOh yeah yeah I mean it's one of the most common themes when it comes to paranormal um or goes way encounters electricity and it seems to be you know with the most prevalent things but the idea is I mean listen we're\nWe all think the electricity comes from you know toasters and street lamps and things like that but you know electricity electrical fields comes from humans as well an animal\nSure does you know any involvement of humans also includes the involvement of electricity because lectures that he is the basis for our thoughts are emotions are movements or we're all a collection of electrical signals\nI've heard of people who walked by street lights and the lights go wild as they get on a on a range the lights go back on again\nYeah exactly so we're all sort of traveling around with her own bag of electricity and it's just like sensitivity to environment it's all different for for everyone is walking around in a way\nUm so it's it's really important when you talk about paranormal experiences because really the only constant it all paranormal experiences is the idea of a human being president to sort\nOf experience that operation a poetry guy so an eerie feeling a temperature change an uneasiness or whatever so for humans always present electricity electrical fields magnetic field they're always present as well since the first go slang counter ever\nUm you know ... and that's an important thing to think about it you know we're always immersed in electromagnetic fields we can avoid them you know as as part of earth that's what it is\nYou know any amount of always
