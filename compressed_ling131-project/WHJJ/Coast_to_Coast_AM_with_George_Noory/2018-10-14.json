damages are pretty extraordinary it collapsed\nSupport by the way I of\nCourse I mean it was a theft I get a burglary of I'm\nA ... a that's a neat show or whatever like that so uh she clearly I has been devastated there's an emotional issue here but how much is that work is pretty speculative and the jury would have to determine that assuming that goes to a jury or the other issue is the contract that\nShe signed and there it is we're not responsible if someone breaks in her well she signed it however\nShe signed it while she was burying her son and then the argument is goes wait a minute no one in their right mind they don't know what the hell they're signing it so she didn't have the mental capacity at that time or\nThe emotional capacity to know what you assigning so I Would argue that right so I mean the point is well and what's worse it's valley so the ... out there uh she's never going to replace the ring itself correct uh so I what what is money what would you want\nI

debated the RV on it now for several years in the area that I live in the recycling centers close to the closest one is like twenty miles away\nSo let me read you know obviously I've got to drive twenty miles or put it in the trash can trash cans recycling trash there'll be picked it up but I have to pay them to do it it's like\nWell hang on a minute wait why you on a C. R. V. you can't take it back to the store and get your money or you have to go to a recycling center\nIt used to be able to take it back to when I was a kid okay let's take back and they give you know and now you're taking ...\nOkay so you have to take it back through a recycling center is a twenty mile drive\nYeah are they ... and there's only one in the entire Scott storyline is yeah yeah what's your question do we have any recourse about not being\nProbably but you're gonna have to go to the state\nAnd the last probably gonna have to change that will say you don't wanna go pay to see here's the problem what do you what are you going to say you don't have to pay\nA a C R B tax if there was a recycling center uh outside of twenty miles for example is going to be Eighteen miles is it twenty miles and what happens if one movie and\nYou see as unfair as it is it is so impractical\nTo do anything other than either charge or not charge to see RV that's all and uh unfortunately uh you're you're gonna lose your C R B money that's the way it goes\nYeah there's a great catch from every direction here\nWelcome to California [laughter] really it seems like we're going to be tax\nReally it seems like\nA combine All right Karen Hi Darren yes\n[laughter] I have a friend who has a brother and sister that is not very close to lean in years rather they can't even find the sister recently passed away now whoever that he makes you know whatever I mean after him for eight thousand dollars\nOh wait a minute duty when he did he ordered the cremation no I didn't want her they coming after him if he had nothing to do with it that's what I Would like to know because he's not responsible and he's not responsible [noise] okay yeah I just I said\nUnless you are involved in taking the body out of the Morgan and moving over to her ordering a\nA a a funeral home to pick up the body is and who did that since I was at the state\nOr the county the cremation it was a state that did it probably is probably ... king you know yeah it's probably the county\nBy the state doesn't remade the county does All right so yeah I Know your brother is not responsible just someone is trying to get\nSome money that's all and it's just yeah it's a crock a you're not responsible for anybody's funeral expenses at all ever unless it has a child a unless it is a I think where you have ordered it and say okay I'm taking the body out\nBy the ... no ... not not not after that All right Jennifer Hi Jennifer Phil yet\nWhere we feel like how mine her high powered attorney or a family member\nAt the end of the family member I Know that there are using our money in stocks and how how do you how do you know that\nBecause our our attorney they bought a new home and they they read anything\nThey can okay Lorrie Cranor and right fair enough and how much money or does the power of attorney person have control over\nAll of our family I've had greater haven't had it out\nAnd a lot of it may be gone so ah what yeah so I get first of all I Try to police and if not that a a lawsuit\nI bet so where of course there'll be a judgment you get that person and hopefully the police will get involved because this simple fact\nThat's what this is this just stealing money uh this is Scott and the argument is fraud became power of attorney under false pretenses if you can get the da in balls junior at the cops and ball that's gonna help you a lot otherwise you go to a trust in a state attorney and try to get what you can first of all the account has to be frozen\nCompletely that's the first thing you do we\nGet all ... ... yeah yeah you know I get a lawyer this is this is one where it's above your pay grade\nYeah you're going to need you need a trust in the state lawyer figure this one out instantly and you want to get one like tomorrow kind of thing and uh make a motion to freeze everything pending and this is where you go into court ah with an emergency order\nWell you know I don't know if you're gonna make out of it yeah you're gonna make life\nMiserable so uh if you want to you certainly can I don't think much is going to come of it or they're going to do a bar investigation\nIs going to obviously have to defend themselves probably hire a lawyer or an expert in representing a representing a [laughter] I was representing their lawyers that represent lawyers in front of a bar\nAnd um you know I was ah oh and I I once had a complaint against me that was quite had a couple of complaints against the these crazy crazy complaints ... a basic based on the handling the law the advice I give because some people it took me seriously\nOh All right into relied on that so anyway but I had to ah you know I brought in a lawyer or who specialize in this the first time out or when I was actually frightened nine now I don't bother so it's your call here called do I think\nAnything's going to come to know why as I said because it wasn't that conflict it was the whites you were a notch uh being uh you were not a she was not being representative wasn't of divorce case where there was clearly a conflict so uh I just think the two of them got it on\nA daily way there your whole anyway yes\nHi I'm ... I'm oh\nGod I hate these lines All right let's try it does but ...\nWe just lost there shouldn't be technology out there that overcomes is wouldn't you think by this day and age I mean we can send a guide to the moon\nThat doesn't work anymore in the last time there was a guy on the moon was in the seventies so that's kind of stupid so we're going to be able to we can send the guy to Mars right at some point and so he calls back he calls back All right oh hello Chris welcome to handle on the law Chris oh yeah there's\nA new tax law that allows me to a man that tax return from Eighteen years ago it could get a refund of actors paid on military severance pay back then I was married to a someone that I cannot locate now are hiding from having to pay ... or\nSo I have no way of contacting her and I haven't heard from earn like sixteen years I don't know how to amend a tax return that will join with only one signature\nAh there there has to be a way of doing that\nBecause if the law allows someone\nTo file an amended return Twenty years later Eighteen years later a there's a a decent chance at the other partners espouse a ... is not around either can't be found a somewhere out there on remarried died whatever so I there there has to be a way within the rules of the IRS\nBecause uh the IRS is pretty good about issuing five thousand new rules every other minute so the trick is to find an accountant straight out accountant who understands these rules I Know when you file your tax returns you have an accounting\nChris yeah yeah have you asked your accountant about this\nYet [laughter] and he wasn't sure of any way could do it then you have and I happen to have an appointment with the Iraq on friday\nAnd that is under yeah that's the way\nI'm Glad you're asking me because of my vast expertise with not only this isn't tax law or this or tax returns and of course I you know when I have a complicated problem do you think I sit and researchers look it up now I go to my account and Chris\n... who did not what you did is you went a step beyond and that is what I Would tell you if your account and doesn't know or several accountants you make an appointment with the IRS and yet and you might have\nProjected that I actually find at my style and a maybe a\nPicnic or just magically appear now now where I Would I don't know if I I don't know if I Would do that I don't know if I Would do that what I Would say to the IRS is\nDo I have to find her and uh then I Will then I'll go to extraordinary lengths to find her\nAnd that's when I about Seventy grand behind the counter right that's another issue in there and they made this new and and you may be able to get the whole thing okay\nBased on the child support order so I the magical signature ah she's she's still entitled to half of that yeah\nNow there could be a way where and this happens all the time with child support the IRS holds off I mean it'll grab people's money\nAre cases in that state right now we're ... supposed to be surrender\nOkay so you're halfway there definitely time to talk to and IRS age and and and if the IRS agent doesn't know that rule specifically and it doesn't have any experience or or doesn't really understand that you go to a supervisor and you ask for someone who understands what's going on 'cause it's a pretty obscure stuff\nAnd it's not as the ... and IRAs Asian who doesn't understand this is incompetent in any way I mean if you ever look at the IRS code if you ever look at the Internal Revenue code these our phone books thick\nWith hundreds of thousands of rules\nAnd you're not normally supposed to be able to amend after three years\nWell they've changed the law I Wonder if you want to ask me I would've said no but if they passed a law that is a different than we're in great shape\nIt's for military better yeah obviously hack on Rick Perry yeah All right so is there any of them out there should get their return\nSo we're talking about a very narrow narrow description of a very narrow group of people and so you simply need someone who understands it and you're doing everything right man I'm there's nothing more I can give you other than you're doing everything\nRight also let me tell you about life like here's something they do right and life locked protects your identity and of course another hack this was Facebook Fifteen million accounts of course why not there isn't a person in this country has had Information Act already I mean just doesn't exist so\nUh I've been a customer of life lock and I'm suggesting you look

E. where did you go what did you experience how did you know that this was effective for you\nWell the my first one I've ever had hundreds and hundreds of experiences over the decades but the first one I had um\nI was actually in a dorm room are going to college and I was doing what I call the target technique where you select three objects and you focus on them and as you fall asleep at night and the next after\nA series of days went by a one day I was sleeping on my side not our when I become aware I've realized that was vibrating differently\nIt's it's strange to really describe this but you feel a vibration of floating sensation and when I reached out my arm I realized my arm entered the wall\nAnd when I did you think we reached the arm out oh no I was not\nQuite I didn't realize it was tell you the truth at the time but when I reached out what is at now I realize it at that moment I realized was my non physical arm\nIt went through the wall and then I saw them stand in the next thing I knew I was standing by the foot of the bed and it was a one hundred percent Rio and I began to move around the room and examine my surrounded\nThat was my first experience it was relatively brief but it was quite a life changing\nDid you encounter any body being guide anyone there\nAre actually that I did and I write about this is my first book adventures beyond the body that I observed someone that was observing\nMay um but they didn't\nI didn't communicate with them but somebody was observing may which was at the moment with a little bit shocking I was a newbie I had no idea about that what I had first stepped into here\nAnd uh over the decades and years of course I became more and more comfortable as I began to have more and more experiences\nIt's addicting isn't it yeah well it's\nIt's it's exciting because you can finally obtained answers for yourself\n... that said I think is the most important\nThing you don't have to depend upon um external sources and uh the indoctrinated society and culture that surround us you can you can find out the answers for yourself\nYou don't give you an example 'cause how do we know the answers are true\nWhen you experienced some in other words once you leave your body you know you you're more than your body you know that your brain is not the source of consciousness\nAs we've been trained to believe you realize that you continue to exist and also you begin to realize that the universe is multi dimensional\nWhen I began to experience was a not only one non physical dimension but many of them and you realize that the physical world is just the in a sense of ... than at the ... of the universe\nIs just one of them yes\nAnd but you can experience that first hand and that's what's important it's it's it's not conjecture or belief system\nMhm I always think you know is incredibly that's our our world is and you know this incredible globe that we're in\nA given topic couldn't stop here I mean with all of the intelligence that we have here and with all the information to the human ... why would the universe just create one type of human being and that doesn't make any [laughter]\nAbsolutely not and once you have to mention\nThat once you have these experiences you realize that the universe is multi dimensional and that and that there is there is trillions of all their life forms yeah not all human\nThere has to be it wouldn't just the one that did not want him anything\nNo of course not and it's the universe is far more diverse and magnificent and then we can do that I can express\nMhm yeah it is it absolutely is so\nWhen you you have these experiences and union of their meal because usually they feel real you and he was playing the because usually not a language to\nReally clearly defined what an entertaining is universal understanding\nWell once you leave your body and you begin to you begin to communicate and meet other being's generally they're humanoid they're generally what we would consider to be people that have died\nA I write about communicating and meeting my mother and my uncle who who had passed and the all communication is very elegant it's by solved\nAnd there's no need in other words language is no longer a barrier\nWe we communicate directly by thought ... and it's amazing it's so clear and concise compared to the physical languages that we use here that are symbols\nAnd it's uh it's amazing but that's one of the great benefits of this is that you have an opportunity to experience and explore\nYourself and discover the answers for yourself there

prayed alludes to them vibrations\nA sleep paralysis by the way is a prelude if it's if you react properly is a wonderful prelude to an out of body experience if you stay calm and react uh I I always I often say and people think it's strange but I Love sleep paralysis\nWell that's an indication that I'm ready to leave my body\nWill keep you safe that then you know walking off your balcony or yeah I think you know people\nDon't know how to use it um to initiate a profound experience\nA as science hasn't told us that so many people have common phenomena and they don't know what's happening millions and millions of people have they wake up in the middle of the night and they're non mall over\nOr their vibrating or they're a hearing strange sounds you know\nYou all can be a prelude to an out of body experience if you're if you learn how to respond to these what I call them in our signals\nOf there's a shift that's occurring within you that's preparing you for this shift of consciousness that we call an out of body experience\nNow it's important to become aware of this\nThat we do this naturally anyway I mean ... these when you are when people aren't going to these travels the experience he mapped the brain or do you make any type of um recording of their travel\nWe have at the Monroe Institute we have in isolation booth that has been used to map brainwaves during many different altered states\nThere was a copper lines or isolation chamber huh uh at the Monroe Institute that's used for um research\nAnd matter of fact there's one in each a we have two centers and uh\nThere's there's quite a bit of research being done on different types of ... states have consciousness let's put it that way for instance we have a class called discovery or twenty people are all hooked up to a mind mirror and every person they go through a series of techniques\nAre and they're they're but they're mad their brain waves are mapped during every exercise and in fact I speak it one night it on this class and I talk about how to initiate obese\nBut they they cover a lot of territory they also how to go deeper and meditation very quickly out of remote view more effectively for instance\nThere's a lot of different let's just say I'm skills that are talked for interested in different kinds of approaches\nLet's talk about some of the findings Cindy's what is a mind mirror twenty people hooked up to the minds near\nA mind mirror it's just a device that um will it's that's the trade name of the device\nI'm In ... in our class we will have\nA four people can be monitored by each Martin mirror and it's a it's a brain wave which it literally will monitor 'em your multiple different venues or the brain while you're going through an entire forty five minute program\nSo you can track it and then we can print out it resolved and again that you can tell what is what are you most responding to [noise]\nBut that's that's that's one of the beauties of the Monroe Institute is that there is research done in these areas\nBut for me the main my main goal is to teach people how to have the experience themselves and not only have it put control it and get the most of it my main goal is to teach people how to have a profound\nA spiritual experience ideally throughout a body exploration it's not just about walking and walking through a wall and\nA talking to someone and it's a lot more profound than that you have the we have the ability to have the literally connect with Sarah herself with are multi dimensional self\nRight and have the kind of experiences that that a Buddhist speaks of and the ancient Hindus and missed except talked about throughout the ages\nThat we're no we're there we have the ability ourselves because we are all of us

participants who have\nGone to the ... e training and then really measuring ya and he's come up with a common let me put it to nominate on associated with the the ... ...\nYes I'm just to clarify I've been at the Monroe Institute for the last eight years so um\nBut I've been studying this and practicing for forty\nOr just to go on my website astro info dot org I included um over a period of ten years I did a\nA number of surveys and our receive sixteen thousand responses from people that had out of body experiences and this is from forty two different countries by the way\nAnd it's it was amazing how similar kinds of experiences that people were having were so similar it didn't matter what the culture was for instance I'm\nA floating or um vibrations high energy sensations\nEighty five percent of people experience buzzing humming are roaring sounds\nAs a as a prelude normally to the experience because normally when you're in your experience things become very generally speaking are quiet but there's a lot of phenomena associated with the onset\nWas Seventy two percent at some point experienced some kind of partial or fall asleep paralysis\nI'm being lifted are touched that was quite common thirty three percent hearing voices are footsteps thirty seven percent this is one that's very common probably to almost anyone\nAnd that is seen through ... if you're seen through your clothes ... at night and you can begin to see you are already\nIn the process of shifting your consciousness to your non physical body\nBecause you have and it doesn't mean you've actually did your body but it means you're in the process\nBut most people don't know this because they haven't been trained\nIn the in the prelude enough phenomena associated these are common things that uh for instance probably the most common it's just a jerk awake you feel like you're just a you're taking a nap and suddenly you just jerk back into your body\nRight is I find that many people feel that that's an indication you're you're at a phase with your body as your fell asleep\nSo that that I see them on because that happened I'm retired I Will switch and I think his muscles in or you saying that now he said\nNo I'm saying it's not that I'm saying it's a prelude to one potentially ... this\nIs what I have found and what many other um experiences have seen and explored\nEveryone when they sleep we all humans are moving at a face from our body sets with sleep is mhm we take for granted no one you know there's no we we know about REM periods and we know about this from a scientific standpoint\nBut what happens for that one third of our life we're actually moving out to phase with our body\nAnd when you leave your body you can observe other people\nIt's like a double image people literally are floated I'm not saying they're floating at the ceiling they're just like two inches\nOut of the phase with her body at night as a sleep and you can observe\nThis actually during an out of body experience it looked like the image you're looking at\nIt's amazing the same applies to animals by the way animals also do the exact same thing\nOh yeah when you watch the animals sleep they aren't switching and having all sorts of experiences\nWhere they're moving their legs and the dream the can or they may be running in their non physical body I mean my point is that\nOut of body experiences are as natural was breathing and think about this for a moment and and that is just that everyone is non physical we're a non physical ... temporarily for a very brief period of time eighty years Ninety years\nDidn't ... biological ... machine ... and then we're ... we're all moving beyond the body\nSo it didn't it I find it just it's one of the ways to discover what's really going on what this multi dimensional game of chess wordplay\nAnd most people only aware that they think there's two levels of the game life and death actually it's a it's a vast multi dimensional game but very few people are aware of it and you begin to awake into this one you have an out of body or near death experience\nWell that you wanted to ask the question like how did the pyramid game here would you go into an OB and ask that question and have you ever tried this and I'm curious how would you know the difference between that and imagination\n... that's a good question it's all in the perception of the experience are okay\nAnd you can have multiple experiences for instance I had I Begin to have spontaneous experiences when I started this goes back into the seventies and I was still learning what was going on and I'm Still learning by the way you know one's\nA master we're constantly learning and I started to have experiences of myself as a German tank commander in these experience I Would find myself literally riding a German tank\nI mean and it was so real it was just like the physical world and I didn't even know what was going on I didn't believe in a past lives that wasn't on my radar\nBut then I had these repeated experiences and that's the way\nA lot of people end up getting verification and I had multiple multiple experiences where I found myself as a German soldier in World War two and I also found out that my let's just say one of my sons was with me at the time\nAnd um my point is that when a Austin will get information given to us\nOr we open to these experiences and we get a download and it's more than just download of information it's presented to us in ... were there were present and when you have this happen a dozen times it begins to get you get your own verification\nOh what's going on\nAnd I think this is very important because no one's telling you for instance I didn't believe in past lives until I started to have my own\nThat's I mean I'm just using this is one example\nRight but that does make sense it's it's just not needing to be validated or verified ... anyone other than yourself right\nAnd it's very important that sets self verification is essential I find because that's the only way will ever break free from the indoctrination of belief systems that dominate our society and culture\nAt Marion point\nYes because all of us have been from birth we've all been indoctrinated along certain religious and let's just say educational lines and [noise] you know I always have somebody that's\nAn avid believer and anything like a specialty of religion you know what would you believe what faith would you believe if you would have been born in India\nAh eh we're all been programmed and this gives us an opportunity to break free from that program into truly see what's real and look beyond the programming that we all share a cause and that's an important aspect of this\nAnd it's an individual journey nobody can tell you what you are and where you're going nobody can you have to experience a menu sudden oh my God now I got it\nAnd it's it's a transformational powerful experience and it's very self empowering\n... it is now back to the report to you had you talked about the common name he put it in ... and also\nThe average age of first out of body experience have you seen ... years old people recruit recount painting and it's often repeated experience that happens over and over again but it declines during the early teenage years why do you think that is so they sent you forget that\nI I think the children are just more open to naturally experience their multi dimensional self and once you hit ... based on all my research once you hit puberty everything just starts to shut down I think it as an interest in just a sec says something to do with it\nYes and I think more of us need to understand that and get out of the the ... that we tend to get in with his Eric all news that we jail it's\nRidiculous and you realize it's\nYou know there's so much of a court and stuff that we need to know about ourselves the greatest problem with humanity is a lack of knowledge of self ...\nThat's the core issue involved in all the ills that face humanity it's lack of knowledge himself if every one seven billion of it's suddenly your work one day and I knew what we were\nAnd where we come from and where we're going there'd be no conflict there'd be no wars are being ... none of that would occur\n... because we would know better\nIf we really truly knew we were all connected but there are just some beans on this planet we don't want to be connected with that theory doesn't work can we really truly all be connected to only the ones that want to be connected to [laughter]\nThat would go beyond the ego\nYeah we we don't I mean we're going to take another quick break and when we come back we're going to take your\nCalls so feel free to give us a call and I only think are

I was scared to death I truly was and\nBut right there at the end it was like a a breath of fresh air came on me and\nI wasn't worried about anything any more\n... [laughter] sounds peaceful peaceful and is is\nWhat it was exactly peaceful\nHave you been able to recreate than experience I'm not going to attack that feeling that experience of these\n[noise]\nNo I Wish I could ... it would actually be a great\nWell maybe that's maybe you can blame could he\nYeah absolutely and one of the things that people do report when they have and out of body experience um is that they have this immense feeling of a love and peace and fly that just flows through them mhm\nUh I've talked about this many times um it's like you're entering into a some people report it like their entry into a sea of of love\nAnd um and acceptance and it's and it's like it's difficult to even the there was no words to even describe some of these things\nBecause they're beyond our um our verbiage but yes I mean that's one of the reasons that people do have a explore these experiences so they can ah let's just say connect with those higher aspects of themselves\n... now and thank you very much so I appreciate it I mean has there ever been reporting of that and not a good experience and it'll be is it you can't it's not right\nYou know like there has been an end to ease and nightmares literally if your fear\nBased if you've been brought up with this concept that there's a devil\nOr Satan around every corner waiting for you to pounce on you you're going to have you made likely have negative experience your own fear will create it\nWhen we leave our bodies were entering into a very thought responsive dimensional space and that's what people forget and I I I say this all the time you know we're not observers of non physical reality we're participants\nEach thought is a creative projection and we are influencing the energies around us we do it in the physical but slowed down here\nBut when you leave your body through near death experiences\nSame applies to um if you're doing ... San Pedro or the empty or it doesn't matter how you do see experience if you're a fear based and you take your fears are mindset is going with us into our experiences\nThat's why it's so important to begin to each to take a closer look at yourself and your beliefs and to see how and tried to perjure yourself as much as possible of these fear based a belief systems that have no reality to them\nBut if you believe in some kind of negative vanity if if there is not like there's negative entered its you were going to create it in your mind is going to mold the reality around you\nIf you believe in love and light you're going to manifest love and light if you believe in darkness and a negative beings and whatever then you're going to manifest that is well\nWell you are creative powerful beings\nAnd when you leave your body no matter how it's done you're entering into a incredibly thought response of environment and you have to take responsibility for your experience some people don't like to hear this but it's it's the truth\nWell I had lived long lines where I went it was just a dream I guess I remember but he could very well in and out of body experience where I\nWas shocked by somebody that he'd written up it was like a future scene and they were on a motorcycle and they go and learn cycling helmet looked directly at me didn't recognize this person don't know anyone did I'm\nBrian ... owns a motorcycle\nAnd it was and he woke me up because it was as if\nThat person was really looking at me\nI don't know who lives in it wasn't a projection of anything and it was when I was no there wasn't a premonition of anything that happened it just isn't it was as if I had gone into a future dimension\nWhich looks pretty bleak be honest and then this person looked at me saying why are you who how did you cross into this dimension and then I woke up because we care to each other yeah\nI'd I don't know of that ad out at la out of body travel less likely\nMhm well it could have banned but it wasn't a projection of my psyche at all\nNo there's object there is consensus what I call consensus realities and there was no consensus realities there's that's that's why it's important to learn about a consensus realities are created by a collective group of individuals that all agree on a reality\nAnd they create I Try called consensus\nThere's many types of realities that exist in in a multi dimensional universe and that's why it's important for us to sort them learn these what is essentially the rules a non physical reality and how they function because it's not the same as it is here\nWe're used to live in your car and riders to gravity we're used to air yeah when you leave your body you don't have a biological body you're not breathing air you know you don't have gravity\nAll the things we're used to have to ... you have to learn how to function in a new kind of energy space\nThat's and that's of course one of the things I teach and I'm In my work shops but it's also in my book but it's important for everybody to start learning the nature of our continuing existence\nYes so that will be prepared for this transition of consciousness it\nI

coast to coast am so my guess today her website it's called ... two legends dot com and I love the beginning of it it does [laughter] welcome to the blue moon hunted history tours Ruben probably scaring the public since two thousand two Stephanie waters is my guest welcome Stephanie Lisa\nI'm Glad to be here and I love that proceeding commercial about paying because\nMy goal tonight is to have everyone Peter Pan [laughter] I'm going to scare the ... out of that it's lovely record\nI was thinking about that commercial say can you really shape e owners or is it is it is that this is Jerry anyway go to the show [laughter] funny\nYeah thank you very much and um thank you very much for being for letting me be on tonight and I've been a long time listener so this is a dream come true\nCause so will you send me your book and we do are you constantly in Colorado during our guys shows and I thought it would be so fascinating 'cause there are so many different pieces of history little pockets of history and it's really unassuming you can\nFind things like that in Colorado and everywhere but where did you what was your first experience where we are normal\nThis I haven't been seen go since I was ... an e high to a grasshopper is what I always say I'm\nAnd about and my parents never believe me so it was quite frightening and so this really has become part of my mission in life is to try to spread some better understanding and after I got cancer I'm about ten years ago\nIt was my wake up call and I looked at my bucket list and believe it or not my goal was to try and unite the paranormal can even immunity and to also do some outreach to help children better understand\nAnd I'm Still I actually started this paranormal convention and I partnered with my friend or a fence\nAnd she said professional psychic and she runs a nonprofit called kindred spirit\nOut of Longmont, Colorado mhm and so the two of us uh with the brainstorming and then getting a lot of support from other people in the community now we've changed the name to spirits of the Rockies paranormal convention and uh we we call it a little faith because every year\nWe try to answer it in a different immunity and by doing that we outreach to the historians because we call ourselves hunted historians\nBecause what we do is actual real history so even if you don't believe in ghosts or things that go on in the Knight supposedly this stuff really happened\nAnd I got particularly interested in this after I found out\nAbout a journalist named Charles sport and I'm sure all your listeners know about him\nThat he was pretty popular about a hundred years ago and what he did was he went into old newspaper archives and old mystery than he revisited then to see if it was possible that these things really happened\nAnd so that what I decided to do and interesting enough this is actually my fifth book and I want to shout out to ship for publishing L. P. D.\nActually published my last book ghosts legends and lord of the Rockies and it is available through shut the ship for publishing\nOkay well let's just back up for a second here so you let's talk about your Journey Through sure going to die of cancer and how do you how you reconnected your life would go what were you doing before then\nWell before that I like I said I've always been in to the paranormal because I've been seeing it you know since I was little child\nWe mean seeing it you\nYou know I see it and I actually feel it\nOn ... like humans to my examples that\nWell I can [laughter] I Know this is going to sound really funny but I can actually sense things [noise]\nUm I'm an impasse I think a lot of your listeners probably are familiar with that kind of a term but I'm very ... I'm just highly sensitive now if somebody came up to me and said hey is the Broncos going to win the football team I Can't\nProtect that into the future but what I can do is I see pictures for example today I was at the flea market with a friend and they lost their backpack and I saw the picture in my head of where was that I just close my eyes and I saw where it was at and we went back in there it was so\nI'm able to do things like that um but\nI let's see I think okay so I was a professional story tell her from the time I was about twenty all through college I used to do singing telegrams all of this kind of thing and so I've worked in the entertainment business for quite a while and about Twenty years ago is when I bought a bed and breakfast and managed to Springs Colorado and he was taunted\nAnd so I said well I might as well start doing haunted history tours and I open my big huge mansion to the public and I had haunted wine and cheese parties\nYou know before you bought it it was haunted\nYeah I was haunted but I was kind of like this you know my kids were starting in junior high at the time and I was like oh this will be fun kids get this we are oh you're going to love this story this is way true I mean it sounds like it's made up but I'm telling you that all that I'm telling you tonight as a hundred percent true\nWe were living in Southern California at the time and my husband was working for cancer research company and he got laid off when the company changed hands\nSo my entire family a move to Colorado and bought an old haunted mansion sight unseen\nI Swear that because they wanted to buy a hundred mentioned well are they wanted to buy a mansion well what happened is\nI actually come out I'm actually from Colorado and I'd come out on vacation and I was staying in the bed and breakfast\nAnd I got to know the owners pretty well and I told them my story about how my husband was in this cancer research company and he was the CFO and everything and at the same time the owner's life who actually wasn't living there she was in California because she I mean ... Texas because she had cancer and she was dying\nSo she was really interested in the research and I tried to give her as much information as I could you know her husband\nAnd mind you and she died and so during this time it was really interesting because I actually got an email um and it was back in Nineteen Ninety nine you know so I I think it was like I feel bad a questionnaire and the room and that's how he got my email address\nAnd he said to me you know I I Know your husband was involved in this and everything but we actually have this\nA bed and breakfast up for sale and uh if you ... you know I Know you said your husband just got laid off of work I don't know if you were thinking about coming back to Colorado but we could talk about financing the home for you\nAnd that was interesting 'cause my husband didn't have a job I mean everything just fell into place like we were meant to have this house and by the way I actually knew of the house because I grew up here and he was always really fond of this big beautiful old\nA craftsman style mansion done and the arts and crafts style I just loved it\nAnd um when we bought it it was really run down\nExtremely run down and so one of the first order of business was to actually fix up the house now this was a problem because the owners said to us that they would finance us no problem we didn't even have to put any money down but I was not allowed to sell anything in the house until the house was paid for\nAnd we signed a balloon I'm a balloon like loans and said that we passed the house and five years\nAfter five years we can do whatever we wanted with the furniture in the house ... what have you well after us you know no no hard feelings to the former owners or anything but I really did not like the way this house was decorated and I'm an artist you know and it's\nVery iffy that I'm In a soothing you can see where this is going wrong [laughter] yeah\nSo I actually called the owner's son and he was managing the bed and breakfast at the time and I said hey do you think they would mind if I you know just sold a few things and it goes you know what steps do what you want he goes\nMy mother is old and she is going to die soon you know this was before she died and he goes don't worry about it you know I'm just do what you want there never coming back to Colorado again because you know it's too high of an altitude song about that just do what you want\nAnd I said All right thank you very much\nSo I put an ad in the paper and I had the biggest is fate so I don't think anybody's ever seen\nAnything like wow I hired\nTwenty people um to help me out and we all had T shirts that said on a ledge estate so Nineteen Ninety nine and it was ethic\nMy goodness you drinking full out literally everything\nIn the house lock stock and barrel you can see where this is going right [laughter] I Can't wait\nTill the ghost of Shirley actually sue was not happy with me I'm not long after that my nephew was living with me and he was only six years old at the time and he actually had his own bedroom with me on a ledge estate\nAnd he started talking about a ghost named sue [laughter] I thought it was just so\nThe the Indian American Native Americans knew about these\nSacred places and in these sacred places the trees actually grow kind of sideways and it's just curious ... the hair on my back on my arms and my neck will go up\nUm you can feel it um and the other thing that's curious about it is that\nBecause of these magnetic anomalies um Nicholas Tesla actually noticed I Believe he was standing outside of the cliff house hotel and he was watching as these birds um we're just\nCircling over managed to spring it was like they didn't have any sense of direction\nLike their innate sense of ability to find their way through north or south was gone and you know they have birds have a little piece of him type crystal in their brain and\nIt they he was saying he was speculating that maybe because of these magnetic anomalies the Brits were hunting confused because\nThey were actually behaving in a very strange manner by like diving into buildings and and like ... the pilots [laughter] interesting\nIt really is a very special place that is fascinating we will find out more about managing your Springs Colorado when we come back with my guest Stephanie waters I

[noise]\n\n\n\nSo welcome back to coast to coast am my guest is Stephanie waters and she is not only a professional storage either as we can tell but he's also the owner of the blue moon hunted histories tours in Colorado\nSo Stephanie tell us a little bit more about the ... we were talking about men or two springs and how it has this incredible magnetic anomaly there where else in Colorado and why the civically Colorado did it just called you\nUm I think another reason why I'm that people were drawn to manage it springs sports or ritual reasons is because originally this was a sanctuary\nTo five warring Native American tribes and when they came here they had to pack between them that they would not\nFight when they were here this was their holy sanctuary so they would wipe out their war paint and put down their weapons and there was peace here forever and tell Victorian came along and the legend is that we started building you know the hotels and\nThe goal was set free by the truth and guess what I went up there on our birthday me and the first\nDay which is October seventh I went up there to the theater and the ghost is gone it worked\nSo the manager confirmed that they don't\nKnow yet all of this worked up beautifully [laughter]\nThan eating now had she seen the operation of this not\nSince the book has come out it was\nAmazing during the time before the book yes\nOh yes she knew it was hard but she hit like I said her job was at stake oh by the way it was interesting I forgot this is an important part of the story why out of the blue you know on August Eighth two thousand sixteen because the theater had just been sold\nTo the city at one point it was actually slated for the wrecking ball\nAnd this was reaching out for at least trying to find someone to help her tell her story\nI'm sure this isn't the first time that's happened to you\nI'm a ... well the first time I got a call from a ghost that desperately needed their story\nThat yes but you seem to be the you know like the public is for these ghosts and the [laughter]\nYou know I have made it is it's meant to be one you have a wave really connecting history with these you do the research it's like a real lives go go ...\nWhen you when you go to places and they say it's haunted don't you'll always want to know why and I laugh when they always say it's haunted by the both the likes of the little girl that bounces all isn't she do I'm like\nNo leave in ... listen friendly does give me a break [laughter]\nThere's no devious funds spirited\nAbsolutely not if they are they're just kicking you being you've tricks\nOr it's here they are in prison here by their own their own their own mind that they're they're they're they're in danger\nDo they tend to come out more during Halloween during nighttime so yes\nIndeed I absolutely believe this time of year that the ... and this is the best time if you do want to communicate with your loved ones this is the best time of year to do it I absolutely believe are in that\nWhy do you notice that there's a peak time\nOh yes [laughter] and the best time of day believe it or not you know everyone thinks that it's midnight or you know they're ... we do have the boats that come out at midnight you know but um or at three thirty in the morning but I find the best time\nTo actually look for if he wants to see them with your eye is at dusk in between when the sun is just setting it's in between day and night it ... that is the best time\nThere's a transition time why it's\nThe if the lighting if you think about this there are so many colors that we can't see and when the lighting is just right see I'm also an artist and oil painter hitting lends itself to the shadows does that make sense\nYes it does it make straps when you see the shadow people\nAnd the light changes very fast rate and it\nI call it the God light it only lasts about ten minutes and then the Rockies we have it it's beautiful because of the way that bounces off the rocks and the ... the mountains like I live in a canyon and it really lends itself to being able to see the shadows that just the right direction\nNow is the place that you're living in now haunted or did you miss when non ... latest gas I think goes follow you write\nIt they do on like two words it's very funny the up and doing them now for Seventeen years I started when I was in kindergarten [laughter]\nJust kidding [laughter]\nBut um that being said I've been doing it for so long that I just naturally thought that the this is going to crack you up but I thought that the street lights and managed to her on a timer because whenever I Would walk on her name's bites they would go out when I Would be talking about certain goes you know these certain locations\nAnd then one day my friend says well why would they go out when you're standing underneath them if they were on some kind of a trip or to save on electricity or whatever they would on when you walk underneath them and I said [laughter]\nYeah that's true [laughter] so they really do communicate with us on the tour I Will talk to them in the street lights will flash this this town is very haunted by\nA well it's true for a lot of areas I mean even bolder window I Walk around there and I went there once a month doing doing uh my show in the ... if you just look at the tops of the buildings it's got a lot of history\nYeah yeah because I happen to you too I mean I've heard that sometimes it just happens to some people with the tripping of life\nI used to happen it doesn't get any longer\nAnd and the uh did you notice that would happen to other people who are just you I Know you said it doesn't anymore\nYeah I notice it was just happening to me\nAnd it happens so much but then it stopped\nI Know and then you don't want to tell anybody 'cause they'll think you're psychotic they're like oh well\nHave you tried to say it's happening at well so\nThey're like oh aren't you especially you know how to do all kinds of magic tricks I'm like no really I'm Serious I was just wondering if that happens to you too and they're like no I don't have that\nAre there are there other western towns like old western towns that you other than Boulder and and manage we springs that you know are also carry that type of energy and absolutely Estes\nPark right in there oh yeah the you know this family hotel right there on that a native them it's very sacred Native American land anvil they're right there it seems to be a there's us [noise]\nI have heard pilots telling me that if you go up on an airplane and you look down on managed to springs and bolder and even as to part with S. with the infrared cameras at nighttime that you can see light up\nLight up with the red energy I find that very interesting and you know the natives used to call this the spine of the ... the spine of the earth was the Rocky Mountains this very sacred land it's very very old ancient\nWhy did they call it the spine is you're right there in the center of the country\nYeah the center of the world the pikes peak\nThey believe was the naval of the universe I find that fascinating because maybe it's the court will\nYou know that's what I was going to ask you know why is what we need to get into this this is very low fat Ernie I Love this stuff [laughter] hikes peak it's very popular\nAnd it has a lot of um

talking about Colorado legends and lower and when we were talking a little bit before the break about pikes peak now there's many places in the world that have lots of legends and lower but this particular one pikes peak has\nA lot it's considered one of the more usual places in the world as well as um because of its kind of rich waters and mineral rich area in\nThat particular region of the u._s. can you tell us a little bit about your experience as many ... you know about the beach\n[noise] well um pikes peak I think it was called T. T. V. A. T. that are have a I think that's what the native youth he used to call it but they literally believe that the mountain was the belly button of the universe I just love that\nI loved belly buttons anyway but especially the belly button of the universe that's pretty important\nWhy why you would call that connected to the mother okay yeah it's\nConnected to the mother and think about the native is the way they must of looking at it as being closest to heaven as they can get a father sky Mother Earth mhm [noise] and so the significance and even even if you look at the mountain it\nDefinitely stand out from the rest of the whole front range it stands out like a sore thumb that and the natives knew that it that of the significance and we also know that cripple creek is right there on the side of pikes peak and cripple creek as I understand it um during the pikes peak gold fresh\nProduce more equal than any place in the whole world I\nHope I have that right but I'm sure I Do [laughter]\nWell it makes sense because there's a lot of other minerals there as well\nYeah and if you I Love the show ancient aliens and they talk about that that we have a lot of UFO sightings silver pikes peak\nAnd I'm a lot of those stories of posts and of course in this region but on the ancient aliens they talk about how perhaps the I'm ancient aliens were attracted to this region because of the rich mineral deposits underneath\nThe mountains here in the Rockies and I find that that is a very good explanation because when I was doing my research especially about UFOs I found that most of the sightings happened over the all metal mining camp\nEspecially cripple creek you know there's a story that happened this would have been Twenty years before the Wright brothers to fly over ... over Kitty Hawk\nHearing cripple creek Colorado they were over five hundred people that saw UFO when they were coming out of church on Sunday about noon it'll it's cleared daylight\nAnd it was a flight of about seven or eight of them of ships\nAnd they were hovering just about oh a hundred hundred yards it other than it was so close that they could see the windows I mean that that is amazing and they were hollering they weren't flying so the explanation of weather balloons was totally\nBefore there was like yeah it just it just I I find that fascinating 'cause even today if somebody says oh I saw a UFO you can always brush it off as being an airplane but this was before we had or a governor ... experiment gone exactly exactly or even weather balloons wouldn't have behave the way that the the ... mhm\nErratic flight ... up and down sideways hovering you know like a helicopter mhm\nA fascinating and they didn't know what to look they there was no explanation now so what I did was I followed it I followed the sightings throughout the Rockies at the very same time it was fascinating to me this was like an Eighteen fifty nine you would not that it's a lot of\nPeople out yet but a lot of people thought this I mean just outrageously\nCrazy and he found his story in\nKansas and then came over to Colorado yeah it was amazing\nAnd the story was consistent\nVery much so the way that that that's a very good question right there because that's\nThere was no way that the farmers in Kansas you know back then before we had the world Wide Web could possibly when farmers in Colorado where thing that I mean this was amazing back then you know um what we you know that we've had the telegraph you [laughter]\nYou think pikes peak because of its mineral rich content and waters that are that contain a lot of minerals there it's a conduit for a a UFO or extraterrestrial activity yeah\nAbsolutely um I have had the great pleasure of meeting some wonderful people over the years as the director of the paranormal convention and one of my friends is named Dan Mathias and he lives in green mountain falls Colorado and um which is right underneath pikes peak\nAnd um he saw a big foot at home to his back door opened his door actually um [noise] he um the big foot\nActually rubbed at the high neon his screen door and he actually had some\nBig hair [laughter] and um then has\nReally committed his entire life to the belief in Bigfoot and he believes that his property is on part of a portal [noise] and he does live above green mountain falls back and these rock formations and there's Patrick clips and the rocks and I've been back there with him and all of this myself\nAnd I believe it's possible you know a lot of you might not\nHave you seen in the writings he believes that my friend he probably if it's um you know it's like stick figures I find this fascinating because they are elongated\nJust a straight line a stick you know with too little like a
