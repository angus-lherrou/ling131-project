ironically um that was at a place called the kind of chase in central England only about five miles from where I grew up as a kid so I Know the area very well and it's a it's a large area of a

baffles paper that there are a lot of cases like that where um you know something pops up and people who do I want to know was that\nAnd then he's never seen again but um this particular case is an interesting one I'm cutting I pull Nineteen sixty four in Buckley, Washington and I'm actually quite close to my ... on the witness in mind I'm young man named Brian Khan failed\nUm he sold the

kind of looks a bit like\n... and um and for a while in Nineteen Ninety four and it was actually quite big using that area and then like a lot of other these\nYou know there's other cases he just sort of became part of the local legend them you know the areas folklore and so\nYou've got a lot of men in black stories women in black stories you and I've talked about that before that might be a ... year than the men in black and and then some of those cases you know they seem otherworldly just out of place\nUh you you know we've we've been accustomed because of the movies or do you think that maybe there are some secret government agents but have you ever had any indications that maybe some of them are\nSort of very human government type operatives who are operating under the umbrella of something like a men in black trying to emulate the the real mystery and figuring they can get away with it that no one will believe the witnesses who see them\nYeah well I've got to be honest with you in Georgia I'm doing five books now I'm On this phenomena for them to men in black and one of the women in black and I have to say that the vast majority of all the reports I get don't send anything like you know they stepped out of the Pentagon the CIA all the FBI and say\nI'm a you know nothing like the the concept in the movies they typically are described as looking ... you know go on and the skins live ... white white\nUm and people talk about how vaccines have the ability to mind control the personal hypnotized them pay for even talked about when they're in close proximity to them that by full and sick afterwards almost like a like a super naturally infection or something along those lines\nAnd um there are cases when the men in black and the women in black of turned up in homes right after paper being using wage of bullets which puts another angle to its\nUm but there's no doubt in my mind again um that's you know this is a real phenomenon but it's not like it's portrayed in the movies it's more sort of like a\nYou know like a golf a horror story mixed in with the X files you know you put those two issues together that's that's how I Would sort of describe the ... the ... street it's fall be on you know just guys in black suits\nWalk and you know\nI'm asking it into contact sort of like with cattle mutilation says I think you know there's there's a lot of evidence that the use animal relations are carried out by something other than just um um humans and helicopters that some of them are truly inexplicable and then you have a whole other wave of them that\nSurely seem like they aren't humans that are carrying out the same kind of thing for whatever reasons um this is sort of leading us to where we are going in the next hour to talk about your other book on the alien abduction wells but we're in human\nIn season that doesn't mean government agencies but humans uh pretend to be something paranormal get away with something that's really weird and they they do it in a way that so that there isn't a lot of serious scrutiny by people like you are people like me or or other investigators\nOr I mean I think you know when you talk about the kind of your choices you know you really we're in a couple of them so much easier to explain\nBut with the men in black but you know in some cases I think government agencies are responsible for the paper or a small degree they really unexplained and the way it was\nWhat I think it happened on a few occasions and there is some evidence to support\nIs over the years agencies may actually unemployed

[noise]\n\n\n\nWell come back we're talking with Dick red burn a you know there's an old joke about paranoia paranoia ... about something along the lines are just because you're paranoid that doesn't mean someone doesn't really following you around it's sort of the the the inspiration for this new book or yours top secret alien abduction piles\nYou talk about the world in which we live where mass surveillance is sort of a given now right\nAnd of course you know subsequent generation growing world wherever I've never known any different you know I'm right\nBy the night before the Internet age will remember it was sort of well why should I say we have now\nYeah I think that's one of the unfortunate things for future generations it's gonna be a child a normal thing for them and and probably accepted as well\nYou know you mentioned in in in the book about the idea of\nThe fear that people used to have that maybe the government's going to talk us into getting a computer chip stuck on your skin and then they can follow us and they don't want to be for all the good reasons you know for our health and wellbeing and\nAll kinds of ways been in effect they would be able to monitor everything we do everything about us we already have a surveillance devices like that we all carry them or their cell phones yeah\nUm but the idea that our government the u._k. government other governments around the world would what time and resources into not only investigation of these phenomena UFOs things of that sort of feeling abductions but would monitor intimidate\nFollow a alien abductees whether or not the government understands what humid Ilene abductions are all about that idea would seem posture us too many but you make the case in this book that it's real and ongoing right\nYes I mean the reason why I wrote the book which actually the official publication diet is the first to November the people can already got it [laughter]\nBut um the the reason I wrote top secret I mean abduction falls is because over the years I've collected a number of official documents on abductions which urbane declassified through the pavement formation act in the u._k. um the u._s. and finally I was in a position where\nI could actually sort of put the book together and you know provide the rate that we've yes it's another book on Eileen abductions but instead of going just overall ground you know\nWhy not present paper with a guy to showing\nHow falls would be put together now I start the book actually with the contract a movement of the Nineteen fifties which preceded the abduction phenomenon by just over about ten years or so and the reason I did that was to demonstrate to people from the would go so to speak\nBut um government agencies do ah put together falls on paper who claimed to have had I mean ... for example just about all of the ... of the Nineteen fifties like Georgia ... George finds hassle\nTrue and bathroom ... all of them had FBI falls out putting on them one of the mind raise in Spain was because they claimed when I'm able to you by the FBI\nBut yes they have these experiences with aliens but they told the FBI that they the Iranians had\nA government government's very different so I was ... and bordering on\nCommunism and I'm so that really opened the eyes of the FBI to the extent that for example George Hans hassles FBI file\nUm he's extremely extensively about an inch thick um Georgia ... is about a hundred and fifty pages I'm ... was about four to and so on\nSo you know we have a precedent for the abduction phenomenon with the contact tape people now\nIn the fifties excuse me in the early sixties\nThings really kicked off I'm with the abduction phenomenon in September sixty one I'm with the bacterium Bonnie hill case which is I guess he was the defining moments you follow gee when it wasn't the first abduction case on record but he was certainly the one that really opened people's eyes when\nJohn full of wrote his book on the case they interrupted journey\nNow in the story of basketball and hail that coming back from a a vacation in Canada they say the strange lights in the sky\nAnd then things kind of get waited\nUm they don't fail rights they you know everything seems a bit surreal and strange\nAnd I get back home and then they start having these weighed dreams and nightmares of being taken on board the strange craft with Akeley strange creatures and being subjected to a stranger and intrusive\nExperiments now what's particularly intriguing is that I found a file in the British national archive on it revolved around among Ronald wild man who was a delivering a vehicle in the south of England and it was like the early hours of the morning about to I Am\nAn essay was driving the vehicle to the location\nThey the lights on the call when I was on the cost a certain time to a halt\nAnd they should they should become known as the the vehicle interference phenomenon with a new holiday what's intriguing\nIs that they they ah British police force actually handed over the investigation because they report to the to the police found it over to a group within the British royal Airforce cause pulled a a promise than security services are sort of like the\nThe James Bond they feel like of the of the royal Airforce they sort of get involved in espionage and counter intelligence things like that\nWhat's interesting is that even the file it talks about how they ... they promised them security services interviewed Ronald wild man by the same time to with the with the ... to a halt and the UFOs in front of him\nAnd the most telling an intriguing aspect\nIs that he told the police so this is a direct quote but he was modeled by the time\nWhich is an interesting thing because that sort of sounds just like you know the whole missing time on goal of abduction low in today's world but Ronald while in the fall actually refers to him saying that yes he sold his UFO coming down lights went out of his vehicle\nAnd then he kind of fell to beat strange checked his watch and there was something about ...\nIt's actually you know portrayed completely and the file but he says he was much older by the time which I think you know you put all those aspects together but has the potential for being a significant abduction case\nI think about the contact ... and I remember reading about them when I first got into this subject and thinking sort of with the music meant well there were there were a interesting colorful harmless sort of weirdos um but the the more you read about um the more interesting they become a course people like a dam ski\nThen you realize that these guys telling you is crazy stories some some of them would say you know they they met these women and went to Venus and things like that and you you you you have a hard time taking the literally but when you realize that the government is really does followed them around and takes it seriously for whatever reason\nI ... it makes me think of like the Roberts and men or that the CIA scientist studied UFO topic and they include\nThe UFOs themselves are not a threat to national security but reporting UFOs might be because maybe the Russians could somehow manipulate a public opinion is that a justification for following around people like a dam ski bathroom those folks\nOh yeah because I mean George ... ah first book flying saucers of all I'm they published in the early fifties that that sold him huge figures are gigantic numbers of books were sold\n'em and a damn ski went on the ... it's a little around the country and he was talking about how the aisle and supposedly have this sort of a call me and this type\nOf governments um the communism was the way of the future and the FBI open the file on a damn ...\nUm predominantly because he was someone yes talking about a controversial subject namely UFOs and contact with aliens bucked\nThe FBI was more concerned as to how painful reading these books and go into his lectures might be influenced by this combination tangle and I'm\nA number

I was wondering the first thing I was wondering when I finished this book was how do you get away with this you are a seemingly respectable guy teaching at a grade school and I wonder if you're if you're going to catch grief for doing it\n[laughter] you\nKnow it's um yeah how do I get away get away from you know a lot of people and cultural studies or people who are interested in studying religion or you know we do we do get a path to study really cool fantastic things right um people's um unusual experience or unusual states of consciousness religious experiences\nExperiences what whatever you want to call them so\nYeah it is kind of a privilege to be to be a professor and and get a chance to just kind of how my interests and that's really what this book came along um [noise]\nIt came out of an earlier book I was working on that looked at sort of buy in a religious experience and spirituality but as you know there's something new and new direction by thinking about science and physics and cosmology and how it would be sort of fantastic scientific ideas and let 'em but\nAt least a new vocabulary that people are using now to talk about near death experiences and and the sciences and and even after life experiences and so on\nYou mentioned in the in the beginning uh and of course as a as somebody who studies religious studies and religion and how it interacts with the world and popular culture you mentioned in the beginning how a believer in church or a formal religion organized religion is sort of\nLimiting a around the western world but interest in spiritual and spirituality topics or has has remained strong or you may increase that that's a that's kind of a challenge for somebody in your line of work to figure out why that's happening\nYeah I think it is I think it is and um you know that's why a lot of us are trying to study these these new forms of spirituality I mean that that was really as you say that was really how I began the book with this puzzle you know the problem which is\nYou know people still in America seem to have a lot of I guess we'll be called spiritual beliefs they ... him pretty high numbers in America\nUm believe in and goes to believe in spirits or believe in God and yet on the other hand as you say a participation in traditional religious congregations are affiliation in traditional ... with traditional religious congregation so things seem to be going down\nUm how how can we think about this how can we talk about this you know how how is it the case that people seem to have a very robust sense of belief and\nOther world um and spirituality and the absence a really in the absence of participation and traditional congregation so that's what I tried to think about and\nTry to think well where where people getting that these ideas you know where where people getting their beliefs their ideas about other world and\nI'm kind of a big science documentary person and I'm I'm real you know I'm kind of like a science nerd and in a sense and interested in pop science pop science book and I think there is there's a lot of sort of fantastic scientific concepts that circulate now in our culture and\nI think uh you know concepts like dark matter or dark energy or even thinking about\nInfinity a or thinking about the the multi versus thinking about higher dimension I think all of these fantastic scientific concepts which I think scientists themselves and embrace with ... with a sense of a mystery in and wonder\nI think about those concepts are sort of uh the seed bed for for a new spiritual infections and I and that's and that's what I Try to look at it in the book\nWell you know we we don't imagine you listen to the program all that often but on this program we talk about some pretty wild stuff and I think that scientists will die hard times too late for me George it's too late [laughter]\nYeah I was pretty wild stuff that I think mainstream scientists generally have a tough time getting their head around a near death experiences out of body experiences encounters with other realities um you know time slips things of that sort of that you you've sort of reached out look look for a way to maybe\nMake a bridge between science and those kinds of subjects with this understanding of\nParallel realities other dimensions higher dimensions we talk about that those kinds of concepts on the program all the time ... as if it's a given day or a given but we don't really I don't think many of us know I Can't get my head around other dimensions and\nUm it it it hurts to even think about it but you take a deep dive into a sort of\nWhy those kind of concepts are so commonly held so um that one that was important not only to reach out to people like us to discuss these crazy things but also to science right\nYeah I think so yeah I think so I mean one thing I Try to do in the book is\nUm I Try to try to demystify a little bit the discussion about other dimensions and the and the first couple of chapters the book I I can I ask the question of what it what is an extra dimension um and I talk a bit about [noise] uh I talk a bit about that and maybe I can just say a word about that for\nThem for the listeners tonight yes yeah I'm also a\nAnother demand the idea of another dimension is not that I'm not that after ... after all I mean we have we know we have we have three directions or dimensions three spatial dimensions that we live in and that's linked with and height\nAnd those are our three directions or or dimensions there's there's an additional dimension that we sometimes talk about is the fourth dimension um send Feinstein in that time so we live in a four dimensional space time a world and on science I spoke about this but\nSome of the people I talk about in my book talk about an additional spatial dimension [noise] a a direction and space or a dimension in space that's different from the other three so you know we could think of like we could we could draw the line on a piece of paper or a line of one dimensional objects that has length\nIf you then draw flask where on that same piece of paper and has two directions or dimensions that has links and with\nAnd then you could you could draw cube I'm On the paper or you could hold a Rubik's Cube in your hand and that would be a three dimensional object has three spatial dimensions ah links with and height and then the then the question becomes is okay what about a fourth direction um or a fourth dimension\nAnd this would be you know this would be an object that has links with height and something else [laughter]\nAnd the the something else as the tricky part something else is the is the direction that we cannot perceive so if there is such a direction to reality or dimension to reality it's it's evidently not something that we can we can see 'em or perceive\nI'm so this this is the possibility raised by math mathematician and actually others some philosophers I'm In the\nGoing back to the Eighteenth century but really on the nineteenth century mathematicians raised the possibility raised seems like kind of a strange thing to think about ... how could there be another direction or dimension to reality\nUm you know and why would there be one well mathematicians in the nineteenth century start to use this idea within the context of their mathematical equations and the reason they do is they want to want to make the mathematics of of the universe of its forces in laws more simple and more elegant 'em and they find that\nThey find that it works um [noise] they find that they find corporate in an extra spatial dimensions\nA fourth visual dimension that the the mathematics of the universe is a law enforcers look that are on the equations cleaner they seem simpler and more elegant um um and so on\nSo and in fact just to skip forward to today today you still have mathematicians doing the same thing um you still have mathematicians incorporating

S. Lewis I'm as well and then I have a chapter on Madeleine L'Engle right who's a famous writer of wrinkle in time\nJust recently a movie made a fact of that book but she talks about time slip some and and time travel um and so on and some of her books [noise] so yeah how do they make sense of that um\nWhat time is not linear right my like my president could be somebody else's future\nYeah well for sure I mean I think one thing that one thing that done picks up on his as you say that Einstein has a new way of talking about what time is which is really\nCounter intuitive and weird right I mean before Einstein people thought about time is just linear as something that just flowed out of uniform rate right we we had a sense of prime flowing we have this kind of intuitive sense at time flows forward\nUm in fact though you know Einstein had a number of counter intuitive things to say but one of them was that um the ways that we experience time is probably just an illusion and the product of the limitations of her own consciousness that\nEinstein's equations for for the universe really lay out something that looks a little bit different but they really lay out a universe that could be called a block universe\nUniverse that already exist\nSo um you know all locations in the universe and all times in the universe I'm already exist and they're all laid out in this big block\nWe are we are kind of a passing through [laughter] passing through that that block prior we occupy a little portion of that block but every moment in our past and in our in our president and in our future and in the earth's future and in our son's future\nAnd and all of our defendants future's all of those moments are already laid out in the block at least according to the\nThe laws of physics um and and this is actually discussions Scott defending wants to look at it it's disgusting my book but you can also look at Brian Greene's books he's a professor of physics at Columbia He wrote a new book called the fabric of the cosmos where he talks about this kind of block universe so I'm\nDone and I was only laid out what does that say about destiny and free will and yeah that sort of questions that you as a professor religious studies back all the time\nYeah you're right you're right and it lays out these big philosophical issues right like um fate and destiny and human free will and how freer to make choices on and so on [noise]\nUm so and we can definitely talk about those issues I mean one thing that done did um and some of the other people in my book did as they thought through these problems was they said you know I I think what ... what's happening is that\nYou know the fact that these future moments are already laid out somehow in the block universe makes it more plausible or makes it more possible that you know maybe the dreaming self could somehow lift itself up above our\nThree dimensional world or I should say are four dimensional world right because we have three spatial dimensions and one temporal dimension\nThat dreaming stuff he said can lift up out of that block universe and peek into future moments and done believed that I'm using a bit of Einstein here and a bit of you know him thin and higher space philosophers there I'm that's what he believes will happen in some other dreaming consciousness had an additional\nA degree of freedom an additional direction that it could move in\n'em and and if we can talk about that as a as additional spatial dimension or we could talk about that is\nNow maybe consciousness somehow can move with an additional degree of freedom but that's what he thought and he he thought everybody everybody's sleeping self had this degree of freedom and he he also believe that every one if they haven't kept a journal by their bed of their dreams and and they followed he had a couple of recommendations for how to how to do a dream journal\nHe believes that if everyone did they would be able to see that all of the all of our dreams contain bits and pieces of future events and past events I'm sort of mixed up together [noise]\nWell I get on the central question for me about higher dimensions is are there people there and can they interact with us or is it a that's over there we're going to get into that ah those topics as well as near death experiences want to talk about to say on a showman remote viewers\nHow some of those ideas that we discussed on this program before might fit into our discussion of other world so the book spirituality and the search for an visible dimensions by Christopher white or we're going to take a break and be back in a moment David Gray sail away like listen to the break [noise]\nNo you can show up dates with other coup spins when you joined acoustic ...
