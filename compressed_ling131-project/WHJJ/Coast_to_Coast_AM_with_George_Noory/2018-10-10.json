millions of people you know there's this story that's been going on for ages oh with a ghost town there's nobody out millions and millions of people use it very happy with it I've been very happy with it [noise] really in a way they were sort of a victim of their own success because when they when they started Google Plus throughout its entire run\nGoogle decided not to put an ad on it so there was no ... there was no way to buy sponsored posts right these are both things that drives people crazy Facebook\nSo there was no separate income stream coming from it in the meantime everybody got kind of look or by Facebook into thinking well you got to have you got to have the sponsored post you got to have these things that are manipulating your your time lines and everything\nAnd they got a

never really got that scale now this brief that occurred\nWell all the right at the top of the currently found out about this for a month ago they should have publicly about that at that time [noise]\nApparently there is that they really didn't if they found that in a during a if I understand that during their own auditing their own security auditing and they didn't have any evidence that it had ever been exploited in other words it was a theoretical possibility but apparently nobody knew about it outside of school\nAnd the kinds of information that we're that we're theoretically vulnerable where like name and email address no credit card numbers no financial information nothing like that while that stuff that people have with Facebook so they said well why stir things up when there's so much going on right now I mean that's my interpretation\nAnd they kind of sat on it and write and now of course it kind of makes it a convenient\nI won't say excuse but ... it convenient to kind of a rationale for setting a demotion this on the setting of Google Plus over a period of about a month but they they should have discussed that publicly of the first place um and uh it would've

surprised to hear that but I think as I Hope people about the evidence that I was referring to people parked up and we're interested in the fact that I was taking the time to research and write a book on this topic\nNow let's talk a little bit about some of the things you uncovered that you didn't really know about before until up with the pre cognition tell us a cycle ... he says you you of course we learned a little bit about them but you learn more as you did more be research didn't you\nYeah absolutely I mean prior to I Would say two plus years ago I hadn't heard of these topics beyond science fiction I had no idea there was actual science and controlled study that hadn't been done on these topics and I have a chapter on each of those topics that you mentioned where I go through what I think is the best evidence that exist today\nWant something that wouldn't arouse the body\nWhat we find in the study is that there is a very subtle again highly statistically significant effect think Jeff thing that the body is responding in the direction of the picture eventually shown seconds before the picture is shown\n[noise] years ago during the television days they would hire anchor people lose people are based on a system called the ... skin test\nAnd it was a series of electrical impulses that they would hook up with audience members to and then they chose videotapes of various anchor people and the the one that showed the most remarkable response\nOr from the audience because of the skin test they're the ones that got hired or they were looking for some kind of reaction from people and the person who just you know didn't register at all on the meter\nUh with the people in the audience they never got hired I I don't know if they still use that or not but it was amazing technology back in the seventies\nWell that's the type of technology that is being used in presents men experiments measuring the skin response\nAmazing work now psycho Comey says\nThe ability to move objects with your brain what did you want to cover their\nRight again this is something that doesn't make any sense at all under the materials paradigm consciousness is considered to be at the phenomenon of the brain it comes out of the brain has no effect on the world\nWhat I found in my research is that that might not be true and I think the most compelling studies that had been controlled or once again that show very subtle effects\nAnd they were actually done a primarily at Princeton University which is interesting because I went to Princeton University and I had no idea of these studies were being run\nA Dr Robert Johnson who was the former dean of engineering a rocket scientist ran a lab for nearly Thirty years running these studies\nAnd he also looked at remote viewing but he also he looked at ... which is disability for the mind that matter\nThe classic study used this random number generators these machines that spit out the heroes and once in a totally random fashion so again if we look at probability overtime a random number generator will have if you present heroes and fifty percent one over time\nWhat the experiment does is ask people to put their mental attention to the machine to make it produce more ones and zeroes for example and the person doesn't even have to be in the same room\nSo they say hey I'm pleased put your mental attention to the machine and make it produce more one heroes again what do we find is that there is a small but highly statistically significant effect where it seems as though the mind is is changing the what used to be random behavior of the machines\nRandom generators picked up some incredible responses during the tragedy of nine eleven\nTwo thousand one they did not know what the time what was happening what was going to happen but they felt something was going on because these random generators mark just went ballistic yeah and people do people have that ability or have\nThat's right George ... that was to me or perhaps even more remarkable and this is part of the global consciousness project which which was an offshoot of the ... study where the machine the random number generators\nWere set up around the world people weren't even necessarily aware that the machines were they're generating these numbers and what the experimenter had done it looked at the behavior of the machines around the world around an event\nThat we know a produce heightened emotion and nine eleven is one example of what we know that people had heightened emotion and it happened at a hunting trip basically and it had a single moment that we can look at what was happening when everyone that focusing their attention or many people are focusing their attention on the events\nWhat do we find that there were the bike at nine eleven but in the case of nine eleven which is even more fascinating to me is that the spike happened before the plane hit the towers before the event that before the event which suggests almost a global free premonition that this was going to happen\nFor a yellow her you know that name of course had an incredible ability or if you believe what he did for ... she had the ability to

B. taught can cycle can ... be taught\n\nWell I've heard of of food and bending party which sounds ridiculous but I've looked into it and it appears that people train themselves to be able to use their mind in a way to to affect matter beyond just a random number generator worth actually bending metal for example\nAnd ... as an example where many credible people have suggested that what he can do is real including um Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu who sat in a two thousand Fifteen television interview that he saw Keller then and\nThere are many people who have suggested that this

ability in a convincing and unambiguous manner\nSo yeah there has been a lot of debate about him but these documents suggest that\nStudies were around and he was able to perform which I think should

Callahan Fox News hurricane Michael very close to a category for hurricane strength\nShows that light that everybody seems to see going into that tunnel or whether something is really going on here ... is a difficult call isn't it\nI'm Glad you brought up short they're really really important one because\nIf there is some truth in what people are experiencing beyond that was an Asian perhaps it gets into a window into a reality that we typically don't even our eyes I I think we should explore this went further my perspective on it after having looked at the evidence to me the most compelling evidence are\nThe cardiac arrest studies\nKnown at ... cardiac arrest studies is where people have\nTheir in cardiac arrest ... and the experimenter as talk to them soon after they're able to sit after they've had the experience rather than ... people to remember something that might have happened twenty or Thirty years ago\nThat either cardiologist for Apple Dr ... ... and ... from Stony Brook another one we'll scientists are looking at this and what they're finding is that some percentage of people who are in cardiac arrest on back and describe near death experience and why is that again\nIn cardiac arrest severe physiological trauma and medicate the person is clinically dead we know that when the heart stopped after a certain amount of time there is no blood flow to the brain and the ...\nFunctioning so if there is minimal or no brain functioning we would not expect people to have these experiences that are so vivid to them and as I mentioned earlier\nSometimes what they report during the near death experience when they're out of their body is verified as being accurate later I'm One example in particular is\nFrom Dr Sam ... in a peer reviewed journal called resuscitation in two thousand fourteen one of the patient in particular had a very vivid out of body experience where he heard something in the room\nIt was later found to be the difficulty later and we know that this happened during the time he had no brain functioning because the times were being stamped and we know when the defendant later went off and it made it very distinctive sound and yet this person came back and describe the sound in the room that happened when his brain was off\nWhere they've been cases as well where somebody is literally gone through this near death experience there floating above their body they see the nurse and the doctor and everybody in attendance\nTalking about the person you know well sorry we're losing enemies dying or whatever then they come the person comes back into his body and tells the attending doctor exactly what he heard and it boggles their mind\nAbsolutely it doesn't make sense according to this material is perspective that we need a functional brain in order to have conscious experience memories\nAre but what I've found is that there are very credible scientists that are looking at this for example the University of Virginia the division of perceptual studies at the med school has looked at this very closely and Dr Bruce Grayson as one person in particular\nWas looked at these phenomenon and is is finding that something is happening when the brain is not functional and people are able to report things like what you described where they couldn't have known about things through normal means and it seems as though their brain was off and they said something that was accurate which is not by definition if not who's the nation\nMarquee Iran six hundred and twenty terrestrial radio stations as we speak and they're all sending out signals in the cities and markets that they are in\nYou can't see those radio signals once they're out there is that a little bit what was this is like consciousness were sending out signals that you can't really see but they're out there\nThat's such an important point I think we tend to be biased by what are ordinary a perceptual systems can tell us particularly our eyes and our ears but we know it's not even controversial to say that our eyes show or a small sliver of the electromagnetic spectrum\nAnd what we're dealing with here may be something totally separate from the M spectrum but we know that our eyes only show us a very small sliver of reality\nSo I Do think that maybe there are things beyond what our normal ordinary perceptual systems can show us at our existing but we just don't perceive them\nAll right let's take some calls here for you as they begin to line up and I've still got a whole slew of questions for you mark and by the way for a non scientist you're doing an incredible job on this topic you've learned a lot haven't you\nI have and I hope to summarize it in a way that a general audience can absorb it\nLet's go to bill from West Hartford Connecticut kid ... Connecticut built by the way is an amateur astronomer and an atheist hey bill\nHi George Hi Hi Mark yes I Am a rational a gift and immaterial west\nHowever I Do think that there is something to near death experiences I Do think there is this phenomena going on I just think regarding Andy\nUh where where the mind I Would use the word mine not sold but mine are conscious just goes uh or or exist temporarily during the envy is heaven or hell in a religious sense just like there is no God or no devil\nI Would call it an energy dimension or an energy universe and I have a new term for it I Would call it may be\nSeeing you ... you know space no time a dimension but my question to you is specifically\nA I liked it sort of question your whole premise by talking about site medications explains psychiatric medications medications for either anxiety or depression whether it's anti anxiety drugs Claude ... antidepressants or major tranquilizers ...\nFact chemical have the brain and therefore they do affect chemical you the consciousness meaning the mind so by changing biologically biochemical you the brain to these medications or even aspirin or Tylenol ibuprofen can that can affect the brain is through the headaches\nGoing back to psych made it can affect the brain chemically we know that positively and in the mine that's my first part my second part of the same one question is\nAlzheimer's disease dementia affects the brain does it affect the conscious system mine's a dusting that show it here's my question for you it doesn't show that if\nThe mine and the brain are not the same thing at least the brain is connected to the minus connected to the brains and I'm trying to say\nThank you very much for your question bill\nAnd this is something I Do address in the book and I've thought a lot about personally because we do know that there is a strong correlation between what happens in the brain and the type of conscious experience we have whether it's ... medications or if someone gets in a car accident and then has cognitive impairments we know there's a correlation\nWhat I argue and and some others argue this as well is that correlation does not always imply causation in other words just because two things are related to one another\nWe can't automatically conclude that one causes the other so here's this simplistic example from Dr Bernardo Castro when when I mentioned in my book [noise]\nImagine you have a fire lots of firefighters show up you\nHave a larger fire more firefighters show up\nA very strong correlation between the size of the fire and the number of firefighters that appear at the scene\nWe know however that the firefighters did not cause the fire that's not the nature of the relationship\nBut the firefighters are highly related\nTo the fire so I've used the brain in a bit of a different way with a grain of highly related to consciousness damage the brain you you'd take psych med the brain and consciousness will be affected\nBut the brain I view it more as like a filtering mechanism or like an antenna receiver which similarly which show a strong correlation between what's happening in the brain unconscious experience but it's not the producer of consciousness\nWhat ... what do you think mark reincarnation\nWhile I have a chapter on that in my book and I talk about the studies done at the University of Virginia I think there is evidence for it\nWe we've had some incredible stories too of people who have talked about their past lives including little children uh and it just is remarkable when they're checked out there's no way that they would know certain things unless they experienced it is it's it's mind boggling isn't it\nGeorge I agree with you it's the chapter eleven of my book and I think the most compelling cases in addition to children being able to recall thing that they shouldn't have any way of knowing\nA man or sometimes they're if I'd buy medical records by the UVA professors is in some cases the children have birth marks or physical deformities that are very specific that matched the way the child describes dying in the previous life\nYes and in some cases the medical records are found so it's it's something that beyond genetics beyond environment which are the two factors typically considered to affect the physical something else was going on and the researchers call it a third factor\nOr a person's petrified of water and then somehow and hypnosis they died in the past life by drowning let's say\nExactly what's preferences and fears that somehow or transferred to something beyond the body seems to be a transfer from wanting to another ostensibly\nWe have Monique insulin California with us I'm Monique go ahead\nI orange and why I have

Albert Einstein did not like this at all he called it spooky action at a distance because he thought the speed of light was the fastest that anything could travel and yet here we have an instantaneous connection between distant particles\nThat there are things in the ... and the fabric of reality that are totally counter intuitive but we just don't feed them in our everyday lives\nHas this changed your life\n\nIt absolutely has I think from the standpoint of understanding human potential and what we can do psychic ... this is open me out completely but also it's it's introduced this notion that interconnectedness the idea that we're not actually separate even though it appears that we are\nAnd that takes on it brings a whole new meaning to things like altruism which if we're all connected than helping another is really a version of helping ourselves that to me that this has implications for interpersonal relationships all the way up to world peace\nRight my friend mark thank you again in one more time you bought your website and where people can get your book and then to upside down thinking\nThank you George my website is mark Goldberg dot com and they are K.

stories from the wrong with the unknown the unexplained the unbelievable let me tell you about marine fifth generation psychic transfer medium for as far back as she can remember\nShe is communicated with the D.C shut the age of Fifteen\nShe was introduced to a person who's studied with laureen Cabot\nWas the official which upset with Massachusetts and she took Maureen under her wing and Guided Tour and ways to dot only understand but also control this gift at the age of Fifteen she served as the medium for adults say on says\nShe's practiced studied and instructed metaphysical studies for more than twenty five years more has been with the New England ghost project since two thousand one and there's a company the group on more than one hundred investigations\nHere she is on the coast to coast Maureen welcome\nThank you so much for having me looking forward to this Fifteen Years old all this happened for you yeah\nI Know as you're reading that and thinking oh my God that was only a few days ago right\n[laughter]\nTell me about Lori Cabot the official which of Salem\n[noise] you know\nHe's very a a wonderful woman when I was at that age Fifteen you know she was someone that was barely renowned and the city and she still is um she had known as you know the high priest is a famine and he'll often\nWhen I was younger I see her walking around town you know dressed and her her guide and very regal looking very um you know she ... ... ... and ... at\nThe time did people welcomed with open arms or did they go oh my God there's a which\nYeah that's a great question you know there are many people that welcomed with open arms but\nLet's just say the town Sam I'm not necessarily [laughter] so it always seems to be at those days it was a little bit of a battle between the businesses and you know and the town in Salem and those who really believed in the witchcraft and um so basically she did you know she really changed\nThe whole way they look at it now you know obviously they tore them right now I ... is it you know go to town on so I think that it really worked out well for the town\nNow you are a fifth generation psychic trance medium that means we're talking about ... back to your family you said this ability what year who did it start with\nNo ... and it's interesting because growing up my mother just never really wanted to I don't know if you don't want to scare me should get you know my father though he thought the girls in the same\nUm but I Would come to her and talk to her about spirit thing and I mean it was normal it did it seem unusual I didn't have anything to judge it by\nUm and my mother would ya you know God Bless her she'd say are here some holy water you know just that you know she'd come my father she is normal\nUm but she didn't really with me a lot until I was older and I was still\nYou know involved but say in a matter of physical and that spiritual around and one day I mean she was talking you know in her and she finally told me that his you know what Marlene\n... from my family for many many years like her great grandmother and you know her grandmother used to help people in town and he'll them of their illnesses and keep them stop them from bleeding and\nYou're waiting for them and she said you know I hear the spirit but I just turn up the radio so\nWould you say that there was a member of your family that was better than another member\n\nI never you know never really quite thought of that um I Would say that I had you know my grandmother died when she was twenty eight so\nI never really knew her um but my great grandmother my grandmother rather I did know and she was the one who really got involved with doing reading for people I heard that you know she was very trusted in her city or in her town\nUm so it's hard to know I mean I don't know have a lot to really judge by and my family history of who was might have been stronger than another\nDid they ever pass dome stories from one to the other the so you could carry through\nYou know the only thing that I Do have was given to me and uh I have this little picture of you know and it was my grandmother actually before she had path and uh she was maybe\nMaybe five years before she passed and it's interesting 'cause she you have a picture of her and she looks like a gypsy\nUm and my mother used to joke about it and say that that you know ... that was her true self she was very unique about what you said so that the stories that God will always bits and pieces never never anything that was really concrete that I could say I'm about spirits anyway\nYou know you've been with the New England the ghost project Maureen since two thousand one would use that\nA well rounded doing much better than me\nTo tell the story but he started this story after on a near death experience um and he had to work and do a um you know a special court for class and he took\nTo try to keep him busy when he was hailing from his illness\nI'm and basically he started doing a cable um you know he's got a cable program and during that cable program he didn't have to do it on something so he chose you know doing it on goes that his workshop and again he'll do much better at explaining that I Would focus\nOn but it's a team of individuals that\nYou know over the years I've learned you know to me everybody is really you know it's a great team of people you work really hard to get to go out and you look for things that go bumper the night you know someone else doesn't really want to to want to look into that they're quite\nSatisfied not knowing about the unknown or you have someone that really needs help there's been many calls over the years to run and the team\nUm that were you know businesses um you know families you know you'd have restaurants and they don't really want to\nDo I go out and tell the public all the time this was years ago they don't want to tell the public that something is going on that they can't explain and um people were getting a little freaked out and they need help so\nIt's really been a journey of love I think to go out and actually work because we're not paid you know it's not something that we get paid to go out and do investigation some people it's really going there to to just help them\nHow many people are just a off the wall when you go to their house and then just losing that\nWell off the wall meaning terrified of spirit you off the wall just crazy\nNow show [laughter] sure his birds I guess\n[laughter] um you know as as it says we've done more than a hundred and investigations\nUm I Would say that you know not a hundred percent would we find something active going on at the time\nBut we're big believers to know that you know it doesn't always happen on command\n[noise] um so I really believe that there are a lot of supernatural things that are going on um if you're aware and you're open to it you might experience it you know some people say well I've never seen it and I don't believe in that well isn't good reason why you don't see it [noise]\nUm so if you say how many people I'd say a good percentage of paranormal activity does take place out there and I would bet that if you did a poll and you ask people on the street\nYou'd get a good amount of you know maybe Seventy percent of people have had some odd experience they can't really explain and their lives\nWhat have you conclude about what this may be a lot of people have their thoughts about what ... what do you think they are\nWell I think\nThere are varying degrees of what they could be right so our experience and my experience over the years has been\nYou know if I Do a reading for someone for instance um I get more of a loving spirit someone that's passed over that wants to communicate and come back and you know let their love when they're okay or\nMaybe has a message for them that they weren't able to get before they pass 'em but then you know you're called out to some locations where\nYou know things aren't really going while someone's gotten thrown down the stairs items being tossed around the house um there's different you know events like\nSay a you know people walking by and then you might see a spirit walk by and all these plants just die as they're looking at them um we had one case of a woman who was living by herself with the door\nTo door closed in her apartment and yet she was hit on the back of the head with a a ballot stripped from the stairs\nOr you know all these out she'd have something go on in the oven she'd go to put potatoes enroll them in soil and should lay down and take a nap while they're cooking and yet they would fire would start in her of and um it would wake her up with the alarms going off and she'd get up and look and the potatoes underneath on you know on the flames itself\nAdamant that you know it wasn't and I need to talk to\nUse them brings us out of the house and now I'm thinking jeez what do we get ourselves into right um\nHe leaves Ron up at the top of the driveway with the guy knew any rags me down on the driveway and he looks at me he said I Want you to come back here tonight by

I saw her continually walk all the way to do it\nAnd I waited and waited and yet\nNobody came in so finally said is there anybody out there and there was a volunteer sitting on the rock out there and there was another one by the door and she's just notice there's nobody out there but yet I saw her as clear as day so clear that I had stopped my field to wait for her to walk it\nAnd yet there was no one here and oddly enough that ... is where the coast guard because it's on the coast guard base\nA coast guard reported seeing women walking on the wall in that same location so that was kind of intriguing I'm an I'm perhaps the other one which is going to the opposite scale was on a Sunday Morning after we did a public a ghost town on uh what Iowa lighthouse in Bedford pool meals\nMain we're in the White House ah keep U.S House it was under um renovation at that time we were sitting on the picnic table in the in the room off the kitchen and I look towards the kitchen I serve dog all across the door or the kitchen and ah but I didn't hear anything you know how it drives you hear their claws on the\nYeah yeah the the there was no there's no sign out so I jumped up and meal you're into the kitchen\nAnd the dog to the door was closed so I came back and spoke to a woman and she says why would you see and that's just that's our dog she says you to describe not so sure absolutely yeah SARS clear as day and I describe that thought she'd just stood there and shook her head and\nSmiled at me and she says well you know Ron there was a White House keeper here who had a dog and when it was time for him to be relieved to leave the island or the dog wouldn't go so all the lighthouse keepers afterward took care of them totally dog actually died and\nIreland she says the dog you describe pretty much mattresses because she has a dog\nThat that of that dog and I did see a picture of it looked like it but can I say that was like no but so I mean his two things that I'm really not looking for goes but it's certainly saw it would appear to me as a ...\nMinute still hangs around Ron stay with us we're going to bring Maureen back in both of you are old will take phone calls next on coast to coast am runs website of course is linked up the coast to coast am dot com and their latest book is called more ghost chronicles and\nFind out more about tonight just log on to go to ... dot com\nIn Ninety Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland\nD.C ... students in seven for the naval school officially became the U.S Naval Academy and he's the new curriculum went into effect requiring mission to study at the academy for four years to train and boring shift each summer the basic format that remains and the academy to this day\nThis week in Nineteen sixty eight Paulos down in the first manned Apollo mission is launch with astronauts Waltzer Sheeran junior gun diesel and Walter Cunningham born under the command of the year and the crew of Apollo seven conducting an eleven gave orbiting the earth during which the cruise transmitted the first line television broadcast from more of a\nLeak in Nineteen Seventy five the single born to run became Bruce Springsteen first every forty head marking started his eventual transition from little known senior international superstar twenty six year old Bruce Springsteen had too heavily promoted major label albums behind him nothing approaching a popular here\nAnd also this week in Nineteen Seventy five Saturday Night live debuts on NBC featuring Chevy Chase a jumble Lucy\nDan Ackroyd and Gilda Radner Garrett Maurice Jane Curtain and Lorraine humid and we'll go on to become the longest like a night ...\n\nAgain winters these Youth Radio nine twenty and ... are you waiting for\nEye on radio station\nScooby Doo strongest storm ever on Florida's panhandle ...

and bring nothing down from four to nothing so that would be good [laughter] I think we've been able to do some of that so when when when you go on your team when your team gets together how much research do you do before you go\nWell Maureen doesn't do any because half the time she doesn't even know where we're going to use\nYeah she was telling us that you you don't want to ah influence\nI I have to know some would have voted for instance if you're going especially if you go into a big location you have to know where to concentrate you're you're investigating for instance if\nThere are a lot of noise is coming out of tickle area you might want to cut your tree your audio recorders serve\nIf for a visual phenomena in different locations you certainly want to uh you know put your cameras in there and and so you you ... you have to have a little bit of it I tried to get too much into the details with tour of the coin is for lack of it or\nAre you there to discover the ghost or to cleanse it what what did they ask for\nI Am not I I Am there for you know strictly investigate\nThat's a popular question 'cause and that was one of the things people will say when they read our first book was like oh you know you know what were they doing you know they're not going they're releasing spirits and you know those are things you hear from people but\nYou know they love the book but the whole point is is as one and I've always talked about you know some of those parents have been there long before we have um and we don't know why they're there right so we don't necessarily know that they want help to move on that's one thing if they're there and they don't want to leave who are we to tell them to that they have to\nDoes the person who brings you when do they want the ghost out of there\nI always ask them you know what you want from us you know basically a you know what you expect from us in\nA in a very of the cases on that if they're looking for someone who watch like a house Clinton's is something we're not going to do it though you know or are we from someone else but if they wanted to investigate this to understand what's going on and try to understand what's going on than will do that type of case\nAll right let's take some calls free both to view let's go to brandy and granted big California Welcome to the program I brandy\nAlright thank you for
