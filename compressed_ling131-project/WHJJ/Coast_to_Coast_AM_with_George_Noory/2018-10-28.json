couldn't go to work the next day it didn't it didn't and it got worse so we had to go back to the emergency\nOr another co payment and then they\nCut another part of her mail and they said go through your doctor ... they seen our doctor the doctor said I Can't do it I mean just send you to pressure work so she was off work or four days into the specialist over following week\nAgain she missed like six seven days by a car we seen this pressure it got worse bad to remove all now\nAnd she\nCouldn't go to work again so she roughly ... or two weeks of work because of the one creditor do we have a case\nWell yes you do the problem is there's certainly no lawyer in the world is going to pick it up and read\nA missing two weeks of work or because of bad pedicure and you have an infection and they ripped off a nail I I mean that's nothing there\nAnd so what you have is a small claims I don't even know I don't think that the small claims he's going to hear a small claims a a a matter of effectively a a medical issue negligence too where you were a method where she was medically hurt you can try\nAnd saying here's what happened ah I've gotten the infection of course if I were the person on the other side of that or if I'm being sued and I run the nails will a shop and he goes hey wasn't me that the infection someplace\nElse so I it's one of those saying also what kind of insurance you think now people have\nA while the other thing that we thought of of going back to the show on him and telling them that we're considering just to and what they make any restitution\nOkay that's fine you can do that although I don't again I don't know how much money you're going to get so here you're damages the the work\nThat was last what two weeks how much how much is your wife went make Henry uh she\nWorks part time so maybe I don't know maybe a thousand dollars in the last two weeks\nShe works part time and make five hundred bucks a week All right let's go what does she do she works for a school district\nOkay fair enough so uh she's on a thousand bucks so there's that and then whatever the co pay is on your insurance there is that\nUh so you can try I can guarantee you that ah the nail salon I don't know what kind of insurance and has a\nIt only has liability insurance before the building if someone falls down I Am breaks a leg that kind of thing I don't think they have insurance for the other thing but yeah what we do is just go there and say hey you know I'm Out a couple of thousand dollars here and uh\nWhen you want to do you want me to sue you and see what they say I'm assuming that the owner is Vietnamese right now I Want a shocker a Vietnamese nail salon especially here in Southern California\nI shouldn't they carry insurance for yeah I Would think so and although I don't even know what kind of ... what kind of liability insurance you have for nails\nI'm s e bay shore but so what assuming I'm willing to bet they don't Henry okay so you're I think your ideas as good as any\nShow up there and say I'm going to sue you maybe it'll give it to you in trade you get two thousand dollars worth of pedicures there's a lot of pedicures you know that a lot of pedicures\nAnd was Kennedy at a versus I was hypnotized and I have no control ... yeah I don't think so\nHigh mark\nYes all I entered into a a settlement contract with a large insurance company and they were supposed to uh give me a two good faith check up front\nFor a total of a two hundred and one thousand dollars and then payments for the next seven years I took the checks down to the bank and a new account specifically\nFor those are the one check for forty five thousand dollars one through and then I was notified by the bank and set in the mail a return on a stop payment on the second check\nOkay did you did you call them up and just ask why\nI asked why and everybody has a walk around with their head gone G we've never heard of this ever happening before\nYou may have to hire a well I wouldn't even hire a lawyer yet a now comes a a letter saying you're clearly in breach of the contract\nI send them a letter out senator and breach of a\n... new\n... center to all the different departments\nAnd how long ago how long ago did you send that letter how many weeks ago or days or weeks ago All right well ... couple of weeks ago is not enough time for all that they've had six days to respond I Know but they do and I just have a more\nI just had one of those where it was a settlement huh that do we entered into my company entered into where we were going to get paid 'cause we dealt with people that didn't do such a good job who had insurance\nSo we settled that and they have to pay within thirty days the insurance company correct they ended up paying within Seventy five days is how long it took us to get paid\nOkay and to the point where our lawyer had to get in that's a lawyer who arranged the settlement had to come in and start screaming at the insurance companies we actually had to file a lawsuit\nFor breach before they paid okay so mark just get really aggressive or if they ... you probably fell through the cracks mark a if you're dealing with a major insurance company you weren't going to get paid more there's no question and then I Would turn around and see how much interest you're paying ... small claims court for the interest you lost\nThere you go okay well you'll get paid more guy it's it that's world of insurance they're they grab you you're you're a second and a half late on your auto insurance for your health insurance ear canceled\nSeventy five days late on a payment that was supposed to be made within thirty days just like Mark and that's typically what the payment to the timeline normally is\nGo figure huh oh hey Gary welcome to handle on the law\n[noise] hey I'm I have a question for you my wife and I own a house in Ventura and it's a smaller track about uh thirty nine ... nine home uh we when we bought a house um where was given a or excuse me a fan are that are\nLimited what we could do with our law and what we can do with our own\nAnd one of the stipulations of the the the at are fed that\nEach of the homes have do we build on a single a lot and um that each home had to be at least Seventy five feet wide there are other stipulation\nBut what happened was a developer got to the city of Ventura or the city approve the splitting of the lot and now the developer is building two homes\nThat are in violation of the CBC in are in a number of different ways\nOkay so I wanted to know what our record\nTheory on that you are you what you do is you get the homeowners you get the H away\nAnd immediately file a lawsuit against them just because of the city allows a certain type of building or the or the community that is the H away also can control\nAnd they can say no one more than one lie or one home ... now I then it becomes an interesting situation where the developer now comes back and saying you're violating my ability\nOr to build housing of which ah I'm allowed to do based on the city but I think the winner here in my opinion would be the H away but you you it's time to get a lawyer you need a land use attorney Gary like right now\nIs that a real estate attorney\nOr it is the real estate attorney but it's a real estate attorney that specializes in land use and there are a attorneys out there and then in fact represent nothing but H always okay so you get to go just go on the uh go\nOn the Internet and got check them out because that is I Know developers going to roll over on this one uh there's no way in hell was especially if you're building additional homes that's big money for them\nAll right max\nHi good morning to offer yes there are ... are you sure quite a horse [laughter] okay how do you have trouble with an insurance company yeah I sure never heard that one before ever max and much of that yeah that's what\nThis was the name is while while asking [laughter] anyway uh anyway they shorted me based on the estimate of up space for committed they shorted may eight hundred thousand dollars [laughter] yeah I called him a couple of times the size and they told me to go around and I\nSaid that is anyway ah anyway what I did I filed in small claims court trade are there and maybe seven dollars\nAnd the way they came with a check for five hundred ... on the checks if I take the check a that negates for claims\nRight now I'm Wondering if I could check because I Know and get their button court if I take a check 'cause negate to end or\nYes it's a because that's part of the agreement the agreement is if you went to ... check then I Will not go after you I waive all my rights absolutely okay so the only way you can go and kick their body is to say no thank you to the check and ... and file in small claims court and kick their butts okay that's that's where I'm going\nOh good luck and here's the good news whenever you go in front of a\nIn ... judge against an insurance company I don't know how that works 'cause normally they would kick it right up to superior court\nAnd so you're really not going to be in front of a a a judge a small claims judge which are usually not judges odd and daddy is and this happens all the time with big companies they immediately make a a motion to kick it up and then you have to go out and hire a lawyer ostensibly\nHowever there isn't a judge in this world that has not been screwed by an insurance company\nSo you're coming in with an advantage by dry cleaners never even go to small claims court ever because they know they're going to lose walking in the door they just write checks now the good news is they write checks or the amount of replacing a\nDress women I've had a pair of

I I think what was ... I I mean I I it's it's it's just it's still very solemn to me that you know the innocent people were hanged who are protesting their innocence and that the real the people who had confessed to being which is\nWe're ... eventually let out of jail and then it's kind of you if you can test instead yet was really sorry about that then you let go but it was the only people said no I'm not going to get ... and I've never been a which those are the people who ended up dying but for the most part I mean there's a large percentage of them didn't anyway\nIs that right ... ... avenue wants the tragedy of these people who did the right thing you know stuck out for that believe all the things are told to do in your life\nAnd it ended badly for them um which is why you know Arthur Miller's crucible such a great works of literature in place is because he tapped right into that kind of idea that these guys did the right thing and by doing the right thing they ended up at the end of a rope on a hill you know only oh America\nWhich the or in the population you said under about fifty thousand but of balloons up to two hundred and fifty during the\nThe Halloween a ... ... the month long festivity of Halloween is is there in Salem is there any other time of year where they they see the kind of bumped like that or is it just is like a it's a I mean I realize that they always kind of get a steady stream of tourists but it's this they're big season this this\nThis October you know these thirty one days October\nOh mathematically I mean some some of his only open in October and can make their whole year in October\nShot up really years\nThey've been getting more ... more a year round kind of tourist impulse not just for the which stuff but for the maritime stuff they've amazing restaurant scene they have the ninth largest art museum by area in the country\nSo they have like a lot of like kind of you know arrows and their whole started to pull a tourist and still happens their biggest one is October which will never go well\nI Do really I mean that's like a ... there are state fairs that have that right where people open up a booth at a state fair and they can make their entire year in the week that the teacher is open so I I I Would never guess shops that are just open for one month in in Salem\nYeah but it but the other but they're realizing there's so many tourists coming to say on the court for a year\nBut now they're starting to open longer so if you go in the summertime you'll still see the shops are still open you might even feel haunted house open to the monster museum ... so they're starting to realize that they can do this year round to stay on grows and becomes more even bigger in popular culture than it is now\nWhat's not cool in Salem ... or their rules a lake or curbs that they that are either written or unwritten about how people are just you know ... or to or how they want\nTourists to be in in Salem\nYeah they're they're getting better and better at that as figuring that especially after all year round the only other time of year there's not that many curbs\nBut in October for instance the er the burial ground which was the old seventeenth century um graveyard right in the middle of town there in Salem and this year they had to like put a cap on how many people could be in the grave at a time because it was just getting overrun and people were like using the graves as you know picnic table and climbing on\nThem and doing all kinds of\nBad stuff to an actual historical artifacts but that there's there's on Halloween Night they have a curfew I think it's around ten pm that if you're not in front of a bar or inside of a party you couldn't be on the streets for those shoot fireworks in the air to kind of tell people hey the nights over ... start heading to the train and start having their cars\nSo there that's really at ten pm\nYeah I Believe it the ten pm yeah it it might be a little later maybe eleven but yet they're trying to get for pushing this a hundred thousand people to the train you to take some time so by midnight nobody around on Halloween and\nIronic did they make everybody get off the streets of Salem before the wishing our\nYeah yeah it was it just gets bad [laughter] really bad there they got to get them out\nBefore the ... or maybe that's the real wishing happens after all the tourists the GW locker or and or Edgar Award winning author and thank you so much a season with the which the magic and mayhem of Halloween and Salem, Massachusetts is now on my bucket list things do you like I didn't have enough of my bucket list\nOf things that are integrated night in fact I'm checking off one when I go to ... in a couple of weeks I'll let you know about that coming up later on in November when I'll be back on Halloween or sorry on Thanksgiving weekend\nOn coast to coast am All right so the story you're going to want to hear the story you're never going to forget the men from the train next on coast to coast am\n...\nTraffic and whether they should use radio nine twenty had won all four seven you wait for\nEye on radio station\nEleven counts of murder crime Del Walters Fox News just some of the twenty nine charges Rob Bowers faces the forty six year old charred was opening fire inside a synagogue in Pittsburgh this is what it sounded like on police radio rock\nRocket guys off the direct laid off\nThey studied and one of the things I learned that sets true crime apart from great reporting is advocacy and proper journalism must stay focused on the facts of a murder\nAnd the prosecution of potential murderers so the result is a resistance to the expression of sentiment you know the the or sensationalism emotional manipulation of the accused because that could result in somebody not getting a fair trial\n[noise] this is why this is why journalism stresses terms like alleged and allegedly and how it is choose mainstream\nYou know notions of what sensationalism means stories that inflamed the senses right that sensational journalism the kind of news riding that stresses emotions over information risks riling the public up unnecessarily in it at one point by the way\nThis is a very real day to day concern regarding regarding the power of the press\nOr there was a time in us history not even a hundred years ago when angry mobs would storm a jail and Lynch somebody before trial ... just like you know the showdown in to kill a mocking bird\nOr white or black Lynch mob justice is the opposite of the rule of law and journalism understood its place in keeping the public\nInformed but at the same time call\nAnd letting the courts do their work in educating some kind of justice our guest this hour by the way will attest to this because mob rule in lynchings played a key part\nIn the injustices regarding the story of the men from the train [noise] uh but [noise] this is the same reason that love true crime and bear with me another minute or two where true crime reporting\nCan go where true crime story can tell something\nCrime reporting must not go right true crime is it allows for advocacy for justice giving victims of voice it's a central tenet to to crime before her death I interviewed I'm a true crime legend and rule about the conventions of great true crime writing\nAn ad rules never one rule was\nThat any true crime story you tell must be victims centric the focus on the acts of the killer or it satisfies the details\nOf somebody's death like a lot of these true crime shows do on TV where it's almost like crime porn right they're really into all of the blood and the wounds to a point where\nIt starts to dehumanize the victim I think so I think true crime must always be about justice and on a day when eleven people are dead in a synagogue where they should have been saying\nThe root cause sham\nThat not run for your life\n[noise] uh all because of a story seemingly that had been told about\nA Jewish philanthropist George Soros we need to be mindful about this connection between the stories we tell\nIn the unintended consequences that can happen or these victims should burden our national heart for years they will mine when we tell the story of the shooting in Pittsburgh today we must remain victims centric\nJournalists need to be responsible in order to avoid whipping up torch bearing mobs right\nIntent on lynching people accused of crimes but everybody in the media or anybody who uses social media needs to share that same sense of responsibility when it comes to conspiracy theories as well I'm not waiting into a debate\nBut who is responsible for today's mass shooting clearly\nThe majority of the blame rests on the trigger finger of today's shooter but take it from me and my experiences on the radio it's important to be mindful about every thought seed you send out into the world that bears your name because once it hits the wind\nYou'll never know where those thoughts seeds will take root that's what we know to be true there's many other stories in the news this week that attest to that so not everything is a false flag up only\nA small percentage of such things I've ever happened not everything is die hard to that everything is a conspiracy if everything were conspiracy than we wouldn't have any media about it in fact the media would be focused on what isn't just conspiracy right if everything was a conspiracy that old radio shows built around we don't have a conspiracy around this\nToday so I asked you whenever you talk about murder whenever you talk about people who you believed to be\nGuilty of some thing stay victims centric in the stories that you tell and not just about the victims of crimes that have already happened in the case of true crime but stay victims centric about telling stories that could result in the victimization of somebody yet to come\nI ask you that in the name of all those people who died today say a prayer for them if you will and they keep that in mind when we talk about the men from the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer\nThat even though the story is over a hundred years old it's still not too late to get

Jeff shot I think I mentioned the the um [noise] there's all their clarity a graphic pattern and the murders if one occurs just south of Portland them extra curves just north of\nThe fingerprints and blood and it meant nothing to them\nA mutt typing was unknown and Eighteen Ninety eight by Nineteen ten Nineteen twelve ... the night and Eighteen Ninety eight no one knew that there were these for blood group say a B o and wherever it is\nThe um uh\nThe uh by Nineteen twelve people didn't know that uh and and breakthroughs hadn't had had\nBeen achieved that had begun to make their way into courtrooms bought a ... it was it was a very slow process and I had a very infant pile stage\n[noise] mentioned the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer\nTracking this story then required you to go through a lot of newspaper archives and other things to try to find a lot of these stories which as you point out had been\nA they had the dots hadn't even been conduct connected then so you you may have been the very first person that ever started putting this this case together in this way\n[noise] ... yes\nWe were ... except for the end of the the the the last year at the last few crimes were connected at the time the public was aware that that what we would now call a serial murder was on the loose\nFrom in Nineteen eleven uh Nineteen twelve which would runner and while he was killing a lot of people but the earlier crime rate what we did was say\nLook this this this murderer is way too experienced to have started this in Ninety eleven there has to be earlier crime so let's try to find them\nNow getting started walking back toward the first crime\nThat's when I got ... nobody had walked it back before you were the first person to go back to the very end and how is it that you are able to determine that first year so successfully\nDumb luck and it is not all ... ... I had told my daughter that ... if you walk the crimes back\nWhen you when he commits the first crime he will make mistakes that will give away who he is and I told her that\nBecause I Know from reading crime books and reading hundreds of crime books for very off of a serial murder when they commit to this first crime reveals who he is but then all of the times he will be ... in the seventies he'd be sent to jail for five years and then he'd be out and start a series of crimes\nAnd he would cover his track so I I guess that that was what was going to happen in this case\n... we were just fantastically lucky and it is fresh crime happened to occur in the the two biggest newspaper towns in the country where New York and Boston\nIs first crime occurred straight west of Boston straight north of New York and because of that both of New York and Boston papers covered in depth\nAnd because of that there's lots and lots of information available about it and it's uncanny it's unbelievable how many points\nThat first murder matches up with against the eye out with uh with with all the last last murders and the series so ah we\nJust luck I mean we never in a million years expected to be able to find convincingly who was actually doing this but we found a evidence about this man and argued that this is Sam and almost nobody doesn't believe it because it's just there's lots of evidence\nYou so you found the arc type crimes for the prototype Chris Rock he and he modeled he he he perfected that crime then excessively after that it is is the years went forward and yet\n... there was kind of a mixed media rent I mean there's sometimes there were some times over guns involved\nIn all likelihood was\nCarrying a gun all the time after about Nineteen oh five the ah I think pretty while he used an axe to commit the murders there are I think three crimes in which the man of the house was shot before he was hit in the head with an axe my belief is that he is\nAt a pistol stuck in his pocket or in his belt or something but he would use if somebody was awake and confronted him but um it was not what he was trying to do but it is why he would do if you had to do\nI Want to get back to some of the aspects of these crimes coming up next our but before I Do ... ... ... what did you hope to learn about\nThe human condition about people about crime what was it that you thought you were going to learn when you went into researching and and being the first one to ... lead all these crimes together to determine you've you found demand from the train\n[noise] they ... the general adds to the question is the crime stories are fascinating to us because they they come from the parts of our\nOf our ourselves that we don't like to talk about a all crime stories are about lost\nAnd greed and anger and hatred and all the things that are part of you and me I don't know you but they are part of everybody that I've had the pleasure of knowing\nAnd and yet we we don't like to talk about them so we cover them up crime stories expose those parts of ourselves that we are ashamed of the uh uh\nThat's that's the general answer to why I'm\nObsessive reader crime but by the way of life book I read what the real crime but with the real world leader a it's a book by um that's why it's a A R rated Weinstein I could have a wife named ...\nUh the uh I I just screwed up her name I'm Sorry you know there sure are going to be safe and\nAnd one of the things I learned from reading that is the white America Walker who was a an avid reader of crime stories\nUh Charles Dickens we're going to have them at an avid reader of crime stories or a Henry Fielding what it's it's very common among writers to be avid reader Tolstoy was avid readers of crime stories because uh ... what I just\nTalked about that that they they tell us something about\nHuman nature that\nYou do get from a church somewhat but the or if you don't get from sports I mean I live in the sports world for the most part and the sports world is\nIs about positive people trying to do positive things in general I mean we take a lot of abuse from people who don't understand it but but that

I\nAn important part of trying to understand\nExecutions in America and and this is where when the teachers decided there they used to just print up their sermons and people would snap them up and then he thought what this will just sell it for a nickel and so they started to sell their execution sermons and then they would get passed around in these became some of the early bestselling\nTrue crime narratives it it it just feels the same function is what you're doing in in the men from the tree and you're trying to bring it even though it's a hundred plus years later in some cases you're trying to bring you\nA kind of I'm a ... a kind of healing anyway I'm not that anybody is still alive that was directly involved but for these communities maybe this this lingering sensitive some tragedy happened\nMaybe some closure I'm On an exactly what happened to their town and how their town was involved are not involved in in the the deaths of somebody that at one point you know were popular members of the community\nUm ... there was an interesting thing that happened just a few weeks ago I actually got a letter from a man in London england who uh was a\nA a ... his great great aunt had been was one of the victims of crime and he had always\nBelieved that uh uh the man who uh was accused of her murder and was locked up without any evidence for two years before he was released\nIt always believe that he had gotten away with it and he said that reading it in my book bag and our book that uh um it wasn't that was not actually what had happened was just a tremendous relief twelve\nYeah it was that was a shock to me I hadn't thought about that but\nIt was it was a shy who said he was tremendously relieved to realize that it was just a a random crime and that this Manhattan actually that that Manhattan actually gotten away with it it was this other fellow I I don't know why it was important to him\nToo well I understand the understanding that sense it was important to have to know what had happened but you know one guy getting away with it or another guy getting away with it and punished I I I don't know that there's a lot of different\nBut it still didn't have that reaction to it\n[noise] yeah I think I could go ahead go ahead please no a lot of the book them a lot of ...\nBook is about is is that all all books all good books or church for understanding and a lot of the book is is trying to get people to understand the America in which these crimes occurred\nThey hurt a hundred years ago and ah I grew up in a small town very much like the crime that these\n... that these murders occur to him\nAnd I grew up in them fifty sixty years ago so it's ... it's sort of equal distance from me and them\nAnd that's one reason that the\nStory was powerful to me but I Am trying to get people to understand what what the criminal justice system was like how fantastically primitive it was\nA whether you are or what\nHow people lived that they they lived rich meaningful live a ... people\nIn urban areas today think of people who lived in small towns a hundred years ago or often think of people who lived in small towns a hundred years ago I was living in these boring lives which nothing ever happened to all of the things that happened to you and me and people in our lives happened to people in small towns I mean they they\nThey got married they fell in love and got married and they got divorced and they started careers and got promoted and got fired they moved and they went on long trips and brought back souvenirs they they had entertainment so they went to literally every night all of the things that that\nHappened ... who happen to us happened to them uh and I was trying to create a a picture\nUnfortunately it is a picture of their death so that's a terrible picture because they look bad terrible Beth I'd also is trying to create a picture of how they live and and and give the reader or a an understanding of what it was like to be in America and in a small town or a hundred years ago\nI think he did that very effectively in fact I think that's one of the interesting things about true crime in general is that the the focus can be on things which ... ... ... the inverted pyramid of journalism\nAnd you can spend a lot more time on the things which are less important to telling the story\nIn proper journalism you can spend a lot more time talking about the atmosphere of the tone for the um the things that people age or the way that houses were constructed around your communities were laid out you can you can do that in and it brings up a fresh context\nTo these murders um you know as opposed to the traditional way that the crimes are covered in in St storytelling into journalism context I should I really like what you were doing especially when you were getting into the fabric of these communities\nAnd then there's ... there's what is it if it always sticks with me that trait that party or just bang bang and that has to do with the the soccer when the cases taco invent that it\nUh one of them I think it was sock co were had an alibi for the time of one of the crime is one of the crime was committed on December twenty four of I think Nineteen Nineteen or Nineteen Eighteen and he had a um\nA he had a witnesses who said that on that particular day he was delivering\nA to his neighbors and Italian community or a pickle deal because trickled deals\nWere a delicacy that we're eating on Christmas Day\nAnd there were there was but there was conflicting testimony that said no no no that couldn't have been done on December twenty fourth because\nYou never buy the pickled deals on December on Christmas Eve you have to buy them on December twenty seconds or something so that you have time to prepare them and put them in on on ice for a couple of days before you eat them\nSee a ... it's a it's a tiny detail that you would right that would not never survive I mean he would never know that that was true of a ... of the way the Italian American communities lived a hundred years ago [noise]\nExcept that it's important in a crime story that is what kinds of stories are there are these little there's a flash of light that illuminates the details\nOf uh uh or something that would otherwise be totally forgotten\nYou know I think that brings us very effectively ...\nIowa I'm and did the crime story which\nAs you pointed out earlier is the one that starts to to give away um ... the communities are already catching on at this point to the fact that there's a a killer on the

the fire so you become a fireman so did you spend the rest of your life replicating your greatest moment kind of thing so I Wonder what this this guy Paul Miller was trying to replicate\nBy recreating the circumstances all along the various realism of America\nWell ... that\nThere is something odd about him the or that he he was not terribly young he was believed to be about thirty five when the first crime occurred but I Believe that exactly what you just said that that that that first crime was or his secret it was it was\nThe most thrilling and the most exciting thing that ever happened to him and that he was simply recreating at the um uh again and again and again with more\nSome variation but more specimens specificity as it got went along so that you know the ... the early patterns or not that tight but the but later patterns get closer and closer to the first crime it's exactly what you're so what are you saying that that that's\nWho he was that that's a that's how he knew him so I I don't doubt that Mr Miller had been the victim of terrible abuse has young person or he was a it was an odd looking man he he uh he\nHad tiny widely spaced teeth or he was not clean and I don't doubt that as a consequence of this odd look\nAnd he said he had suffered terrible abuse and it's a terrible abuse replicated itself and his anger and his outrage is not that it in any sense of justification for what he did but I don't doubt that that was true of him\n[noise] you know the the pedophilia piece um especially abusing the corps if that's what happened\nUm speaks to\nThe age in which he might have been sort of frozen emotionally which makes me wonder whether that I'm sure you've thought of this ... been committing similar crimes in Germany which forced him to go into the navy which forced him to you know do some barking and come to the United states\nWell I don't know and and you know there is speculation\nIn the book has a lot of things we don't know about a year are you you're going to have no after you're gonna have a speculative answers up there\nI wouldn't speculate that he had never killed anyone before he killed the uh the Newt and family and ... in Eighteen Ninety eight I I Would I wouldn't I don't I doubt that he'd ever killed anyone before that because there's an obvious lack of planning and\nPreparation for the of at ... I don't doubt that he had\nCommitted pieces of the same crime earlier I don't I see this very much which respect that he had been\nAdding inappropriate interactions with young girls that he had a\nA while he had had a chip on his shoulder he wasn't but like a nice guy and then he said he ... his the documentation of his life around around the time of the first crime mentions that he was um it wasn't hard to get him into a fight you know he was he was he had he had he carried\nIt carried a tanker pretty open by the uh but I so I I don't doubt that there were other violent incidents true in about his life\nThe um uh but I don't think the whole scenario had come together for him before that\nBut it still isn't that's that's a great point we're headed gone into the navy do you know we don't know no\nI'd be curious whether to find the town and she grew up in yeah um and then check what year he went into the navy and see whether prior to that year there have been something which you know he knew he had to get on a ... he had to get out of dodge\n... joining the navy it was a great way to do it so whether it's just one person who is the victim of the ... range but gave him a great satisfaction and and you know I'm\nA nurse assist sociopath which is what this guy sounds like the most dangerous kind\nI'm socio pets are often rage killers and they just you know they it it's a ... thing and and the ... they just they do it as a kind of release and I I Wonder whether that that first released came long before he came to the new world\nBut it was not a nurse if there's a ... because he was not a ... he didn't have any charm it was not it was not a ... a ... generally as a charming\nRight motive often well spoken\nTruly makes a good appearance he didn't do any of that maybe he was he was a true psychopath a psychopath have no fear or Arab ... norm had do not have normal fear and one thing the apparent about this ... this demand from the trade is that from his crime is it ... it was not\nIt was not acting and fear he was he was calm and the middle of events that are horrific events that anyone else would have been shaking in their boots and that was one reason he was able to get by with his for so long I this is probably not that I should have made this this other point first\nThe story of a Paul Miller on the map from the train is is much larger than our book and and we were fortunate enough to find this set of facts about him but I have no doubt that someone else is going to write another book about him in\nTen years or Fifteen and\nGoing to say well here's what that James's miss they missed this whole story about Paul Miller in Germany they missed this whole story about\nAh this this crime and it when that guy Illinois [laughter] and uh\nThe I don't we don't have any doubt that they are going to do that and and there'll be right but we had spent years on it and we reached the limit of our particular research capacity to lead to dawn and printed book but various still more story to be discovered there\nYeah very interesting a Bill James you really take some questions [noise] sure that'd be great okay so we'll give the phone numbers are coming up just a second demand from the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer for you can ask them about the Boston Red Sox would you also [laughter] so it's quite a bit of onto\nA and I may throw in a strange question about the Boston spring learned that's been sticking with me up but we'll do all of that after we give me the numbers for you to join the conversation coming up next coast to coast am this is Ian\nSign up now for ... or ... ... email newsletter today it goes to goes damn Duncan\n[noise]\n[noise]\nAnd ... minutes after her journey began\nAfter a brief flurry of photo ops who's speaking engagements Taylor's fame cold\nAnd she was unable to make the fortune for which she had hopes\nThis week in Nineteen thirty one eight months ahead of schedule New York governor Franklin Roosevelt dedicate the George Washington bridge over the Hudson River\nFour thousand seven hundred and sixty foot long suspension bridge the longest in the world but this time connected Fort Lee New Jersey with Washington Heights in New York City one year later it carry five million cars from New York and New Jersey and back again\nThis week in Nineteen sixty two in a televised speech of extraordinary gravity president John F.

you know until bill\nThere was not a lot it means that he ... his not there's not a name that anybody would have mentioned as being the most prolific serial killer in America and as you say we don't know yet or maybe we can never know the numbers the actual numbers\nIt's fair to say that he was the most elusive in the way in which he operated because he was able to get away for so many years just\nAs it you know his vocation was I tend to rent longer but his application was definitely somebody who we came to a town with the intent of murder and got away with it for years because really who thinks that there's people out there that do that\nYou know I mean just like even today we don't think about this we will just driving around going up which Tuesday you know I'm really in the mood for murder but there are there are they get to Mike in Roswell New Mexico by coincidence where I'll be driving through and a couple of weeks at a\nBill I got a couple of questions first of all I Need you to answer for me again ever seen any evidence from a ... like one of the act\nOf every how you'd what any of the actual evidence from any of these crime scenes\nThe ah I wouldn't say so I have held held in my hand the acts with which the Alaska murders were committed they ah it it's still it's still around and and the has been the ... guide to the to the murders and\nThe uh uh but I wouldn't say I have a lot of it and so\nAll right uh you know what the palm will buried by any chance\nNo way down it disappeared and I was never caught my belief is that he probably went back to Europe and my guess would be but he ... he went back to Europe and continued to murder people but that is speculation and we do not know that for sure\nOkay well that's all I had to pick it up you pretty much got it all figured out I figured he might have worked for the world road which how he got to every place that he did and maybe Sunday night where they lay overnight or something like that but thank you for being on the air and I appreciate your story\nThat you might actually she that hey you know actually that's a really good question too about what was the connection to Sunday's why we're why we're most of these murders on a Sunday\nWhether what a in a modern criminal investigation if a criminal could make the murders on a weekend this is taking to be a sign that he's employed\nOr if a ... and if it happens a lot actually up there quite a few serial murderers who will\nWho committed murders on weekends or the or because they they work during the week and I you know they have jobs go to the um\nMiller probably did it on Sunday nights because he would spend the weekend working I'm self into the perhaps stocking as victims although I don't I don't know that he's a lotta stocking but the the just war himself into frame of mind that he could get where I needed to be\nA ... the ... and we do you think he did was just kind of trampling it as a you know and and riding the rails or was do you think he was paying you know cash money for a ticket to get on the ... these trains all over the country you know\nHe was he was just it wouldn't have paid cash money for a ticket because he would have been seen\nA ... and ... and he came into town\nMay no contact with anyone spoke to no one and this there that was part of his criminal Jane is they ah they ah but ah so it is his crime in the ... crime and Eighteen Ninety eight eight did buy a ticket to leave\nThe town and this this led\nTo a trail forming behind him and place followed his where he had gone on
