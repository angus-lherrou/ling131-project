the line mosques delete Stephen Hawking they were petrified warning us about the dangers of artificial intelligence isn't that bad\nA well I I Would say that I don't think so but I Will say this what what they're worried about a was look we mentioned earlier which is that kind of artificial intelligence we don't know how to build a general intelligence and that\nWe don't know how to build it but the idea that we could build it is based on his simple a\nSupposition and that is that people are machines if if you are a machine and your brain is a machine and your mind as a machine and it stands to reason at some point in the future we can build a mechanical you and then over time\nThat will become better and better and better it'll have an eye you have a hundred and two hundred and two thousand and two million and then it won't even know what you are um\nI find that idea that people are machines to be very pervasive in Silicon valley I'm On my part cost about a I I I find maybe one person in ... doesn't believe that and yet when we take surveys\nOn my website asking essentially the same question about eighty five percent of the rest of the country doesn't believe the machine so you you should be worried if you believe you're a machine because eventually we'll probably build on a mechanical version if you don't think human beings are\nBit there may be more ... than they do is a lot more harm than than than good it it it's very little suggest the machine\nWould do that now through through accidents are absolutely you know you had a had a rocket blow up because the single one was a transposed with the\nUh Oprah's transposed with a zero so a lot of our systems are quite brittle and that is very true you know if you had a um\nYou could out of the airline pilot had a heart attack and that's bad for one air air airplane full of people\nThink you've got the co pilot right\nThere you go but if you have a um if you have a computer flying a network computer flying all the airplanes in it quote\nHas a heart attack look that yeah that may that may propagate through a systems maybe much ... much more brittle much one better they may break in big ways now that being said they haven't done that yet and and\nAnd we come you know we're better now I think uh at writing good software that we were\nA few years back [noise] what is fueling the gross and the ... and just really the incredible gross on this kind of technology\nYou mean is it the human being\nThe main thing that feels that technology is it's actually finally working a hey I even the term was calling to Nineteen fifty six by a man named McCarthy McCarthy and uh he got together with a few of the computer scientist and they said you know we work really hard we can solve artificial intelligence and one summer\nA big thought that for a very interesting reason which was\nNew you know three laws of planetary motion laws magnetism laws of physics laws of electricity very few simple laws that explain everything and I hope to find that with intelligence we did\nThat being said people got excited about a bunch of money came and everybody was disappointed funding dried up all the people you know took him out for ten years\nThen there was a breakthrough more funding everybody\nNeither a winter it kept going well now for the first time\nIn space up his face up to space up his face up to space it's delivering the good ... ... it can it if you out of business it can make public any department in your business and ten percent ... percent better ten percent more profitable\nOr it can it can do all of these things you couldn't do before and so we're never going to have another one of those yeah winters we now\nHave the technology that we know how to do some cool things if there were no more advanced ... and I ah we probably have twenty five years worth of stuff just to apply what we know today to the world but of course we're going to have you know more dense has a ... they come to light speed almost\nJust amazing now will we ever have a series of artificial intelligence soldiers by the millions sending them into warfare in battle\nThat's a fantastic question um\nArtificial intelligence the simplest definition is it's a system that response to its environment so land mine is a kind of artificial intelligence if it were a program that is if something weighs more than fifty pounds explode that's a very rudimentary very rudimentary\nYeah if somebody came out with a landmine just hypothetically that said uh it was a camera and it can make sure\nIt's somebody wearing a petite ... or carrying a gun mhm and then it was up you would say well that's that's that's better isn't it and then if you say well it can also step for gun powder and you know we can do for other things to make sure it's blowing up the right person you say well\nThat's better I guess that's better right and you you eventually get your way all the way up to um if you could ask you to to an artificial intelligence\nFights wars and instead of people um\nThere there is a quote debate about whether we're going to make a ton of his killing systems I think it's disingenuous the debate is I personally think it's disingenuous I think you've got twelve or Thirteen countries that are ... that have significant military budget sitter spending money on these systems and no one of them can say\nYou know I let the other guys all have it but I'm not going to do it I just don't think that's going to happen or the south Koreans came out with the forty million dollar automatic Gunter that\nCould could shoot people at a distance automatically and it it's required by law to say you know leave before I shoot\n'em and it now requires a person to approve it's tiring but originally I didn't uh they only put that in because people requested it and so uh it could easily be turned off so even if you make decisions that require people to make decisions\nYou always disabled them so I think it's inevitable that we're going to for better or worse whatever you think there were going to build a a weapon systems\nIt's going to have it\nWell for for three very easy reasons you can argue that ah there the better the more effective it their mission and there'll be less collateral damage and wherever they are you there and argue that you will be saving lives of soldiers ...\nA ... and ... and whatever country you are and and the third you know they will they will work and be effective and probably cost effective wall and they will unfortunately what were the political costs are going to war which uh is is not not necessarily a good thing\nWell it may not be a good thing but in the long run if we don't do it some other country will\nOh absolutely absolutely I'm just saying

[noise]\n\n\n\nWelcome back by run race with a survivor and do you think technology will ever replace\nStill people who deliver the mail to our houses\n[noise] you know um I I had a I have a feeling that any job at a machine can do we really want machines to do it I mean 'cause if\nIf the machine can do a job to make a human do that job there's a word for that that's called B humanizing mhm\nBecause if if you just use a person for stand in\nFor a machine then you're saying nothing about you that makes us human are we interested in and we only need you to be a machine that there'll be invented a is delivering the mail or or delivering packages something like that I could imagine a machine that did it I could imagine a machine that washes windows I can imagine machine that automatically\nMost my yard and so I think by definition we kind of want to get machines to do those things that\nYou know but but if you take a step back these technologies this country for two hundred and fifty years just as high unemployment between five and ten percent\nAll the time except the depression which wasn't caused by technology five to ten percent but but I think the half life of a job is fifty years I think every fifty years of the jobs vanish and so you have to say how have we had full employment\nNew technology ... years right and we had rising wages and because so why are we able to do it it's\nWe're able to do it because a new piece of technology comes out and everybody sees it and says I'm going to use this to increase my own productivity so what ever is if you can self driving cars you're going to have people who offered to ride around in the car and give you a tour of their city if you are I mean like\nIt's hard it's hard necessarily for us to see all the things that are going to happen anymore than if it's a one back twenty five years and said to somebody hey in the future\nYou know there's gonna be the sweat thing ...\nBillion people are gonna use it what do you think there's going to do their jobs you could've seen all the jobs that were going to vanish she would say well that's gotta be hard on the travel agents at the stockbrokers on the yellow pages on the newspapers\nUm but you wouldn't have seen any of the things that got created you wouldn't have seen ... you when you see at sea air B. and B. Hooper a Google Amazon you wouldn't have seen any of the million companies that were made so that these technologies are the same way you it's easy to say that jobs are going to go away\nIt's hard to see the better job that's\nCreated and what happens is every body Everytime technology makes a great new job and destroys\nA bad job everybody kind of ships up one level\nIf you had a robot that was a waiter and delivered food to you you get a tip that I'm not\nI don't I hear the waiter wonder why I don't\nI don't think a robot can do a what a waiter can do you know they use spell a drink\nYou know the robot can't a clean it up that would take you know tons of programming that you have a special order and you want you want to send your food back there is something you didn't like about it you have a question about where the Russians were I mean there are so many things it's it's funny we we\nWe have every human on this planet has ten thousand skills than thousand things you can do\nAnd then we had this vision that if you can do those ten thousand things and you can do estate planning than your high skilled otherwise you're low skilled but in reality every human being is incredibly high skilled we don't have robots they can\nThey can do what a two year old can do let alone in an adult yeah so\nWell correct correct but it's proved very difficult like right now I heard somebody say if there was ever a robot uprising just wait Fifteen minutes out of batteries there'll be dead 'cause we can't even you know make batteries that the power these things for very long\nSo right now hands down and and I think for for decades to come\nA people aren't going to you're not going to make machines and had the same range of movement joined going to have a robot electrician who comes in and look at your house over and figure out where to punch your wall out to run the wires it's just way beyond\nYou know when I called my airline of choice and it tells me you know say your number I'm happy when it gets started right when it doesn't get a an agent ate all mixed up so that's kinda wherever that I'm not like you said that oh you know yet I'm\nIn that survey and that sort of big yet because one day at the progression we're going we're going to get there\nWell with physical robots maybe that's true it's an open question on intelligence it's an open question whether a computer can be creative with a computer and\nIt may be that that you have to experience the world in order to do a lot of the things we have and it's it's unclear that computers will be able to do it I ... let me let me say a real quick thing about our brains you know we have these brains that we don't really understand and then we had these mines which is kind of all the things the brain does that we\nCan't really explain like I have a sense of humor you know your liver doesn't have a sense of humor but some of your brain does\nAnd then we have consciousness and people think we don't understand the brain 'cause it's just so stinking so many neurons\nBut people who spent Twenty years working on something called the open worm project\nTo try to take this little worm he's got three hundred and two neurons in his brain basement Twenty years trying to model out of the computer\nJust make a worm that lives in a computer with a brain of three hundred new neurons and even among the people have been working on it they're not even sure it's possible so there are so many we're we're so spectacularly\nAmazing uh beings that that\nTo duplicate what we do with the machine is you know ... one leading a researcher said worrying about those kinds of things like worrying about overpopulation on Mars yeah maybe some day we'll have to worry about overpopulation of Mars but it's like that far out\n[noise] so you call your book the fourth age because you believe we've had three ages week already going way back but tell me about this\nSo we learned this trick humans did which is technology which is multiplying what we were able to do\nAnd and we've used it to overcome scarcity because for all of human history there's just never been enough of the good stuff never enough food and medicine never enough of of any of the good stuff but we learned this trick technology and\nSometimes we learned something so\nBig and knew that it just changed their productivity of humanity forever and the first of these was a hundred thousand years ago I think it was language that's this thing we do where we coordinate action about what it means is that you know twelve humans working together you know man of was a match for us anymore because\n'cause we could all communicate in the ... couldn't\nUm then the second one I think is when we got agriculture and not actually wasn't the big deal because agriculture give us the city and the density gave us a division of labor\nAnd the division of labor says you know you specialize I specialize and we're all better off because of it so agriculture indirectly gave us prosperity and that changed everything we have prosperity and then the third time things changed I think was five thousand years ago when we got\nTwo technologies coincidentally at the same moment we got the wheel and we got writing and when those two things happened\nUh you invented the nation state and that's why five dollars and years ago you kind of shut your clock by it all over the world a giant sort of sanctions emerge ... America and just go all over the world and so I Do think that\nUm that\nIntelligence and robots are another thing of that magnitude if you if you actually can take human thought and put it in a machine\nAnd human action and put it in a machine and and and multiply us both you know we're number one on this planet 'cause we're the smartest thing on it imagine if you can just make us a whole lot smarter huh I don't I Can't predict what that's going to what's that's going to do but it's\nI'm going to be a big one well what we know for example that machines called 'em robots or revolutionize the automobile industry with mass production I mean they they did things faster\nThan humans can I'm coming from St Louis I've been in in in ... Bush factory and I see how they bottle beer or by the thousands in the bottles humans can't do it that fast or\nYou're ... you're right that is already Fishell intelligent hid it is to be frightening\nIf if you saw if you were a skilled across person and you saw unskilled people making more stuff better and cheaper than you like how purifying once that and yet we don't look back and say that was a bad thing do we\nKnow not at all not at all and has displaced workers probably you can't have a million workers are filling up bottles by hand\n[noise] right and yet we never had unemployment and uh you know we never had unemployment along that time you also had an interesting phenomenon that from Nineteen forty call it\nYou know where where did search early days but uh but yeah there's going to obviously have to be some kind of like customs is gonna be laws is going to have to be all kinds of stuff we don't up because uh that's very real working on a boat\nYou know I I kind of hope so I I don't know that I Would say a blanket thing for every single person on the planet like because you can just ...\nCareers that you you can't like the electrician or a ballet dancer or anything to record a psychiatrist or anything to record a are kindergarten teacher requires you to be president in any in any way but for people who are the permission industry then yeah\nIt was just there was a series of\nCommercials on I don't know if you remember the nineties that someday you will you know should the box from the beach someday you will and all of the things in those commercials kind of thing the only thing\nThat really stay with us by when you come back and take some calls in a final trap next on coast to coast\nTo coast website is no streamline for mobile devices Greek news if your ... simply want to enjoy our website on your phone visit coast to coast am dot com on your iPhone or Android rose or [noise]\nRadio nine Twenty one over ... ...\nOn Wednesday polling that third season opener Riverdale Daniel ... star in the new trauma polling arrogant ... has recruited to Beverly Hills high school and I have been starting at eastern and central ...

GDP did kill off eight fold just like he thought so why are we still working all these hours and what it turns out is that if you want to live the way somebody lived in Nineteen thirty\nBel Air conditioning six hundred square feet no medical insurance no higher education do they can grow your own food make your own clothes you worked Fifteen hours a week and live\nLike you did in Nineteen thirty or ... people decided they wanted more and so there's no limit to human ... turns out so even in the future of people are going to say I'm going to stay late at the fusion reactor 'cause I Want you know the the same flying cars the neighbor has a so\nWe're not completely materialistic interestingly ... the time we save at home\nBut not holy water up from the well and not run washing her clothes at the river we turn that into hobbies but it turns out we always worked forty hours a week\nIf if if our productivity goes off we just work more to get more and we always talk at the time we save at home I'm with labor saving devices\nWhere do you see this fifty years from now Byron this technology\nUm I I think that question I ask earlier which is you know if you can imagine a machine doing a job I think we will have machines doing the kinds of jobs you can imagine a machine doing you just start looking around you and say you know who to machine a\nFix my road probably could a machine teach kindergarten probably not a ... would we wanted to and so I think machines will be doing almost anything that you can imagine a machine doing that doesn't require unique human ability\nBarber in Los Angeles ... go ahead\n... faced off than than being a wife and now we have ten cave and [noise] and ... ... ... ... ... ... ... and ...\n... ... and ... it gets half the fan on less ... than\nTalking about automatic guns\nWell okay I Know you're you're in the guests bart is entirely right um we are using a condom is\nWeapons which may kill decisions of course we've done that since landmines wheat crop we drop dumb bombs uh I mean the nature of warfare is we build machines to kill a so I didn't mean to say\nThat uh that we that we don't do that\nWe've always done that we build machines that that we push a button and we don't know who's going to die\nOr the debate that is allegedly going on is whether are we going to you know make more advanced systems that operate completely economists say that you can just release in an area and it will go and decide that\nAnd combative that's about it I'll kill them and so forth\nA it's a solo districts you agree with you\nBefore the smart robots conscious computers in the future of humanity where do you get the book Byron\nWherever find books are sold I think ah is the expression Amazon dot com Barnes and noble or just reach dot com and there'll be a lot of lakes\nSo what do you see is the most dramatic change coming for us through artificial intelligence what's going to how jumped to very\nSimple things one uh\nIndividual worldwide average income\nPer capita for the last two thousand years or if you look at it for Seventeen hundred and fifty years from say the birth of Christ Seventy fifty not that a lot if you look starting seventeenth fifty shot up like a rocket um\nWhy because we learned how to system because the acquisition of knowledge we decided to the method and there's no limit to where the wind is going to go so vast amounts of well created a eliminating poverty and then the second thing I think will happen is all purely technical problems like disease and hunger\nYou'll live to see the end up I Know that sounds like a I'm dreaming or all kinds of people said it would be possible but um\nYou know this country the United states already Throws Away enough food to feed all hungry people\nDon't really know cautious that the world strains to feed them\nOr we just need to get a little better at it\nWell and I hope we do solve all these kinds of illnesses and diseases that would

is\nAnd you know I Will tell you a gym is a good man to yeah he has said man I I have\nSome great stories about him or he just allowed me and to um like that the theater where they record all the music and he said you only stand here this is where the director stands and may you know the best place to hear it every week and I'm like oh I Love this guy\nYou got a great background by the way\nI have an end or are you talking about my hillbilly rates in oak\nWell how are you talking about my day job your day job we haven't gotten to the Oklahoma he'll be on the hill Billy ... [laughter]\nI Do I have a fabulous job\nAnd you how did you end up in Los Angeles how did that the truck work out for you\nUm you know I think it was a slow escape from Oklahoma and\nI made it to Texas first and then made my way to San Francisco\nAnd then maybe the way down to Los Angeles and here you are and here I Am talking to you\nWriting stories about ghosts and interesting things\n... isn't that the craziest title who called their book that goes for target for\nWhat some of your peers about this the fact that I mean here you are you a corporate executive doing some great work and now you're writing a story about the ghost photographer\n[noise] you know it is it's it's a great question I\nI think because what I Do day in day out is you know rooted and data and and I'm and I'm now ... you know within the organization thing you know very direct honest kind of person that when I started telling the stories\nAnd they couldn't help but believe even if they were kind of on the fence 'cause they're like way you make this up\nHere that you're that nerd when you went [laughter] and and I would say Ninety nine point nine percent of the people and have kind of gone with me on the journey um I I think that's a very small you know\nPoint zero one percent and you know they they just they\nCan't make their way over right are nine that's right\nAnd but I'll tell you at least half if not more than half the people that when I started telling them one of my story a can interrupt me fast enough to tell me there's [noise]\nAnd I realized you know during this time that I was kind of thinking about writing it all down like oh my gosh people don't want to come out about this like there in the class that they are afraid to tell the story because they're afraid that they're going to sound like they're crazy\nBut didn't want to return to actually write the book was so you know people could feel liberated to tell they talk about their experiences because so many people what Adam and I also wanted them\nTo yeah I wanted to write it so people say well believe in themselves and believe that it's actually happening not yeah their their brain playing tricks on him or something\nWell what's so amazing to is that the people\nAre all into the ... and like you said not a lot of ... minutes well once they feel comfortable with you or somebody who is going through the same thing they open up\nOh my gosh they talk to your ear off and you know just just for your listeners then because I Am a nerd do you mind if I roll through just a couple of stats for them yeah go\nBecause I you know when this started happening to me um I I didn't know a lot about it you know I didn't understand\nUm a lot about what really anything about goes photography a little bit of that medium ship just you know some of those things are a little bit about but I started um I started researching and there is a Harris Poll um that says that between forty and forty five percent of Americans believe and go so we're almost the majority\nWere barely a minority\nAnd that's grown I bet\nAnd and you know what I think it was done maybe three years ago four years ago something like that\nWould be over fifty percent\nI I Would think so and the second stat um I worked with my friends I'm at Google um to get this and every two seconds to say it again for everybody every two seconds someone in North America is Googling the word ghost\nAre saying yes every two seconds\nSo none of us are alone I think everybody knows they're not alone because of you whose whose listening um but they can also now use them statistics to tell their friends hey either way I'm barely a minority and I'm probably a majority now\nYou have nothing to hide\nAnd you have nothing to hide\n... started for you because of a personal situation\nYes did did you know just\nThis started from me I'm I'm I mean the book really is a journey Adderall transformational Journey Through grief [noise]\nUm I lost my mother to all timers are and you know I I you you're not only deal with the the eight to ten years prior to it because it's a very it's a painful disease for everyone um and when she passed I was devastated I was broken she I was her person in this world\nAnd not long after she passed I started seeing ghosts and photograph\nAnd at first it scared the heck out of me um I actually want to I'd opened a like a ghost portal because you know I Do live in the world of movies so everything in my life I think about tends to get exaggerated when it's like oh my gosh it goes work holder guys what am I done\n'em and and then I started the aging you know the house the perimeter everything um and kept taking photographs and I now have a crazy collection of nine thousand photographs with ...\nDo you have been doing several things what kind of camera [laughter]\nAnd I found\nI used and what a great ad by the way right shouldn't apple say have an ad that says shot on an iPhone and have scroll through a bunch of pictures of ghost [noise]\nUm it was an iPhone I ... at one point and and the journey I bought a real cameras like Sampson camera on the phone but like a regular camera\nAnd it was interesting because all I captured on that um we're ... not that ... you know aren't important in special in our ecosystem but I wasn't getting everything else it's interesting\nYou know when this was going on for the entire journey looks looks good into your mother's situation and the old timers but how did that really gets you going\n[noise] how did you I'm Sorry so you mean get me going through the journal and how did I start to heal from that you started investigating these strange thing yeah\nI um you know I I was I'm very lucky I um have found some phenomenal\nAh women actually in this world that are incredible psychics and they were like my psychic sherpas through this and you know how how make me understand that I was an absolutely crazy and then I wasn't running up and down the street so Sherman Oaks screaming you know hide your kids had your wife we got ghost in the neighborhood\nAnd um so ... so I had some guides\nI ... you know that that were helped me understand it and an album investigate and um I I started you know after I saw the first coast and the photograph I um you\nKnow I kind of panic was intrigued because I I got to be honest with the George I was a little bit of a skeptic before a skeptic as and it's not true\nA skeptic thing you want to know\nRight right I ... it was an atheist can't possibly be true kind of person but you know it was like really really take pictures of goes\nUm so I you know I I read a lot I investigated I talked I I I mean I I think I did what any but he would do is just trying to understand what was happening and you know I I think\nLooking at the underlying aspect of it is I I I think when people are in grief and people are experiencing grief I'm wearing chaos and when you're in\nChaos um you're able to open up and shed would ever rigidity or get over yourself or get over it whatever skepticism you may have and and I think you fall into things like this\nI'm with a lot of ease because you're looking\nYou're looking for something right you become a seeker and I think for me I became so incredibly interested in it\nAnd I would spend hours taking pictures and I would spend hours um you know putting them through a photo lab on like negative mode or add some color because you different things would come out I became I think maybe a little bit of an expert in it\nThat smoke as like a canvas for goes\nI was able to see them so clearly and the smoke and they would like kind of pulled a smoke around them I could see\nTheir shapes either form and without the smoke they were not there you could not see them\nWithout the smoke I could still see goes but not as clearly and easily and as reliable as with the smoke\nWas amazing gift you still with us Julie we're going to take a quick break we'll come

[noise]\n\n\nAnd\nWelcome back to coast to coast we're back with Julie ... her book is called the ghost photographer I loved the subtitle of course is interesting ... were you talk about a Hollywood executives true story of discovering the real world of make believe it's coming true isn't it\nHer about their experiences and there was an experience where um there was a it was a man who was ... experience they probably actually spoke to that man had men like\nDoesn't really have facial features he where it's like a foot door and sometimes a coat but what people get the feeling they have is just out of fear right because they'll see this kind of a shadowy figure while they are their bodies paralyzed but they're awake and\n\nAnd one man's ass you know who are you and he said they call me scratch and scratches another name for the devil\nBack in the day when he tried to ... Adam and Eve away from God to carry it get scratched out of the book of life\nAnd so clearly he's not a nice guy right so my theory and it's just a theory that's all the theory is that you know if you subscribe to the idea that we're spirit having a human experience\nThat when we sleep it's our physical body that needs to sleep not our spirit the spirit goes off and parties and the actual space I'm sure many people have talked to you about that show planes\nAnd you know what our spirit is getting ready to land back into our body I think what happens is that it doesn't fully land and it's like this little space and I think that that's a little space before it lands properly and you are aligned\nOn is when this can happen again it's just a theory which were pretty good\nIt's not terrible so I really consider it more of a spiritual condition than I Do a medical condition and it's not that people who have a bad because you know what the light\nDoesn't need more light or the dark doesn't need more dark dark needs a lot you know the the the darkness one flight so I think it's you know people are are these bright lights that I think that this entity kind of makes its way and\nAnd I don't really want to spoil for folks 'cause I I I Hope people will read the book I'm a at what happened that last time that alec saw the ... man because of that is probably the most profound event that has happened in my entire life\nWould you want to duplicated duplicate that experience yeah yeah I can handle it now\nYou would really yeah I could which you couldn't\n[noise] um it was um oh let me just tell them I just tell your audience what happened\nWhat I'll do it if you want me to George and like All right I'll tell them All right we have a couple of minutes yeah oh you use the clean up the blackout oh I'm Sorry\nIs when you say you're going to tell us\nOh yes Oh yes so I have I but I just tell everybody instead of just the thing about them having to read the book to find out because what happened was that Alex called in one night and said I saw that happening again\nAnd and he spoke to me\nAnd what he said to me was how her my name is Ron\nAnd I went he he said what\nHe said how her my name is wrong because I noticed that the message for you and I said yeah that's the name of I accept that it\nWas not very nice jeeze and I said I'm he's trying to scare me away from you\nYou think that was him I don't think it was my extent that but I think it was that man who knows I Would say a lot about a lot of people fair to say um but I think that you know\nIf anybody tries to if if there's any darkness that is trying to scare either going to find that thing that triggers you right there I find that deep dark thing they're going to find who is the antagonist and this person's life\nAnd mine is my accept that and and he brought that up and Alex didn't didn't even know about my accepted didn't even know his name\nWhen all this was happening to you [laughter] we went weird yeah I mean\nAre you under control which is now I mean do you feel as if you're in control of what's happening\nI I Am I Am I Am I Am now because I now understand that I Am in charge I completely understand\nI Am also I've become fear with\nThe photography all ... ... it's almost like that's the hobby will you do the ...\nYou know that goes with ... and um and uh and storytelling it would be considered um the inciting event\nIt's it's that event is what triggered all this other stuff to happen and photography was you know a little scary at first because I\nIt's weird it's it's it's weird there is no data\nDo you know who the subject matter is for you or these random ghost [noise]\nUm [noise] I Do have a picture of my mother has passed um I didn't include it in the book because it felt a little too sacred to include that in the book or doing um but other than that I don't recognize a single one I've had a couple that have come back twice\nSome of them look like they're in Eighteen hundred garb\nThey do they do yeah no I I don't know if all of them are there some of them um you know I feel like I've gotten a few that looks like they had a rough time the last time they\nAnd their bodies like a guy looks like he's been beat up a woman who looks like she's very sad\nMaybe that's how he died\nIt could very well be could very well do they talk to you [noise] you know I'm after a while um after I got past the I Can't believe this is happening to me face um when I Would be able to see them I Would I Would start to ask\n'em I I was better\nWeirdly by communication is better when

it has made my life so incredibly interesting ah and I think things are really good word for it\nWhat is done for you Julie knowing what you know knew about the other side\n[noise] [noise] um I have found a tremendous amount of peace\nI Know that there was more than what you see with your ... and I think it actually\nIt you know it it actually doesn't bring me chaos it brings me peace um there's a lot more at work you know there's a lot more work like this story you know from the four oh five but I think is so I'm profound about that is\nAll the coordination collaboration that had happened on the other side in order for me to still be alive\nYou know my spirit guide you know talking to me and and I had to listen and believe\nToo not just Pam my friend who I who I Believe is actually her sister who was holding her down where she could not answer the phone or the other four people I called that you know their guides or their spirits are they'll fast somebody was distracting them not to pick up the phone\nAll with the you know chance that I Would hear in less than that is pretty incredible when you think about it from the flip side\nDramatic yeah it is and as I I Believe that's happening every day all day all the time to millions and millions of people don't show that used to listen\nDon't you think it's pretty stark if you did not believe in the other side that that's all there is\nYeah I think it makes the world really small and I think it and I think it also probably leads to live depression and a lot of abuse\nLet's go to those who are you ready for some calls\nI Am
