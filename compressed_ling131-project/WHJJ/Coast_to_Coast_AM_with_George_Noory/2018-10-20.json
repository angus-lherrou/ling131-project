mystery of the end times finally arrived Bob McGinnis welcome back to coast to coast how are you\nI'm doing well Richard thank you for having me to feeding\nMy pleasure let me throw a couple of items that you very quickly and one is that we are we are hearing that us national security\nAdviser John Bolton is reportedly are pushing the president to withdraw from a treaty designed to prevent a nuclear arms race between us and Russia that would be called the INS for the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty which has been in place since Nineteen eighty seven your thoughts\nOf course the Russians are respected and I think I'm a lot of people would agree in violation of the Nineteen eighty seven I in a treaty because they have\nA not only build practice the use of ballistic can cruise missiles that have a range of five hundred to fifty five hundred kilometers in violation of that a\nWave tractor cruise missile we called nine and seven to nine or that has um you know not met the criteria is violated the criteria are of course John Bolton is on his way this coming week over to Moscow to talk about that but they're also Richard going to talk about\nUh the of renewal of twenty ten new start and you know President Trump said um you know weeks ago that perhaps we aren't going to renew it and that should be a a a really a a shot across the bow of Moscow ... concern is all\nAbout his ... back dramatically a nuclear weapons or\nTo Fifteen hundred and fifty are deployed strategic warheads and about seven hundred vehicle so you know this is important in a world that I Believe has really cross the line to a new Cold War because the old Cold War is all about nuclear\nHolocaust and the threat posed by the Soviet from the U.S\nWe're entering a new era right now\nI Want to also dial back to September when Russia began its largest ever military exercise with three hundred thousand just think of that three hundred thousand soldiers others\nA a drill with China as a rehearsal for some sort of large scale conflict it was called the Vostok twenty Eighteen drills this kind of really illustrates how China and Russia are aligning themselves perhaps against the United states\nWell it does and in fact\nA really yesterday you had the two defense ministers from Russia and China met and they're getting ready to jointly head a commission on military technology that is of course being shared\nA significantly between the two we just sanction the Chinese for buying a\nFighter jets from the Russians and also the S. four hundred a surface to air missile system and the Vostok Eighteen exercises you indicate I had three hundred thousand\nA soldier's thirty six thousand\nA armored vehicles or at least a thousand bombers some of those strategic bombers um in fact flew off the east coast of Russia\nStraight at the United states you know practicing what I Would consider bombing runs against ... clear air force base and Fort Greely Fort Greely is where we have\nThe mid range nuclear anti missile capability and we have and we're growing that mostly because of the\nNorth Korean threat but of course the Chinese have a rising capability and the Russians has never gone away\nI Want to ask you whether there was an opportunity last after the fall of the iron curtain the end of the Cold War\nWhen\nPresident Reagan had essentially vanquished\nOr when he called the the evil empire the Soviet Union and then later assurances were given to the Soviets or the Russian Federation that NATO would not encroach one centimeter towards Moscow and of course that was violated some might suggest that the United states was poking the bear\nAnd given their\nTheir passions for for for a nationalism in in the former Russian Federation\nUm coupled with the ascension to power of some who might some many who we would suggest is perhaps the greatest Russian leaders since the great\nThat that this was an opportunity last that that that the United states provoked the Russians and they could have been our lives but now here we are what are your thoughts\nYou know I think you're correct Richard huh we did poke 'em and of course we've continued to do that they considered a Ukraine or the breadbasket of Russia\nAnd of course they're continuing to fuel the anti key of a civil war which I call them the eastern part of the country and that's after having seized Crimea and of course two provinces in two thousand\nAnd eight from the republic of Georgia and they're pushing back against the Baltics against Poland Hungary Romania that'd be entire a former Soviet satellite regimes\nUh that's something that I Know when Mr Yeltsin or the new president after Gorbachev stepped down came to this country met with Bush Camp David [noise]\nWe had the opportunity to do more than just give them a few crumbs we could have brought them into the fold and I think that that really is you indicate ... you know fuel the rise of Vladimir ...\nAnd you know ... of course has captured the imagination of the Russian people and as a direct result\nHas you know really fueled\nNationalism and patriotism in a way that um they're somewhat um I Would argue blind to perhaps what the West is looking at it because they want to rise again they want to be a great power again\nAt perhaps we ought to amend our constitution much like the Chinese did this past year and allow pool\nIn this case to serve beyond twenty twenty four because he was just elected of course uh yeah this past march they're beginning to see that we need longevity and we need to have the capability to\nAh keep the momentum going in and they feel confident that ... is doing that much as the Chinese are feeling confident and president Xi is well\n[noise] you're not exactly painting potent as an evil adversary and yet the the title of the book is alliances evil so why why should we aside from the fact that the Russians have a vast nuclear arsenal\nWhy should we be fearing ... and an alliance with China\nWell what they're doing is they're weaponize eat everything against us you know if you look at political coercion predatory economics strategic extortion information warfare um covert action you know I I could go through every one of those Richard\nAnd there was a long history and in fact an alliance of evil I go through sixteen indicators and which those things just come out alive and they they like blinking red lights and they suggest very strongly that yes they're representing their interests\nAnd in fact Russia and China are collaborating just like the Russian prime minister is

at a strategic level that will harm our interests are not only you know interference of elections\nUm but uh certainly and jeopardize our dominance in space her satellites of course the Chinese have an anti satellite capability they're\nShooting literally for the moon and they're building a capability to put a space station up very shortly\nNow they're doing the types of things that maybe twenty Thirty years ago we as the United states we're we're talking about I'm beginning to do while they're rapidly catching up and you know this is caught our attention that's why\nYou know the president and the Pentagon and wrote a national defense strategy that focus like a laser on Russia and China as untrue competitors are near peer competitors across the board and it's not not just\nThe military it's economic it's diplomatic\nAh it's all these other areas that show national capability and national power and we're finding that our adversaries are are doing quite well thank you\nHow concerned should we be with the fact that Google arguably one of the most powerful companies in the world I knew a monopoly on the distribution of dissemination of information a appears to be in bed with the government of the People's Republic of China and it's helping them\n[noise] censor information in that country\nThey're manipulating algorithms so that they can monitor their own population and of course they won't negotiate any longer with the Pentagon on you know those types of things on the use of the cloud et cetera\nUm that that's disturbing um you know they are a U.S company and you would think that they would have some allegiance to this country and not become a poll on in the hands of the communist leadership in Beijing and yet that's exactly what they're\nDoing I supposed to a certain degree because they see a rising Chinese economic power and they want to be part of the success of that a country you know they will you know by a lot of estimates um be the world's\nLeading economic powerhouse by twenty thirty five you know somewhere around there um and unless something dramatically happens in a very different way they're going to achieve that they're going to have\nNo leverage using what I outlined earlier the belt and road initiative which is pouring hundreds and billions\nIf you know maybe a trillion and a half\nAcross the world and arguably at least sixty eight countries where they're buying infrastructure and thereby markets and they're controlling information flow you know you I either the Internet and what can be used in what can be so they're strategically doing some very bright very smart things\nUh but when you look at their autocratic regimes yeah and their president for life under President Xi and the amendment of their constitution and you're seeing something similar\nUnder ... with the possibility of ruling for a long period of time and the collaboration across all these fronts\nSharing of technologies and kind of they kind of have to love one another because ah the rest of the world doesn't seem to like them except they're holding to them because they're being bought up to a certain degree by the Chinese\nI Want to ask you about\nSaudi Arabia and how important it is the United states or to maintain this alliance with a bad actor in a bad neighborhood or given of course they showed the um the brutal slaying of of a ...\nUm [noise] and how that might I mean there's there are dominoes at play here obviously I'm Wondering what your thoughts are on how we should proceed or how the United states where the Trump Administration should proceed\nAh with with Saudi Arabia and how that plays into all of this a sort of his little Cold War scenario\nYou know it's never simple as that and the cars folks sugary a situation is is tragic but if you've been watching my mom and then so solemn and you\nKnow the crown prince uh you know he's probably been cut down a few notches here recently especially with\nAnd the

based solely upon petroleum\nUm we have a lot invested in the ... the Saudis we have a lot of Americans over there are a lot of technology they're totally dependent upon our arms of course\nThey could go to the Chinese or Russian but they don't want to because ours typically are much better I think the big question and that part of the world one is oil\nA and and how are they going to use dollars in the future but also Iran Iran is not to be a ... with then of course that their their major adversary against the Saudis\nAnd the Russians and Chinese are all lined up with Iran and were lined up

[noise]\nYou know a friend of my ... you know my friend and what's the expression Richard a friend of my enemy is in you know my friend or something like that that the idea\nBeing that we we have to

Decatur of destroyer\nA in the grave and reefs and the south China Sea the Chinese warship came\nOnly a few meters away from it and just in the last day we've had a couple of B. fifty twos set it flew over um you know the\nContested area and the south China Sea people need to understand that um these islets uh thirty four hundred acres that the Chinese have militarized with cruise missiles and defense weapons and\nYou know created not only harbors for their warships but also for their jet fighters and their bombers that they practice from\nThat these are claimed 'em by the Vietnamese a Taiwanese as well as the Filipinos and there are six hundred and sixty miles or in that range south of China so this is not just\nNext door to them it's really in the middle of that to see but these confrontations are on the increase we've had a lot in the south China Sea East China sea\nThe Russians are being very provocative at sea and in the air as I've indicated and of course they have their neighbors\nTo the west I'm terrified to the point that the\nUh polish a prime minister is called for a given to us two billion dollars to forward station armored brigades so that they can be prepared in case the Russians do what they did a in Ukraine or Crimea or\nThe republic of Georgia which is a concern and you mentioned the mercenaries yes back in February of this year we killed a couple of hundred and it's interesting we have a a hotline with the Russian military in Syria and we called him and said are these your troops and they said no and so we've\nKilled them um and that's the nature of mercenaries but they were there to represent the Assad regime [noise] uh and of course uh the Russians wife their hands of even though we know where they came from and what they did\nWell Syria uh obviously that looms large in any time scenario uh it it is that the most likely flash point as far as you're concerned\nAt this point it certainly is a flash point I Would argue that ah you know if you've got into phase ... thirty eight that we're really talking\nUh [noise] the the Gaga mad dog a and that mad dog could be the country of say turkey I Know it's interesting a friend of mine spoke with a\nA general now president el Sisi of Egypt who told him less than a year ago that he thought that air to one who is the current president\nOf turkey is really a seeks to be the leaf and\nTo establish a gala fat and his statements have been very very um conducive to that interpretation not only within the region but\nYou know the release of the American pastor Brunson here recently was after great pressure we put on him a air to want to cooperate with us but yet\nWe find that he's traveling all over the world he was just two weeks ago and of all places current cologne Germany what was he doing there yeah he was doing a state visit but he was also dedicating a mosque\nNow that's not very typical of presidents of countries going across the world doing that sort of thing but this guy has a and he consistently has had over the years a very ambitious thoughts about uh the re emergence\nOf the Ottoman Empire he isn't Neal Ottoman and I don't think anyone that follows him closely would dispute that so\nThese are issues Syria is you know clearly something that everyone is watching he's collaborating with Russians who of course uh even though there is some friction there that they are working together\nAnd of course they're working against the likes of Riyadh but they're collaborating as well with Iran who has a\nLot of forces especially crude forces there near Damascus and operating even drones threatening northern Israel so when you kind of put the picture together\nYou see the Iranians certainly the Turks are sort of our lives\nThe Russians and the Chinese and the Chinese Yasser ... beginning to show up and even Syria hoping to kind of look their chops and and put together that country once a declaration of peace can be found and they can find a political solution so\nA lot of players here are confused battlefield uh but I clearly see Syria as part of this\nA long term agenda\nEven care to one and I wanted to ask you about turkey did they belong in NATO even at this point\nThat's a fair question I don't think so my concern would be one you know if you go back to O. three we tried to put our fourth division through turkey into northern Iraq through ... to attack\nSaddam you know a good ally would've allowed that to happen of course had her ... her to won didn't want that to happen they blocked us and we ended up having to take all those troops who is who was up to the Gulf into Kuwait\nUm air to one is not being a cooperating of course they're purchased the U.S for hundreds a surface to air missiles from the Russians\nAre they're being pretty cozy with the Russians of late or even purchased a long term nuclear power plant on the ...\nFrom the Russians and of course as we've seen elsewhere as soon as you have a operational power plant much like they have a in downtown to run a and on the coastline there then you can begin to make a\nPlutonium and that puts you on a glide path to having a nuclear capability and I think that's what everyone wants\nTo all suddenly ... it's just too rich so the the the turkey is buying um air defense system that would be at least under the umbrella of NATO a sensibly used to protect NATO from Russian missile yes\nAnd that yeah because we will not connect our a patriots and other fat to a Russian as four hundred a that's why there's a\nIt's a non ... we just won't do it and that is a major bone of contention and of course that there are others even though we've tried to maintain good relations with the Turks\nGoing but we're not going to eliminate all the tension

one critical time to give people you're with them that he did go work through was wrong for\n[noise] you know well I sort of question there Richard it it is it is perspective um you know I think that the the history of the Russian of\nSoviet Union certainly in where they killed millions a hundred mile in China where they kill millions\nAnd their foreign policy where they provoked all sorts of proxy wars um the the types of values that they support ah yeah we do sell weapons are defense security cooperation agency has done a robust year this year double what we did last year\nWe we have made mistakes with some of our alliances and the like\nUh we've helped topple governments perhaps in the past and and and did it for our own national interest so I think what you said moments ago Richard is absolutely correct and that is\nA we don't have any friends we just have interests and those interests are going to shift from time to time given what\nThe United states needs to secure itself and to prosper\nUm sometimes are in the eyes of the beholder it is is evil or certainly in my perspective when I've you know label Russia and China as an alliance of evil I looked at their history and I look for the one today and it's certainly not what my country wants\nAnd I do believe a United States\nIs not perfect but it's doing you know some pretty good things around the world and I I tend to want to respect and care for our interests over there\nBecause you know people talk about democracy and and how that is really what protects freedom but it's not really democracy it in the rule of law and we have the rule of law in North America thank God in western civilization as you look around at Seventy eighty percent of the rest of the world\nThey don't have a rule of law it in the wild west and there are no protections afforded the individual you can be literally swept up the street in the middle of the night and executed\nFor for no reason in most places in the world\nA and to me that's evil\nYou know you're you know there are a million Muslims that are incarcerated in West\nAnd a western China today and that's a un report on somebody can look it up here\nIn the last week or so why are they doing that because they they say that there\nAre extremist well you know we don't do that the United states now yes we have a history of incarcerated in Japanese under FDR a that was wrong and we've acknowledge that we do bad things but the rest of the world\nI have I've gone through I think five passports have been all over the world I've seen some pretty bad places um and yet you know it's always wonderful to come back home to the United states are where we\nEnjoy the rule of law we aren't afraid as Richard points out being arrested pulled out of bed and shot and they had um [noise] our families being carted away and yet ah unfortunately we're seeing that elsewhere in the world and\nThe likes of the Chinese are doing some of that to their own people and so
