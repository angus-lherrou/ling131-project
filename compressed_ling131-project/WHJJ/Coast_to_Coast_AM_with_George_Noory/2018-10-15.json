dream Stella right before the break and I want to get back to the dream Stella briefly before we started to move forward and in the dream still up\nThe pay for that minute published last week is on his website we're going to be discussing this uh tonight on the show\nIt's like on my news website over across it goes to I'm going to take history there there are a list of papers on the right hand side\nThe current neighbor is the one that is on the top now with the your analysis here minute it gets a little complicated a little technical\nBut the idea behind it is actually quite simple in an allegation which is is that some of the layers have a different sickness in stone that take us through bad\nYeah [noise] um when when you when you're standing in front of the pyramid and you look up the walls are you when you stand close you don't notice there's so much but when you go further away let's say you're in your hotel and you have a ... view\nYou start noticing that there is a certain texture to the pyramid and um ah the reviewer or who was it was very well known a ... a shop here who don't we reviewed my paper\nAh he calls his waves um and I call it sort of a federal effect\nUm and so when you look at the details of that which was published by Clinton as petri a hundred and fifty years ago who actually measured each individual course I was a function of total height\nYou then you actually see the numbers and so there is these uh you know you you start with really thick courses and as you get to the top of the courses get thinner but every once in a while there is a jump so uh you have a much thicker course and\nThen the thickness tapers off and then it resumes the overall trend which is a thinning trend and then you have another sudden jump in thickness and just keeps on going and going for twenty three times as far as I'm as far as I see there's twenty three peaks like that [noise]\nUm and ah and then before each one of these jobs petri noted that uh if you calculate the surface area of course and you divide that surface area by the surface area at the base\nSome of these peaks have rounds fraction of twenty fifth so you know one twenty fifth to twenty fifth ... so he found that there are rounds fractions of twenty fifth associated with some of these ... courses and that was it uh it was not for interpret it what does it mean\nA it was just noted but uh it just sat there um until I took a look at it again\nHow many layers total and and the forty two story great German how many rows\nYeah two hundred three left and probably two hundred ten\nUh originally\nTwo hundred and ten originally is there and I have\nTo have to immediately say there are some researchers who say the pyramid was not completed there was a they say there was there was a virtual top so it was actually ... at the top and the rest was a maybe a as fear\nAnd you know one of the the most prominent researcher who was proposed this is Robert ... father John Paul evolve\nAnd the papers on I think it's on a Robert ... vaults or\nAcademia a page and it's also in costs me gloom uh his brother vote to attend and he sees in the back of the book where he explains\nThis theory so there are some people that I think the pyramid was not coming to a peek a and of course other people say it was ... and so theoretically at least you can say two hundred and of course\nNow we have is there a consistency to the ah repeating of the sticker layers\n[noise] um ...\nDoes it every ten steps that every ... there's some kind of ... you\nKnow I that's a great question I I that was the first thing also I was looking for it but unfortunately I unfortunately no it's not that easy it's it's kind of what you know Jimmy it's kind of haphazard has to be honest with you I I'm I was just struck by when I first saw that I was just struck why did they do this\nUm because you know you were you could just you know simple mine that I thought each step they weren't just a applied the ah the pyramid and go you know in Egyptian the Egyptians designed their parents with or something called they called this set that which is the pyramid angle\nAnd it's a you know when you walk up a staircase basically for each amount that you go up you go a certain amount forward\nAnd that's how they ... a pyramid and go so I thought you know each course it should be the same amount like you're going up a staircase each step is the same and and it's not and and ah and all of a sudden you know the steps gets much thicker\nAnd cheer question again there's low regularity even to the thickness so when you know it's it's completely off hazardous but of course now I think I Know the answer it has to do with the interior architecture it has to do with spaces inside\nAnd we'll get to that or after the break but what is the most amazing to me about this is that with the different layers of which there are\nA couple of dozen dinner is decker\nYeah that the orientation for the pyramid that it still ended up at the right angle on all four sides yeah a to complete the pyramid correctly without any errors but that's an engineering feat that is just beyond comprehension yeah\nWhich which to me I Want it to correct something I said in the shape to black interview I I think I said that uh the ... to ... um shot a shop to ... and ... published that al ... was disappearing or during\nThe twenty seventh century so I I wanted to correct that it wasn't al ... in the paper\nIt was a star Iraq\nSo it was starting to disappear in the southern part of the country and because of that because that constellation\n... it was so important to your trip shows off his proposed that therefore they began to oriented oriented monuments to another part of the of the ... and we ended up in the in the north south orientation\nI gotta jump in right there the coast to coast and we've got to take a break my new this ... church we'll be right back stay with us\n[noise] get Daily Show updates your inbox

that it was published last week\nAnd again I Want everybody to go over and get the reference at my news website it is a Chiapas pyramid dot com the links are at coast to coast am\nAnd go to the right side scroll down there's a list of published papers right there we're talking about the top one now my new I Want to jump ahead and let everybody know in that PDF\nIf they scroll down to page three twenty six has tried three hundred ... a a scrawled on the page three twenty six where you have an illustration there\nOf the layers ... with a cut away showing the grand gallery and of course the kings chamber and the queens chamber the descending passage way and\nThe ascending passage way up to the grand gallery and so working from the bottom the first layer up a ... we're talking about a road number eight Seventeen Twenty one and of course thirty for these must have been for you and I want you to take the audience through this\nBut these are game changing moments when you see these alignment these layers weren't they\nThat was a game changing moment you're right I'm I'm I'm a listing all the peaks you know the total number of pixels twenty three some of these peaks a worst civically noted by petri\nTo have surfaced a race shows that were round number fractious up twenty fifth so you know six twenty five twenty\nAnd I'm a and those are also this that\nAnd it turns out that those courses that are associated with these round fractious to run\nA over ceilings in a in that of course we don't have a lot of feeling but the few that we have it seems to be a coronation uh thirty four is the most striking one it goes right across the queen a chamber\nAnd based on this ... this observation that there seems to be a correlation between round fraction twenty you know courses that have a surface area that is around ... number facts of twenty fifth\nI Am proposing that the top part of the pyramid where we don't know of any space and where we nevertheless also see these type of round fractions of twenty fifth that it must be space is just the same up there and I'm saying at me six if not then\nWe're going to get to that are exactly that's on page three twenty eight yeah but staying on page three twenty six with this cut away yeah you need to have if you are going to a proposed\nSo these extra chambers above the kings chamber where there is supposed to be nothing right but then you have to have some basis for this and clearly we have a I I'm just looking at one two three four five six seven eight\nAbsolute definitive uh marks on these rose starting with the descending passage way all the way up to the top of the king's chamber\nRight so for example correspond a Twenty one which is a ... which has a surface area that is a round fraction of twenty fifth for Nineteen twenty fifth that aligns with the uh the uh you know the ... ones that are that guard the entry of to the great pyramid show right that\nCost on the Twenty one is right under the V.\nUh so it is in other words if a soldier with a feeling than the than the one that we just talked about is a course I'm thirty four also it has a round fraction of twenty fifth sixteen in this case and it runs right over the ceiling of the queen chamber\nOr then the other courses don't don't have round fracture the twenty fifth and they're not associated with feelings so it works out very nicely and then we go to the top and then we have eight a we have eight twenty fifth\nOr and that goes across the feeling of the um off the ground at tower\nI'm now there are there are two courses nine twenty fifth and ten twenty fifth and those ... line up with a with a two of relieving chambers in fact that the tower\nUm and and then the final point I wanted to make is that the possible avoid which I marked in here um that was found last year is also aligning with eight twenty fifth so it's possible that that causes marking not just that granted power but maybe also the possible avoid if it's four wheel\nWhich we are talking about a rose sixty eight\nA that would be a that would be will eighty four\nNo role eighty four is at the top of the king's chamber am I reading this correctly\nYeah you are it's not the top of the king chamber and that also happens to be a you know within the resolution of this scanned that they were publishing that also is approximately the top of the ... the big boys\nI got it yes of\nCourse we don't know exactly if we just it's kind of have the image so I just kind of like you know painted that into this illustrations just to give a rough guide\nI Want to jump back a really quick I don't want this to get away from me there was a tweet earlier that is a pretty important and this is from eddy\nYeah and and he says does ah does my new see any connection between a dynastic Egypt shouldn't use of the lion and the use of the lion at go badly tabby\nAnd everybody's talking about go Beckley tabby today and its relationship with ... and the great pyramid and and the other things thrown dynastic Egypt is there a connection\nYeah that's a fantastic question um and I am actually I'm I'm currently looking into that uh with Robert shock we are um we're trying and but I'm not ready to make a statement yet\nOkay but the they used the lion see this is what I find fascinating when we go back on these dates\nAnd we constantly land at ten thousand five hundred BC for a variety of reasons one of course\nUh what was going on with the stars we understand that but then we have all of the\nUh cataclysmic event the end of the ice age the construction of go Beckley tabby the erosion on the banks all of these things and Leo Rising right all of these things happen at ten thousand five hundred BC yet which makes it go back leads happy not an accident\nNo with his references of course with lines to as low extraordinary\nYeah no absolutely it's a fantastic question and I don't want to you know jump the gun because I Can't really speak with authority yet I'm so maybe the next show um maybe we'll have something more but it's a great question\nLet's go to a um I'm gonna get to the top half of the pyramid and we're going to work on that in a second but got some calls that have been holding for quite a while to speak with you my new let's go to Barry in South Carolina Barry welcome back to coast\nHello there ... and you know what

sounds radical but\nFor example the great pyramid is missing the capstone and it just seems to me that\nYou could bring in architects archaeologist perhaps what special theme sub remote viewing into an intuition and actually\nRink construct temples repair the temples has this been discussed\nYes and as of the great question I'm so there's two answers to that the first one is that uh the minister of antiquities is trying to partially restored monuments so you get a feel for what it is\nYou have looked 'em but they don't want to cover it up all with you know modern\nBe construction they just want to give you a sort of an idea so they may may they may do affection and then they leave the rest on touched\nSo that's the first part of your question but there is something even more exciting going on and I have to reference a a Harvard uh it's called digital visa and what they're doing and this is the direction of Peter I'm a new area and um they are\nBasically recreating gives a a a ... in the in the virtual world and I predict\nIn a few years you'll be able to uh descend into a virtual world and it will be exactly like the way it looked or the way we think it look and you'll be able to go into all the chamber's look at the inscriptions and it'll feel you know uh the real thing and they're working on it\nNow with these additional chambers in the upper half of the great pyramid where did you come up with a number six or eight\nRight so because we have we have a sequence of ah courses that conform to this uh you know the the simple rule that the surface area is around ... of twenty fifth and so and\nI Am pretty convinced that they that the architect wouldn't just waste I'm you know energy to create these sticker courses unless there is a purpose for it so for every single of course that has a round fraction of twenty fifth I think there is a space associated with that\nMore and more phone call before the break let's go to go out west to Daniel in eureka California Daniel you're up next on coast\nHi um I had a quick question about a\nA shot he awash or I've heard him many times interviewed on coast to coast over the years and yes apparently he controlled and very closely guarded access to researchers in the public or or to the pyramids in for research and just general public access\nAnd I had heard that after the um spring Arab Spring uprising or he resigned what is your access like now with the new minister and our researchers are given better access for research and the general public and I'll take my answer off the air\nGreat question Daniel my new what's it like there now with ...\nRegarding talked about so first of all I have a few email exchanges with him and he's been always very nice very courteous as just the questions and so I've had good experiences with him I've never met in person than he probably doesn't know why I'm\nI'm regarding getting a hermit so we are currently applying for a permit um for a small study Robert Robert truck and I are um and I think I'm so I'm hearing mixed messages so on the one hand it's also like investigators are being invited to come\nOn and on the other hand I'm hearing is that they uh they've become more selective so you know it probably depends on the project they have certain areas where they want research to happen and other areas they feel like it's a it's been exhausted\nUm you know so it's really in their hands and there's nothing you can do about it other than you just try it and what they do\nWell do you think that the the ... research would be ongoing like it is ... how was it was still the director there\n... I think he is actually involved a Jimmy he's on the he sits on the on the uh the board of directors that reviews the data so he is involved a half these not maybe not publicly but behind the scenes he is involved they ask employees at by a is input\nUm you know I think there's sort of mixed\nBack here you know there is the public's eye of us who you know comes on TV and gives announcements and then there's the the scientists the archaeologist who loves what he does um you know it's difficult to kind of saw it all out but\nI think um you know they they have to strike a balance between protecting the monuments and allowing people to research them and I to be honest with you I understand it and you know some of the projects that uh you know you want to do you can't do them because it might destroy the monument so I'm\nWell you're being you're being said some political right now and I understand that might do it and I respect that you know there's the other part of this where we have been told for so long that there is nothing to discover there\nAnd that they have not moved from that stance and now it looks like it's going completely in the opposite direction says why are they gonna have to open ... are they going to have to back pedal\nYeah so it to the to the listeners question I think I forgot that goes down you know I think right yes\nUm yeah so I think what you you said two thousand eleven so I think that has something has changed\nUh they're sort of a you know people are even each opposes that talked to some of some of the scholars there the local scholars they feel like you know they have more of a voice that can you know a say\nOr they can research and I think it's been I think it's been good for the country and I think it's\nGood let me jump in right

oh well let me let me jump in I guess what you're asking my new is ah the origin of the word pharaoh and where did it come from from a which which people\n... to ... to ... to ... to ... the work of the meaning of the pro which it ... the push language\n... Kush which which is of course required by two by four to five years ago\nYeah ... ... ... the you know we're talking about a quite of three ... for ... years ago it's been ... older than any other language you can put a little bowl of pulling it so ... which was\nOf people who is just speak well it's a cush people still it'll rich in the bag loan which I'm from the coach which just do things like\nWho does it should be a little late it was people well the pilot or\n... ... ... you know heightened will or somewhere in oil\nI'm going to I'm going to pass that up to my new I actually have a couple of comments about that Isaac and and thanks for the phone call a minute the origins of the word pharaoh and its meaning\nYeah I I couldn't buy some thanks for interpret I couldn't hear the whole question I I'm ... so so he chipped colleges are saying that uh in the old kingdom a that term was not use\nSo the term pharaoh it's technically speaking doesn't apply to the kings of the old king them I think the first ah I'm I and I can't remember if it's middle kingdom or new kingdom when you start using that term uh and that probably means that's when it first appears\nAnd that's all I Know about it offhand I said what I've read about this before but I don't want to say something wrong so I I this is what I remember\nRight in that there's two two points that need to be brought out here uh when we were ... going back\nTo a man as a um and the first and now I'm going to say the word they were referred to as kings\nYeah right right like in armor and\nMen is uh the first uh kings of Egypt could be some are saying that the the same a menace unarm are may be the same or they could be two different teams they weren't called pharaohs back then\nRight and now there's another ah\nAh I have research that is a little bit and I find it fascinating that the Kurdish people were the original Egyptians and the the ... that are there\nNow I'm more\nMore workers or possibly even slaves to the Kurdish people\n[noise] yeah um yeah I Can't really comment on it because I don't know enough about it um I I it regarding what the king was called I can tell you that uh\nBy the fifth dynasty the king have five different title um and in the very beginning um you know the kings were called horse came so it was horse alarm or an hors ...\nSo uh so that that was the first that was the first title and then quickly after a ... you know the designation a natural in bed which is basically referring to operate in Egypt\nAnd then came to to lady's name ah you know and then came to cartoonish name later\nUm but uh the as you just set yourself so Farrow came later I I just looked it up if I was like ... the is the first time it was used\nThere you go let's go east of the Rockies or just go to Jay out here in Los Angeles in jail you're up next on coast [noise]\nHello hello J. lo J.\nHow you guys doing hello how high is there a first time caller long time long time listener I'm I Am actually um Egypt certain time on my mom's side [noise] and um growing up as a kid I Would always hear\nMy grandma to sit at least they tell me a lot of stories that there was always passages from here there there's always secrets to the great pyramid has secrets to there's tunnels here I was there you know there's always stories that Graham you know grandkids hear their grandparents say the\nOne that always stuck with me that I really wanted to get clarification on I've seen stuff like on line but [noise]\nI Try to take it with a grain of salt\nUm I really am glad that you're on the show a ...

it\nYou can find them in the ... in the dimensions of the ... of him you know\nAnd you know we don't have time to get into it today but the papers on my website Go check it out and tell me what you think but I think the answer the question is yes I think this is the world's first example of an architect using his own to him as a blueprint for monument\nAnd thank you for the call Joe and that paper is underneath the latest papers the second one listed over on my news website and one last question from Twitter before we had to the break this is from dean\nIn doses are there any other pyramids in central and South America that carried the same traits as the ...\nTraits meaning\nBut it's just what it says in the winter\nWe don't know yeah um\nI I assume there would be a couple of things that I Do know is referencing near one would be size in orientation or to true north in may be uh something astrological ah within the alignment\nWell let me let me put it this way so I think I you know I've I've watched this documentary or which is intriguing they're basically saying is that all these monuments are lining up a across the globe and I find that fascinating I and I don't know how to explain it\nIf that is true that would definitely suggest that master plan that you know people were coordinating this this this is building activity and of course that's what Graham Hancock\nA has been writing about four years and uh so I I think it's possible yes but just specifically some of the trades I I Can't really comment because I don't know enough about it\nWell let me help you with this idea when we look at the the tops of the the the pyramids in Mexico in Mexico city and the mind structures throughout Guatemala Honduras\nAnd believes that the tops of these pyramids there's always something there what about the top of the great pyramid is would do not not the top top two there'll be a chamber\nOr something at the at the upper levels\nYet as well I think so I think that could be that they could be a space or that um connects that connected to the summit\nEr and of course the summit itself I'm you know like I said before John a drop off a vow has provoked pose that the summit of the great pyramid was not at peak was basically\nA virtual top and a and it would have been a you know as fear and it's interesting that the diameter of that's here is a meter\nA it's a very interesting a very interesting theory a and others have proposed similar things\nThere's even a hero cliff I think I'm a this was first mentioned by a state Jeannie in a night in the Nineteen Seventy one book by Peter Tompkins that there was this fear on top of the great pyramid so not up to her media and by the sphere\nSo yes I I think I think those theories out there I but I don't know how you would otherwise prove it I'm\nNo you've got to anomalies in ... a a and one is clearly defined edge row one Ninety six and do you do have a ratio there could there be a chamber at the very top\nI I think so how big would it be the way I'm looking at those upper rose or the dimensions of the pyramid at that high um how big could that chamber be\nI think a chamber like that would be maybe no more than five feet something like that five feet by ... and hide I'm saying rising oh\nMaybe maybe a five six courses or something like that\nUm and they would be it would be difficult to detect it may be on a on the ... and especially if you have a grand gallery in between which you know the last year scan was from the queen chamber so I think in order to protect these spaces you'd have to put the place up in a in the uh in the or the chamber of that's off limits right\nYeah and how would you how would you detect more than one chamber\nWill the new one scan your show multiple chambers that were stacked up on top of each other\nYeah maybe not if they're stocked up maybe not but they might not be stocked up um they could be you know like the one for example I mentioned that uh Rudolph gumption bring a is suspecting that will be a chamber that's in the southern part of the pyramid maybe close to the face\nYou know so they may not be stocked up I'm a one way you could do a Jimmy is by putting the plates ensure that knowledge that we talked about you know the one that ah who Don and fire investigated it's up on the south it's on the north east side\nYou know the northeast corner right at\nNorth east corner it's a fairly sizable space you know I mean I I don't know how big the plates are but I Wonder if you could set up to a place up there and then you might be able to actually discern the different chambers that made it might be possible\nHow expensive is it to perform these ... studies\nIt seemed like it wouldn't be that expensive because you're just placing the the wage throughout the pyramid and then of course running a computer system it's not like there was any excavations or right right it's not that expensive but\nYeah they have I think they've already spent the main capitals already spent basically uh you know making the plates\nAnd then you know if you have to pay the people to do the experiment I'm guessing multiple a million dollars I think maybe ten ten million or something like that you do this project I'm a and most of that money has maybe already been spent and now like you were saying you know and now it's just you know you just to repeat studies\nUm but I I think if you do any kind of invasive a project or in a project like this is spending several million dollars a which if we want to go back to the strings and hope things that's a kind of money that will need for a project like\nThis is coast to coast am I going to be church it's been an all Egypt the great pyramid evening era going into Monday morning
