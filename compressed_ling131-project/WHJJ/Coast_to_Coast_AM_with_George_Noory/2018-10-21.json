MRI and a spinal tap that the next day those doctors not determine what what's wrong with me\nThroughout those six days a year or\nOur basic quicker lives on the right side of my body after six days this or this charge me not knowing what was going literary saying take two Advil call me or four days\nSo we went to go get a second opinion was second doctor said he didn't see the ... from the first doctor was also an nurse narrow certainly by the way so we went to go get those ... but I felt like I was having a stroke\nRights are more slurring or my ... more to his arm my rights that are based on ...\nI went to a different hospital [noise] within two hours they were able to tell me that did not have a stroke that I had to bring a cancerous tumor\nImmediately started doing work I had a biopsy there told me I was diagnosed with the question is if I could have gotten help earlier that tumor what not to put pressure on my brain I Would not have a Sable I'm\nOK Now okay I got it uh so let me throw some questions that you uh during the course of those six days had the doctors are discovered a that you had this brain tumor\nOh I'm Sorry\nI yeah I Know the doctors and not discover it but that was so over six days to the brain tumor grow and cause pressure\nOver six days the tumor grew Yes sir and how do you know that\nBecause I ... I was able to walk into the hospital ... normally stays there that was such pressure on my brain dark and there was on my brain dam mhm that I could not walk I\nCould not pay and I was moving I'm assuming well uh my guess is ah you left your ah neurosurgery ... surgery residency a little bit earlier so you weren't ... you didn't get board certified\nUm do you have a doctor that will say two things number one I had they taken out the tumor six days before I you would never have had these problems and you would be fine you wouldn't had slurring you wouldn't matter problem there wouldn't be pressure\nI don't know why I called ... have you ever talk to my\n... well being in colleges it'll be a it'll be a neurosurgeon who's ... going to make that call and you're gonna have to have that doctors say that and willing to testify to that so that's one issue how about let's start with the second issue I any permanent brain damage any permanent injury neurological injury\n[noise] not that I Know it's\nOkay so what you have is you hear your damages six days of slurring and six days of ... walking around or not walking around thinking you had a stroke okay what what does that work six\nDays of that when you say\nI was not able to work\nI mean I got it you might call you miss six days at work I understand there's some damage as they are not arguing that aren't damages I'm what I'm saying is what do you think that's worth\nI honestly I don't know\nI yeah I don't either so I I think even though there could very well have been malpractice a ... then there may be an argument that there wasn't we looked and or a doctor could have easily miss that I that's the other defense that uh the first group of doctors said but you're making a lot of medical exemptions here\nThat ah you I don't have the legal right to make that you're going to need some very heavy duty second opinions\nAnd it's going to get very wonky and very technical and you can bet the insurance company is going to defend this thing like crazy and you're going to need a top notch medical malpractice surgeon\nWho's payoff will be six days\nOf you walking around like you were slurring and losing six days of work do you see the problem\nRight but that's continued to this day\nThat's what I asked is do you have any long term problem as as a result of what happens and having missed the tumor for six days is that was caused the long term problems\nYeah okay and you know that for a fact\nHis doctors have told you that\nYes I mean I'm Still going through chemotherapy\nI'm not arguing that you would have gone through chemotherapy anyway correct All right\nSo six days is all the difference in the world you'd be jumping you'd be doing a judge jumping jacks to be flying around and you'd be fine if they had discovered the tumor six days before\nYeah okay I Believe so I\nWell doctor and a ... where where was your residency in neurosurgery let's go through that because we have to put you on the stand and uh we have to ah absolutely a approved to the court that you have the certifications that you have the credentials as an expert so let's start with is\nA where'd you go medical school\nOh Iowa

welcome to coast to coast am how are you\nI'm well Richard thanks for having me on\nMy pleasure let's talk about Harry Houdini ease um how should we described his I mean he was not just a skeptic\nOf after death communication he was an of vowed to bunker and I don't even think that is saying as strongly enough I mean he was almost a hatred for these people that he considered to be frauds where did that he knew why did that happen how did it come about\nThat that's a very interesting place to start 'em because you're absolutely right I mean he wrote two books as you mentioned and he really um he um\nWas not just on the side he his mother died in Nineteen Thirteen and at that point he tried to get in touch with her through some psychics but he could tell they were all faking what they were doing and so um\nThat kind of got him going and so he has an excellent magician he was able to replicate some of the things that these fake mediums would do so he was always looking for that and actually I think this is ultimately will get got him killed because I think that the people these fake psychic or\nTalking amongst themselves and I think they want it to refer them up a little bit I don't think they wanted to kill them but I think they wanted to say back off men we don't get in your way get out of our way and I think they might have spent some money to get that um\nThat young student who had been on the boxing team to punch him in the stomach which was a trick he did in public and as you know Richard he\nHe would pick someone out of the crowd pick someone like you or me you know right I mean I'd have them come up to the stage and he would make his muscles ready and he would be ready for that\nBut this time there's this guy came backstage and Harry wasn't expecting it at all his muscles aren't from this guy really late into him and the trauma into his abdomen was so intense that um you know you had those problems than his appendix burst and this is why passed away\nRight and and had he had he gone to the doctor immediately to receive a medical uh help he probably would've lived but always the showman he the show must go on and he went on and he performed or four or five more shows and and then finally collapsed in Detroit\nYes he was doing little tiny handkerchief magic 'cause that was all he had the strength for 'em but\nOne other point I on this subject about these fake medium he would send his assistance out and they would find people and they would see the show and he would find a point in time where the show could be busted so to speak\nAnd he would even get the guy that was in control of the light and on the deal and here he would show up with a photographer and the newspaper Harry would be wearing a disguise\nThe magician would be in the middle of his\nYou know they say on the weather would ever where the hidden string making something fly to this guy or whatever and the lights would come up and the photographer would take a picture and\nAnd uh you know the fake media would be totally surprise you and he'd say I'm Harry Houdini to pull off his mask and so these guys were very upset yeah\nFascinating I I had not heard the the theory that perhaps some of these a cabal of of disgruntled psychics mediums had put this young student at McGill University up to the task of of uh yeah\nThis writing on beating on Harry right into\nMy that's my own idea I haven't heard it from anyone else it seems to make sense a few phone calls hey you know I mean that guy had nothing on Henry you know I mean he didn't have any kind of reason to go there or do anything\nRight right I thought it was in I just wanted to ask you about briefly about a circus or Arthur Conan Doyle because they were Harry and and he were were good friends and yet\nA Doyle was a prominent spiritual is so how did that how did that friendship survive the fact that area was such an vowed to bunker didn't have time for spiritual is and yet he's good friend and his wife were both very much into spiritualism movement\nYes yes the spirit was movement is not exactly out and find in some kind of permanent structure you know you can't say there is a leader but a lot of people did looked at the oil as the leader of the spiritual as\nA matter of friendship starting in around Nineteen twenty for about two years and I think the friendship came

after Harry died because of this is the word that he was looking for from his mother to show him that his mother's soul or spirit was surviving death and says this got\nHer attention but what's really interesting is that neither ... nor Arthur forward pursued this anymore they didn't want to pursue Arthur Ford\nWas well aware of who d'nese reputation and how strongly he was pushing back against the

[noise]\n\n\n\nI must resettle my guess is the author of leaving the paradox of enlightenment and the the essay we're discussing\nA Houdini afterlife experiment did it work and that is posted up at the coast to coast am dot com website and Thomas's website as well infinitely mystical\nDot com time is tight Thomas so let's get to the to say on a at a best his house in January of Nineteen twenty nine and a Arthur Ford is there this is the the medium would reached out to her a so so what happens [noise]\nAnd I think this might have affected his ability to function as a psychic and much later near the end of his life and I'm Sorry I don't have the dates on this he was involved in a very high profile\nSaid on hum with pike that's the name that comes\nTo my oh James Pike up yes it was up here on on I'm In Canada upon earn a Canadian and so there's another Canadian connection yes yeah yeah and\nI think it's an I'm looking at it now Nineteen sixty seven for how a say on for pike now pike son had tragically committed suicide\nThe year before now what Ford did for this high profile say on what he did with all the acreage do three is the only thing that\nYou kind of breaking up a sign on us Thomas or I Am not sure if it's a cordless phone or a cell phone but maybe if you keep very still speak maybe okay that\nI'm there where it's actually a voice over I T line and sometimes it does break up is that a little better\nIt is okay\nThe James Pike this is the ... an Episcopal bishop his son had committed suicide a year earlier and now Ford is doing a sound\nA Canadian TV [noise]\nYes and and he does a little up front research\nBrings it into the than says if he's getting it in a psychic way whereas in fact he got it from a conventional way this was discovered after Fort died and people went to his papers and found his research preparing for the ... and that's why people say this\nSo this is another black mark against or if they're bored and it again and muddy the water for this case the Houdini case\nAs fun as it is and is exciting it is it it's not going to be the first to break through convince all the hard no skeptics who just isn't\nRight but but okay so Ford is discredited because of this sense in Canada in Nineteen sixty seven but as you point out he had been taking morphine he had been drinking or perhaps that had damaged his medium ... abilities does that necessarily discredit the work that he did on on the Houdini case\nYeah yes that's the way I see it and it does or doesn't I I just\nThat it it puts a cloud over it but it doesn't necessarily directly bear on it\nNow despite basses\nRe catching\nAnd you know saying no I I don't believe that Harry communicated with me nor Cody then why did she continue to do these ... high profile public stance is on the anniversary of Harry's death for the next ten years\n[noise] um she did it for ten years after his death but she didn't start them until a couple of years into that so she did about seven of them as my count but the point is still well taken and here's the way I look at it when she was with Harry um\nShe would be on stage at times and Harry was the one in the spotlight but when Harry dies she's in the spotlight but she doesn't have anything to do\nYou know and so all of a sudden she's in an unusual place and so by stepping into the spotlight only once a year for one night to do the ... and I think the last one was in LA\nI'm On the top of a building you know the first they were going to do it down into building but then they said let's do it on the top one will be higher closer to God and the spirit\nAnyway I think she knew these were going to be a failure because she was the one that was acting as the medium and she's not a medium so you're pretty much guaranteed they're gonna fail\nSo she can say that statement at the end you know ten years is long enough to wait for any man and and that kind of thing and it kinda makes it safe for her to say well I tried I open minded I tried but it didn't work and so I'm going to go back\nWith my friends and embrace the standard mainstream belief\nBut you're inclined to believe that the original statement released in the New York times in Nineteen twenty nine\nAffirming that she had been contacted through a Arthur for its been contacted by her beloved Harry that that that quite possibly happened\nYes yes I Do in the other letter that she wrote to wind chill is also it has a fair amount of passion to it she's very strong you know and so I'm not someone would say well if she was tricked and didn't know she was tricked she would still feel very strongly so I'm I'm open minded to that comment to\nYou you finish the essay with a I don't know if you have in front of you if you could share with is the final words of Harry Houdini as brought forth by Fletcher and Ford Flex your being the spirit guide in Fort at the end of that successful session can you share those words as we head into the break\nHere um and this is the words of Harry so it's um [noise]\nDo the whole world that Harry Houdini still live and he will prove it a thousand times and more in my life I was

happened that way through the history absolutely there's no doubt about that\nAnd the young FDR didn't exactly have the common touch steady I mean he didn't have um these sort of I I think of George Bush a senior in trying to buy stocks in Kmart back in the er the remember that back in Nineteen eighty eighty tried to show people he he was the common man\nAnd there was a famous TV report he's trying to buy a pair of socks at Kmart to show you know while he's just one of us and he had no idea what to do when he got up to the cash register [laughter] it's funny how that\n\nWhen he won the

with a series the other side of history I Believe a DVD sir yes\nYes he came to the exact same thing in this book was was in the middle of writing this back then are researching it waste because I Do all my own research and you know he came up with his own research to substantiate the same thing so it wasn't a matter of if it was just a matter of one\nThat had happened\nAnd so again or or did he let it happen did eat while in part I suppose he was sort of and they were prodding the Japanese maybe cornering them a little bit but how much more knowledge do you think\nHe had the actual attack\nIt's difficult to tell I Know they had at least two weeks notice and you know the aircraft carriers mysteriously went out of Pearl Harbor\nSo they were not it Pearl Harbor when the attack happened which was a little sister suspicious you know aircraft carriers tend to be a pretty\n... pretty necessary commodity in a word like that and every word actually so you know they had to spare them so they left the harbor if I'm wrong\nSorry but I mean I I Can't imagine a situation where\nAre you would be taking aircraft carriers and ordering them away from a place that you're supposed to be protecting\nSo it was a pretty good evidence to support that the\nYou know the same you know to support that conclusion let's say they definitely had a as a matter of fact the History Channel broke it I think last year I was watching something on the History Channel\nThey even said they had uncovered documents internal documents which I didn't find in the archive suggests that that very thing that the codes were broken and I thought wow hey look at that you know I mean I hate I knew I got it right but I didn't know how to write I got it so that was where I was right on the money with the

Mussolini at first it was an author of Mussolini so mostly actually started the whole thing but\nYou know again I'm history books being what they are that it was the last um\n[noise] so America gets into the war Britain is getting polarized ah being bombed at night for more than a month every night\nUm people taking shelter in the tubes in the book I have a first hand account of that actually my great aunt is still alive she lived through it to the ... bombings in Birmingham she watched the city's burn\n'em coverage of entry and in Birmingham I'm very interesting stuff so um that was really neat that I have that personal contact with her and she's still alive and doing well by the way\nI'm anyway are we going into the war and we're we don't have anything to do a stone at the moment we're just trying to help Churchill and because they were really they have no people have no idea according to my end it was there\nHow close England came to losing the right one they were ...\nUp on the other side of the day being the Germans were lined up on the other side of the English Channel and this was what their MO was they used to go in late on airstrikes\nBomb them into oblivion and then just tape around your ground troops over and it worked exceedingly well especially France and they thought the same thing was going to work in a in in Britain and of course it didn't because of you know church does resolve a and you know of course so we're going to the war\nAnd now we're there to help out Churchill so we're talking amongst ourselves now working you know hand in glove with a with the Brits\nNow all of a sudden we get the rainy idea to bring styling into the war and Churchill loses his mind he hates style and doesn't want anything to do with um never trust them I'm of course to admit previously and I'm Churchill really masterminded the whole thing to be honest with the church who was the one who\nGot the two together but he he just hated the fact that the Americans\nBecause they were so similar at the time\nThat style and in America and the American president FDR were working in unison on this it was great for the war it was bad for the world because Stalin was a temporary ally he had his eye completely on the post war world he knew that after the war we weren't going to be friends\nSo to answer your question around about fashion um Churchill elected for the war hated it for the world and I don't know if he completely trusted that FDR wasn't going to become a saw one only a less aggressive one\nWell at this point was FDR still a huge fan of style needs to say that they called them uncle Joe\nOh yeah absolutely absolutely he was a there was of course you have to understand\nWe weren't getting things from Russia we didn't know much about the great purge I think of FDR had known about the butchery and everything going on and he wouldn't have been as fan but of course we weren't getting that until decades and decades later\nRight in New York Times wherever they were writing glowing a pieces about uncle Joe and how wonderful sure I Know what I mean it was ...\nThere's still a communist newspaper as far as I'm concerned and you know um they're right down the street from the the Communist Party of the United states of America so you know I mean they're still carrying their pieces are ... million\nFDR it seemed that from a reading a book that FDR was very anxious to get a face to face with Allen I don't know if this was because he admired him or like that he was burns as Donald was playing a little hard to get\nStolen didn't need us we needed style and Stalin didn't need us\nHe was already you know when when the Nazis started to hit a pact with style and of course we know as Hitler and installing a pack well Hitler violated the pack and went after style in which completely blue silence mind\nAnd they were on the march to Moscow and they were doing good doing well with this march and then\nYou know Hitler's ego took over and he\nDecided he was going to go to Stalingrad because it held his namesake so now Hitler's leaving under the illusion right now that he's unstoppable is completely unstoppable so of course\nWe didn't know anything about Hillary's drug habit at the time he was on like thirty\nSome odd different drugs so he was such a delusional dictator at the at this time he thinks he's completely unstoppable so he decides to switch course in midstream and go towards styling read um meanwhile the weather is changing\nA winter is following the Germans are ill equipped and he'll close to do this it doesn't matter you know his generals are coming back saying it's a suicide mission\nAnd he'll just says well I don't care I Want to do it so\nStalin is already beating him or he doesn't need us\nSo Hitler has he has he ever hand here he has the opportunity to play a little little hard to get and he certainly was so when we really had to go begging at his style on the table and wish to get this done\nRight so there was a conference in Casablanca and and then later Iran I think\nIn a restaurant in Nineteen forty three and a gang member forty three correct\nThey have that even at this point they have their eye it sort of carving up the post war world\nAh and still at this point you know I I think teachers Roosevelt still looks pretty robots or you know he you know by by standard to Nineteen forties he was an older guy by today's standards he was only like sixty years old we tend to think of him and you know in our mind that he was like eighty but he was he was a relatively young guy\nUm but he looked pretty healthy even in in Nineteen forty three um but I I Want to back up all the minute and talk about the assassination squads Hitler we're sending over to the United states because I didn't know about this until I read your book\nAnd after ... death they they called him a you know a pencil pusher and all kinds of stupid things\nMurder I gotta I gotta jump in here Steve we'll take
