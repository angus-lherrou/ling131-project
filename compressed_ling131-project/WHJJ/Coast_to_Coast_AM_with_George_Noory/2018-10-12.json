and now we've seen signs of that in the last few days or a week in the whole truth is like a ten to Fifteen Percent correct and hair which already close to that\nUm we may make it you know in the next year but but this is the greatest bubble in modern history and it's been extended by six ten trillion dollars are free money printed\nSince two thousand nine and now a trillion and a half tax cuts from Trump two trillion repatriated from overseas this stuff just keeps piling in the stock market it's the most overvalued it's ever been even now more than\nEarly two thousand the greatest bubble

fine most people should sit through that not I call this a great reset this only happens once in a generation and even more so every Ninety years like a clock and we're coming right on that clock\nIn stocks can be down Seventy eighty Ninety percent and take twenty to twenty five years to get back there you do not hold through this and you do not listen to your stockbroker at this time\nYou buy

I've never I mean is this there was no common sense no rationality was just\nPolitical partisanship and the people the Republicans hated the Democrats for attacking this guy and the Democrats hated the Republicans for defending him and in installing this thing and cutting I mean this is like\nI mean and and and who's got all the guns in the world we do so so this is really\nI think that that social unrest in this downturn is going to top the great depression where it was more people roaming around in their cars and not having housing and no jobs and soup lines this is going to be different people\nThe the blue and the red extremes are going to blame each other for the crisis to Republicans say damn Democrats let all this debt run up and do all this you know free money and stuff and and the Democrats are and say Republicans you didn't let us stimulate enough and blah blah blah blah blah and and and they're going to hate each other\nAnd so I I think that's gonna be the worst part of this that we really and and and I really think there's a possibility that there's going to be movements in this time in the civil war I compare there's more to the civil war on the social political level at that time the\nSouth seceded from the more industrial an urbanized north they were totally different I mean the north was blue the south is read this time\nEspecially with Republicans in charge of that I think there's got to be fact I think states like California or the whole west coast\nOr the whole northeast is going to threaten to succeed from the red states because they can't agree on anything that there is nothing that can be agreed on his cabinet thing was the perfect example that no middle ground it's either red or blue you know\nAnd his argument planets argument in hatred and bitterness on both sides\nAnd and even you know the Democrats are always a nice guy I Know that Democrats are jumping up and down and women you know almost to solve it you know ... senators and in the elevator and stuff this ... every body yeah there's a very high tensions and\nI tell you I don't feel that here and it's another advantage to being Puerto Rican I'm kind of

do it when I can buy a condo there for a quarter of the price [laughter] and and and and and but I Want to see what happens first and and the thing about that that the next year also George's this is this is when it's going to\nYou know it's going to happen or not it it's either starting to happen now or or the latest by my calculations with every cycle we have and everything we got her as well it's going to start by late next year and that's going to be a Ninety year anniversary of the greatest\nStock crash in modern history Nineteen twenty nine to thirty two and that is one of many of our cycles we cover and zero our\nIn our newsletters that Ninety year cycle is the most powerful for the big us what I call you know downturns depressions and the biggest stock crashes and this has happened every Ninety years since the industrial revolution caused the greatest boom and global his\nLaw you know Harry I've had a couple of guests on who ah say very similar things to what you're saying the timing was off some of them said things were going to happen back last September or you know there was one the fellow who was talking about Jewish prophecy and he called it the ...\nOh yeah yeah I remember that guy yeah and if I did or\nDidn't happen it didn't happen then but it could happen now you're saying\nWell yeah I mean we're we're in the same position and we were coming into a three thousand sixteen the marketed gone sideways for you were saying you know this looks like in may that finally taught and then\nTrump got elected I mean we turned boys I mean when Trump had that surprise when and the markets were had a two thousand point reversal from down nine hundred to ... eleven hundred just overnight and end of the morning I said look\nThis is a river so this is a tax cut coming and then all of this sort of stuff this is going to extend this boom another year or two another twenty to thirty percent or more\nAnd that's what's happened but now we're on the other side of that now we've seen most of that um and we're running out of tricks I mean what can you do now and the Democrats may when the house it looks likely possibly the Senate but it's going to be much harder for Trump to push his gravy train for businesses\nIt as the Democrats get more control and I see the economy falling apart by two thousand twenty at the latest\nAnd that's that's not good to win reelection I was just going to even\nI don't think Trump gets reelected and they may not even make it we're tracking Watergate on a forty five year cycle almost to the tea which would say you're about to see the special prosecutor get fired after elections early next year and Trump could be in trouble by late next year so so either were peaking now or best\nIn the polls on it no disaster we're going to peak late next year and see the greatest crash in history I don't see any other two options I don't see this bubble lasting pass next to the end of next year but there is there is a

just from the people generation where they would\nThe ... and when they would stop spending so yes what we see is it the worst of this downturn in what we call the winter season that started in two thousand eight\nWill be over a bout about probably about late two thousand twenty two for stocks uh two thousand twenty three for the economy will be the worst and and probably real estate out there maybe a little longer real estate takes longer to crash and longer to come back\nAnd then we'll start to see a global boom again from about twenty two thousand twenty three all the way into two thousand thirty six that'll be the next global boom the differences George\nIs that it will be concentrated as it has been this far but even more so in Asia and especially in India and south east Asia [noise] most developed countries a lot of Europe Japan and East Asia have continued bad demographics in the United states is kind of the best house and the bad neighborhood\nOr where our demographics are we have a strong millennial generation but not as strong as the baby boom so we'll\nWe'll be in the middle but yeah we can tell about when the economy will turn around and where it will be the strongest the other thing we the biggest Boston bubble burst already has been in commodities\nAnd things like oil and iron ore commodities are down Seventy percent it we're so far oil and iron ore eighty percent there's going to be another big commodity boom and bubble which will be driven by the emerging world and they're the biggest commodity producers and consumers they spend much more of their money and\nSo you can buy these metals and things like that everything from gold\nTo iron ore and and and copper and things like that and there'll be an incredible boom and again you just wait for them to go down first so yeah the next\nBut between now and two thousand twenty two twenty three is gonna be way more than a downside and after that the world starts to recover and again that's when you buy stuff into the only\nTo orange or does it real estate has a new factor this never had before because the baby boom was so large because older people when they die they are literally permanent sellers if you want to call it a real estate\nAnd more and more countries including the U.S today and massively in Japan\nAnd places like Germany there's more old people dying and selling homes than young people that the next generation coming in buying so\nWhen we adjust for that real estate is not going to come zooming back and a lot of countries like stocks will so and then of course the aging baby boom sectors like health care will do better than other sectors so\nIn our newsletter which by the way people can get on our free newsletter by just going to Harry Dent dot com and that's going to be a solution to be the next year that that it's going to be different sectors the next boom is not going to favor everything eighty three to two thousand and seven everything went

automobiles are tanks and everything we became a major exporter to Europe over that\nSo you know that goes both ways but wars tend to cause higher inflation\nWars disrupt things and and uh the great depression was followed by World War two the disruption around the world and that makes people angry as we're seeing now an even worse this time\nAnd and when things get scarce and there's a fixed pie countries tend to fight over things we've this trade war and we said this in his ear all our book\nCame out a year ago this trade war with China and ... and it's a global thing as well this is not just a short term thing and Jack Ma from LA Bob came out just a month ago and said this is going to take at least Twenty years to sort out\nThis is a major war between the leading to countries the U.S and China who's going to be king and that's why China China should be giving in more because Trump's right about this\nThat they need us or our trade is three times tilted towards them this is going to hurt them more but it's more important to them because they're the up and coming in there don't want to get in too much because they see this is a long term battle and they think longer term so [noise]\nSo I don't know if it's more a trade war but but they're certainly after this downturn coming out of this downturn [noise] the the potential for wars around the world will tend to grow\nAnd that's where I go to Peter and cotton wood Arizona did get things started with us I'm Peter\nHi hey thanks for taking my call this is great I'm sure they're going to be a bank holiday during the crash\nThat's an interesting question what do you think\nYeah yeah I mean that definitely tends to happen and and I think that's what happened to the great depression of course because people don't realize banks can lend up to ten times their reserves and guess what their reserves are ten percent of their deposits and whose money is that that's our money they're pledging now they also tend to have you know capital they raise up to about ten percent\nSo so they're they're at risk to but yes when when you get problem like this banking system will get in trouble especially when real estate goes down that we saw that in two thousand eight and nine forward\nAnd all of a sudden they don't have money now the new trick\nAnd then I'm I'm getting ready to go into a five ... city tour in Australia is the big concern there because their housing bubbles already starting to crack ahead of ours this time\nIs it banks in Cyprus just said well you know what we need money we're just going to wipe out of the the\nMore affluent accounts were just going to take you know ten twenty thirty forty fifty percent of their count and say look I'm Sorry we need this we're gonna take your deposits and we're kind of bird them into equity in our dying bank who wants equity in a dying bank\nSo this is in in in ... even in Australia that people are realizing\nThey're not supposed to do that but there's loopholes were in an emergency banks can do that so people have to worry you know you need to spread your money around I tell people all your excess money\nOther than you need to pay your bills should be in a brokerage account whether it's in a bank or a brokerage firm or an on line from I I prefer firms that are not into lending that's why I like a lot of the online trading firms\nHave happened in a brokerage account 'cause they can't borrow against that they can't swipe that but they can deposits in savings account so yes this can happen and people\nLost their deposits a lot of people there was a run on the banks this happens in in in in the magnitude of what I'm Talking about\nIs exactly what had happened doesn't happen in a normal recession like we've seen it started to happen in some

the Puerto Rican example a and I'm going to say this bluntly if I can too many Hispanics like black Americans vote democratic they will not give Republicans and conservatives the chance and and the same way that all all of these urban areas\nHave been struck dumb because of liberal\nDemocratic policies uh we're having them going to say this bluntly the non white people blacks and Hispanics they

E. R. dot com you\nThat I I Do think I mean this is going to have to happen a lot of rules are going to change just like banks may suddenly start swiping money out of more fluent accounts [noise]\nThey're going to have to have forgiveness these loans are going to have to be restructured all loans are going to have to be restructured hum except for the most sovereign like U.S Treasury bonds and that may not be but but\nThis is the key to going through this the countries that restructure their debt and we restructured massive amounts of private debt and the great depression it made a stronger coming out Japan never restructured any of their debt and they're in a coma economy forever even when they're next young generation\nIs come along so I I my bet is that they're going to come to point we're going to have to say no we have to allow restructuring of student loans there to owner as we went too far and that to me what happened the education establishment I'll even call it a mafia\nBasically overcharging had the greatest inflation next you know of any sector education even more than healthcare\nThey're on a run and win win that got too hard they say okay we can encourage student loans\nThen people can afford these higher prices we can keep our above all going this bubble has burst and and and too many students are never going to be able to pay off these loans so when you have excess loans it's better to admit it just like a drug addict\nAnd then change policies and restructure detox I call it the leveraging go on we're gonna have to forgive or restructure down these student loans however it happens if it makes it changing in the rulings yes I I Would say that's highly likely in the next couple of years\nInto thousand a year and I saw one way to bail out everything would be to give people like a hundred thousand dollars you know voucher to buy some good what do you think\nWell well here's a I don't like money printing except in emergencies like I think\nThey should have done money printing quantitative easing for the first year in two thousand I like they did just to make sure the banking system doesn't just melt down like it did rapidly and the great depression but to put it on a permanent\nQuantitative easing just perverts the entire system is bad but the second thing I always said if you're going to print money don't give it to the damn banks\nWho got us in trouble and did all this leverage and\nAnd the rivers and all this crazy stuff in the first place just sin if you know send period to to to get us out of the at least send them money to everyday people send them a check I wouldn't say a hundred thousand but if if they sent everybody at twenty five every household at twenty thousand dollar check\nThat would have done a lot better for the economy and then in that that would help banks because things wouldn't have been as bad for the economy but it would have helped people instead of the banking system this whole bailout this whole quantitative easing has only made Wall Street stronger\nOnly made the rich richer is only benefit of corporate including these tax cuts and has not benefited main steal\nThe reason why I wanted it as a volunteer as opposed to a check areas because I wanted them to be forced to spend that red line them you know right and\nThey don't spend it or ... you're right that that's much better way the point is to get every day people some relief and and to have them spend that money to stimulate the economy and then that helps that you know businesses and banks and everything but it should have gone to the people and not to the damn banks\nNext up we're going to hear in Port Huron in very good that you\nKnow hello there George and mass area that question you mentioned earlier about the bank and you can't just now but uh he taking the money I'm wiping my what about credit unions are they going to be doing the same thing or what's what's up with those\nOkay I I Would much rather have my money in a credit union than a than a money center bank\nBecause that's where all the leverage is been there was kind of opposite of the great depression a lot of people a lot a lot of the problems worse farms were over expanding\nAnd borrowing money and those were in more rural areas and that's where the trouble is and it was rural banks going under more than the money center by this is totally money center bank thing\nAnd and also when you do a bank if governments have to explode with money pal account if they're going to do for the more fluent towns and those going to be in the in the bigger money center banks so I'd much rather have my money and a credit union\nThan you know bank of America or Wells Fargo or or ... or city bank and stuff like that\nOkay let's take a call or two before we wrap things up with theory Dunn Hi Barbara North Carolina\n\nOh yeah okay thank you\nAnd I just think that's part of one of my question is why I asked\nA direct tonight at ... at one of my way around ... why oh why oh why oh hey wait a second line\nRight yup it's all about timing it\nAll that time what am I garden moment like I'm hearing what I've heard of it she gets answered my question what about the smaller amount so my Social Security income that much\nUm I don't have to worry about that so much as a as a larger account hold her is that what I understand\nYeah I mean if they're going to have to restructure so security there's certainly going to take the benefits of a larger accounts and more fluent people\nFirst I mean the everyday person is going to be more protected in whatever scenario\nAnd bank insurance agree that they can insured deposits and they can't insure them all that so what oh deposits are insured they can ensure everything if you have a major club but the smaller account it'd be spread out a few accounts and you have more money and your brokerage accounts which they can't get out\nYeah sure going to be less vulnerable and what happened in Cyprus it was a lot of rich Russians that had big accounting those were the biggest losers those were the ones they hit and of course\nWhen when things go bad people gonna hit foreign depositors more Iceland went down and basically all the foreign depositors and foreign loans and protected their own people so yes smaller accounts domestic accounts\nAre going to be safer but again\nI still say have as much as your money in a protected account and your name that is not just the general deposit they lend against those deposits in real estate loans\nAnd business loans go back there going against your deposits but if you have a brokerage account with your stocks or bonds or cash that\nThey can't they can't pledge\nDoses reserves and well that's a good thing

anomalous experiences visions pre cognitive dreams auto body experiences encounters with the message burying operations is well welcome to the program Dr many basis on coast to coast Dr welcome to the show I'm looking forward to this\nThanks for inviting me\nVery interesting that the somebody with your medical and psychiatric background would be so heavily involved in the paranormal and how did that all happened for you was it the near death experiences that started it\n[noise] well I think it was because I almost died so many times\nYou know when my book the borders for normal first came out many people ask me if the book was based on stories which my patients had told me that my aunt was always no not at all because whatever patient tells the doctor is confidential documents bound by the Hippocratic Oath\nWhich states that the doctor should not be Pete anything told by a sense and I don't so the material in my book was based entirely on my own personal experiences\nStories from my readers and somebody audiences and from family and friends and from I own extensive reading research into the paranormal in terms of why I had the experiences I think it is related to the fact that I had some close calls for that so many ... that [noise] um you know\nIt's been a lot of Libya tribute my both near death experience\n\nBut the um term near death experience you know it's coming back Dr vehement moody in Nineteen Seventy five for that's over forty years ago that's right now I think he estimated\nThat something like one thirty Americans that had a near death experience or know someone who has had one and that's a large group of people but it's an even larger group of people who have almost died but never were announced clinically dead and never had the typical near death experience\nBut when I look at how my close brushes with death effected me I see that I have some of the things after effects that Dr moody described in his patients who had a classic near death experience\n[noise] in other words I'm having had all these close calls that I tend to have a deeper appreciation of life and I I also have over my fear of dying and I have found get myself a shift from materialism into spirituality and any an increased need to find meaning and purpose in life\nWas that a pretty dramatic shift for you\nKnow not at all I I Would say was gradual\nThe first um couple the paranormal experiences I had I was quite young\nAnd I honestly I didn't think anything of them I just kind of ... the ... yeah I just thought well that was weird but I didn't tell anyone about them because I don't think anyone would believe me and in those days no one talked about those experiences because there was no rational way to explain them\nBut then as time went on and I got more and more of these experiences and then when I went\nI'm a life threatening illness and and came out on the other side thanks to a stem cell transplant from an anonymous donor\nOh jeez well\nYeah that was that was quite dramatic I'm Better at that point I felt like I Need to share what I've been going food because that would help other people\nIn the ... stem cell transplant so why do they let harvest stem cells from yourself\n[noise] [noise] well that's one way of doing it but the the um anonymous themselves don't know it's called in how Jeanette transplant mhm was more effective they actually found someone on the worldwide ... computer\nOr this worldwide um donor bank and they found his name on the computer and he was a perfect match for me\nAlthough super ... what was what was wrong if you want to get into that\nOh sure well I had leukemia ruins ... um\nYeah and I had it for many years well actually I had leukemia for sixteen years and I was in the hospital I had numerous um blood transfusions numerous courses of chemotherapy and then finally the doctor said you can't keep giving you a chemotherapy because it's doing tremendous damage to your body\nYou was it was still in remission\n[noise] well you have to be in the mission in order to receive a transplant so they gave me chemotherapy um and I was in remission but then I Would keep having relapses and that's why I eventually they gave me the transplant huh [noise] now is the person who gave me the transplant he was an anonymous donor that\nThe rule at the time was that after one year I was allowed to contact him if he agreed to contact them and I did read him just to thank him for his generosity and I found out that he was in the he's the ... was the name of the U.S navy [noise]\nAnd when his name came up on the computer he was stationed on an aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf wow [noise] so he was flown\nBack into the donors sent from Washington DC and the team from the city where I live flew down to Washington and took a sample of his themselves and then flew back to my city and that's what happened and that was eight years ago and I've been fine ever since\nThat if you still in touch with them just did that happen\nYes um I actually met him in in DC and we kept in touch and we've become friends\nThat's amazing you say your life\nHe did I can thank him enough he did save my life and it is\nHere altruism you know he said the way it came about was um [noise] they were having a donor drive and one of the bases where he was stationed and he just got in line with his buddies and all is required is their cheeks swab that's it\nYeah it just it takes time to get the DNA so that's when his name into the donor bang and then I'm ... years later my name came up on the computer and at that point he's even forgotten that he had agreed to be a donor [noise] but then once you know\nWe found out that he was a perfect match for me and he was flown back to the ... center in DC they gave him some injections to stimulate his bone marrow seafood produce more stem cells\nAnd they gave him these injections for five days and then he had produced enough themselves so they took a blood sample which contain to stem cells and that was what what was brought back to where I live\nCloser but yes we've become friends and I just saw not too long ago\nDr fact that you were dabbling so heavily into the psychic role has that help or hurt your psyche ask your practice\n[noise] well I tried to keep the two things separate I mean\nYou know in terms of the psychiatric patients generally they don't talk about paranormal experiences they have you know serious mental disorders that they need help with and that's why they come to see if the ... [noise]\nHowever since I had that experience in psychiatry I'm able to help people distinguish between what's his psychic experience and ... right\nRight and and and there's a big difference there\nWell absolutely there is a big difference\nI mean sometimes if a person the something or here's something they don't know what it is they think they're losing their mind but in fact these types of experiences are quite common\nYou know for example um if someone is believed that they've lost it I'm a spouse or a child quite often will be some type of post death contact with the deceased loved one\nSo let's say a widow might see her deceased has been in her bedroom at night and she might talk to him or she might feel his tax on her shoulder or something like that and these experiences are quite common in fact one study showed that up to fifty percent of people who've lost of of a loved one will have some type of post deaf\nContact with a loved one\nEven if a person has no belief in an afterlife and many of them don't I mean these these types of experiences are not related to religious beliefs are belief in an afterlife\nUm in in fact you know atheist agnostic have these experiences as well as religious people\nYou see that every one is like you and I I tend to believe you agree with you\nOK but uh when you said that what's the basis for what makes you say that\n[noise] well the thing is the the word psyche covers a lot of territory you know it includes things such as ESP or telepathy or pay cognitive beams and other things you talk to both types of decisions hundred voices and so on deathbed vision is near death experiences\nSo certain types of psychic experiences such as ESP\nUntil after the or extremely common and a lot of people have experienced that type of thing\nUm for example someone phones you and you're thinking about that person then you say oh you must be ... I was just thinking about\nYou right that's very common um and I think everyone has the ability if they're interested to nurture their intuition or their ESP or the ... the fence but a lot of people aren't interested in it as I said when I first had these experiences myself I just kind of brush them off I didn't think too much of them\nWas really only after I got sick and I start to think that maybe there was more to it than meets the eye\nWith with the psyche grown out there\nIn the ability to tap into it have you found that certain people are better at it than others\nYes definitely um well I think the most important thing is whether the person is interested in it and whether or not they are paying attention to it but the other thing I've noticed is that the second ability often runs in families\nSo there are ways to augment leprosy but in my case and in most people's cases it just happens spontaneously\nDo you have a lot of patients that have these abilities\n[noise] no I wouldn't say so\nAll right stay with us Dr we're going to take a quick break we'll be back with the ... more Dr ... is with us his book the borders of normal\nStudents ... the new version of the coast to coast am apple is now available\nFor Boeing and no enjoyed for not only listen live on demand anywhere anytime\n... dot com and downloaded today\nNews radio nine Twenty one ...\nIt's all a military service members volunteer to protect us in the most dangerous places around the world they step up and when they're severely ill or injured returning to their families is only the beginning of their long road\nAll the hospitals and doctors surgeries they need just to survive\nThey also deserve whatever they need to truly live\n... in home care in day to day help they need to ms ...\nFor a grateful nation [noise]\nTo step um find out how you can do your part\nSigned W.

about to death bed visions and your thoughts about that do you believe they're extremely common don't you\n[noise] that's right a lot of studies have shown that it it's very common for someone who's dying to see a deceased friend or relative\nUm that actually happened with my dad when he was in the hospital he saw his late sister he mentioned oh they don't tell you mentioned her name she's out in the hall and there was one study that was done in a hospice\nPatients and they found a lot of these patients I'm someone who's coming to take them and they called they didn't call them visions they called them visitors and as they got closer to death is is became more frequent\nSo sometimes people have these experiences have these dreams and they disregard them you know and I've heard of other cases like that too\nSo as you say these ... can be very powerful and and where does this where does this message come from that I bring up another subject which is sometimes people receive messages and dreams which aren't the cognitive\nAnd who's giving them the message\nChats the question like where's this message coming from you know we can we can speculate you know we can say it's coming from the unconscious oh we could say it's coming from something they've added or we can say it's coming from the spirit\nWorld [noise] you know but some of these\nMessages for example this woman I mentioned who had the dream that should be killed in a terrorist attack where would that be coming from that could've been her fear\nYou know um and maybe all incidents that somehow when something like that happens it seems to be more than a coincidence\nUnder there was a movie about to a group of people government people who tried to enter the dream state of other government to leaders\nTo to assassinate them and you know the wanted them to die of heart attacks and they were going to put fear into their dreams and stuff like that do you think that really might be going on many\nWell that reminds me of the collapse of the studies that I mentioned that were being conducted at my monitor these medical center in New York because I think people can be more susceptible to telepathy I don't know while they're dreaming while they're asleep I don't know to the point of\nGetting having to make someone have a heart attack I didn't know if that would be possible if that's ever been done\nWell who knows when people die in their sleep what caused right that's\nRight that's right because you know I sort of take the position that anything is possible you know and I think that's possible although we don't really know and that and how how did we know it's right you know um so yeah\nThat could be pretty remarkable\nMhm [noise] yeah I was also talking about messages in dreams 'cause I've also had that experience where I received a message but it wasn't um wasn't a pre cognitive gene was just a message and I didn't even know what to make of it that I remembered it just clear as day when I woke up\nThis is the message I got I I just saw these where it said this is a world of illusion\nAnd the biggest illusion is time\nDidn't Caesar's wife have a premonition about the\nIdes of march [noise] that's right in fact she dreamt the night before he was killed she dreamt that he was going to be assassinated\nShe begged him not to go to the Senate hate in order to please also with his favorite told Julius Caesar it'd be where the ides of march which is the fifteenth of march and he ... ignored his wife and he was killed so yeah that was a very strong premonition premonition is usually a warning\nHow many people don't act on their premonition stole maybe\nI'd say probably the majority\nI Would agree because I don't think people believe them they don't believe they're intuition and then they do the water should uh after the fact\nYeah exactly and how many times has that happened I Know\nThat said the majority of people don't pay attention to it because they they think well we live in a you know scientific rational society and we need to think of things rationally and they disregard things which could be dismissed as superstition is always the fear of being labeled superstitious\nThere was a a movie called let it ride with Richard ... was above horse racing yeah one of his friends apparently really understood who's gonna win the race but didn't back on that horse spent on something else and lost\nIn ... in the movie screaming at ground you knew you knew you knew that is a little like not acting on your permissions\nYeah for sure that is yeah and you wonder why I think it's fear I think people are I don't believe they don't believe it and also they were afraid of getting into something which appears irrational\n\nTell me a little bit about blind people in a overseas and things like that\nWell that that's very interesting story because\nThere have been reports of blind patients who've been blind since birth\nWho have another body experience during surgery\nAnd then when they recover from the anesthesia and they wake up to be able to tell the doctors nurses um what they saw and what they heard while they were out of their bodies there was one patient who is blind who when he returned to his body after the surgery was able to describe the color and the parent and on his\nDoctors tie and of course the doctor was astounded there was another case of a blind patients who left his body during surgery [noise] I think no she was a he was wasn't surgery he had a cardiac arrest and they took out his dentures\nAnd he left his body and he was observing everything that was going on and then when he when he recovered and they couldn't find where she put his dentures\nAnd he wanted his teeth back right yeah have you\nBack but then then they said I don't know I put them and he said well when I was out of my body I saw you put them in that door over there and she open that door and sure enough there\nThey were they were wow yeah it works it would work yeah\nWhat what have you learned many about all of this what do you think it is\n[noise] I think well I think that there's a spiritual component life I have to say that\nYou do I do and you don't think it's paranormal\nWell I think it's related you see I think it's ... I think it's paranormal and I think it's spiritual I mean there's certain words that are used to describe these experiences are these phenomena some people call them ... some people call them paranormal some people call them spiritual or anomalous\nOr mystical are mysterious Israel different words that have been used to describe the same event so I think paranormal events can have a spiritual component\nYeah but I'm not saying every paranormal event but some do of course it depends on the person who's having the experience how they want to interpret it or what they want to how they want to think about it\nDo you think science should do a better job investigating these things\nOh definitely I think it improves the quality of life for people to feel like there is something more out there that we don't just have to live our routine nine to five they you know day to day lives that there's something more that we don't really know about and I think it should be explored\nUp next when we come back with Dr many make this we're going to take phone calls your goals your stories above pretty cognitive dreams and so many other things\nYou were just talking about here on the coast to coast they find out more about tonight just log on to go to ... am Duncan\nNow I look back at this week in history this week in Eighteen forty five the United States Naval academy openings in

nothing approaching a popular ...\n[noise] well the thing is if someone has a vision for example or someone who's hearing voices certain qualities that would distinguish the fake from a psychotic experience for example if someone hears the voice\nI'm a psychotic hallucination tends to be very very frightening it's also very frequent it could be everyday auditory hallucinations could also be other things besides voices\nIt could be the sound of machinery and in\nFact it may be more than one voice too with the voices talking to each other about the person the voices might be a accusatory or threatening whereas I'm psychic hallucinations and can be infrequent\nThey may occur only once had price in a lifetime and they tend to be a reassuring and calming the other thing is with psychosis\nYou can't just look at when symptoms such as hearing the voice\nYou have to look at the whole person because psychosis is the major mental disorder which affects the person's ability to function in society whether the person as a student or whether they're going to work or within the family\nIf they if they're not able to function and if they have a lot of other than an aside from the ... for example the thought to ... or paranoid id Asian or you know feelings have ...\nThat you played talking but then this type of thing so that it's more than just one symptom that you need to make a diagnosis of psychosis\nCan you make a misdiagnosis is act conceivable\n[noise] yes in fact it has happened that is a psychologist that did it and experiment where he had a group of eight people including himself and he had each one of them go to a different emergency room and had different hospitals around the country and it tells the doctor in the emergency room that they were hearing voices\nAnd in each case the patients well they weren't patients they were actors pretending to be ...\nThat they were misdiagnosed as it gets ... they're admitted to the word they were given medication they didn't take medication and once they got the word the the patience to me that they were faking so they were able to fool the doctors but they weren't able to fool the other patients\nPatients knew how did they know\nWell because these people were otherwise normal the facts and the fact that they said they were hearing voices in terms of their appearance their behavior the conversation the way they were thinking the way they presented themselves everything else about them is completely normal so that's why I say you can make the diagnosis on the basis of a single symptom\nHow come to the doctors couldn't figure that out\nWell unfortunately you know sometimes doctors make mistakes\nWell that's true but but the patients that and\nI think because well the patients live with it they they know the illness so well\nThey know the symptoms and everything that's right All right let's take some\nCalls here for your Judy in the Ozarks in Missouri hey Judy go ahead\nThank you so much for taking my call waiting and waiting to talk to someone who knows a little bit about the brain are a lot about brain I have been a mistake in ... had visions all my life and
