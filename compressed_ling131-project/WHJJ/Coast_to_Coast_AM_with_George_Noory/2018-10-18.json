wasn't clear at the time what had caused the outage\nBut then about thirty to forty minutes later the website was restored our expert on the Internet luring Weinstein where the lord and what do you think happened\nYeah go Google isn't going to get into the technical details on the the the outage or actually lasted I guess around an hour and a half and that apparently it was a global outage which is pretty that's weird\nWell it's interesting because um as we know that the the actual video stream for the people from YouTube from different locations around the world that says about all coming from one place but there are centralized system of course so\nThe fact that this was a global out it's just that there was some kind of access related problems centrally the cause is in my own case it was actually the the website itself wouldn't even load properly if I were to YouTube dot com or you'd normally get all those little thumbnail\nIt would just get the shadows with typically appear before the video of they'll for themselves with that with the it wasn't actually get the video [laughter]\nSo uh it's an interesting interesting kind of situation apparently uh there were people tracking where everyone went when they couldn't access YouTube but I guess one of the porn sites got a big spike\nSpike in\nActivity there which I guess you'd expect some of the of some of the other other sites to [noise] um but but it's an interesting kind of thing and I'm sure the post mortem the post mortem review the Google conduct of internal you're going to be are going to be pretty interesting\nUses a sign of the times Lauren when the Internet goes down\nIt's well this is uh keeping my YouTube is enormous I mean the scale of YouTube is is that\nWhat you do we got our own coast

big as it is it is it the entire Internet and it is a very specialized kinds of applications [noise]\nSo I don't think that's necessarily says anything about the Internet at large but it does kind of

for thirty five thousand or a little walk away and look for something else\nWhy do you call the student loan situation a scam when nobody's forcing these kids to take these loans to go to school\nAnd I know what you're going to say but I got to ask you that\nThese agents that that compel them to do this loan rehabilitation get a paycheck for what what would that be sixteen thousand plus it's about twenty four thousand dollars goes directly into the pockets of the servicers\nPeace in the ... these agents or collection companies\n[noise] well yeah these agents are typically\nI'm large sort of

rehabilitate your loans it's a horrible idea a according to Moody's these defaulted loans that rehabilitate they default\nAgain three to four times and they just keep growing\nOh that's right yeah and

I should add so that's a ... something that makes this a predatory lending system by definition\nAre their predatory lending laws in the various states\nThere are there are state\nUse three laws in every state in the union and federal student loans are exempted from all of them there are also fared\nCollection practice laws federal um a truth in lending laws uh and\nThese again are restricted or completely remove a for the case of federal student loans\nWho came up with this scam [noise] well the genesis of this the genesis of\nThis really comes back to sort of a swamp the beltway cabal of bankers a which included a it started with a company called Sallie Mae which was a government sponsored entity back in the seventies [noise]\nUh and by the way one of your other guests who appears on your program frequently Catherine Austin fits yes\nServed on the board of Sallie Mae back when it was actually controlled by the government and she was there right at the nexus of when this company went from being a publicly sponsored enterprise to a holy private for profit enterprise and she can tell you many of the stories about people like Albert Lord\nA bill defender for in other executives at Sallie Mae who had no interest in serving the public and at every interest in making money off of this system [noise] so you can point to Sallie Mae and um they're very deserving also other groups like the consumer Bankers Association [noise]\nUh like many of the state run Gehring tours in the country um like USA Funds\nThese people were all in it for themselves and they saw an opportunity to make money and they did everything they could to make these loans as oppressive as possible and here we are twenty Thirty years later living a under the the fruits of their labor\nWhere do you recommend for a parent who use child has a ready to graduate from high school and they want to go to college\nWell the the only good advice that I can give up this point George is do not borrow and if you have to borrow\nDo not borrow from a student loan company so don't borrow federal student loans don't borrow private student loans from a bank you know that they were they were technically it is called a student loan\nBecause as soon as you call it a student loan federal or private you lose bankruptcy rights are and for federal loans you lose statute of limitations you lose fairly collection practices treatment lending a state use three laws all the all the rights all the consumer protections that I mentioned [noise]\nUm so really don't borrow is the best advice I can have but if you absolutely have to borrow go to a private bank guinea private line of credit [noise]\nUh and do it that way because at least then you'll have you know every consumer protection that exists for every other type\nOf loan whatever happened in the days of scholarship so they still being awarded to people\nWell you know church of course scholarships and grants are still out there but the colleges have been raising their prices so astonishingly much that you know no amount of ground serves even state funding cetera can keep up with their budgets um\nYou know I was just in Syracuse recently in the price to go to Syracuse University is now Seventy thousand dollars a year well I can guarantee you now you're I'd per year\nThat's tuition room board books um for a four year course for a four year college and by the way it no longer tapes for years to graduate George the average time to graduate from undergrad is now six point two year what happened well again\nThe colleges are sitting in the cat per seat vacant because there's this lending program standing behind the whole thing and the federal government and the other lenders are willing\nTo pile as much dead on the back to the students as possible the colleges have carte blanche to not only raise their prices but also really stream the students out and keep them in college for as long as they can possibly do it [noise]\nSo it's it's the time is getting longer the pre your costs is just exploding and that's why we're seeing these just insane stories where people are graduating with you know a million dollars in debt\nRight there was a story just recently we're losing a guy walked out of dental school with yeah a million dollars in student loans\nNo wonder if that's all uh the belt bills are so high\nThat's right you know and and this really hurts the broader economy when you have one point six trillion dollars in debt you know strapped onto our younger workers just out of college um have to charge a huge amount just to pay off that burden\nAnd you know we're seeing comments from people like Jamie ... Morgan Chase and William deadly at the New York Federal Reserve bank and many others are about how the student loan problem is\nReally affecting the broader economy I mean when you have Ninety million dollars in interest clicking off that's Ninety million dollars where people aren't buying homes cars they're not starting businesses scaling entrepreneurship uh it's really starting to be felt\nAll right we're going to check in with you with phone calls with Alan Collins when we come back\nIf you've got a student loan give us a call if you've got a question give us a call if you're an instructor at a university and you want to give us your feedback on that give us a call as well we'll be back in a moment with Ellen Collins in your phone calls right here on coast to coast to\nCoast insiders the new version of the coast to coast am app is now available for ... and now enjoyed ... listen live on demand anywhere any time we go to go to ... dot com and downloaded today\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\nThe weekend box office review [noise]\nIt was a repeat of last week's top to starting with venom repeating in first place were thirty six million down a better than expected fifty five percent from its opening weekend that Britain's Sunday total and one hundred and forty two million in the U.S easily topping it's estimated one hundred million dollar budget [noise]\nA star is born held onto the number two slot adding twenty million were terrible so far in Ninety four million that's almost triple it's estimated thirty six million dollar budget so it must be a big moneymaker for this through your old\nNewcomer first man opened in Thirty Ways with sixteen point five million paid also earned a good ... from first day audiences and is expected to finishes run in the Seventy five million dollar range a bit higher than it's estimated sixty million dollar budget [noise]\nI mean higher archive of thirty for thirty\nThe number four goose bumps to haunted Halloween started off in these in sixteen point two million rows and send them a score from audiences band small ... and landed in fifth place with nine million over the weekend to give it a total of fifty seven million so far\nAs your weekend box office review on hard radio [laughter]\nOur military service members volunteer to protect us in the most dangerous places around the world they them when they are severely ill or injure\n\n... traffic and whether the Youth Radio nine Twenty one ...\nYou waiting for\nEye on radio station [noise]\nDid he find ...

back to coast it goes ... with us we're going to take your calls as we talk about the student loans scam what was that Alan that made you get involved in this\n[noise] oh well I had a um I had student loans I have three reason engineering and hum\nI graduated and found myself unemployed underemployed for short amount of time [noise] uh and I tried everything I could to keep my loans in good stead through to ferment forbearance cetera\nUh but what I fell into and what a probably forty percent of everybody out there with student loans is falling into\nA is a lending system that actually want you to default and so they will lose your paperwork they will give you bad information they'll baffle em bamboozled you and compel your loans to default which is what happened to me and my loans very quickly doubled or tripled with penalties and interest and [noise]\nAnd so I started doing research and what I found was just astonishing uh I took my my ... my findings to first Fortune Magazine ah and then I wound up top story on sixty minutes\nA and this was a peace with the Leslie stall a piece for which Sallie Mae and the federal government refused to be interviewed I might add a and so it was sort of snowball from there I unfortunately I thought this was going to be maybe a two or three year project\nTo get you know justice on this matter a but here we are low and behold Thirteen Years later and Congress has not moved one inch and I'm hopeful that will change very near future because the numbers have become just so astonishing uh but you know we're going to need a lot of help from the people out there whose lives this is affecting\nWhy isn't Allen that people who have a rough credits\nOr have a a very difficult time to make payments\nSeemed to be the ones that get the short end of the stick and by that I mean a you've got these payday loan center outrageous and predatory a dinner gear marked for people who need some money and you know they're having a tough time you've got these student loans situations and one of the worst icy are these um\nSecondary car market a lenders who will finance people who really can't afford a car because they have to have a vehicle so they'll finance them with just what you said they want the default so what they'll do is\nThey'll say All right I Want five hundred dollars down you can buy this used car\nAnd so the person the poor person gives them the five hundred dollars keeps a car for a couple of months makes payments for a couple of months then defaults the car gets repossessed and they sell the car for the same amount of money if not the ... if not more\nAnd with financing and they do it all over again and they make more money on it\n[noise] yeah that's right you know that that's a great analogy George and you know I make a similar analogy off and I say you know student loans\nIt's like buying a car where you pick it out you buy it online and say you know look it's got great reviews you go and so you buy online you go to go to the dealership and you pick up the car and you're driving out of the dealership and all of a sudden you realize that the car has no brakes any wind up in the ditch\nAnd you go back to the dealership you're like hey guys you know the car has no brakes what's going on and they go well hey buddy you know what can we tell you you should read the manual because this car comes with no breaks you know uh and this in fact is really what's going on with student loans in particularly\nIs used as you rightly say for lower income people um\nYou know a ... what we're seeing particularly in past ten years or so is these sort of fly by night an expensive for profit colleges are marketing very heavily to um you know disadvantaged uh\nUnder privileged people\nUnder yeah under privileged people people who weren't born with a silver spoon in their mouth and they're getting a horrible sort of a nonsensical education is just a joke a and lo and behold they get saddled with the loans uh and this is rex their life um\nI mean they should be getting more interest rates better financing deals but because their credit shot and they don't have the ability to make the payments the way most people do they get the short end of the stick and that's very wrong\nYeah you know it's a it's a real cruel irony and just in general you know there are a means test for student loans in the first place so the only people the people that get student loans and it's about I mean let's be honest is about Seventy percent of everybody who goes to college winds up with student loans but still this is a a um a an economically needy group of people\nWho you know don't have a silver spoon in their mouth and\nHow cruelly ironic is that is these very people that the landing system was supposed to help\nUh and it's essentially wrecking their lives you know the default rate across all borrowers by my best estimates is over fifty percent\nAs crazy crazy what's what's the tuition like at Harvard or Yale\nA it's a it's on a par with the the number I mentioned for Syracuse earliest probably Seventy or Seventy thousand Seventy Seventy five thousand dollars a year and there are even more classes schools by the way\nUm but uh yeah the the ivy leagues are running you know they'll they'll be up at a hundred thousand per year within I'd say a couple three four\nYears I I should have pushed my kids into sports when they were younger so they get scholarships to go to university smart yeah that's right well\nYou know even scholarships really won't pay the freight anymore I mean the price even at state schools were seen annual cost of attendance of thirty plus thousand dollars a and you know the scholarships really have an increased\nUh on that scale and and so it's you know unless you get a full ride it's a very tough proposition to go to even a state school these days you know we're we're getting stories from people go to community college and wind up with you know fifty sixty thousand\nDollars apiece crazy so this has\nJust gotten unreal um this is not this is not your father's a college environment you know it used to be that you could pay for tuition by working a summer job or maybe a summer job and a part time job during college well\nYou know those days are long gone um the colleges have gotten so brazen with the amount that they charge a and I should say their own salaries as well it's it's just stupid vine\nJust go to Joe truck driving in Indiana that get us started Hey Joe go ahead\nGeorge good thank you [noise] I got good news for you too man a Trump rally over there and a lot of the other day yeah there was a big sign they throw support sealed\nAnd he left right after the whole ...\n[laughter]\nI Love it but uh anyway I I I wanted to drive a little bit of traits will do a ... a former company I used to work or I got on egg wildly\nWhen a company went under the owners of the night and a private plane crashed on a mission to several years ago probably about seven years now you know and it was a sad time but ah pretty much longer and they laid everybody off\nAnd I was one of those people so I ended up her job over here and I found one but they wouldn't even let me take a lousy fast or as I didn't have that little piece of paper saying to undo what I'll do\nWell and I think also you know\nYou probably in more and more experienced than most people\nYeah and I looked at the local schools they were to our knowledge or oh I I think it was about two hours\nJust on while they're you know their way\nSo I ended up going out and I spent thousands of dollars on uh\nIt's a little are learning to drive semi thrive\nAnd then I felt like I got shafted on those I found out that I could have done it for about half the price now they've been\nLet's get your reaction to this is Ellen what do you think a trade schools\nWell you know even trade schools are participating in the student loan program these days and so the prices of trade schools are getting jacked through the roof or as well you know when you have this landing system stand behind these schools\nYou know they can charge almost what they want because there's all this quote unquote free money out there and so for guys that want to pay out of pocket you know what are they supposed to do they can't compete with that uh and it's just a travesty it's\nIt's really shutting more people out of getting an education even at even provoke Texan other trade schools\nAre as it is you know allowing them to actually go to college which was the intent of the lending program in the first place\nTo go to Gordon sorry to hear the Gordon and Lakeland, Florida have already go ahead\nHey thank you for taking my call 'em I Want to publicly think Allen he the one pointed out to me\nThey're the lack of bankruptcy protections encourages predatory lending um and of course a tuition inflation I I already knew that the more you subsidize the loans especially the taxpayer on um it's gonna crash the dollar by the way because almost ten percent of total debt is college dead\nOK I already knew developing at ... but now there's one thing they don't want to mention and that is the ... I'm a conservative everyone knows that I'm the guy that almost won I lost a forty three\nThat's right show at the end of the twenty five years you get a tax bill which probably equals or probably even

it was bankers that set up the office of federal student aid for and and currently run the federal student loan program these are people these are executives from Sallie Mae and many other student loan companies that that are running the place now so\nThey have no public a benefit a inspiration they jettison all pretense of actually looking out for the students are many many years ago\nEllen

George it's pleasure to speak with you on your way I loved your reading of upgrade Allan Poe's tell tell\nHuh that job thank you and I hope we hear more of it before Halloween that point though I'm\nA very interesting I've I've just had a my loans and all or a little over a decade maybe Fifteen Years and they fell off my credit report and lo and behold the same way this is just last week I got a letter from a company called central research L L C\nAnd hope you don't mind me mentioning mentioning them in particular a but their information is a hundred percent correct the principal was sixty four hundred and some change there's you know they're listening a breakdown of all of the costs but I've heard\nAnd I was wondering what advice you can give me do I try to negotiate directly with the deal he tried to negotiate with these people I mean there's something like four thousand dollars in interest and also of the\nSounds like another scam Ellen what do you think\nRight I mean first of all I Would I Would\nNever deal with a third party collection company you know unfortunately I don't have any great advice for defaulted borrowers because they're truly is known to give other than helping\nFight for age are twenty three sixty six and getting out of bankruptcy writes back so that they can't steal from is legally a but certainly don't deal with third third party collection companies\nI'm the owner of you're alone is probably either a a guarantor or the department of education at this late date I suspect it's probably the department of education [noise]\nSo I mean if you can make an offer to them of a hundred and twenty percent\nOf the lake it alone he'll take it all the you know that's something you can do but certainly dealing with a very close up you know like like what you describe how did they get\nThe information Allen lucky said they had everything down to the penny how did they find this or a public start clearing house that has all these things out there\nNo more than likely they are subcontractors to either a guarantor or maybe directly to the federal government itself so the information they have is good\nUm but I can tell you that dealing with them is only going to add to whatever price you wind up paying\nSo I definitely recommend I'm getting at the bottom of if you if you want to negotiate flying the owner of the note rather than these third party collection companies because they're only going to cost onto the process\nBy a friend that had alone with a company that went bankrupt you never heard from them again\nWell you have to be very careful these are zombie loans there are no statute of limitations for these loans so you may think alone went away maybe it went off your credit report like this gentleman but I'm telling you they will come back from the dead [laughter] and\nMy ... down the line at least expect it\nThat's right yeah they they are waiting in the wings to to balance a like a shark or whatever [noise] um that's the thing about not having such limitations these things can follow you literally to the grave [noise]\nWell what you need to do is just say send me a copy of my loan I'd be glad to talk with you and you know what Ninety percent of the time I bet they don't have ...\nYeah that's right I'm I'm guessing that something like fifty percent typically for order loans is probably even higher than that they do not have the original sign\nProblem [laughter] not at all Allen once again thank you for the information truly enjoyed it off next aliens and the Pentagon whole war what's that all of

days\nWhere do we last see each other contacted the desert we were there ...\nAnd now we're back to your life event in which we\nThat was right around that same period yeah yeah that was fun you did a great job they're\nGreat job indeed aliens at the Pentagon I Love this title tell me more\nEssentially it is my new documentary that I put out to tell the story or taken\nCredit gram but you're right that story and and really to try one human treat it as best as I can\nSee the story of the U.S government don't want any relationship with this phenomenon watch a decade now\nLots of people have been talking about the Pentagon the CIA what's been going on there these new revelations that keep coming out Mick what do you think of them\nThey are hearing this town that they have been the biggest single wherever they needed a UFO community I think that the story that I think come\nAnd I would say this is the classification and release the British Government files but the revelation that often decades have to know the U.S government did have a new effort right Graham often when it was run by a secretive intelligence\nAgency and they feel that the day I hear you\nFor years they said no no since project to close down we haven't been doing this this knowing ... there were no investigations and of course\nThey were and that's what I really focus on in in the new film aliens at the end again to try\nTo train on tangle the numerous threats to the story and there are numerous threats I mean we've we've seen the videos we've seen the talk of\nOf mistreatment polls there all the different players involved and maybe we'll get into some of this the robot big yellow a Senator Harry Reid told him to long I mean you couldn't make this stuff up\nNo you you can't make it up and how do you track all this stuff is coming from all different directions these days\nI think the answer that one is is very cautiously and very carefully and and I absolutely in meticulous detail because I think the problem with this story in one sense for years\nPeople have said the problem is that particularly with the gal them we have two little information about what's\nGoing on with the aid kit story with with these revelations um we must have too much information and I think the public\nI mean it's it's just about a case for the deep specialists or is it difficult for them but for the public eye I think it's just that confusing man if you think back to when the New York times\nWhen they are they a landmark story on this on\nDecember sixteenth last year and then the the three videos came out will to first than a\nThan a third one but now with the public has been absolutely bombarded there thinking yeah well this the videos and then there's this won't strong guy and then this this ... millionaire businessman and and struggling\nTo see how it all fits together and so that's that's what I've tried to do to take a step back and and give people an overview of this from my incite a perspective of having run a similar program in the u._k.\nDo me a little bit more about the film we're getting a lot into it of course tonight Pentagon tell us specifically about\nWell I took a long on on on this one and it was quite a diversion for me usually I I just sit in the interview seats and then you've done this of course civilian times yourself you know you said in the ... said a direct tucked kind of\nTalks to you and you spend a couple of hours and\nAnd also the question is this when you see the final product sometimes he's saying well well you know I co edited down to a few soundbites and I wish they'd put that but at the end and I wish they'd taken it out and of course I'm not sure I Would have told the story like that\nSo they only ends at the Pentagon and what I did this I teamed up with Warren ... oil from reality films and we essentially I had the the idea that I Would ... the thing so scripted the entire movie that the I wrote a million and a half thousand would I think the laws\nScript for this and unfold in that way I have absolute control of this\nAnd then literally I went into a recording studio you know you had it all ... headphones on and I knew right to it the whole thing and and then I sat down in front of a camera and did did parts of it too to Cameron in that way\nIn that way although there is a direct to who's done a brilliant job of putting it all together I'm Mike along I but I was very much in the driving see having done the script and and in that sense\nWhen we look at the final pro dog no one can while I Can't say gosh this is somehow didn't turn out the way I wanted it because I had my fingerprints on it from from start to finish and that's a departure\nFor me it's a completely new role to me I mean there are people of course who are used\nTo this sort of thing or people like Jeremy coal bellicose who just made a a a great movie but um you know I I it was a departure for me so it took me to some interesting new territory\nWhat are you hoping to accomplish with the\nFirst lady\nI as I say really to try to go through some of the the confusion about what's been going on just how the complete story from\nFrom start to finish but another thing that I've I've tried to do this I I think we probably discussed this before but one of the big problems I think that that this field\nHas is it we know young people are interested in in the subject but they don't go to many conferences and and you know it is difficult to engage with them\nSo by putting this out as video on demand we go ahead on tool of platforms\nThat the young people the watch these things on when they stream as many people do these days\nSo it's on Amazon and iTunes and Google Play and food and video and all those sorts of things so the the aim was to take their subjects not not just to the conventional UFO conference crowd\nBut but to young people and and another thing is you know it's been a year since combed along ... had his press conference where\nHe\nGot together with the ... people um\nAnd it's been nearly a year of course since the New York times\nWhen the story I I did ... uh you know in some ways the story I think has pulled down a little bit so they ... at the Pentagon I Wonder we ignite the some ... by wearing absolutely belongs center stage and under the spotlight\nAnd how is this organization Dewey ... nowadays like like you said I I'm beginning to feel as if the momentum is waning what do you think\nThat when when you say the organization um E. E. T. I. P. O. right\nUm well that's very interesting question and the answer is no one knows because in in all of this\nThe U.S government has said what he says in these sorts of situations only as little as possible and we we really have very few pieces of the puzzle\nFrom the government itself which is is pretty much profit because we don't frankly we don't even know whether a tip is still an ongoing project\nI think people like Lou Elizondo ran it of course say yes it is it still has its mission it's still continues he of course all though he's resigned from the Pentagon and still has has a lot of contacts and friends that he says it's still going\nNow other people I think have disputed that and certainly we have been told that the\nSee adaptation of RL Stein the love of children's harsh series were too young friends find a magic book that brings a bench ... quest dummy alive\nI got a job in a\nBad time to be ... gathers seven strangers each with the secret to bury they meet to Lake Tahoe is el Roy yeah a rundown hotel with a dark path\nOver the course of one fateful night everyone will have one last shot redemption before everything goes to hell Jeff Bridges Dakota Johnson\nLast News I'm Carmen Roberts anew Fox poll shows if the election were held today the house would likely flip to democratic control\nAt a big part of the reason is women are poll shows likely female voters support the Democratic candidates by Eighteen points and even more concerning for Republicans is a shift over the past two years on\nHis choice Gallagher experts say that shift happened because Republicans positions around a favor including trying to get rid of Obamacare residents along Florida's panhandle slowly returned to see the devastation from hurricane Michel Bras say for\nAbout a hundred and twenty thousand customers in Florida still without power including more than half of bay county where we are the water started to run but they have a boil order in effect\nThe schools are still closed here\nFox has wrecked lemons salt in Panama City this is Fox News [noise]\nYour storm gene ten forecast powered by Dunkin' Donuts try any Dunkin' iced coffee only two dollars from two to six PM gusty and cold force early Thursday morning a little less wind in the afternoon but still chilly ice in the upper forties under a mostly sunny sky clarity cold friday morning up or twenties and thirties to start sunshine mile during the afternoon behind you're sixty degrees\nMostly cloudy Saturday chance for a few showers mainly in the morning I'm storm team tend to eat or all just marks or all all news radio nine twenty and one oh four seven at them\nLot on the phone ringing\nNo one ever heard some of 'em\nDo was to\nIn the sky\nSaw\nWho was\nWho was the\nShow me sweet fragrance\nHeard singing\nLive from the gateway to the west coast to coast am George Norris we'll be back with\nMore with the pope and we'll take calls next door with the pope as we talk about his work aliens at the Pentagon fascinating DVD fascinating indeed colonel multi dot com are approaching eighty thousand members now\nShow such just truly remarkable\nSo if you haven't signed up for it yet it's free to sign up just go to the website colonel date dot com and meet people who get you ... the dot com that here's something that\nWill help make you look a little more healthier\nScience has come a long way in helping us look younger now we have an amazing product to give you near instant results with bags into your eyes fine line wrinkle proceed and port it's called instantly aids look and\nLet the two minutes the dramatic changes to your look no needle no pain instantly age ... is a cream applied lightly and allowed to dry look younger and intern feel younger and do it in a minute even doctors agree instantly ageless works like this from the Rachel ratio\nBoard certified dermatologist Dr ... and her ... her ... her ... her own home but actually in Iran acknowledging ... off I don't get the wallet chronic bladder\nAnd we're going to buy a product there are more than ... you know go back\nIt on silicon really landmark I made earlier\nAnd then she went off to try products\nCalled instantly age where yeah instantly you could say a different saving the cameramen were like wow look at the different yeah I definitely use this\nProduct [noise] fine\nAnd it was actually a very dramatic when she sat right\nInstantly ageless today go to our exclusive website H.
