this coming march ... he launched top condition he's also the biggest killer decided to stop pecking kinda boring it was just incredible feeling set on the ... around my house when I have the extra auditor and two and a half months later\nAnd so the the old game is is that they don't want us to know that they're they're they want us to think that this is our own feelings our own thoughts and some of it is all of the violence author is not caused by demonic spirits and negative spirits\nAre but certainly there are there to amplify and right now everybody's got a target on their back everybody\nHow did they possess on and they take over somebody's body\nThey work on them for on people for a while you can leave these things happen over a period of time people who are depressed people who move into a home a and there's\nA lot of negative emotional energy drawing or something I practice something called modern actresses and and that is that came out of the idea when I started going into people's homes I I found out many years ago that ... homes because people have lived in there to generate both positive and negative emotional energy is\nWhich are unseen but we feel ... and ... it accumulates in the environment and demonic spirits actually feel stronger and become stronger and these kinds of environments and so do negative\nSpirits and so they are uh attack people and homes we don't take care of our homes we\nClean them wash windows when you move into a new place the carpets paint everything but we don't clean the atmospheres and so essentially were living in other people's emotional energies\nAnd so to monitor spirit's just play on that\nAnd they come into the our environments\nAnd generate huge amounts of energy that is negative and the air thickens with emotional energy especially negative energy at thickens and so it's easier to transmit negative emotional energy hatred\nThose kinds of negative thoughts and emotional feelings when the air is thick with emotional energy and so I get calls all the time from people who you know say hey I just moved into this new home apartment or whatever and doesn't feel right\nI don't know why but you know the kids are crying the dogs are barking in a certain area or we're just getting into more arguments why is this happening and so modern extra citizen deals with the idea of that first\nThe negative emotional energy has to be removed by somebody like me from\nThe atmosphere of the home that makes the spirit weaker than I deal with a negative spirit\nOr that's the second thing that I Do that's modern exercises difference from traditional actresses and in that I don't always go after the spirit first sometimes I cleared the atmosphere to make them weaker and then I attack the negative spirits\nAnd you're not you're not ... you're not a priest does that affect what you do\nI Would not say that I'm not a priest I Would say that I'm an independent priest say Sean priest exercises\nI don't belong to any particular religion because I work with people from all different religions or no religious at all people call me who are ignored\nStick if if everybody calls me and that's the thing you know you don't have to belong to a particular church to call me and a half of your home cleared\nAnd these days I Do it by distance as well because when I was going through homes and going strictly in person and work for the Internet ever came about\nUm I wasn't touching anything anyways personal clarion wasn't touching anybody any ways really it's not necessary\nThere's no such thing as as a\nDistance on a non physical level doesn't matter\nAs long as you have focused each one of us is a complete individual and so anybody can be cleared from anywhere you know how to do it and it it it has to be done you know we we moved into apartments like I said and there's lots of emotional energy from maybe people living there\nFor Twenty years forty years a hundred years ending on where people are from around the world it builds up it accumulates and spirits need to be\nDealt with you know times are already in the homes for the times that come into the home they sense of family that having a problem\nBecause of emotional energy in our living environment and they're ripe for attack and so it's it's best to call maybe a professional but have it cleared out one and I then I teach people how to\nMaintain the clarity of their bodies are energy fields\nAnd also how to maintain the clarity of their living environment's so it's kind of like having your carpet cleaner come in first and then you can simply queen her own carpet once that's done\nSo it really is something we all can do to a certain extent and something I think we all should do I'm not going to be around forever and certainly there are great exorcist and every religion I'm not the only one\nThat are qualified extra systems just about every religion\nBut the ... but they don't work for people and other religions I get that all the time you know that I get people call up and say well like I called you know local parish even though I'm not no I don't belong that religion I'm not Catholic and they won't come over and help me\nI Hope everybody so I that's why I don't belong to any religion but I remember doing this kind of work and has lives um I have deep contacts with higher spirits\nAre also this universe is filled with stars and around those stars are planets and there are the universe as I said before on on one of my appearances universe is teeming with life you asked me that question you have\nTo know do do you go into these ... what's a crucifix at all no you don't do that no\nBut when I'm working a with Christians which haunt me all the time I'm even evangelical Christians have you know it they need help to everybody\nKnew everybody needs help hold on for more at the ah we're coming up to the top of the hour we're going to come back we'll talk more Jeffries website stark clear dot com his

unfortunately is a great portion of the population and so they will attack people who have mental issues physical brain problems\nA depression anger issues unhappiness a overconfidence all sorts of things that are going on and so it does happen and and we have to watch out for that and and so ah demonic spirits\nAre experts at reaching across that dividing line\nAnd being able to reach into the physical realm and affect people when the wind is right usually meaning that there is emotional energy in the atmosphere or a person is feeling weak they're not protecting themselves properly\nAnd they can reach across and damage a person physically and they can cause even something like that usually what happens is it's not so much of an immediate death but actually\nBeen working on them for a long time and they can cause physical injuries even happened to me once you know I I woke up\nOne morning I was getting dressed in my office\nMy girlfriend was asleep at the time\nAnd I was getting up and ready to work out doing what I Do here and all of a sudden\nDemonic spirit appeared behind me I knew I could feel its power suddenly a light shot out from it\nMe right in the back and it caused me to have a centrally a pulled muscle I actually had to go you know get in my car and drive to the hospital and you know I haven't looked at in a you know get some light medication for it because it the demonic spirit had pulled muscle so it can happen to me and I'm good at protecting myself\nSo all the people out there who are not protecting themselves which is the you know most of the population of our planet are very susceptible to attack\nAnd it can be physical because demonic spirits studying how to do these things the non physical universe having the other side whatever you want to call it which is a wonderful place but they also have dark realm was in her negative\nVery negative what we might call help and an essentially that is very connected to the physical realm I think of the physical realm as something like the crust of the bread and heaven and the other side being the inside the bread itself which is much larger\nLet's go next to the gym in Portland, Oregon while we have some time here and Jim go ahead\nWell home polish on my question is is it possible for one of these evil spirits to quit being evil or you know a good trip pan\nTurtle I gotta go to the other side gets off drugs\nSo many psychics back in the Nineteen nineties asked me and said hey Jeffrey as long as you're doing extra citizens and teaching people how to protect themselves why don't you help spirits and I said when I say no I Am not a spirit psychologist\nUh it's kind of like if somebody calls and your window and wants to steal your stereo or worse you don't sit them down on the couch and say look we need to talk about why you steal things it's not my job\nYou don't have time for spirits out there that actually are very good at trying to help negative spirits demonic spirits are homeless but the idea of negative spirit's just negative people who are dead\nDoing negative things and trying to get them to look at themselves and see what they're doing but it's not my job and people who hire me I worked for them\nMy job is to get those things out of their home get negative energy out of their home out of their bodies energy fields I don't have time to do it and if they're not going to listen to me anyway\nThey're they don't have to there's going to go someplace else they're just not going to do that anymore the physical criminals going to sit there on the couch is that he or she is going to get up and walk out the door back out the window I I just don't have the time\nI have to immediately focus on getting rid of the emotional energy in the person's energy field of the average person\nNot everybody's everybody's possessed or anything we just have negative energy issues and also getting if there's some kind of negative spirit attack but not necessarily living in the house they could just be going from house to house every night or apartment to apartment or condo condo or Republican pub whatever and getting them out of their fast\nAnd making it work so the family or the individual is safe this is my main concern not dealing with a negative spirit's there are\nMillions and millions of spirits out there you don't just sit aren't clouds or walk the streets of gold actually do things and one of the things they do is work for higher spirits and help other spirits look at themselves and stop doing what they're doing if they don't there are other measures that we can take\nYour every are you glad you have this ability disability to see demons to maybe even get removed them\nGeorge I am I was born with it and at first it was really scary because when I reported it the teachers you know I'm seeing these spirits and you know I'm\nA mom so that could you know you know tell her when my grandmother my grandmother was going to call and you know two days and all those kinds of stuff at first it was real scary but actually I I started as I went along in my life I started and and I'm fifty nine now I started to remember doing these kinds of things in past lives helping people\nThat to me is the greatest gift um I could ever be given is the ability to help people it's dangerous work but the idea is is that once I teach people how to protect themselves they can go off and and not be so susceptible they can go to work and not come home so drained\nAnd I bet they really appreciate you while they love it\nYou know and it it's just great to hear them say hey thanks Jeffrey but you know\nThe real the real reward is them feeling better that's what it's all about me\nSure is Jeffrey ... would you please\n... you can find everything you want

I didn't I didn't know when I was dreamed that it was a dream and the wife of a loose a tree but\nAfterwards I woke up right after and so sure enough that was only a dream but what I'm curious about is\nSomebody like Dr Ford in the area of psychology and whatnot I Would would not be surprised at all but she has stayed and consuming news drugs\nWe don't we don't know that\nI don't know but but what I'm saying is that it could very well be that she instead of what this young man had with a with a well he can dream\nFruit she hers was more like ... bar that you can read on 'em\nNo you're you're absolutely right but that's that's something that nobody asked either one of them\nIf they were on the mood altering drugs I don't believe everything I ... I've seen in the in that case\nThat never came up but I'm sure that's a possibility or even though we don't know for sure what it probably happened key thank you for that but we've got open line calls let's go next to Jason in Bowling Green Kentucky west of the Rockies Hi Jason\nDoing Joan okay where you are\nI'm engaged in ... um I had a I'm well thank you and I couldn't believe it I saw before I had a I had done a little ... ... and I had gotten to read the Bible a little bit you know and um and I was in a bone in my life where I didn't really know\nIf it was real or if the devils Israel all this you know when I started reading the Bible and then I'm\nGoing back to the point when I was out of jail will never been a a ... and I was like ... if you know your real angel whenever I engage where you go you know show me because I Would like to know I Would like to believe All right\nSo uh it's probably ... ... at first nothing really happened except until about a week later then what happened to me and I\nI started thinking these little things like with people like a Beagle like these little spirits and stuff\nAnd I'm a well I I think this one guy had three of them right and it seemed like everybody and he had frenzy everything he did he touch must go I mean you have a one my ... and you know what I'm saying in and then I think it's one camp he didn't have none okay\nNow these kids that you know you go oh that's a glass of water without knocking over some breaking it it's something told me that he was going to get an angel [laughter] but he just didn't have one at the time\nAnd I'm leaving it was kind of be just to show me that you know how it works warning or no men who I bought the church in a ...\nI tell my uncle about it and he told me oh you know you go to church you know and I'm so we go to church but why would they church I won't eat them and I started the ... will will be angels like\nIn ... on the church all over the place\nAll of them around it you know a new like there was a state of behind the ...

was in their right hand lane and she split the difference between us and she turned her whale and I keep on oh God I always here here's the funny thing George\nI. T. bones like called the police and I called the fire engine and all that because I was sure I killed or passenger oh my God yeah well ...\n[laughter] we call the sheriff we called the police and they were on their way and the fire trucks showed up in the car took off\nHe took office ... yes it took off the trail and parts all they catch him in\nThe ... fire engine showed up says where they went down the road fall that far\nWhy would they take off unless they were hiding something probably using drugs or something yeah how are they stole a car\n... car was pretty torn up to begin with but I couldn't believe that that ... that the lady just moved here and went down their own\nThat's a that's a great story tough thanks appreciate that ... let's go to Angela in Fairfield, Ohio hello Angela\nMorning jarred Maureen are taking my call my pleasure thank you\nI was listening to Tucker Carlson of the Fox news channel ... um\n[noise] last night and he had a far left liberal female guest on that's had a group of evil which is we're going to get together\nAfter capital of New York this month and I don't remember that day they did give a date\nAnd I don't remember I don't have a computer to check it out but anyway they're going to put a hack on justice Brett Kavanaugh yeah my son\nI Would like to ask that good which is the listening right now to cast a spell to block the heck\nNot a bad idea the guy's been sworn in he's our justice let's give them a chance to do what he does\nI agree one hundred percent and I listen to to both of them and that lady came across as I'm mentally and balanced to me um\nBut she was and I both seem to be telling the truth and\nHer face her hair kept falling in her face she just flipped the shadow old and I I'm you know she just I I think she has a a mental problem\nWell we don't know that but uh you know they both came across as telling the truth they didn't come across as bad people and it was just a horrible situation though just horrible\nAnd mixed up with someone else\nThat could be that could very well be a war you know ... years if he did anything if he did anything he should have said look\nI was Seventeen years old and I was with my buddies and I didn't do anything bad I just you know was too aggressive and I'm Sorry if he did but he didn't you know he said he did not final Texan tweet for the night what do we have ...\nDo you think Kevin I read that story which is oh I'm sure he somebody's got it to him [laughter]\nProbably uh this one from Justin in Fort Myers Florida beat this when George ... a year and a half ago I was in the bank and it got robbed well now the manager had a gun and disarmed the robber now that was something I Can't believe I saw\nThe manager had a gun in disarmed or they didn't have a security guard is already taking doesn't say that but he's ... that's pretty risky though for the manager oh yeah number one what they always say let them take the money the banks insured\nKnow don't ... you know confront them somebody could get shot you might have had a good opportunity and ticket you know let them go you catch them later you get their pictures on video everybody knows who's everybody is now\nBut you're never there I mean he could on his back to the could've been a lot of things\nMy point is that if you're going to pull a gun like that it's very dangerous people could have been shot innocent people let 'em go\nIf a guy was robbing a bank you knew or in their view run in the store some guy comes in with a gun\nAnd says you know give me the money you open it up give them the money and wish them well I agree but if he turns his back on you jump on now know what do you mean turn is back well because we don't know we weren't in there so we don't know what the circumstances were and what if he's got another guy in there hiding or something and you're in trouble you know okay\nThanks Tom next up Barbara Los Angeles welcome to the show hey barb what's up\nMan
