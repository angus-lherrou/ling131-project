I Want to hear what the authorities have to say about this\nAnd I don't want to jump to conclusions because it could be a left wing conspirator doing them is to try to make Republicans look bad but on the surface it looks like and I know everybody's saying you know Trump and his rhetoric has made\nYou know things he he's created an environment so somebody would be induced to do this you don't know that you don't know that we need to wait\nAnd get the official verdict\nFrom our authorities in the intelligence communities in the United states and then the American people can chew on it but bottom line you and me both know that the rhetoric in this country I'm Talking about the grass roots level I'm not talking about leadership because these guys have always been you know at one another stroked\nBut we have to understand that at the grassroots level\nAmerica is best when we can debate ideas\nVigorously debate these ideas and then you know come up with a viable solution to whatever problem that we're facing to try to assassinate former presidents and leaders in government\nIs not the way to solve this problem and whoever did that whoever did it they're not\nBenefiting this country they're hurting the United states of America and George I'm so glad you guys let me way on the way in on this because I Love my country I Love it with all my heart I told you once on this air\nThat would get my life for the United states of America and I and I will but George\nThis right here it's got to come to an end hopefully this a wakeup call for all of us for all of us to realize that if you're a Republican don't look at a Democrat is your enemy if you're a Democrat don't look at the Republican as your enemy as an opponent yes but not an enemy\nWe're all on the same\nTeam and the media not not coast to coast but the media has definitely because George you giving everybody a platform you giving everybody a platform and you've been reasonable you've been honest I've heard your commercials saying listen you know just because I let a person to say what he wants to say don't think that I'm On one side or the other\nAnd that's a proper and healthy way to look at it but George\nThe media has exacerbated this problem I Do believe that the media bears as you know a little culpability in this we've got to stop demonizing\nAnd looking at one another as we are enemies were all on the same team the only people that are clapping than I our our adversaries overseas\nA note on and the individual or the group that sent these packages exactly George\nTed Kaczynski the Unabomber killed three people injured twenty three others he was caught because his manifesto was publicly let go in his brother recognized it as Ted Kaczynski he's turned him into the FBI\nAre we going to happen hopefully some kind of a person because I'm convinced Andre that one person always tells another person somebody knows something about who sent these packages out maybe they'll go to the public that\nThis is a conspiracy I don't think that this conspiracy will hold wax too much longer\nYou cannot have a conspiracy like this and everybody keep their some keeps their mouth shut I think that if this is a conspiracy we will get a resolution to this we'll find out the truth a whole lot faster than if this is one lone but I Am convinced\nIn our law enforcement uh individuals and are individuals and institutions in in the intelligence community entire US intelligence apparatus they will get to the bottom of this and\nWho ever did this whether it was somebody on the left or to somebody on the right because I Will say again I Will say again because I Know you've got people on the right thing this could be a false flag it'd\nBe somebody on the left that did this and you got most of the media saying that President Trump still this weight shut up wait let the intelligence officials do their jobs then wants their job is completed\nAnd they've determined who've done this then we can begin as a nation to try to put the pieces back together and come together as one\nCountry we are the United states of America\nYou know every group has you know had their time to be stepped on that's just the weight empires are established and America is an empire and people are going to get stuff done but\nYou have to wait and do things proper in order I'm thinking about the Tuskegee Airman right now who President Roosevelt said well they can't fly on a piece for the one less thing but they flew it and they flew most six more successfully and they protected more bombers than anybody in front\nOf they sure did in ... in when they landed white pilots went up to them and hugged them\nExactly George exactly you know we all want to contribute to the greatness of America and we're on a good path right now let this path continue unless stop this rhetoric\nThat drives us apart and and I'm not talking about Trump I'm Talking about individuals the guy the gas station your

are certainly a short period of time we're going to find out who is behind this some of these questions are are going to start to be possible\nAt least you'll find out about a minute left our optics story really like\nI I mean this is mostly a a you know it kind of future kind of issue with it more it it's more involving a ... communications rather than individuals I think the question it always

Conley was sitting in front of the president\nSo he got he but but what I don't know is whether he was in a bench before him how that seating arrangement was I I I think he was sitting in a bench in front of the president or the way I like to run I think he was in the front you know\nAt so the so a governor coddling and his wife or in front of President Kennedy and his wife\nSo there were three people in the front seat\nNo they were in another so it won't be water in a row of sitting there and and the\nDriver or a or the other Secret Service agent who was on the passenger side so you would
