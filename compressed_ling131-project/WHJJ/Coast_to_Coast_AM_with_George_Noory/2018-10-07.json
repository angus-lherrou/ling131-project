You're welcome handling along [noise] couponing Yes sir I Am trying to\nFigure out how to get someone to live up to the other false advertising\n[laughter] she had good luck All right I just tell me what happened\n[noise] um I had a car that I bought from a dealership in two years in Italy they sent me a written a letter and also emails wanting to buy my car back and they said they give me up to a hundred and ten percent of the appraised value my car no matter if I bought there or not\nAnd then when I when I'm On it and they appraise the car and we had a hundred ... because it was an excellent condition\n... we'll give you the deal will give you a hundred percent but you got about what our cars but in their printed advertising and my email especially especially [noise] definitely says this away races are paired up are you up to a hundred and ... percent of current market value for your vehicle [noise]\nIn fact we're so interested that we will buy your vehicle back even if you don't buy our\nShowcase so now the issue is the value ... you got him on that All right there's no question that this was what they said ah they're out is up to a hundred and ten percent that's for one or one aspect and connected to that is what is the value of the car\nOr that they're saying it's not that much or they say they're just not ... not buying the car back no matter what\nIt is in there but by the ... say they did the appraisal on the car so I went ahead it appraised by car max and then I came to them and they were the original company they will show me the car two years early right\nIn are they not recognizing the ... appraisal or they're saying we don't care\nRachel came higher than ...\nOh my God okay so\nSo so they they printed it out to me and brought it up to me and then and then I said well what about a hundred percent and like I I don't know nothing about that they brought the manager out I gave him the document and email and he goes\nOK yeah we'll give you a hundred percent because your card I mean your car but showing initially it was ten thousand miles under ... should have been particularly on at least that time and he goes it will give you the deal that you need to I Want our cars and I and I go out to highlight it and I think I'd go but he says you'll buy micro no matter what buyers are not ...\nWell ... and they they just stumbled on themselves\nAnd get mad or anything yeah okay let me let me ask\nThis uh and that is a why wouldn't you buy one of their cars or just in I understand there are a bunch of jerks but if they're willing to give you a hundred and ten ...\n... percent legitimately and they give you a reasonable deal on one of their cars why wouldn't you jump on it or even though they're much lying scum\nOkay I bought two new cars within a week of each other when I bought my Chrysler [laughter] I bought one from across the street from a ... a dealership from them out of that in my truck I drive thirty five thousand miles a year at my cars just from the garage so I'm sitting here going you know I'm spending over five hundred\nOr a or you then are you are so are you not going to buy a car then you're just not interested in buying a car period I was just trying to get out of the week\nOkay uh and they offered it yeah they're going to buy your car back uh and and they're releasing it too right\nYeah yeah they're listening to you yeah yeah I'm just trying to think they are in breach just one of the damages a and here's here's\nWhere I figured out the ... because it's been a year and I've gone through\nAll right no I got it okay all I have a a you can sell the car I to anybody else at whatever the value is and the difference is they're responsible for the ten percent\nWell the problem was is that where there aren't ... percent I Would only had to chop up\nA book kind of been out of the league at that point I couldn't sell it for what that hundred ten percent would have been without you know picking up here [laughter] so I've kept the car and I just turn it in on a leash so uh what I'm really on the hook for just is eleven payments and car insurance and vehicle registration which is comes to like hundred dollars\nThe new the new and what we bought that so it just starts all over again\nIt's not true well that's what they called me I don't\nKnow if I Know collection agency or the credit reporting agency ... collection is\nOkay have you checked have you looked at your credit reporting out your credit report yes absolutely\nEntitled on and it's still on the credit report\nCorrect okay you can't forget about the collection agencies are they just hang up on them that they have nothing to do with it or threaten them or or as I keep on telling people just say hey I'm recording this call is a Fifteen year old dad I'm recording this you have no lawsuit against me and you argue consenting to\n[noise] to keep on being recorded and they'll hang up on you so are\nThe next problem and this is the big problem is that from Fifteen Years ago a debt was unpaid is still on the credit reports vets that's an issue\nBecause that's huge damages so well could actually destroys your life effectively having no credit especially in this day and age All right so you go through the appeals process you say I Want to refute it sent me the paperwork and your refuted you say Fifteen Years old and you ask them\nIt don't you have a policy of uh after seven years I've been dropping from the credit report and what are they gonna say nope that policy has gone it's crazy I agree it's crazy\nYeah I don't I don't understand it I mean I just don't understand that happening I'm had credit and I've had clients who had ah the issue of whether these statutes ... with these statutes that no longer fly for your statue in California for example non paper to prompt a credit card or any written a contract\nAnd a credit card agency or collection agencies in some of them are real ...\nAgencies have called and people know there was a four year statute and they'll say hey this was five years ago there was a four year statute they just changed the law\nWhen they

test and of course came up negative\nYes okay now what that's why I'm asking you know no\nMatter of fact there is nothing but good news is there's nothing there either in terms of the case or the

when you get scratched\n[laughter] so no there's nothing there although you know it's always interesting is there I have my knee and is there anything there in you know everybody default this is America where you'd default to how do I get money\nThat's it how do I get money\nAnd then we start talking about well what what happened in all okay so there's nothing there well emotionally distraught uh I'm Upset because I I Want money and I can't get money and therefore can I sue because of my anticipation of getting money\nOh sure that's a great case oh why not\nAdding is high Agnes welcome to handle on the law and get my ...\nWell I got a problem I have a my guy a fake test for that kind of know what less than half hour and they kept me seven hand it and I didn't I doubt it I Won that that I have to and then arrive at family and\nFrom what I mean how much should you pay seven how do they know how much do you think you should pay did they fix it or not\nI have to pay less than half hour\nIt doesn't matter I don't care if they fix in half an hour or did they give you a bed did they give you an estimate\nThey already did you pay did you pay for the glass door being fixed and when did they\nDid they say it was going to cost eight hundred dollars or just after the ... they handed you a bill for eight hundred dollars\nNo they're not they already than just don't pay I got in a\nWhile then that's the problem you have a Agnes because you paid it and now you're saying I pay too much so it's a they're going to say you accepted our\nOur bill the bill basically use verbal says I Want a eight hundred dollars and so uh and then there's the issue\nOf uh contractors over five hundred dollars you need a written contract but I don't think that's a that's going to be particularly important although it might be in a in the case of a ... is small claims spending on the judge so ah you wanna do it's worth something Agnes right\nDoes the work they did not\nWhat do you think you should pay I mean I think my God\nAnd there may be reasonable so you turn around us to him for six hundred dollars and you take it to court and they are going to say you accept the deal and you're going to say it's too much money and I didn't know and then I found out that they just rip me off its predatory\nBut I had nothing to it and then\nWhat do you mean you have not did you hand them eight hundred dollars in hundred dollar bills in cash no no I didn't my credit card okay so you have the points that you pay them eight hundred dollars okay and you're saying it's too much and you and you want your money back and the overcharge you\nOkay and you didn't know the overcharge you until after the fact that they're going to argue it doesn't matter what we charge we told her I was

[noise]\n\n\n\nWelcome back to coast to coast am county Willis here discussing the origins of Halloween on Willis ... talking with Ben Radford then so as you tell us about the\nOrigins of Halloween it really does have a um an interesting history very rich in history um it's silly it's scary and gets said panicking gets kind of crazy I enjoy watching the\nAh television shows around that time of Halloween or that were the fun ones the little peanuts you know characters that's always fun with the ah great pumpkin and all that kind of stuff\nUm but I like the fun ones and and I like when people dressed up you know like the vampires and the Frankenstein I like the really good scary stuff\nI'm suddenly the guy that talks about that but a lot of times ah there you know there there's a lot of them are just hoaxes I remember there was a guy I think it was in a in Cleveland or Boston or something about two years ago\nAnd he went to the the um the police saying that the ... the he'd found like a needle in in a Snickers bar or something and it turned out that he put that in their himself\nAnd we yeah when the police busted him he said well I was trying to make sure the kids knew not to trust strangers\nYeah not to trust you that exactly\nI was just such an offensive of like the first of all the ... you know the whole stranger danger thing is really it's really played on the fact is that most people are good most people don't want her kids at all and you know and every year they X ray candies and it's I mean whatever if if\nIt makes me I Want to offer but I wanted to ask you that are still doing that I remember you know it was always go x-ray your candy I mean really do you do people really go to the emergency rooms where they really sick ... you know people are really sick needing to get in and do they take the time to x-ray that did that really happened\nIt occasionally does happen to know I Know that because uh I I used to live in Buffalo and I remember there would be occasional announcements and it was also I'm a dentist office they would say you know come to the dentist often are actually the candy\nAnd and I followed that for several years again I I Would I Would pay attention to the news stories and I'd follow up and say did you guys actually finding anything in the candy and the answer was almost always\nKnow for something like you know it's it's a piece of candy if you have any any doubt throw it out you don't you don't need to wonder whether there's something in the candy if if there's any reason at all you think its dubious you don't need to make but just toss it in a way I just the whole thing is just silly\nNow my dad would go through it and say well let me let me look through the candy makers okay but he did it yes so that you can feel the stuff that he wanted\n\nWhere where are the ethics here what we need to go back to the days when people were coming for soles of of of you know predatory this ... you know this yeah something here\nWell what we did the you know sometimes I always think you know like little Linus commercialism when it comes to like a Christmas when did the haunted house has come out because you know those are cool and everything however it was it primarily for money [laughter] 'cause it always raises money right\nRight no no that that's a great question you know originally you know of course originally that the the when when people begin first making disguised as I mentioned it was originally an Irish thing it it was primarily restructure the British Isles\nAnd then it came over with the with the first and second wave of the of the ah the immigrants to the United states\nAnd in fact we mentioned a little while ago about some of the conservatives getting upset about it the Puritans I'm In New England or who of course you know part of the uh the Charles ... have you know they were they were dead set against Callaway and that was that was a an occult abomination\n... and so that for for so certainly for for for many years I'm a court before there was mass marketed commercialized stuff\nUm you know you couldn't go to the local store you know Halloween store and get a a teenage mutant ninja turtle mask so your people were having to be creative you know point\nThough you'd actually have families coming together to make a gift costume and what you find is that\nThe first the ... the first record that I found of Halloween masks are really emerged in about the Eighteen seventies so it really dates back over a hundred years I'm uh they weren't they weren't of course you know as foreign aid in your past the oldest and stuff\nBut what's happened that over and over the decades as as you know as marketing is turn Halloween into you know a much more of a commercial enterprise and you know it's it's ... it's become commercialized for for better or for worse\nAnd this is when you start getting adults who are you know doing the the elaborate which costumes and you know the the you know [noise] the the sexy police officer costumes or the\nDrag yeah\nAnd of course as soon as you have mass marketing then you have a you know you have the princess is right you have Cinderella you have peanuts and you have all that sort of stuff and so you know that that's fine I mean but I like you I I sort of ... I have a sweet spot for for homemade costumes but really creative and not just you know something with a mask slapped on it\nYeah it's fine for sure um sell you know you talk about the history of it ... basically what goes on now so how do you see since she studied it so much can you really continue to to to do that how do you see the future of Halloween how do you see it in about ten years Twenty years Thirty years\n[noise] well on us no good question you know I think that um you know ... ... Halloween ... mentioned I mean it's\nIt's it's very much wrapped up in tradition and folklore and stuff and all these things changed right I mean we've we've talked about two or three different incarnations of Halloween going back to to win and then you've got the\nMixing it with all saints day in office all day and and you know we went to each it raised with each you know a couple of generations changed a bit\nUm and I think that um I think it's probably going to remain more or less the same for the time being a you have had occasional places where people taking it too far\nIn Detroit for example it's it's known as hell night I mean there's there's like arson and stuff it's like scary scary stuff going on [noise] um but for the most part you know most people keep it keep it pretty simple I think that that there is asserting innocence about it\nBut I think is really appealing again it's not it's not Easter it's like Christmas it's not tied to a particular religion\nIt's it's something that anybody of any of any uh of any faith and creed hum what is like a dress up we all like to dress up right I mean eight year old kids love just eighty year old kid like a dress up and so it's\nThere's something that is I think just inherently a humanistic and fun and and I don't think that's going to go away and um\nYou know it's still going to be knocking on doors and asking for candy or you know I don't think it's going to change dramatically in the next ah in the next you know twenty or fifty years or ... you know who knows maybe two hundred years from now a ... there'll be a sort of you know virtual a ghost\nYou know where you've got like holographic oh you've got to that you got a six year that he was late this giant thing that'd be cool\nThat's right that's what's going to be knocking at your door that'll be cool All right so we're talking with Benjamin Radford origins of Halloween we're going to are asking about panic part of it when we come back stay with us you are listening because because I Am I'm ... and we'll we'll tonight\nNever missed a detail on a short just sign up for the ... ... email newsletter available for free at ... dot com\nPirate five games history in nine theory this week in Nineteen\nThirty two it was Babe Ruth legendary call three points to center field before ... into the\nWrigley Field bleachers in the beginning it was game three of the world series and the Yankees won Seventy five this week in Nineteen fifty one third baseman Bonnie Thompson hit the one out three run home run in the bottom and the ninth inning when the national Center for the New York giants\nSounds Homer wrapped up in amazing come from behind run to the giants the giants went on to lose the series and the Yankees\nBut Tom says miraculous home run remains one of the most memorable moments in sports history\nReferred to as the shot hernia weekend sport time capsule\nOr don't want another drinking in my life\nI Want US Marshal\nAs to whether someone else drinks\nA pastor adjusted I Try our family groups\nAre troubled by someone else drinking you might be surprised at what you can learn and\nAllen on family group from people just like you [noise]\n...

[noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\nKind of you will is here on the coast to coast am our gas tonight on Willis wean is Benjamin Radford we've been talking about the origins of Halloween\nAnd uh oriented time we are also by the way because he's a science based paranormal investigator he goes all over the world and investigate all sorts of great things great mysteries that we all love\nSo uh and he writes a lot of books his last book was on actually um investigating um goes goes hunting stuff so\nLet's say I want to talk a little bit more about the origins of Halloween and some of the the areas and then I Want to talk about his book because it's very interesting stuff in there I think you guys are going to like and you know it works with the will of saline theme of\nGoes tiny so Ben I'm as we talked about Halloween I Want to make sure you say everything that you wanted to say about it but I Want to know about that let's say panic part of it\nI mean it can really can get pretty evil with some people as much as I like the orange and black and the which isn't it you know and the Frankenstein and the Iraqi like kind of almost like the bubble gummy kind of\nHalloween that's what I like sure um but then there's deep darkness and say panic part where people really do get creepy and scary\nWell yeah I mean it's one little thing for I mean there's always going to be a certain segment of the population that take things too far right there's always going to be you know some some creep in some you know a mall haunted houses you know reached out and grabbed her crow somebody or whatever I mean it's there's always going to some of that but\nBut you know that's for every one of those examples or you know there's you know hundreds and hundreds of other people who who just you know have a good time with it [noise]\nUm you know I mean as I mentioned before you know so and was not you know there's there's nothing the panic about it a lot of ... sometimes conservatives cause you can cause it of its roots with with with pagan ritual\nBut you know the the ancient the health I mean they they they they they didn't warship anything\nResembling the Christian devil at all I mean they ... if if you drink when if you ask them you know if you told them about some some horn goat creature that you know the the evil they wouldn't have the famous paid hear what you're talking about it wasn't it wasn't or their world view\nUm and and again you know as someone festival died out long before\nBefore you know the the the Christian concept of of of\nA scene and all that sort of came up and so what you find is that you know there there's there's tradition of course I mean you look at exit is coming to Eighteen you know ... for which to live\nUm and so there's a there's a strong tradition in in being concerned rightly or wrongly about a a cult influences right so this is fine uh this is of course not just Halloween that that's one of the more uh obviously comes up\nEvery every year in coming up every year but I mean for example we saw the same thing in the Nineteen eighties with a concern over dungeons and dragons\nI'm and role playing games and heavy metal music and and ... and ... um I was up in uh I did a ghost investigation a couple of years back up at the heart of St James hotel in northern New Mexico\nAnd I was there during investigation and looking to go in and\nOn the wall I I'd never seen that before I have a I have a photo of it is it a wage you're bored or strictly prohibited anyone using a ... will be kicked off the property and it was just it was just so interesting I mean the the owners were so concerned\nThat using the ... board was going to open up you know do you want to ... or whatever I I I agree with that one\nBut it didn't say what was interesting was that it was it was codified on a wall\nAnd I'd never seen that like you know in the rule if you will find this don't use it and so you know typically the concern is uh it's about kids because again as I mentioned for for most of most Halloween\nIt wasn't it wasn't senator on kids or was it was something that mostly you know adults and and and you know teenagers did you know whether it's a bobbing for Apple's are doing trick or treating but beginning in the Nineteen fifties\nThat twin because it was centered on kids that were the concern came from and so it was ... motion that\nA kid the dresses up as a witch or goal will become interested in witchcraft or wicker or vehicle because of that and so that's that's basically the foundation for that and so this is why a lot of times um the the\n... parents who are concerned about that\nUm they do a couple of things one of them is they have instead of a Halloween party have a harvest party so they they they they they make a case to distinguish it from home and this is our way into harbors party but there's lots of similar stuff and of course they'll they'll you know the parents were concerned about that\nBill have the kids dressing up as princesses or something ... anything that might be you know darker scary\nIt's so interesting because um you know everybody has their views and their opinions and and uh you know in in everything\nBut I just um I just remember as a kid levine that it was\nIt was like a fun scary and it was you know creepy in there like I said again you know black lights and the\nUh we were um and I grew up in Louisville, Kentucky and one of the local radio stations at W. H. A. Y. was wacky and they had the wacky haunted house and it was\nIt was what your bigger brothers would take you to you know as a kid and it got to be a family of Ben and everybody would be there and it was the coolest thing of all is one of the biggest events like in the country I mean even though all the radio people still remember this from\nFrom back then it was a wacky haunted house there was nothing nothing scary or it was all so much fun back then everybody had a good time you'd be dressed up\nA it was fun to be scared you laugh and then you go home and the next\nYou know that was that you eat candy for awhile and sometime you still had that candy when they came to Christmas and just the way it was right down the\nMarathon bars amount either right away I assume doing those\nYou freeze those have you ever had them frozen\nOh they were great oh I'm sure you're just taking me back your love is\nSomebody needs to a grand that recipe and make those again I don't know why they ever stop to because you knew that everybody loved marathon bars my gosh\nYeah they were and they came and that was like a red and black rapper written\nOr something yeah and the real around the back oh man I'm going to go after we're done here\nAnd uh and uh I I didn't know that um that uh what's his face was last seen McGregor so I I I learned that tonight in fact if I weren't here talking to you I'd probably be watching the fight\nThere you go it's gone now is there any way\nYeah Yup yup yup\nMember on all the producers were were watching that say hey you guys are going on the air

when you put all together in the area that you are there are so many things that are going on in radius and again going back to the fact that these radar bases were there there was a picture that you had\nDid you mean I guess one of your book that was a picture I'm a I guess there were some happening that went on some sort of the den\nAnd that were seen and then the next day or maybe within the
