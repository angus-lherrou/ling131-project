don't know I I had no idea I\nI thought that they possess during tricked her something sounds strange the way it changed your personality or so I\nKnow they they turned it on a dime I didn't understand why they did it it's like when goes whisper was being shocked for somebody to buy it out there in LA and\nUh the person that will take me around took me into this this house of a couple of

the lake you want to go and not a well I had just had a scan acts that my name was all swelled up and I dislocated\nIt I thought well no he goes well you might as well get up and move around\n... as otherwise it's just a hot stove up so I have talked me into it I went and uh\nLike I said it was about an hour away and we got up that direction and\nHung out with people but little while and uh they all want to go to a bar probably I don't know maybe\nAnother thirty miles from where we were there and ah I was like well whatever you know I got to be late afternoon but time and the early evening and a wintertime\nAnd we got up there and I got this real strange feeling after I got into the bar or they knew people there I didn't know anybody other than who I drive with\nAnd it was just weird it felt like every body in there that was in that bar ... focused on me\nI didn't understand why at the time you know and I thought well what the heck about\nLike a bar full of empires or something yeah exactly it's like well I mean I felt like a oh I Am a at the swatter bright and tied up on a rope or something yeah\nAnd and I I got real aren't comfortable and I told him I said hey look I'm not very long ago I Need to go\nSo they they agreed and and we left that place then they went to this other place that way out in the country and it was an old I mean this was an old bag ... yeah and I went in there with them\nAnd to this by then it was a bunch of old people that there again I felt that hard enough and the air and I told him I said hey look I'm all just go sit out the car\nBut these these folks who brought you there they felt comfortable right\nOh well I've known them because I've worked with him um and uh yeah they're to me it didn't you know I didn't feel any threat from them it was just in the places that I attended they know where they took me\nAnd I'm like I said it ended up being a night of heavy snow and it ended up being a level three snow warning which means that you're not even supposed to be out\nSo we're out in the country after I go out back to the second bar after I go out and sit in a car and they finally decided well come on let's go\nWell we go down the road
