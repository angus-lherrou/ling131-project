coast am off gorge and ... are very popular voice of audio books as well his latest the miracle club Mitch welcome back\nMuch George great to be here always a pleasure my friend what you've been up to these days\nWell a today is the launch day of the miracle club which is very exciting for me because it's probably the first book I've written that is strictly practical that goes into techniques and methods and it's a big rich that I've crossed with this book and I'm very grateful to have the chance to talk to the coast family about it\nIt's a great title to by the way the miracle club it sounds like a movie already\n[laughter] you know it was a group of a cult explores here in New York City in the nineteenth century and they were dedicated to exploring everything just like you do on your show and I really wanted to revive the spirit of that original group\nOr their motto was try that that just one more try and that's really been my and form a motto throughout my whole life so I use the term in tribute to them\nHow many members of the club\nThat was probably about five of them they were just a little group\nWest side of Manhattan and Eighteen Seventy five while we're experimenting\nWith San says and medium ship and talking to the dead end table rapping and so on they weren't around for very long but they formed the nucleus of a much larger and more influential group the esophageal society which is still around today and which is probably responsible for the whole revolution and alternative spirituality\nThat is amazing too because during that era the Eighteen hundreds it seems like the dabbling in the paranormal was different than today Mitch yeah and they really took it seriously didn't they\nVery seriously and they had the spirit of childlike wonder I mean they were delving into mysterious things and they were looking into some dark places\nBut they were doing it with their sense of just asking themselves what is out there how can we understand life you know it was a period of time when a Darwinism was in the attendance and people were starting to think maybe we've been wrong about\nGod and spirits any invisible world and these people said listen we don't want to throw science out we embrace science but we want to use science to try to experiment with whether we can detect things about the invisible world\nThomas Edison believe it or not was a member of the original group and he talked about wanting to construct a machine that can help people talk to the dead it's not clear whether at us and ultimately did that but he and a major general Adnan doubled day we're both early members\nThat's amazing now tell us a little bit about the book the miracle club and and because it's also a practical guide book isn't it\nIt really is you know for many years I've written and I've been on the show talking about alternative spiritual history the history of the occult but I've always also considered myself a believing historian I experiment with the ideas and the methods and approaches that I write about and I wanted to take the opportunity\nTo write about the things that I've tried myself I Believe very strongly in the powers of the mind I Believe the thoughts are cause of death I Believe that if you walk around with a deeply held emotionally charged mental picture that is going to affect what happens to you and you can use that and there are reasons for this\nAnd I wanted to write a book that would give people concrete hands on math is\nWhat do you think a miracle is Mitch\nA miracle very simply put is something that is a radical departure from all natural expectation and occurrence that breaks away from everything that you could naturally and reasonably\nExpect to arise\nFrom circumstances and I've experienced miracles on my own mind the very fact that you and I are talking you know I didn't start reading my own books until I was into middle age I Am currently fifty two years old and my career did not take off\nUntil I was in my forties and that didn't happen by accident there was a mental picturing there was a visualization\nWas an affirmation as well as a lot of sweat equity but I Do believe if you can find a miracle as a radical departure from circumstance miracles do occur today\nHence the subtitle of the book which is how thoughts become reality and you're you're a very strong believer in that aren't you\nI really am and you know it's funny if you actually take a look at your life sometimes there is a long\nInterval sometimes there is a long gestation period between a font and the event but if if if listeners really sit back and survey their lives they will find an uncanny ... grew in sea between things that they've thought about and things that have happened to them\nMay have you found the people who dabbled with the dark side tend to do some of the similar things that the positive people do but that's something always goes awry for them\nWell it's an interesting question you know we faced these ethical questions of how to use our powers\nAll the time in life you know a person could be completely materialist he or she could be an atheist and they still face ethical questions\nEvery single day about whether they're treating other people fairly honorably if you take seriously as I Do that our minds have these extra physical capacities\nThat responsibility becomes all the more that responsibility becomes that much stronger my contention is that however we may feel buffet by the winds and currents of life we are much more powerful than we think we are we have a hand in events\nMentally and and often the shows up in ways that we don't suspect\nSo my messages also be careful be careful because what you're thinking about absolutely has a practical dimension on your life and on the lives\nOf others I had a rebel or on before you came on and he was in Israel and of course great mental list and it was telling us the story and how he was commissioned to help the Brits in a soccer match against Scotland\nAnd over the stadium they put him in a helicopter and he was supposed to influence\nThe ball and and I guess when the when the Scottish kicker was going to the ball or a mentally moved up and the guy missed it or something like\nThat and now here's a story about or he's an old or a family friend and he was over at the house hold up my brother in law I've and when I was Fifteen Years old\nAnd I've and expressed all kinds of skepticism and er he said to him do me a favor arrive and go into your bedroom and draw a picture and so I have and when his bedroom drew a picture came out and said\nYou drew a house and I was shocked and said that's absolutely true\n[laughter] I Know we had gr Mitchell delayed astronaut when he was on our program was talking about a tie class episode yet at NASA tie class\nAnd it ... or or type pin and he lost and you couldn't find it\nAnd he was telling ... bought into and out of this guy just out of nowhere they heard upping and it was the tight class that that fell on the ground and came out of nowhere the other part of it the part that class into the the pointed at the end of it\nWas an ... ice cream [laughter]\nYellow swallowed it I mean it's amazing villa in there for that [laughter] it's amazing\nBut back to these miracles and we take calls next hour I'd like for people to share miracle stories with you Mitch if we can but\nBack to the dark side of it and I don't want to dabble in the dark in too much but nothing too but you know people dabble in the dark side they curse other people they put exes on other people\nAnd in a lot of cases those things happen to these people yeah how how come than the dark side has that kind of power\n[noise] well it represents something that's in us you know we we we we are being of of of a broad spectrum and\nMy contention is that thoughts are ... and whether you are using your thoughts through spell or whether you're using your thoughts through a ritual or whether you are projecting thoughts at other people\nSomething's going to happen there is going to be some effect\nHowever one of my favorite teachers never God or to grade teacher in the mind power tradition teaches that the only way that you can project\nNegatives spell or thought on to another person is if that person could wish the same thing for someone else is if that person could wish the same thing for someone else if he or she could not get rebounds tea is so in a certain sense well we grew up calling the golden rule is protection\nAgainst evil forces and I want people to listen to that very carefully because we're apt to overlook familiar things we're apt to overlook simple things if you are concerned about negative forces in your life the golden rule can serve as an enormous source of protection there is an esoteric and a cult dimensions of the golden rule that we don't always appreciate\nWell that's absolutely sure now why do our thoughts shape the reality of what happens\nThis is my contention in the book and I felt they really have to put myself out there and come up with a theory of positive thinking I'm going to be very brief about it across all kinds of science has from cyclical researched quantum theory rising we have made the determination over the past eight years\nOn on Jupiter doesn't mean gravity in their

[noise]\n\nAnd a great time to use an affirmation that just needs to be spoke it does not need to be spoken out loud a great time to use an affirmation\nIs those few very relaxed moments just before you drift off to sleep at night sleep researchers call that the hitting the gothic state it is a state of time when you can not only reprogram your own psyche\nThrough repeating affirmation Z or prayers or holding visualizations but but cyclical researchers have also found that those few moments before you drift asleep at night are prime time in essence Patel a path or extra sensory activity mysterious things occur\nWhen people hold affirmation in mind or silently repeat them to themselves in those few moments just before going to sleep at night\nThat he is an exquisitely unusual supple suggestible time it's a time that each of us experiences every day you also experience it's just as you're coming to consciousness in the morning use that time that is the prime time for silently reciting affirmation stew yourself\nAnd it seems to work doesn't\nThat's been my experience George when people ask me for a simple step to take that is always the step I give them again my ... is never neglect simple things we have a habit of overlooking simple things used them there's more depth there than one might expect\nOne or some of the positive mind control methods we should use\nWell one of the things that's most important is writing things down right down your goals\nAnd I don't mean on the computer I mean get out and old fashioned pencil and paper and do it because once you do that you've actually created a physical manifestation so to speak of the thing that you're looking for the actual tactile act of writing something I think not only helps\nPersuade you mentally and in terms of your neural pathways of the goals that you're moving towards but you've actually done something empowering you've done something real if\nYou sit down and for a sustained period of time make a list of things that you truly want in life and you know these are things you want with all your heart there not diversionary but they are essential\nLife goals take that list\nPut it on to some sort of a laminated card or something that you can carry with you look at it\nMorning noon and night think about it as much as possible and when things on that list come to you and overtime they will come to you and they may come to quicker than you think just expressed gratitude and most important of all\nDon't tell anyone what you're doing remain silent because sometimes you share these things with other people and they'll roll their eyes are those say it's nonsense than they knock you off your resolve remain silent make your list carry it with you review it three times a day memorize it\nAnd when the results arrive express thinks that's a method we can all do and it's easy isn't it once you get into it\nIt is easy ... the the important thing is to do it with consistency\nIs to do it with silence and it's to do it with total stark honesty arriving at a definite aim in life or a a a a a small number of things that coalesce around one name has enormous power and aim is really another way of saying focus and we know that\nWhen you focus the sun's rays with a magnifying glass were prism\nThey become enormously powerful what is a laser other than focused light\nNatural laws are consistent your mind is powerful when it is focused which is why I keep emphasizing the idea that you have to really\nNail down what you want in a very concrete way and be very honest with yourself that's worth focus comes from\nMitch since you've been doing this have you use these techniques for yourselves\nEvery day every single day George and I must tell you you know I my life has gone in directions that I never could have expected I've done television then narrating and and and and written many books and articles\nIncluding in places that are not known for their a cult enthusiasm I've written about these topics\nIn the Washington Post the wall Street Journal the New York times I never dreamt that was possible and so I feel like I'm an example of the effectiveness of these methods and everything that are offered to the coast family\nOr things that I've wrote tested myself I Would never ask somebody to do something that I hadn't experimented with myself\nOr you could tell you love doing what you're doing\nI really do I really do I mean you know ... it's a dream come true and the most literal sense you know Fifteen Years ago this is exactly what I pictured myself doing and exactly what I wanted to do be patient sometimes things happen quickly but sometimes a gestation period has also necessary\nIt is amazing we're kind of people get this membership into the miracle or the\nMiracle club I used to say that anybody can join the miracle ... he didn't have to\nSign your name up anywhere there was no magic decoder ring in anything and of course that is true everybody who's listening is automatically a member in the ... of the miracle club but I got to thinking you know speaking of magic decoder rings maybe it would be fun if people had a little membership card so I asked a friend of mine a great artist named Tim boat\nTo draw up a membership card in the miracle club and anybody who emails me and I'm super easy to find throw my name into Google it'll take you to my website and my email email me and I will send you your own membership card to be in the miracle club you can sign it you can fold it laminated carry it in your wallet\nIt's just something fun to have with you to sort of keep you on course throughout the day\nTo keep your thoughts steady and productive so I I thought it would be fun for people to have an official card a designating their membership and the miracle club so send me an email you get a miracle club membership card\nWe're going to take calls next hour with Michel ... of course we will take your miracle stories as well I Would guess Mitch it's surprising how many people have miracle stories it it is ... you know\nYou know we have to understand that life is made up of of of joys and and sometimes great tragedies but in as much as we do experience catastrophes in life and let's face it that's part of life we also experienced\nExtraordinary shortly unexpected moments of good news there are in fact times George where we get what we're looking for and I would say that's more than just the turn of the roulette wheel our mind play a role in\nThat again a miracle is a departure from all expected at all reasonable\n...

career against the titans\nAnd use Radio Nice twenty and one oh four seven am [noise]\n\n\n\nThat will come back to coast to coast George story with you along with Mitch Horwitz Mitch told me about the power behind writing down the goal women going for it\nYou know it's interesting when we write down a goal it really demand that we pull something out of us that's authentic and that's kind of magic key to all of this material I Would say that absolute passionate intensity is the one the hidden key behind every health health program with it or something will work without it nothing happens\nNow one of my contention is that we really need to have one absolutely definite chief aim in life and that could be something that we very often resist writing things down can help us with that because if you write down what you really care about over a course of days are over the course of weeks you'll see that it will all tend\nIn one direction and my challenge to the listener\nIs whether you can come up with one overarching goal that facilitates all of the smaller ones what would that be if you can come up with one chief aim you have arrived at mental focus and mental focus is the open sesame so to speak to everything that we've been talking about\nInteresting work miniature what's with us and Mitch did you get some professional help when you put those together or did you do this all on your a\nToll on my own you know this was really my tribute to the thought of my own heroes and the mental healing tradition or things that they've thought about things that I have experimented with ideas that I came up with myself\nA you know I view the miracle club is something that we all belong to all of us who are ... all of us who are experimenter as we are all automatically in the miracle club and my idea was just to create something around which we could all gather and experiment with our mind\nWhat would you say would be a great miracles story that you've heard about\nA great miracles through that I've heard about was a financial miracle I had a friend in New England who was recovering from a very serious disease and he was facing financial disaster he had only one hundred and two dollars left\nHis name and he was on the brink of losing his health insurance one night I challenged people I challenged people to make a marathon reading a book George that I Know you love very deeply the magic of believe\nAnd less though\nYeah and my friend rather than reading the book decided to get hold of an audio version of it that I happened to narrate he\nListened to it over and over and over for about five days on the fifth day he got a call from an old boss who said to him you know you left behind four one K. account here have you checked that account and my friend said on that you know you can carry thought it was a few dollars and cents\nHis old boss had to have you looked at it there's over fifty thousand dollars\n... ...\nYeah I can only tell you that that's what happened and to my friend it truly felt like America\nThat is a miracle it really is yeah\nIt's actually what the experience and it was quite recent\nThat when you least expect it you know\nYes yes that's why I tell people you know again George it can sound sort of act need to say never give up but these things do happen when you least expect it you can always give it another twenty four hours you have no idea what twists and turns life is going to take and as much as life visits catastrophe on us and it does\nIt also visit extraordinary absurd the good news on us and you never know you never know what life is going to take and twenty four hours I always in poor people who feel desperate among other things among other things give it twenty four hours more\nYou
