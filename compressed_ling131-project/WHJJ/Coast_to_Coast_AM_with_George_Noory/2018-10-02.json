know part of it\nMight be as well and one of the things\nThat is happening this is definitely you know how the media is always there they're they're amazed because of what's happening with with the president with the tweeting and all the information and so from the political realm it when people like yourself or myself people who are you know tuning into news reports a need to do it for work\nOne of the things that's so weird there's so many events are happening much more so that they are being reported like Lincoln these split hour after hour\nAnd I think that you know people are tired of it and they're exhausted and then we've had like this whole thing about social networking we're you know millions of people like their their passwords here and there and so it's kind of like a revolution every single day somewhere\nAnd I think that that's making the time go a little faster or maybe we want to make make it go faster to get away from some of the ... the weird problem\nCan you chart out asking logically I Know you were with me back in July and you're always popping in on New Year's day with us right can you chat to chart the rush to the year for someone in the beginning of the year\n[noise] yeah well it's an interesting thing New Years in particular is very powerful I mean you could even do today it's October one\nAnd you could in general I mean these things are not usually done you can take a look at the whole month of November by looking at the same midnight in in the nation's capital here or wherever the capital is of a particular country and do a truck for that moment no the big one is New Year's at midnight all around the world because\nAll be on the air with everybody\nYeah and what's interesting is at midnight everywhere around the world lever is

on two thousand Nineteen the sun and Saturn are coming into a conjunction and Mars is going to enter its home sign of areas which doesn't actually look all that wonderful for the planet\nBecause Mars the traditional positive war will go into its own fine actually laid on December thirty one and then the son of Saturn are together now there can be positive things like maybe for sports with with Mars\nAnd um exercise an engineering and different kinds of projects that are more martial but some of the Saturn at the beginning of year is often you know too many frustrations law to block coming in but I guess it's going to be a testing year two thousand Nineteen for the world\nWhy does it work mark why does astrology war\nOkay because here's what's happening it isn't that the planets were throwing down raise this was what the old idea\nExactly what and why scientists would say you believe in that foolishness pseudo science mumbo jumbo\nIt inside of us okay so in other words\nIf everything depends on something being born at a moment of time like with the person baby it's when you take your first breath it's not coming out of the womb\nIf the village of course still tight a twin that's why you know we've got to make the baby cry to make sure we know that is free they taking in the first spread like the declaration of independence is usually used to leave America's Choice because it was our first\nBreath we're we're saying guess wedding when we're independent of you were being born okay this is our beginning now\nNot every astrologer works with that chart but most of them do so the reason it works is that wherever the sun is the moon and the various plan if it's not that they're making things happen from outer space it's that whatever is born a person a president take an oath of office you buy a new car you\nGet a new job you do if you have the time uh that that happens you put everything into the horoscope and then you can attempt to interpret what does that

you\nWell look I could ... if somebody said to me I Know one on board ... you know what I don't have the time I Know the town or city actually month standing here I could do anything for that person not as exactly ...\nDo it because timing allows us all kinds of things the sunrise birth is is it near noon is a ton said is it\nA midnight we're or the planets falling at that point because in twenty four hours most of the pilots are gonna be in the ... they're going to be in the same signs but the moon can change a lot and twenty four hours it can go half of the time\nAnd so the moon has a lot to do with our instincts are moods even reincarnation and looking back who may have been the qualities were bringing in this lifetime moon has a lot to do with personality the sun is more of the

teachings and so on\nHum and I found my mentor Dane where you are who is one of the great astrologers of twenty century and he had studied not just astrology but philosophy psychology and metaphysics of sauce so I read all of his books and kind of memorized everything and the reason which if their students out there\nUh the planet mercury which rules mind thinking communication at the time of his birth and Pisces was exactly at the same spot where mine was and I knew what his chart was and\nWhen I started reading this book that you asked me about psychic was as if I could hear his voice\nIn my head because we were born at the time with with the planet mercury which is very powerful and often underrated was on the same spot but any rate I took it for a whole year and then I started doing some consultation work in New York City\nAnd but the point is people need quite a number of years to get really good and they've really got to study much more than just an astrology charts they ... they have to learn what's called transits and progression where the planets keep moving on different levels and be able to do that for their clients\nSince since you've been doing this and what was it that got you interested in it and then something happened\nUm I started going to medical uh to Columbia University my dad had been doctor he got sick at one point I didn't know what it was going to do I could have\nStudied medicine in college at Michigan State I didn't do it I was into ah all kinds of things like social science and he got ill and I thought well maybe I'll take chemistry physics I'll take all the prerequisites I went to Columbia University [noise]\nUh this is part of a psychic weird thing that you asked me about so it's the first date or the first day of chemistry class I'm living in the borough of queens where Donald Trump was born I go home\nAnd just before getting home ice stopping a bookstore and I find my first astrology book which I mentioned TV for astrology the space age science\nAnd it's all about people like Isaac Newton Galileo ... all of these great physicist and all these people have studied\nA more of astronomy telescopes ballet or and so on they were all astrologers but when the biographers would write about the is fantastic people they'd say oh by the way they had one fault they were all went to the\nPhony thing of astrology because the they biographers just thought it was foolish and wasteful and they couldn't understand why why was the greatest scientist before noon sir Isaac Newton studying astrology\nHow could that possibly be what what's wrong with a guy\nWell what they didn't realize is who is a science was taught in the universe is if Europe a thousand years ago and it goes way back to all these great ... nations Persia Egypt\nRome ... you know all over the world the ancient world and it was even taught in the universe is if you're up\nI'm going to make your work this hour mark so let's go to the calls we will pick it up by going to Bob in New Jersey hears Bob's birth the December twenty nine\nNineteen fifty seven twelve twenty nine Nineteen fifty seven okay born at one forty two in the afternoon now in\nJersey City now do you when you you want to know the city they were born in or do you want to know exactly the place they were born\nWell that helps I mean just what you just said you know what I'm doing is just for people out there I'm not putting on my head I'm actually type it into a computer [noise] and believe it or not I'm able to sort of get that information pretty\nQuaint and and what you want them to ask you a question\nUm if they want I mean ah if they can say to you and say I'm interested in this era of my life and then I'll just see what I can\nTell them we're going to Bob in New Jersey Hi, Bob\nYou're\nGood welcome to the program turn your radio down a little bit okay yeah I ... thank you okay great you're you're on with mark Lerner of given mark your birth date for your time go ahead mark\nOkay well if he's if he's not asking a particular question what I can say ah of course this individual is born with a Capricorn son and an areas moon\nAnd tourists rising and he's born very close to a first quarter moon I'm a ... as I said earlier on the other side of the hour\nPeople don't often study their moon enough because the moon has a lot to do with who we are instinctively so with an areas moon coming from other lives in like instinctively this individual had a lot of assertiveness and forceful illness and kind of an aggressive\nPersonality and that's important for him to sort of live his life on a on a deep level where he he has leadership qualities developed in otherwise particularly in the last life and now with the sun and Capricorn that's kind of to refine that not to be brash but the sort of\nDo things more um grounded more practically in order to sort of rise of the heights and the planet Saturn which rules Capricorn\nIs in the process of Criss crossing over this individual son so it's an extra kind of a this year and the and coming into the fall of discipline responsibility being focused and\nHe should be make sure he strengthens his immune system and stays healthy that um he doesn't become pessimistic about things\nUm but he's also heading for um if he wants to develop this an another career cycle of the next several years as long as he stays healthy and focused and a has a good attitude about things\nBob do you have a question to\nUh yeah what what if I'm not healthy now [laughter] well if you're not on now again you want to kind of like um well my feeling is that people should\nStudy things like use your intuition if need be go to a used bookstore you're you're on the show tonight there's a reason why you got on another people didn't get it on um go to our website see some of the you know read about my life the books the philosophies and so on and get into something like that philosophy\nMetaphysics astrology the power of numbers numerology is connected to astrology as well and find something that you can kind of a steep yourself in for a while and that can make you accept inwardly excited and then maybe your health we'll get better\nThanks Bob good luck to you and everything you do would you believe in reincarnation mark\nAbsolutely and I've studied that longer than this and that's part of the whole psychic thing\nWe're all psychic world intuitive and we all live many lives now people are different levels so to speak I guess uh how it would work out of why we would see like an Einstein or gundy are different people and mother Theresa [noise]\nYou know how many times people who've been around and when you study spiritual things and there's a whole field of esoteric astrology there was a whole other kind of idea like in the Casey Casey predictions I Know you've got a lot of people on we'll talk about the ... and Edgar Casey\nThere was a whole sort of spiritual science about humanity being part of the solar system like we're not just on earth I mean we live in the solar system we live in the galaxy we just don't live there physically but spiritually when we're asleep\nPsychic Lee people who ... who can meditate and sort of leave their bodies you know Asheville traveling that kinda thing looser dreaming where are we were somewhere else\nSo that's all part of things indefinitely that there are multiple lifetimes than I Do believe very strongly that we're all spirits and souls and\nOur incarnations like in the chart we're looking at the like I said the spiritual kind of genetic code of what our game plan of higher destiny is as a spirit or sold to accomplish something with the sun moon and the planets in the configuration that we have\n... reincarnation astrological you speaking you were the born the let's let's say the ...\nCarney did person and the person before that well were they born during the same time period\nOh no no no ... ... ... there's a whole question about that kind of thing you know people might in the old days I mean a lot of people thought people would reincarnate slowly like maybe once every century or once every couple of centuries or whatever it is according to the spiritual material I have read my life [noise]\nCertain souls or spirits who are doing work like the work that you do okay light worker kind of work at this stage in twenty first century\nMike ... will come back more quickly now everything depends on getting a body from from a man and a woman being able to come into the world of north ... time to take advantage of astrological vibration\nThey're to me absolutely in other words the sold the spirit comes in and chooses parents and family based on family karma Dharma that kind of a thing and then you're actually choosing when to be born because there are spiritual forces angels teachers masters whoever you want to call it\nI Know you have a lot of people talk about that stuff hoard guiding and bringing in that entity and then you have your own guardian angel with you throughout your whole life I'm a firm believer and all of those things\nExcellent let's go on to Cleveland Donna's with us welcome to the program and

I've been saying a lot to to everybody do a lot of deep study you are definitely in that camp because then you're going to have once in a lifetime Pluto\nA movement towards your son and the next like year or two and Saturn which rules Capricorn is heading is already in that sign them Saturn will then contact your son and then between two thousand Nineteen two thousand twenty Jupiter will be there so you're going to have three enormously important influences\nIn the Capricorn part of your chart which is your son sign your character your life force kind of the link to hire spirits so what the universe is saying is\nDo some big time study psychology philosophy authors or ... it doesn't have to be a study like that I mean it could be art it could be music anything a a hobby a craft an activity that\nThat is deep and significant so that you don't get down on yourself are worried or stressed out and so on that you do have a wonderful moon in Virgo in on the line called the trying which is flowing to your son to be an organizer this is what you've you've done in the past\nEfficiency organization service to other people like possibly other lifetimes where you've been nurse or a doctor or or a student or you know a libraries or things like that learning languages from the past so there are some skill sets that you have that are very strong from other allies but the big things next couple of years\nSo it kind of deep seated study penetrating into some kind of mysteries or involvements that like you stay really focused and that you learn a whole lot over the next couple of years\nOkay good luck to your car loan next one may fourth Nineteen sixty nine may fourth Nineteen sixty nine or going out to California so who is with us welcome to the program for good\nYeah I think you are my question is about Korea money and should I moved to a different um uh when I was born in ... city court\nNo where are you okay ... what's the city how do you spell it who wait city oh okay in Kuwait a scholarship and he's a toy and I'm just\nPutting six AM here unless you give me another time I'll put around sunrise do do you know your time birth or know\nAnnoyed okay no problem okay you said money\nAnd where what state to live in what state deliver using Kelly right now\nOkay well first of all there is an even on my website it's called global hotspots ... where I Do part of mundane astrology but it's also individuals [noise]\nWe've there's been a science for forty plus years in astrology\nIt was originally called astro Qatar graffiti by a fellow named Jim Lewis who many years ago passed away and it's a it's a wonderful tool but you got to know your time of birth and then we can move around from like where you're born from Kuwait City to California or New York or somewhere in the planet's understand what's good and what isn't a California is\nAnd this is another big thing that people don't realize and astrology every state of the union as a chart like September nine Eighteen fifty California and to the union as a son signed Virgo state with a with a Scorpio moon\nSo you as a tourist son signed tourists\nThat's an earth fine and you match pretty well with with California okay so that is a match where your earth fine and California's earth fine\nOr good okay you also have a good money aspect in your chart I'm not sure what you should use it for but you have mercury with Vesta which is one of the four main asteroids that says a lot to do with investment\nSo it's not surprising that you would ask that question about what to you know something with money investment so there is something that you're supposed to do with all that\nAnd you just have to figure that out the other thing is you have a a moon trying to Venus which is another potential money making energy but the big but here is Venus which goes stationery in retrograde on friday\nIn Scorpio is making kind of an unusual Lyman to NATO Venus therefore don't act precipitously\nOkay in in the near future um and because you're ... and it's home signed a Gemini you want to avoid those mercury Richard ... times they can be good for review and reflection but you want to learn more about mercury a threat to upgrade the power of Venus which is your son find ruler and that will really help you\nMark if there's a planted acts up there in the solar system somewhere will that affect things\nYeah in fact uh the I have a whole thing about here is which has a five hundred sixty six year cycle\nWhich is on setting out when President Trump took office it's an article on earth Aquarius news it was very strong at his inauguration and has a whole lot to do with what's been happening over the last year and a half\nAnd therefore outer planets even beyond Pluto have are now being used a whole lot just as there are a lot of asteroids and little plants like higher on\nThe chart gets over populated that's part of the the complication but you want to use them judiciously not overwhelming the chart with a whole lot of 'em but sometimes they were very significant\n... mark keep in touch with us we'll probably talk with you on a New Year's eve or New
