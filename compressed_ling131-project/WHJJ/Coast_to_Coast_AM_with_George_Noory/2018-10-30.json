I Can't do that\nAs a human being or has a Christian but I think this has a Christian and a woman I wanted to see you think you know first of all I'm he called her a horse face she was trying to jump

they had\nWas temporarily side track 'em a booming economy or tried to bring down next man but more importantly it man has had\nActually a little lifestyle at home I yeah and that little one but a young white and blue and white and we had a president at in something so by all can't even talk about on on on radio in the oval office while I Will pay for it and with my tax dollars\nAnd everybody said oh she has a right to a private life if I did as if he did that\nWas over a decade about so I don't have a problem with can say whatever you want because you have to remember\nFrom its reactionary he fights you look at everything from his campaign going forward he has reactionary if you found him he's going to come back at you that's human nature and the second thing I guess\nIt's sad it's sad I'm white now I'm not a senior in high school by it and it but I'm I'm not an old guy there\nWhen I was a senior in high school I said that this country is nothing more than ... ... ... and it should be run like a death net I had started to successful business myself is that men and women don't have time for non stop and\nGet get a deal on we're not going to happen eating I have a meeting that have a meeting and then kept a committee and then that and that we don't have time for that they're spending our money and\nSo the fact that you're saying we need more gets home at the ... the ... when ...\n... he doesn't have money we need a businessman I voted for account and how can you know ... if anyone that would bankrupt it four times and they had me on that he could get back up yet I Know or\nI I I I have\nIncredible admiration for people that are fighters in it and she I think they are if people call in the race that\nBecause God Knows what kind of tired and other oh no yeah well I ... it has got mad or about ... ... he knows he yeah as I as a man on and uh and as a prior to that so I disagree with you on both of those um things\nAnd let's get let's get his comments data in your comments are warranted obviously and you have a right to say these things what can you want to jump in\n[noise] well ... ... regarding running it but I'm the country as a business I think you need to run the country as a country that the the single biggest enemy to any country a period is corruption\nThe business model does not protect us from corruption\nI think one of the things that when people say you run the country as a business let me give you an example I I think you know most businesses are bottom line oriented\nYou're not going to pay thirty thousand dollars for a screwdriver or toilet a year to pay the fair market value or even tried to get it to the last one I think when people say let's let the country run as a business\nThey're talking about things like that where let's not waste money as a nation\nYeah I Would I Would respect that I I Would I Would agree with that as well but it would also say that that our country is a republic with the constitution and the constitution works where we have the best country on earth we have the best system on earth\nThe thing that frightens me about it a bit a a a government run like a business is that the business model cannot protect you against corruption but the but the um Republican Ken that that's that's my position on that\nRight and you want to come as young as you want to comment on the president's tweeting\nYeah you know I I don't disagree with with um uh the fact that this you know porn star in it and our attorney are are self serving they absolutely are self serving what I Wish our president would do is just\nNot areas you know this dirty laundry in public I just wish it wouldn't happen\nNow but ... let me ask you this devil's advocate in by the way I've commented on his tweeting too because I I think he needs to be a little more presidential he's got some great ideas I'm not a a lot of great ideas I don't agree with everything he says\nBut I'd rather be a little more presidential a little more dignified when in back off the tweeting and stuff like\nThat but if he let them spot what they did without defending themselves then what happens to him\n[noise] I I think that was in their punishment would be what they've said and and um [noise] uh I don't know I think what he has done is dignify but\nIt is the argument and I and I don't think there is one\nI really don't\nKnow I mean somebody got paid a lot of money to to do what they did and she got it and I mean there was a reason for that who led to it who pushed it who knows\nIn ten years from now we

drivers helped unload whatever they're carrying you know I've seen I've seen trucks at night stopping off at the let's say like subway and they're you know the truck has park there and the truck

just a minute yeah please okay one of the things\nThat are are are is troubling demographers about China right now is there are a from a forty years old and under there are about Ninety million or um men or males\nOr without that have no prospect of marrying because there's no female counterpart because of of either gender based abortion or simply infanticide\nNinety million where are they they're in the military and the it's the there there is just a ton and and that that's what happens when you have an imbalance in your population\nSo that's another factor that China is dealing with\nDo you see another major war breaking oh\nNo I just I I I ...\nI just don't see any reason to do it well\nI'll tell you what what what I Do see is I think the future of the earth is the Americans and that is

know it just doesn't seem to be any reason for the for for that to to to take place even even with wackos like like a king John hurt on and on North Korea I don't see that happening are in fact I say I say what I see in in Korea is going to be a unification of\nThe north and the south [noise] do you know that the south is not having children\nThere for ... heard that oh you sound like about one to\nHere's my concern with though not from a country but from some terrorist group that obtains a new ... or something like that and they do it and try to planted on another country\nThat could happen that concerns me\nYeah that could happen but what concerns me is a demographer is if if you have a South Korea with you know what I'm saying is that the one child per couple you cannot maintain a market economy on a shrinking population you can't possible it has to grow\nSo I don't know what's going to happen there with the north in the south I really don't North Korea is about ... they're they're right at or just above replacement level fertility\nMichael in Jamestown North Carolina hey Michael go ahead\nYes Hi George and higher I guess my question is that uh is the trend going to

to thank you for that and for survey my friend I really appreciate that\nWell uh yeah thank you very much and uh yeah thank you for having me on on the program I I I Love this show\nI'm looking forward to this this is as you got to tell me well I mean what did the incredible background that you have in so many different things how did you get interested and involved in the paranormal\nWell it's ... the paranormal spin happening to me my whole life it started at age four with my first paranormal experience it was an ... experience a near death experience\nAnd just from that point on it just the these things have been happening randomly but quite frequently and uh I've always had it on the back burner I you know I've been doing all these other things\nAnd have a lot of different interests and it's always been on the back burner but it wasn't until recently that I decided to\nFinally put these all these experiences together into a book and a and then started talking openly you know not just with a couple of friends or family members but to to students and actually I teach a class now at the college I'm On the paranormal that's been a very popular just started this this semester\nThere's a lot of people Bruce or a little hesitant to come out and talk about their paranormal experiences some of them you know pilots they don't want to talk about UFO experiences as it's been a problem for you since you've come out and talked about this\nUh it it hasn't been I I understand the the the nervousness it or the fear even that they would have it I was a I was afraid of that uh that maybe people wouldn't take my work seriously\nUh or that I'd be ridiculed or the administration would find a way to maybe I I get an early retirement or something but I haven't found that to be to be true at all I I think what has happened is that people now see me as a safe person to share their experiences with and they often do so privately\nOr some of them actually I have two colleagues that are taking the paranormal class that I'm teaching\n'em to two of my colleagues at at the college so I it's been a very positive experience I guess the most negative thing I can think about there was um a friend of mine her daughter's a graduate student in history and she told her mother that uh well I think he's just committed academic suicide\n[laughter] you know that was the perspective of a graduate student I can understand that you're just starting out in your doctoral program that's something you probably don't want to tell your your graduate advisor\nYou know as as it's happening now Bruce and as you probably know the field of the paranormal and the activities and the studies it's really growing now isn't it\nI I I I Believe it is and it's and it's gaining acceptance and it's it's always had the and the scientific community of of which you know I I I have friends in the scientific community I'm not a I'm a social scientists historian\nA but from what I gather there there's always been a tremendous interest in the scientific community but it but a reluctance to uh to do much with it in fact I think ah my friend dean ... who's\nThe chief scientist at ions good guy he uh\nYeah seven he said they're Seventeen thousand five hundred institutions of higher learning and the world and there is only fifty\nFive zero academics openly interested in studying site and some of those are skeptics\nSo that's a very small percentage fifty out of at Seventeen thousand five hundred uh schools uh in in in ... or colleges and universities and from what he told me there's only five or six paranormal courses being offered in the United states right now which is very surprising\nAt one point at Duke University had a department that's due to all of this ... under GB Rhine and now it's not there anymore but there are still the J. B. Ryan Institute thank God you to study some of these things\nYeah no I it's it but I I think there is an eye confirmed this with with dean because he's doing and then you know he's traveling around the world talking about his research and very actively engaged in this research and\nThere seems to be a and I suggested to and there seems to be like a paradigm shift going on of of gaining acceptance and I think people are are increasingly you know professional people are are are increasingly\nA supporting the research and and talking about their experiences more more openly\nWell and I and I look at this program you know six hundred and twenty radio stations we're on we're podcasting or on the Internet uh there are other podcast he was out there dealing with the paranormal\nUh millions of listeners it's growing it's getting bigger and bigger and I think people Bruce are looking for answers that they can't find and other traditional places\nI I I think you're you're right and that's\nExactly what I've seen as people have come forward to you know colleagues and uh I've I've made a I'd make contacts with our um our custodial staff or at at that work at the college at night and they have incredible stories that I've just that it's just it as kind of blown me away and I never would have\nKnown unless somebody had said oh you should talk to a you know Mr D or whatever he is he works in this building a night and he's got some story so it's like they're telling their friends who are then calling me and and saying hey I got something I Want to share with you so I think it's\nI I think once\nMore people in positions of authority or or you know academics are professional people uh express their interest in and their support I think it's going to it's going to spread a lot faster\nWith Bruce ... latest book is called timeless the paranormal personal history he released thirty four issues and cases that he had and just an incredible thing because in the beginning you say that it's not that you don't believe in ghosts they believe in she tells me about that\nYeah I I think that uh it it well in fact it's my my my uh spirit friends who I I I Do have contact with a they told me that experience is believing and believing is experience\nSo this this initial experience I had at age four kind of open the floodgates for me and even though I tried to every once in a while put it on the back burner or because I didn't seem to have much control it just happened randomly these things\nUh it just kept coming back so they just kept coming back instead of a you know it it you know ... regardless of whether I wanted it to or not\nAnd then I just kind of accept that this is the ... this was the way my life is going to be and I just proceeded doing other things but it was always there in the background I think I was always destined to to explore this at a certain point in my life and ... and ... in the last couple of years that's that has been the the point at which to do this\nFirst one did you have if you can remember your first paranormal experience how old were you\nYeah that I was very I I was four but I Would and we had traveled to northern Norway or to an island two hundred miles above the Arctic Circle my parents are are from northern Norway from that island\nAnd we were staying with my grandmother for live there about nine months so it was a winter time\nAnd I was playing outside and I remember very distinctly what was going on and I I was a I got very sick very suddenly I just my body was getting stiff and achy Mike I couldn't move my head from side to side my neck was totally step I had this fever coming on\nAnd I went home and I got home to the old farmhouse we were staying my grandmother's home\nAnd she had this little bed in the in the kitchen and the old farmhouse kitchen because sometimes she would you know it should be baking for a long time and just wanted to take a little map and was too hard to go up the steep
