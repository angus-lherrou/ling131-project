um it's still not as scary in some respects of some of the things that are happening in science and that's why Michael Guillen was Clint joined us just a minute a couple of things in crypto news

to a and about coming up on coast to coast am and we'll start with Michael Guillen who is here the end of life as we know it ominous\nNews from the frontiers of science is his new book but you might know him better from\nABC News or from the History Channel where he hosts the show or from his other books including a novel they'll know prophecy he's in LA guy or you are you a dodger's fan Michael\nWell uh you know what I grew up rooting for the Dodgers are but I spent a lotta years in Boston\nHarbor day of my son was born in ... and I don't know I'm kind of caught between a rock and a hard [laughter] I understand that that's why I asked at a at a later on or\nIf you are obviously you you achieve great heights both in academia and in media and you are amongst I think in the lead group of science\nReporters people who actually write nonfiction about science in into very accessible way uh my we put you in the same category as Mary Roach are you a fan of hers\n[noise] you know I I I I'll be honest with you I'm not familiar with Mary\nRoach oh you're missing missing a terrific come in\nBut you know she's a she's a frequent guest here and but very very energy\nPainting and she writes I'm always about science and so she lives to explore particular subjects and so her book on for example what happens to the body after we die called stiff or ... or packing for Mars and wish you talked she tried to learn what it'd be like to go to Mars and all the things that would happen is she is just very I Love it\nYou know she's grey and you'd really like her in this kind of ... it was reminiscent to me a little bit on how you were getting into the subjects because you handle it with a very\nUm [noise] a very non scholastic approach it's the science is there but um anybody can follow these stories and everybody probably should if you want to get a glimpse into what the future is all about the students to be a great gift for\nFor Christmas if you if you have a a young scientist and you're on your list some urban old scientist for that matter but looking ahead you know I ... if you pardon the pun I was just talking about Larry King and he was he was talking about he he believes he's a big believer\nIn cryogenic [noise] yeah yeah a lot you know there's also that famous baseball connection with you Ted Williams family in ...\nBut I mean yeah I what what is the science these days on something like that and how realistic is this would disappear for somebody like Larry King do hope that he will be able to come back again and take his place behind home plate in the few huh\n[laughter] well first of all thank you for the kind words I I have spent my entire life communicating science I tried to make it as interesting as I can you know I spent fourteen years at\nA ABC News as you indicated good morning America Tony Tony Nightline and you know you have to you have to make things interesting or they'll give you the Huck basically [laughter] uh I've kind of cut my teeth on that\nAs far as cryogenic says concerned you know it's interesting you bring that up and I've covered the cryogenic story over the years ah you know they're in the stories that Walt Disney had his head\nA frozen and ah with with the hope one day of uh of being brought back to life\nThe head being the most important part because it carries our memories or thoughts and so forth and so on but you know I got to be honest with you that's like old school um what I ... in in the sense that now with what's going on with robotics and so forth ... ... it's more likely that um\nWhat Larry King is going to want to do is you know before he kicks the can uh you know he's going to want to upload all his thoughts and memories or\nOnto a super computer and then downloaded onto a very realistic robot so that Larry King [laughter] can ah can remain behind home plate you know indefinitely into the future but I'm Serious\nYou know in my book um the end of life you know what I deal with these four big topic areas or the first is the worldwide Web the second is an artificial intelligence robots that third has to do with privacy and surveillance technology and the fourth has to deal with genetic engineering so\nBetween genetic engineering and artificial intelligence robot man I'm telling you Larry King is going to be around for a long long\nTime ago and I was reading some of those sanctions in I thought that was interesting because there really as you said when he was very I think you mentioned like ... once the ... there's not a big emphasis on it but there is still this hope that people have about\nPreserving their essence and and then that becomes of course a full debate about what we're is the seat of the essence of us you know we used to think the soul was the heart and the head contained all of the you know the the computer works but\nBut you do with how realistic is it ever in any near future that we would be able to upload thoughts in dreams like you might expect from Minority Report being able to capture them and then put them into something else\n[noise] I think it's very real or in I mean you know and and and you indicated about the my book being about the future but but the truth of it is it it's\nReally about what's going on right here and right now even as we speak and ... in labs all over the world\nUh I tell for example the story of Iran must uh being very very involved well you know he's involved in driverless cars these involved in outer space and going to Mars and so forth and so on but he's also got his finger in this whole neural net\nWith the dream of becoming the scientists since the second grade really\nAnd that dream took me to UCLA then on to Cornell where I got my PHD in physics and astronomy and then as I said on the Harvard where I taught physics for about eight or nine years and so\nIt was during my grad school years at Cornell when I started asking myself how did this universe that I've been studying come to be an\nExport into wisdom and Buddhism and Islam and transcendental meditation and Judaism and finally um I met this girl this girl came into my life\nAnd she challenged me to read the Bible and I was interested I was like five or not I I just thought it was just too familiar to prosaic\nBut anyway it's it changed but it was a game changer for me I don't want to get into all of it so I became a man of faith faith\nI'm a Christian and I take my my face very very seriously and so when I\nSay we need to call upon the fruits of human spirituality I'm Talking about ethics morality religion ancient wisdom whatever your faith system is I I don't particularly care even if you're an atheist ... there are some innovations in this book\nThat I think we need to reflect on and say okay just

[noise]\n\n\n\nMichael Guillen former science reporter for ABC News on various shows and former instructor of physics at Harvard as well as the author and the new book is ah is is just great it's a the end of life as we know it and just before we went into the break we were talking about\nThat that space in discussions of what we should and ought to do which\nMight be better informed by discussions of morality as much as ethics and and you know I think even Michael when you were talking about\nAbout the idea of preserving physical life uh on this planet is like the weather that was through uploading a brain and putting it into something you know into a robot or something you know even that it makes me\nSo um the question then becomes do we I mean you know it's exciting it's it's interesting it's it's like science fiction come true but then when you get past all that kind of the bells and whistles of it all you have to ask you know do we really want to do this and there's an even deeper question that I raised\nIn the book and that is with all the genetic engineering were doing and you know the extent these the extinction efforts are do come under the category of genetic engineering why we're doing in is something that's never been done before and that is we are elevating recessive trade\nAnd we're going to trade in other words we're fine in the face of the very forces that have created these species the evolutionary forces sure we're defining the natural\nFlow were to find the natural order of thing and you got to believe that when you take on Mother Nature remember the old commercial you don't don't mess with Mother Nature or something like that\nYeah it's nice to nice to mother nature\nYou know that the one yeah it's not nice I forget what it was the Marshall was margarine night\nIt was very mired in for a merger and right yeah I own a margarine is not so great for us right now so [laughter] but\nYou gotta wonder that because we are doing this we now have the ability of elevating recessive traits than suppressing dominant trait were flying in the face of Mother Nature we had to pay a price\nAnd he can't do that you're you're you're fighting against\nYou know a ... billion according to science you know billions of years of evolution right as we do that if we take it on or who's going to be the casualty I'm thinking we are\nI you know this is the ultimate question and I I mean you know I was reading the DEA extinction thing and I'm not sure that if they brought back quote unquote a wooly mammoth what we really wouldn't have is\nThere's still woolly or elephant you know but much in the same way that we have a sweeter orange right or we have a a a a juicy or beach or something that people do by\nFlipping genetic codes around here there and I'm not saying that that smart either but but I think I'm more worried about some of this idea about the the ... some of the robotics that you talk about\nAnd and what that what that really means ... who's gonna decide\nWhen robots have really gone far enough and are we going to be in a situation as crazy as it sounds words like sky net and it'll be too late the robots will you know there'll be self teaching and we're out\nWell you know again that's a very real possibility I um\nI tell this story about this guy I think his name is Anthony ... is a former Google engineer a big into driverless cars I'm so he he he helped launch way mo which is the driverless car\nA division of of Google right and then went to her and then got involved in this ugly law suit or stealing or industrial secrets and so for the sun but [noise]\nHe recently applied to the area and was granted I'm\nA tax exempt status for what he's calling the church of artificial intelligence [noise] and\nYou know on the surface it sounds a little bit crazy but when you look into what the thinking his thinking behind doing that he's he's basically saying this look\nIf we continue in the trajectory we're now on\nIt it it is an avid ... one day\nA artificial intelligence robot powered by artificial intelligence will will become so much more intelligent than we that they really reached the level of a deity they they they are in effect God because\nThey know everything they see everything they they don't control everything if we give them that kind of freedom\nAnd so we may as well just start getting ready to worship it because we want to stay on its good side because God I did that this technology we're creating will run amok and you know you start thinking well okay it's a little crazy this guy but\nYou know it's not that far fetched because the rate at which artificial intelligence is\nIt is developing you know I talk about how it beat the pants off of the chess champion and then the checkers champion and now it can beat the chance that the you know Texas hold them poker and the uh the gang go which is generally conceded to be the most complicated game most ancient game around go yeah\nYeah I probably and every once in a while\nYou write an artificial and tell us now can beat the pants off her her you know the the goat champion and so\nPrinted that writing is on the wall in I mean it it's pretty clear that these computers and not just going to become fans there they're no longer just fancy adding machine there no there are no longer just doing computations\nAh but they're they're becoming more adept at doing things that we post about are we once posts about being very good at that well you know I hear they're ... button it up by saying they're generally like he was still pretty small\nBut you know one day they're general like he was forced seem to be even greater than ours that the day of the singularity that's for a day when all singularity him one day we'll have the equipment IQ of you know ten thousand\nTwo hundred and twenty five so\n[noise] yeah and it I think the interesting these are the two is it ... the equation is was used in a hundred and twenty five and we're using that as like a horizon line for human intelligence right we go with an IQ one twenty five\nBut at the smarter machines get and the more the takeover of our day to day activities\nAnd or the more they do things for us and we allow them to be in the driver's seat of our lives who's just said that that that average IQ isn't going to drop ten points\nSo we we'd like to think that we might stay but the more we get cushy our brains get ... and who knows it might be a lot we might be bringing on our own physical demise faster than right than we would have possibly imagine so\n... are like that the cushy ... yeah I'm right because you know the old saying if you don't use it lose that you lose a yeah no but I talk about I think I caught one guy that that you know it may very well be that we are in the process\nOf creating our own conquer the yes raising with at the right now I fully believe that completely and it it and let's pick this up and coming up after the top of the hour because I'm saying like [noise] like marriages like democracy like friendships [noise]\nI think our life as we know it is much more fragile then people would like to think it

[noise]\n\n\n\nI Want to move here to leave some time to talk about future of privacy where we rest right now at this frontier of all of this home technology with Michael Guillen in a moment but I I wanted to wrap up the\nConversation about uh about trends humans as you talk about them in the book people who are becoming part of something else or used physical um enhance Mintz from technology to be able to compensate for\n'em either for injury or for a deformity and there's a couple of those that are very entertaining like the guy with the built in vibrate or in some of the other stuff that's\nIn the book but the part I thought it was really interesting and I just I wanted to mention that because I I I think there is this idea of the eggs those skeleton I'm ... I Know several people who have a ... who has a\nTrouble walking or they lost their ability to walk in the spinal injuries and and that this to them as a dream I mean the I Do just being able to walk across the room because of a of an exit skeleton that carries their body or ... their muscles are stimulates their muscles are all three\nOf I I Can't think of a downside to that other than the military application I guess a but where are you with that one\n[noise] no I I agree with you I'm a and I I think that you have that discussion that I have in the book about\nTrans humanism and you know that's there's actually a movement are called the trans human movement where\nAs you say ... or the ideas to enhance ourselves one way or another using technology and I break it down into three categories that they usable or trends human augmentation there's so there's usable there's where a ball and then there's implantable\nAnd I I agree with you I I ... this is an area where I see very little downside\nI mean I tell the story of the sky from Dayton, Tennessee who he was a power lines when he touched a high voltage line that was lying on the ground and he'd lost both arms to the vet them right off now here's a guy who would have you know live the rest of his wife you know of severely crippled\nAnd and now scientists are creating for him what are called neuro prostheses prostheses but see these are artificial arms but not like your grandfather's artificial arms\nYou know that we are mechanical that requires you to wear a harness and you have to know these are these are arms\nThat he can move with his car so they're they're wired to his mind\nAnd I know some fantastic oh yeah and\nAnother story that I tell about the woman who is a quadriplegic and now you know she she's able to have some level of independence and uh because of of some of the trans human augmentation um so I Know I I I agree with you name it even and um [noise]\nEven in the military setting I mean if we if we can outfit our soldiers so that\nYou know they're wearing an exoskeleton I talk about how on day has come up with some stuff there yeah where you know write it just it just it it you know so so or a soldier who's out there and he's carrying you know what I fifty sixty pounds back ...\nYou know if if if they if we can give them an extra fell Scott what's on the take some of that load off of their own skeletons I I think that the\nI think it would be a stretch to find fault in something like that\nOr maybe but maybe I've seen robocop more times than you have I mean I think that I mean and I do I'm not I'm not\nBeing facetious I think that's the only one I'm here's why there's always this belief somehow that if we can if we could come up with the technology\nThat saves our soldiers from from harm inevitably that decades weaponized into and yeah we can invade without losing any soldiers and therefore there's no political consequence\nYeah from the ... and ... and ... you know back to 'em that idea about I'm\nAbout maybe some of our advancements should not be consequences free is that I think that that's the ... I get worried a little bit and maybe that's the science fiction part of me that I see\nThat politicians would rebel at the thought of not having to be accountable for anybody's death by having super soldiers that can go in and take whatever we want 'em until the embittered enemy that we've created does this one but then I never really it's a new arms race\nNo no you're absolutely right in and I again I talk about that but you know it's interesting as you look ahead to what this technology is pointing to\n[noise] and ah you know we're talking about enhancing sold a human soldiers abilities but I think are equally realistic will be a you know a robot warriors and effect Terminator like warriors that will be our surrogate going into war and so we spare\nCould possibly go wrong there [laughter] yeah [laughter] and you know I quote that sounds like a plan [laughter] yeah I Know\nAnd and now and and the ... group you know I caught them in the book in Russia is\nVery upfront about them doing that they're I mean they're in the process of doing that and they're talking about unveiling some other stuff soon\nOr using neural net says it's just a fancy way of saying these are robot warriors that have human like brain the question then becomes do you get such warriors the right\nTo make the decision to shoot or not should in other words to give them complete autonomy and and that is called the Terminator conundrum right now yeah nations are thinking about well gee if we give our robot warriors complete autonomy then that basically going to make Russians do the same thing and now we're going to be as you said a moment ago and\nWe're going to be now and another escalating arms race\nSo right yeah ... it in some ways you know that I often I often think to myself you know all this technology is brand new it's unprecedented but we can't are just still the same\nYou know so oh our faults in our ... our weaknesses\nAnd are downsides just get magnified by this technology the technology doesn't eliminate our weaknesses in our foibles and are downsides you you know what I'm saying to you\nYeah I Do and ... and ... and yet I Would propose\nTo you may be the biggest problem we would face in the law of unintended consequences would dictate\nThe Sarah Connor conundrum\nThat's the Terminator conundrum but to Sarah Connor ... which means you can't win a conventional war because you're over welcomed by the technology\nOf the your opponent you go unconventional and you'd go gorilla end this creates more terrorism and you know I mean\nThat's that's how eventually she was able to beat the I don't want to spoil the ending for some term in there but you know I mean that's how that's how you know she will one is eventually learning to to you know to go to grill her way out of it not to face the enemy but to be the enemy by you know going [noise]\nUh and his weaknesses\nBut but positive for setting because whenever you mentioned Russian scientists I'm reminded of the story about the the scientist that want to put a a a new had an old hat on a new body right\nYeah yeah okay well had transplants yeah yeah\nOkay so let's let's pick that up [laughter] that's one of those that's one of those Halloween he kind of moments right there were like All right now that\nThis is this is one of those nightmare dream things depending on where you are with that I could understand if somebody had um a body that was decaying but their brain was brilliant and you wanted to put it on a new body but then\nWhere does that end and how far along are they in that pursuit\n[noise] yeah well you know what I've been reporting on that story for some years\nOh and um it began with a small number of scientists um\nWho experimented on monkeys and it gets a little grizzly but this being Halloween okay ah where they yeah they severed monkeys head and then they re attached it\nOr just to prove that they could so there's a lot of plumbing involved right I mean you have so up they they the the veins in the arteries and the nerves and so forth and so on and they've they've scientists have achieved to\nLevel of success with monkeys and so now emboldened\nBy that they are turning their attention to doing it to human and there's at least one guy and Russia who's been coated frequently or who is a quadriplegic or you know otherwise mentally very alert\nAnd he says yeah come and do it to me man I'm I'm ready I'm I Want to be that guinea pig and there are scientists who are her were quoted as saying yeah they're going to do it\nInternet of things devices so we call it I O T I talk about it in the book and the Chinese or the this as an opportunity to ... to spy on us and we are they willing accomplices because we're buying these gadgets bringing them into our own home you're talking about the show key thing in\nWhether that's true or not it's entirely possible and I tell the story in the book of a woman who was murdered\nI don't want to give away the story but she was murdered and the police started looking into\nThe the situation and the husband was claiming one thing he said there was an intruder and how they came in\nHe killed he killed his wife and the basement and we started looking at things and they found she was wearing a watch\nHang onto the thought because we need to hear the end of that coming up after this break then we'll give

[noise]\n\n\n\nI'm Michael before we started getting all these calls waiting for you let's ruled that story back about twenty seconds before we can cause I was ... I had to cut you off but we're going to the bottom of the hour and it's a heartbreak so I could pass on that [noise]\nOh yeah no I was just telling you the story of a a murder that happened to Connecticut and or the husband claimed one story and the police looked into it or his wife was murdered and he claimed one story in\nWhat they police found was that the woman was wearing the deceased woman wearing a fit with one of these little smart watches that you know keeps track of your heart rate how are you walk and so forth and so they downloaded the data from the fit fit\nAnd they found out that the they could actually get this calculate how many feet chi walk and it didn't square with the story from the husband\nAnd then and then other things started happening with Facebook in other words what I'm\nSaying is sure that that technology out at this husband he ended up being charged with murder because of this this kind of\nAnd I was I remember that yeah yeah they\nThey won't have soles God didn't make him they won't have soles there'll be like zombies there'll be like and I was like no they weren't so I mean I think some of it as an education piece in and I think that's where great science writing in science journalism in a book like this is really helpful\nBecause it really makes clear to people who how complicated these issues are but what's the great benefit or not for us in the long run that's the part I'm focused on myself but anyway [laughter] and I think\nIf you you're you're absolutely right and that is why I wrote the book people can have their own opinions but you have to be well informed in order to have a sense right when you write up after you read this book you'll have you'll be well informed and then God Bless you with your opinion\nRight and and God Bless you in five years this may be totally irrelevant right because by that time the beds and you're going to have to write a sequel the end of the world is end of life as we know what let me get to Jason in Portland for Michael Guillen on coast to coast Jason\nYeah they um ... playing God is kind of baked into I D I F ... when they say that we are created in the image of God that kind of you know is put into\nOur sense then ... now\nInto my question before I get I if I read the uh your schedule right are you going to be talking about the subject of immortality on Tuesday night\nOh coast may be\nYeah I Will yeah but yeah I don't give it a little plug for an up there I think you where you were\nTalking about immortality and I don't know exactly where it is but in the book of revelation I talk about your mortality\nAnd when the wrath of God is or out of a ... fine it says that they will pray that they would die and they were not able to and they asked for the ... mountains in stone to come down and in and cover them up\nAnd are they talking about it if you're if you're talking where we've achieved immortality\nThis is this is an interesting premise again is whether it's immortality would be a blessing or a curse a ... you know that uh that is the the portrait of Dorian Gray ... what's your thought on that Michael\n[noise] well it it's a I have a couple of thoughts about that and that is number one uh you know obviously as a theoretical physicist and and as a serious minded Christian I I'm fascinated by finding a references in the Bible that might give us some glimpse a summer camp\nAs to what what's in store for us and how it jibes or doesn't jibe with what's going on in science I just find that just it's fascinating intellectually fascinating er and and so I I'd I'd love to think for about this reference the revelation [noise]\nI I think also my other thought is\nYou know do does does a supercomputer and this is this is a kind of um of a mental a question or a mental experiment that people talk about a lot ... ... we don't want you reach a point where we create\nAn artificial intelligence being whether it's in the form of a big computer server or it's in the in the body of a hunky Alyssa a kind of a role of human like robot but get so complex and so beyond\nThe you know has an existence that is beyond the human experience that you cannot unplug it\nYou know it's like that guy net running it's like running on\nOn energy that it absorbs from the environment I mean that's\nThe word from saying or for the crush souls of the people in stumps on on you know getting I think you can and some coffee [laughter] yeah I get that I think that happens\nWith some of our technology now right after you haven't you ever been in a situation where you\nKnow you're you're like try and everything stop you know that that piece of machinery is going great stop stop stop and oh I don't like it and it goes on you know [laughter]\n... tell me about I spent the last two weeks trying to get a Kenmore elite dishwasher ... so ... ... ... this is exactly where I'm living and by the way to is somebody with a I mean I have a masters of divinity degree I Would just say\nIt's really interesting about the Bible in this the the only problem is the Bible is multi vocal on the subject\nOf immortality life after death et cetera so it's really great because it creates more conversations but it doesn't always resolve them so keep that in my let me go to a let me go to a ... who is in Arizona on coast to coast saying David\nHey my question for example and the ethical and moral conflict created by doing the strings artificial intelligence\nUm one would be the result\nYou keep breaking up dude you're killing that gives it sounds like a really good question [laughter]\nYeah they do we just lose him\nAnd we just left\nA oh no Well James is in the in the Washington Let's try him while we still have a minute for Michael Steele and before we go to open lines coming up on coast to coast James\nI enjoy your show but um [noise] I've been on a machine going on forty five\nYears yes er here and I was a banker degeneration\nI'd like you know from your guest or what you feel that the shoe will be overcome through Christ or or or maybe a ... either by big I'll take my answer off the air\nAnd hang in there James hang in there James we need every one of you [noise] go ahead Michael\nYeah what what what kind of I didn't get what kind of machine is he on\nHe's on dialysis is on kidney machines and he has macular degeneration\nJust like my friend yeah no I think this is where are the technology really is very helpful\nUm they they are making enormous strides now or with restoring people's site with macular degeneration I'd actually interviewed a woman\nWho had the operation and you know even though her fight it they'll not crystal clear she can she can make out fate and it's given her an enormous amount of independence but we're making enormous strides they're already working there's this one company in particular in California I talk about that or is already working on a second generation\nAh that will help actually restore sight the people who are born blind not never mind with macular degeneration so I see a lot of hope on that also and the kidney front I don't think we need to create these by merit\nA there's a lot of great research and I've reported on for ABC News and elsewhere where they are now able to create using stem cell or ... it might\nCreate a artificial Oregon so\nThat are more tailored for the the person yeah yeah I'm In\nTheir brother is you know that that is really where the technology is very helpful\nAnd that's where we'll have to end it with Michael ... book picks up the rest of the thank you so

here's the story on coast to coast am wrote in\nDowntown Oregon City there are fears that but at least that's the\nTheory behind paranormal activity witness that find the real treat a can of its dispensary\nBehold if you dare this surveillance video from ... watched the glass tip jar on a counter slowly it starts to move that's Andy ... next to it\nEither what's happening and I felt like somebody was standing\nRight here suddenly the jar bombs on the level surface that has happened then Andy remembered the surveillance camera with all the jar\nNot long after that this happened to watch the Penn it's completely skill and no one's around when suddenly the pen to begin to move\nAnd if you think the video has been dumped her as a candidate shop that would be against the law ... terrified ... key and Samantha Davidson says at the turn of the century this building space with\nYou one of the ... so so yeah so this could have been a pharmacy and maybe there's no real explanation for why there are gone there\nBut that video ... especially ... and the fact that ... what really got me was because it's a kind of a shop law mandates they can't touch the video\nSo what was it I don't know but if you go and look at it you want to jump in on open lines of the daddy let me go to a Mike in Charlotte North Carolina on coast to coast to get us started Mike\nGood morning

[noise] I I'm with you in your it I mean we're the incident in a\nRow the Bible says the dead are aware of nothing because\nThey sleep right uh you know we can try to play God but I I I it's impossible because we are not God that was all I have to say\nWell that's fair enough I mean I it thanks for calling you know I think the the issue of that sold peace though is a little more complicated so a lot of people would say then it if it's a version if it's forty percent of who you were\nLike we did have a soul if other people out there have you know uh other meant if there are other people who have uh the problems with their mental capacity due to injury or disease you know we don't say it was suddenly they're less human than they have less of a soul\nI'm so I'm not I'm with you in theory well I'm with you in theology young soul um but I think there's much trickier question than just saying they wouldn't for sure because that used to be the thing that people said about test to babies and I think we're we fortunately moved beyond that\nUh okay let's get to where we got a lot of people standing by which is always fun Aaron is in Richmond, Virginia on coast to coast Aaron\nHi um I and world power guys first of all for not let in for five years I don't want to get too much into her bright\nUm after ... ... and I I have a couple of things to say on this whole and mark how are the black or hurt 'em a revival manner and what had happened to the things he ... that were to survive\nI mean wouldn't even know what to jail interested environment now and furthermore\nIn our current situation right now we have there are a lot of people storing up first survival situation is and there are a religious groups such as the Mormon too are you know highly compiling surprise for\nFor years to come for for them is\nFormer ... with multiple wives with multiple shelter with multiple multiple and um and we don't really we are not really touch it whether or not we\nAre usable ... we don't know even with\nTraining we all know asked me supplies what's this phone somebody who was in a cave or in a whole or in a ditch or whatever I mean so I Would hurt or you like to I'm falling scare myself not to\nA consuming somebody supplies but just chill on my cell and my child\nEven I hesitate to say my child but I Would like to offer a myself to give her trial like for a year on one of the supplies without training without any\nKnowledge of how to use the supplies to just hear somebody could even his veins and sell\nAn interesting you don't really know even with like Mormon families if there was a huge disaster you don't know who is going to survive it could be a child it could be a twelve year old kid\nWho hasn't had any training on how the year the supplies that are stored up with ... or or wherever I'm\nOkay well I think that's a really interesting proposal and I I I just wanted because there's a lot of listeners who are a latter day saints and so I just would be a clear\nFor people most LDS do not practice plural marriage ran the overwhelming number of them do but to her point I was watching on Netflix a there's a series called uh like the men with three wives zero three wives club or something I don't know\nBut it's about a renegade\nA Mormon sect community and everybody generally in the community has more than one wife and their the following some of these and that's in Utah near Moab\nAnd um and that they they've already talked about saving up than having enough food for these big giant families to last for seven years that's a lot\nI mean and what it even work Kennedy even work I don't know\nA ... but uh yeah so air willing to be a volunteer but um I think the only thing I ever get to bring your kids\nAre done is in a in

number of things that I don't want to put up a lot of your time that regarding the caller about the immortality relation nine [laughter]\nBasically to wrap it up the turtle man is one concept that he spoke about any caught about and I wondered if you've ever heard of that book I just learned that recently by Truman Napster and there's a very good Youtube video Joseph Smith and the recovery of

discipline\nA if any discipline that you study whether it be science or whether it be a Bible for instance uh you can't just take a a ship if you go to the wealth of knowledge you need to take a big

the Korean has deep roots in the Old Testament and\n... and the new this and the New Testament to the ...\nYeah I mean the the story the story of the prophet Jesus in the current is is significant it's a it's a big portion of the current\nThat try and even the story of the floods\nThe story of Jesus in the car and all of that validates not counting the historical values a historical cruise you know that that line up with a so many of the stores in the Bible a\nMini the many of the critics don't believe that it's even possible for Daniel to be real because\nOf the historical value of the book uh Daniel is so accurate and ah and if it hadn't been found and the dead sea scrolls you know they ... they were you know people would have said well it was impossible for\nDaniel to know as much of the future as he is he did\nBut that that Cruz when you look at the courage there and you look at a big picture the heart the grace of the Old Testament and the New Testament this has done so much

but\nI did a I'm a I was writing I wrote an article about um about the true crime texts I'm interested in how true crime stories are told [laughter]\nAnd I was interested in how many troops um how many murders stories there are in the Bible\nAnd that the basis for true crime as we know it today the ... the popular genre on any platform that the basis for that it starts in the Bible and that these true crime stories really are these murders stories or or had the same effect they're teaching us a lesson which is what the murder stories still do\nWhat I found was when I looked at 'em delays stories were told in the Koran they actually use the word murder\nWith regard to Jesus they where is the Bible says you know in in the Greek portion of the the ... of the Bible and the New Testament the Greek word says kill but actually the word that's often used uh the Arabic word is that Jesus was murdered\nAnd I find that very a very interesting distinction that that Muslims see that and that's the way they look at it and he was murdered and I don't think murder comes up\nA lot when we think about him in a Judeo Christian context but I'm just throwing that out yeah I don't know if they find that interesting or not but I did\nThat that corporate I Want to be careful how I say this do you think that corporate Christianity has a you know or Christianity for higher so to speak
