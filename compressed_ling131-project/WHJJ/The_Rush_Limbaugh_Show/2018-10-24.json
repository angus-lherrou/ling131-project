it look likely insane lunatics are also on the Republican side disorder cancel out the impact of lunacy on your side as average American voters\nPerceive it\nOkay let's get some of the election analysis them in terms are\nThirteen Days away two weeks ago from yesterday\nTom ... who co founded real clear politics and it is a it's a website that many political scientists political operatives\nA political experts cite constantly what what real clear politics does among many other things is average all of the so called response civil polls out there into something called a real clear politics average of polls\nAnd political experts from across the aisle site real clear politics and trusted as an unassailable source so Tom ... cofounder of this place\nWas on ah the Fox Business Network today\nHe said that if there was a blue wave that it would be cresting at this point meaning it'd be building we'd be we'd be seeing the top up here and Tom Bevan sat in all of polling data that they have it real clear politics and analyzing it's not\nThere is no crafting there is no blue wave after wave was coming it would be building he says and it isn't but on the other hand the generic ballot is holding meaning the\nDemocrats are not running away with it they still have a ... depending on three to five point lead in the generic ballot but they're not expanding it there's no growth there is no Democrats pulling away as what happened with a blue wave Trump's job approval is rising\nDemocrats are in the advantage ... says but they're not building on anything there's no way and that's gonna wash everything away and leave only Democrats standing\nHe says the house races are really tight they are race by race real battles hand to hand combat is how he described it\nHe forecast that Democrats might win the house that they do have an advantage right now because they have a range of Seventy competitive races\nAnd the range of pick up as they look at polling data now\nIs anywhere from Democrats picking up ten to forty one is seats\nThey're projecting a democratic pickup of twenty five and a half seats which give him a slight advantage Democrats need to pick up twenty three that's the magic number anything above that Democrats have an advantage in the house the range of the pickup according to the polling data real clear politics takes a look Savage anywhere from ten to forty one seats they project\nPick up a twenty five states twenty five and a half so two and a half seats more than they need but with even a tiny shift in just a couple of races there GOP can hold the house [noise]\nSo all of this synthesized and stripped away and they went to bear essence there isn't a blue wave there isn't this blue wave that's going to sweep every Republican away and leave only Democrats standing\nThe generic ballot is not moving and Democrats favor Trump's approval numbers are rising all her on the Senate side ... and real clear politics project the Republicans are going to gain two seats two weeks ago they were predicting no change\nRepublicans wouldn't gain or lose any two weeks before that the Democrats were going to pick up seats in the Senate so in the past month we've gone from Democrats picking up a couple two Republicans gaining a couple and that's the momentum and that's the trend\nAnd he made the point that it's a whole new world with Trump\nGender gap education gap the rural urban gap all of these things don't mean mean nearly as much as they have in the past week cause of Trump neutralizing much of it [noise]

and might video that came out during his presidential campaign to Russia to they'd even gone so far as to try to ruin the wife of judge Kavanaugh nothing has worked\nWhat makes you think that they wouldn't do something that's whoa it tell\nAlong along those lines if you want to look at it that\nWay it doesn't make any sense for a Republican or conservative to do this if they really care about winning leaves elections this makes no sense to do\nThis is going to be instant fodder for the Democrats in the media to blame it on Trump and his supporters and or his uh there's there's ... it doesn't make any sense for a Republican or conservative to do this if they care about the elections none whatsoever but flip that\nFlip that around once you make a lot of sense for a democratic operative or a Democrat in cocaine and the lunatic to do it because things are not working out the way they thought do\nNot forget this is why I'm spent so much time dwelling on this today and the psychology that's that that's attached to this this is not going the way they have assured us\nBut the last nine months it was going to go more importantly it's not going the way they believed it was going to go they believe they're allies remember they believe their pollsters\nIf the pollsters tell them there's a big way based on the generic ballot they believe that they get it in their heads and I believe it and they start reporting it and they just compounds itself and it becomes even more intensely believed it becomes gospel\nAnd then it doesn't\nAnd then the things that are supposed to cement it like think Kavanaugh trick backfires and these mobs are backfiring they are not achieving their objectives\n[noise] so if you flipped this around and you've got this you've got this this this mob of people flooding the border by intention\nThere's no way that helps the Democrats don't and the Democrats as I said let me grab the let me grab Lee a tweet here is really strange ladies and gentlemen I'm going to quote the creepy porn star a lawyer but Here's Michael ...\nThere is too much at stake in the mid term shut the Democrats do allow the Republicans to use this caravan which is so obviously a set up as a wedge issue it is time for the Democrats to step up and be strong on border security we\nCan be painted as a week and then look for this in addition to what are you saying here\nMake it did U.S Russia a truly an honor to speak with you so well I was holding for you a couple of things popped in my head and I'll get to the point two seconds\nThese are all deep state leaders that these quote unquote bombs are going to Hillary and and you know and and ... and all these guys and then Brennan the deep state\nAnd this is right out of the play the Clinton playbook if you ah go back in time to I Believe it was two thousand eight when Hillary was going against uh Hussein Obama\nThe uh iron my shirts folk started coming out I don't know if you recall that or not I'm sure you do with your memory\nOr yeah and I think I'm responsible for that because of a joke I used to tell about Hillary\n... yeah and so Michele milk and you know put that to bed as far as it was you know it was a plant\nWill tell people what it was ... tell me because I stepped on it tell people what it is\nOh sure sure so back in two thousand and eight or in order to garner sympathy and empathy for the health of east um there was a gentleman or series of gentleman that were walking around the Hillary camp for president campaign of two thousand and eight\nWith signs saying iron my shirts iron my shirts of course because of you know can't have a woman for president those you know those sexist Republicans\nRight and we'll watch or we're going to do Hillary and be a domestic beer housewife ... or in my shirt didn't fix dinner and get my slippers that kinda thing right\nIt was a point it was a plant in it and it was all it was all nonsense to garner apathy in\nSeparate it was already plan to go to waste it was Hillary's plant there was nobody legitimately anti Hillary doing that\nRight correct that's another time telling you I gave them the idea but anyway I don't want to step on it keep going with the story\nSo so anyway Michelle milk and came up with a good piece and basically could it's a bad from a follow up that this was a plan\nAnd it was all a facade like everything is with the Clintons a great professor called the ... rush it taught me one time with the ... there are no coincidences and there are no\nAh are you there is nothing that set in stone with these people not everything is manufactured everything is made up\nAnd so I don't trust them look at Nancy Pelosi down in Miami\nFor someone who is quote unquote running for her life millionaire Nancy was taking her time walking down the stairs\nOr somebody was open the door for her while she's being shouted that I Believe that's a set up I don't want to sound like a conspiracy theorist here but take a look at it it's a bunch of nonsense and I don't trust the Democrats never have you never let a good conspiracy theory go the way I could never let a good crisis\nGo exactly rush no you're you're ... you're right about the Clintons there are no coincidence is with them as soon as I say this is a philosophy that I have a stove for four years on this program asking people to\nNever forget there are no coincidence and live and the fact you know you said it is they're all deep state players a Soros bill and Hillary or Obama and so forth\nUm if it is curious they're they're they're not even on the radar in in the mid term when you get down to what other then they're trying to get themselves on the radar but\nSee that's I think they're trying to get noticed the Clintons desperately need to be noticed all the time and Obama is trying to recapture some glory trying to show everybody he can still move the needle isn't working now the reason I think I'm responsible for the\nWhat was it iron my shirts I used to the rush\nTo excellent store open up you know with some funny jokes line stories and so forth from I Would tell people that I just met Mrs Clinton I'm a week before\nAnd it was the strangest strangest thing that we ended up in an elevator together and just the two of us and she said you know I could never say this outside this elevator but\nI I have\nEverything you do on

democratic nominee which has happened the dissenters campaign\nPounced to see Republicans always ... in the media Republicans towns Democrats David but Republicans ... ...\nIt's now abundantly clear goes there just sent this statement that the Andrew Gillum\nHas repeatedly lied about taking free gifts and trips from lobbyists to feel lie about these gifts and trips and lobbyists on national TV what else\nIs he lied about once a close friend of ... this Corey Feldman is at the center of the FBI's long running investigation into corruption in Tallahassee\nNo one's been charged with anything and Gillum has said that agents assured him he was neither a target and or a focus of the probe just like call me told Trump\nGillum has repeatedly given vague answers to questions about who pay for

a lot of people want is a big deal okay a trip to New York Hamilton tickets big\nSky won't tell the truth about it is the big ...\nBut I think this is chump change compared to what's really at stake here I I think it chump change is wrong because it is a window into he'll Gillum is and he is somebody that wants to parlay his positions of power\nIn too positive influential goodies for himself\nHe is a classic a politician in that regard who believes the holding high office equals an entitlement to perks and uh and the other thing is willingly a desirous of sticking them\nAnd it's a [noise] in in this in this era where everybody feels the need to denounce the special interest and not being beholden to them a Gillum can't make that statement now let's look at the polling data Quinnipiac University poll yesterday\nShowed that Andrew Gillum is headed ... fifty two to forty six among the light ... voters\nAnd he has a double digit lead among women Hispanics and independence\nAnd it's the third such poll in about a week ten days to show Gillum with this clear to lead as is overall edge in public polling why do its largest level since October first [noise]\nOkay so give me is a character he is a person with cloud of suspicion\nThat are hanging all over him in addition to that he is a hard left wing activist tack who refers to Florida as his collective he looks at things in the white communists and Marxist do\nHe does not believe in the power of the individual because that leads the inequality and unfairness\n\nWants everybody to get free health care here and a free medical care over their Medicare for all he believes in a guaranteed national\nIncome these these kinds of things that if ever implemented would bring to a screeching halt in Florida everything that's happening nationwide that is building the economy\nBut who is the fact is\nYou know a lot of people may not know much about ... the ... so let me step in here and tell those of you in this vast and wide audience in Florida who he is ...\nAnd Harvard graduate who was a decorated jag officer in the navy judge advocate general\nHe has a solid record of winning achievements as a representative from Florida he has resigned his house seat in order to devote all of his time exclusively to his campaign has got a great family as a wife\nOr is it is all in for this got a young kid is just the\n[laughter] the epitome of a decent solid American citizen who has achieved tremendous great things\n\nNow on TV I think if it was this morning he was on a on Fox and he very calmly and very simply outlined a pattern or corruption by Andrew Gillum\nHe pointed out the FBI as had yellow monitor radar for years as they said an undercover agents to catch him for breaking all kinds of laws and accepting bribes in return for development deals pay to play so to speak\n\nYour mom graduated from college was given awards by socialist organizations which propelled him a young age to get elected to the city commission in Tallahassee then he became mayor for three years he's been under some kind of cloud or investigation ever since he was Florida it'll be a sanctuary\nState he wants to Florida to be open borders for any and all illegal immigrants he is the classic\nAmerican socialist who believes that America is the problem in the world and the poverty in Central America and the southern
