competing newspapers in the current you're right in this modern day\nAnd it's amazing how honest if he is about what journalism is now this\nIs not about contemporary events there is nothing in this series about Donald Trump or Theresa May or anything current in either country it is a modern era of generic piece lowers the storylines or all fictional all made up\nAnd it is\nAbout two competing newspaper is one of them's big one of them small one of them\nIs very serious take themselves very seriously don't do tabloid anything [noise] don't focus on celebrities the other one is nothing more than the furor trash and it's the one that wins it's the one with the biggest building is the one with the more employees they're reporters are stars and so forth but you know what this\nDoes it's flat out amazing how honest it is in terms of what people who do journalism think its purpose is\nDestroying people both of these papers in this in this miniseries end up targeting the same targets the same powerful people some of them in government some of them out\nOr some of them not but it makes it clear that journalists think their job is to destroy the\nBig people powerful people rich people\nThere obviously has to be something they're doing with breaking the rules and the gun suits breaking the rules there has to be something mistreating people they are sexually abusing people they are stealing from the public Dole they're doing something and the purpose of journalists ... call 'em out\nAnd and and ruin them which many many years ago when I first began to encounter the media as a target I was never I had a little\nTaste of it when I was in Sacramento there were a couple of reporters at that paper that that that that have me and their crosshairs simply it was it was liberal versus conservatism\nBut I mean I I didn't really get a full dose of it until this program started and I remember sitting talking to some people about it and they said you have to understand what journalism is\nI said you mean the bias well there's that but that it it's it's more than that ... it's about ruining people it's about targeting and destroying people how do you think resumes are built\nJournalist and his little medium size markets are small markets don't target somebody and they if they run a profile or or a or a piece on somebody that can be made to look accurate that nails them as guilty of this trans Russian or that transgression particularly against the little people\nIn that report or is going to get noticed and that's how that's how that reporter climbed a ladder if you go back to the early days of sixty\nMinutes it was all about that and it remains so today it's just it's it's evolved to adapt to the current climate which the only person they want to destroy the day now is Donald Trump\nAnd any Republican who gets in the way like Brett Kavanaugh it's all about destroying people the thing about this series is it makes no bones about it I I don't recognize the names of the writer\nOr writers I don't recognize the stars I've never seen them in a thing for I don't recognize the names of the producers\nAnd I haven't taken the time to Google that many of them but I watched this I've seen two episodes so far out of the ...\nAnd I catch myself my mouth is wide open it's agape a couple of times watching this thing and how brazen only on is this is\nOne of the the editor the head of ... of the of the tabloid paper is one of the most despicable human beings I've ever seen portrayed who is not set up as a criminal who's not establish he's he's just two years\nAnd he is totally on affected\nBy life to him everybody's a bad guy you just have to find out why his favorite his philosophy in life and the way he guides\nJournalists is the world has no solutions I'll stop what what if that were your world view of the world has no solutions\nHe's telling it it's not your job to fix things it's not your job to feel bad about who you destroy it's not your job to try to solve problems because\nThe world is not about solutions it's your job to sell this paper it's your job he one episode went to great lengths to show how this this sleaze editor\nWho has some kind of a secret relationship with the prime minister the u._k. no no no no not sexual just up there that they have some kind of a relationship not pretending like each other but they owe each other from\nWay back before the series began and the editor ranges a cover story about a Pdf file\nAnd then puts a picture of the prime minister on the cover with his his picture only an inch away from the word ... to file\nYet the story is not about the prime minister being a Pete if I was about somebody else for the prime minister is limited and outrage calls the guy in in the editor says you don't run me you don't control me and it was a mistake I I'm Sorry well then you wish you want a ... I'm not apologizing for anything you don't like it was it\nIn the primary I didn't want to do the story in the first place I didn't want to pursue the pictures the editor says you did I mean this guy has no empathy or feeling for anybody\nHe doesn't [noise]\nIt's just it's ... it's it's perfect if the kind of personality you would have to be if your job is destroying people\nNo conscience the belief that everybody is flawed that everybody's a dirt bag that everybody is a rapper ... and at some point their time to be called out is going to happen\nNobody's decent nobody's white [laughter] it's amazing how this in the eyes\nOf a journalist an editor\nNow I imagine real journalist I got to look at this thing some of them are going to marvel at it and think it's wonderful others are going to have\nIt because it's it exposes too much uh people have never had encounters with reporters have never been targets I don't know how they're going to react to it other than you entertained by it starts kind of slow but it picks up speed\nOr\nMany of the primary characters are women\nThe competing editor of the clean paper the above board paper is a woman who gets out smarter than tricked into not publishing one day because she can't confirmed the pizza file story while the other paper puts it on the cover having confirmed it\nBecause the editor at the other ... doesn't care whether it's true or not wondering calls that got us Peter found just get it up there and get it on the newsstands whereas the female editor didn't have the guts\nTo run it and so the paper doesn't rot and I'm thinking\nThey obviously are not worried about the me too movement here ever put this thing together so the name of it as press I have no idea it's it's I think it it just completed airing\n'cause I've got all six of them so I just competed completed it's um it's runs cycle in the u._k. which means it's going to be on Netflix\nAmazon Prime wherever I don't know where it's going to be but it won't be long and if you remember me talking about it here and if you watch these kinds of things\nIt's fascinating 'cause it's not about politics not about current but it's not about Trump it's not about conservatives liberals any of that\n[noise] if it's a it's a hit everybody everybody is a rep rate including the people at the papers the reporters I I have to admit I was so [noise]\nAnyway here's Donald Brazil now I I did not lose my play she's with Bill hammered a day and they're talking about the blue wave where she thinks we're headed\nAnd remember now this is a woman that used to be one of the head honcho side of the DNC the Democratic party who in hurting normal countenance would be out there oh yeah blue wave Democrat's gonna win band gets it's our time people are fed up but that's not how she found\nSee how many days in a long time in politics [laughter] I'm not breaking out the champagne and I'm not trying to scramble my eggs before I get my chickens right we still have to improve turnout turnout turnout turnout\nDemocratic victory depends on turnout among millennials one on a farm millennials voted in the last midterm we also got to make sure that we get a bank way before we can get a blue tie we need these women to when they're racist I'm confident not over confident you\nAsked me today what would I Do differently in terms of Democrats would target Latinos I Would talk to millennials\nOkay so why would she do differently she's saying here that Democrats are dropping the ball with Latinos why she's saying that well because she has the freedom to say that she's not at the moment in the in the hierarchy of the apparatus and it\nTurns out Latinos are far more supportive of Trump Republicans than anybody know according to recent polling data\nThey're worried that something that's not a blue wave may be shaping up here that's what this headline is certainly over a blue wave NBC News lines Democrat and GOP voter registration at the same level\nAs past cycles comparing registration activity for twenty four team to twenty sixteen with activity from twenty sixteen ... current helps put these numbers in the context but it should be noted that twenty fourteen and twenty sixteen include a complete\nPicture of registration for those years\nWhereas twenty Eighteen only includes registration activity up until this point in time what that's all you need I mean if you're not registered yet the odds are you're not going to be registered from time to vote so it's that\nSeems like a little hope well we don't have a full database with numbers for two thousand ha well you've got enough to know\nSo how can this be helping voter registration if Democrats are supposed to be smoking us\nIn voter registration because there's so much more interest there so much hatred for Trump there's so many people that want to fix that mistake\nThen they call 'em from the Washington Post by Megan McCarthy dull\nTrying to help the Democrats who she believes are morally superior and smarter than Republicans headline will the blue wave collapse before it reaches the shore\nWhat may give them a card all in this op ed in the Washington Post is doing it

expect a big democratic wave this fall I got three stories in a row here plus kind of Brazil\nAbout this now I don't want to make too much about the best thing that we can say about it is that they are losing confidence or maybe they are just purposely dialing it back\nFor Strategic reasons and still think there is going to be what I I I don't think that's what's going on here I don't think they're able to discipline themselves\nUniversally unilaterally across the drive by leftist board there's always going to be some renegades that'll bust out of any attempt\nA in something like this but we'll get back to this I Need to get back to the phones first Canton, Mississippi and Damien nice to have your welcome to the E R B network\nThank you Mr lumbar I appreciate it does have definitely a bucket list item for may ... planet I appreciate that very much\nSo I had a a different take on why they're not going to release anything from them Mueller investigation before the midterms not not that I Would say you're wrong I mean I just uh\nI don't think that they have anything against Trump and they don't want it to the fight the Democrats' chances and you know boost the Republicans' chances in the mid term [noise]\nWell uh I that would be a wonderful and magnificent if that's true of all I can tell you is for what it's worse\nThere is in in the in the\nQuote unquote cannons a procedure\nIn our revered and volunteer department of justice\nThat nothing they do should impact elections\nMean call me even five at this as\nReasons for doing some of the things that he did\nIt now I Know I Know I Know it looks like he was doing the exact opposite forget what he did for a moment it's what he said there is all I'm telling you is that there is this it\nMay even be a written the regulations for all I Know but it\nI I Am for certain that it is and acknowledge gentleman lay procedure that the D. O. J. you know Doug balances of justice\nThe scales that justice third wind the department of justice does nothing including indictments that would impact and election now\nThe Hillary cases do they had to exonerate heard their futures dependence on\nTheir careers depended on it and she was a democratic nominee they're not going to be in the business of charging and pursuing and diving the Democratic nominee again seizing the unwritten regulations not impacting the election so it does exist\nAnd it probably is a factor in smaller report not being released\nWhat I expect to happen well I don't know what could happen\nSince they've decided to leak that Mueller is about finished since they've decided to leak that the report is imminent let me get that headline again just to not have to paraphrase this Mahler ready to deliver key findings in his Trump probe\n[noise] [noise]\nNow you know and this was going to drive the left literally batty\nThat it it it they're not going to be able to restrain themselves\nHow long do you think it's going to be before somebody on that side of the aisle starts demanding that Mahler revealed is how long do you think it's going to be before dawn lemon or little Brian style turned\nJake Tapper any of these are the start demanding this I mean if he knows what it is why can't we know it showed affect the outcome of the elections will be told I\n\nThink the odds are that are pretty good or not what am I play the game what's hypothetically say that that pressure is brought to bear it's not up the Mahler it's going to be up to Rosenstein and the president to an extent Congress that's who gets the report what are you\n[laughter] [laughter]\nI Can't see this happening but what if\nThere is a lot of pressure brought to bear on mother to reveal this release it are are Rosenstein whoever\nAnd somebody like Trump says well okay All right if you want to see it go ahead and they release it and there's nothing that indicates Trump what do you think that does the Democrat turned out\n\nA couple of weeks from now three ... what do you think that does that's why I don't think there's anything in here on collusion\nI don't think there's anything in it on obstruction because folks at one of the week they're sixteen never Trump anti Trump hate mongers on Mueller's team if they had the gods yeah what a week and it would be leaking right now and it would be used to guarantee a blue wave\nAnd the drive by maybe su Didi of the president's doesn't is you know what I find interesting about this\nAll of these so called paradigms of hurt you on the left

woman the Trump decided to call it a name\nShe is a woman who attempted to him but for these liberal Democrats these people in the media to act like people don't talk to sweat presidents don't come on people talk\nThis way this is what ... what I resent about this the idea that they are cleaning shores the wind driven snow and they don't think this way they don't talk this way what an absolute crock simply look at the things they say about us during the course of your average political day\nFrom\nYour Hitler through your Nazis to Europe this or that they make fun of people's appearances they make fun of people I mean they ... their their comedy has become literally hate\nAnd then they act\nLike one of the greatest social ...\nGresham genetic history of humanity is occurring when

these people are president and he is and this has been nice to have the\nPresident's ... well I Know they look at it and think of it that way my point is they\nCan try all day long that's not going to separate Trump from his voters that some of his voters like he's shown that in fact that\nThere's so much good going on here focus on that don't don't need to distract every body with that stuff\nBut you do\nThere are also gonna they're not going to give up trying to link Donald Trump to the murder\nOf the uh of the journalists is in the Saudi constantly is ... ... a ... they're still working on that but I think they're frustrated to no end that nothing they do works and now\nI have a story I have to print I haven't had the chance to printed yep just cleared the transom here uh it's

Republican senator Dean Heller\nIs that people are going to re elect senator Dean Heller\nAnd talking about fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson well he's now saying indicated he's going to plead the fifth he's not saying a word anymore\nOr he was on Fox News Sunday telling Maria ... that Glenn Simpson is in real legal jeopardy in all of this he also confirmed that the FBI has evidence that directly refused the premise of a ... a Trump Russia probe in other words that there's been and remains exculpatory evidence\nThere was a great piece by Jonathan Turley ... three reasons mall or may not charge Trump with obstruction apparently not asking any questions about it but\nSticking exclusively to whether or not there was any type of collusion which we all know the answer to a you have one top Republican lawmaker no saying the FBI failed to provide a\nFederal surveillance court with important evidence well we don't that now for a long time and we know that\nFor Pfizer court judges\nOr handed information that was supposed to be verified and corroborated ended up being Hillary Clinton's bought and paid for Russian lives that was put together by fusion GPS interestingly funneled money through ... from the hiring of Christ is Christopher Steele a foreign national he doesn't even stand by the information and the ...\nAnd it was the bulk of information to get for Pfizer warrants against the Trump campaign associate and the lead up to the twenty sixteen race\nAll this comes down to some simple basic fundamental things and they never told the ... the judges that it was Hillary Clinton a paid for this information and it's unbelievable that this could be happening in this country but it looks like we're finally beginning to get to the bottom of it at least I Hope so Jason shape it's just one of those\nFormer congressman now Fox News contributor author of New York times best seller the deep state we have Victoria Toensing and Joe diGenova up the gentleman ... with us a thank you both for being here let's start with Jason shape it's because this is your wheel house and it seems to me that it doesn't matter what Congress request\nAs they seek to do their job of oversight they're never going to get the information from the department of justice and they're not going to get the people they need to talk in front of them under oath\nWell the hard part about when you issues to peanut when I was the chairman of the oversight commission or maybe I can issue a subpoena but the only way to on board that is through the department of justice and so the weight of the paper really isn't worth much because the the OJ won't enforce its own subpoena the subpoena issued by Congress\nThat the name that people need to also ... themselves with is Marco Wyatt market why it was ... he was counsel for the DNC he was careful for Hillary Clinton he was capital for a ... the group he was involved there\nThis this guy sits in the middle of a lot of these transactions in the movement of money and I think more and more you'll start to see his name along with you know or and Simpson and all these others\nWell I think the fact that ... Simpson is now saying Victoria that\nWas going to plead the fifth and can get away with that and make them come in and plead the fifth you know the idea that they can do is threatened to plead the fifth and not have to actually go through with it I think is important\n[noise] they should make him show up and do it in front of the TV cameras plead the fifth\nAnd it's ridiculous to accept a letter from the lawyers on and I hope Jason you're talking to your former French and telling them to get them a get him in to the Congress to take this ad and I don't care if they're not going to\nI'm In ... because I think there are other ways to to figure out how to do it you've got a subpoena you subpoenaed first and then you negotiate later\nYou don't have our own minds you didn't show up we were talking trying to work it out now you have to think about and he said peanuts and then you say you can't make it went state and you make it Thursday that I Can't believe there's no ...\nI mean I'm trying to understand I mean the president said that they would\nThe de classification and all the materials the Jim Jordan was just talking about would be an redacted and we'd have a chance to see the ... of warrants the gang of eight information that three oh two between\nA Bruce or and Christopher Steele and how they wanted a funnel that information straight into Robert Mueller's office uh Joe diGenova but you know the idea of why do I think even even with you and Victoria's my attorneys\nThat I wouldn't get away with just saying I'm going to plead the fifth leave me alone now or or not handing over subpoenaed materials to Congress\nWell I don't think there's any question that Congress has dropped the ball on course to get some ... but let me just say this because this is really important all the names that you heard Michael ... Mr liar\nOr all those people they are to everything that was done in the United states what's fascinating is what happened in the United kingdom\nWhich we the Congress as an issue any subpoenas court we now know that the FBI or am I stick\nAnd the G H cue to conduct electronic surveillance of Americans said he said it on foreign soil without legal authority to do so and that information\nWhat fact conversations of George ...\nWere intercepted and in the course of the there's the confrontation they found out that off the top of it was not interested in Hillary email or anything else and they never ... information because by the court\nYou know it seems congressman shape is that every piece of the puzzle now is falling in place I think we now understand what the insurance policy was Lisa Page testify that in the the nine months of the investigation\nLeading up to the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller that they had no evidence of Trump Russia collusion at all\nUm and by the way even her lover Peter Struck said the same thing he said well I'd be all end up there was something there there's no there are there\nAnd then all of a sudden we find the media elite strategy that they discussed this with Andrew McCabe comes in James Baker comes in and other people come in and what we see is again it goes back to the Clinton bought and paid ... that dossier information has leaked out to the media creating the impression that in fact there was Russia Trump collusion\nBut they did it themselves they took the again it's it's all they were doing the leaking so that they can appoint the special counsel so that in the which one could be ... began I is there any part of the puzzle that isn't clear to you because it's getting very clear to me\nYou know it is becoming a crystal clear\nAnd that's why Jim Jordan is exactly right the people that were in that meeting and reverse the timing of this evening this meeting happens directly after\nA district Colombia's relieved of his duties but just before Mr Mueller is put into place and you have to understand who's in that meeting what was discussed it sounds like bakers being most candid about what was going on there\nBut each of the people in that meeting should be brought in for its own their own deposition uh transcribed under oath\nA breeze plot to exonerate Hillary Clinton they're legally dead if she lost the election to frame Donald Trump and that is exactly what they did these people were motivated by and and this court Donald Trump which led them to fabricate evidence to foreign intelligence service fabricate evidence\nTo wiretap Americans ... and and when they found the scope tore evidence for example that would have favorite George Papadopoulos they hit it by the court very no doubt\nThat number people John granted James Clapper on down all the way into the White House committed crimes and Jeff Sessions\nAnd Rod Rosenstein cannot figure out a way to do this and by the way
