I think one of the most effective ways\nOf getting people to think about this how many people have you heard people say this is the most important election and our allies and that's why it's not\nThis is not the most important election of our lives to thousands sixteen was\nIf Hillary had one in two thousand six that that's what we need to focus that the kinds of stuff we need to ask people to consider what would be happening in America right now and the past two years of Hillary hit one\nWho would be running various cabinet posts and agencies what do we know today that we would not know if Hillary had one\nIncluding names of people and what they've been doing\nIf you have people between the eyes\nWhere what would\nAmerica be today if Hillary had one\n\nIt's a different way of getting people to focus on the importance of the election is uh the the drive by us have their formula and it's rooted\nIn the desire they habit everybody hate Trump\nAnd so that desire becomes narrative and then that narrative becomes the result\nPolling data and says the media is so hates Trump they want everybody else to therefore the trend is pro Democrat in the mid terms in their polling data because people have awake and realize what a mistake they made voted for Trump none of that is true\nExcept on the hard left where it's always been true there is nothing new about it and it's not confined to Trump patronage hatred of everybody that isn't them\nLike I say just based on the last two weeks of the Capitol hearing the Democrat Party today as constant deserves to lose in the biggest landslide in the history of landslides a Democrat Party deserves to get bombed\nFor the tactics they have engaged in for the actions taken by their lunatic and paid supporters\nAnd it just outrageous the kinds of things that they are engaging in and then the decent world and in a sane society they wouldn't be punished greatly in the midterms\nI still hold out hope that they could be my point is we will get to all of this as the day is unfold\nIn this weekend in coming weeks but here we go with Donald Trump and Leslie stall on sixty minutes provide providers are soundbites work I'm not confident now so the only way to know is to give it a shot the first one is Leslie stall\n\nTalking to Trump about the ... poses hostility that he has created between the European Union allies and us\nThat I mean what's ally we have wonderful relationships are a lot of people but I don't want to teach us much worse than the European Union the European Union why it was formed in order to take advantage of us on trade and that's what they've done is hot and yet they shot hostile sounds hot he always has some of the way they treat us\nWe're not how somebody can in dealing with in my head in this country for so many years I even willing to get rid of that western alliance now\nLike they don't then is fine but you know why we shouldn't be paying almost the entire cost of NATO can protect your and then on top of that they take advantage of us on re electing a don't any more they understand okay\n[noise] so what once again we have here the concept but just so hostile hostility it sounds so hostile it sounds so mean eight pounds so it sounds so it's this it's confrontational\nAnd of course in the eyes of the left we want to be Europe they want us to be Europe they want us to be westerns socialists\nThey think still functioning\nAt a democracy but but that's that's what they want us so we should be forthcoming\nAnd tolerant we should be welcoming we should be in ... ourselves and this\nThis is just Donald Trump keeping a number of promises\nWhich say what you want this guy has kept more promises probably all politicians in history combined\nContinue to be strong but people are asking what if earnings fall short and then force increased regulation in tech which may mean performance in this recently strong performing area\nAnd what about the economy in general Monday always kicks off a new round of economic data that can move the markets in one direction or the other\nWell we're seeing contain positive news on the economic friend from areas like manufacturing and a low unemployment we've seen positive numbers and consumer sentiment in retail sales but both missed expectations so we're focused their\nThanks Michael this is done the staples stock market report with Michael O'Keefe truth in desperate officer for ...

not Vanity Fair is\nSix foot one and a half dozen varieties not so much a celebrity focused rag against Vanity Fair is a but they are both left wing entertainment oriented and they do comment on left wing entertainers actors\nActresses TV so called journalist and so forth and and it it's just a little minor correction I get them confused occasionally here is that just another sample from last night Trump\nAnd Leslie stall\nYou know general mad at the tails have reason for NATO and the reason for all these alliances and say prevent World War three now it's not true but frankly I like General Mattis I think I Know more about it than he does and I know more about it from the standpoint of fairness that I can tell you finish high and one more time\nOkay unless you're not to try again [laughter] I Know and my answer is this\nI Will always be there with NATO but\nThey have to pay their way I'm totally in favor of NATO but I don't want to be taken advantage\nWhat general manager so I think I Know more about it than he does I Know more about it from the standpoint of fairness that I can tell you he's talking about the fairness of do is the fairness of all the NATO members paying their own way\nHe's also talking about people like Angela Merkel making a side deal with Russia and potent for natural gas shipments explosively into Germany ignoring other NATO allies and you'll notice a sixty minutes isn't going to Angela Merkel and asking her why she is undermining NATO\nTrump already called her out on it\nFor doing this the Trump supposedly in the pockets of the of the Russians but Trump knows what sixty minutes or less they still trying to do here that's what they don't get\nThey can't sneak up on people anymore particularly Trump he knows\nHe in fact you know one thing he says I don't know if we've got at the roster coming up probably do but he said something to her that is as as honest and true is anything he's ever said because I Know Donald Trump I've known him a long time I play golf and I've known him a long time before he ran for office\nAnd he would ask me about various Democrats asked me about Obama and I can tell that sometimes when I told him what I think he didn't agree especially when discussions in the media came up\nHe thought I was maybe just a little bit over the top exaggerating in some of the things I Would tell them but my opinions with the media he said to her I had no idea and I'm being really serious with you Leslie I had no idea how dishonest the media is until I ran for president\nI had no idea I being really serious with you he said\n\nAnd I I think that's probably true as a New Yorker and immersed in New York media where he was a star\nWhen he wasn't running for office it was a local New York's by you know he made fun of him and they laugh but but he was a big get he appeared everywhere and they loved him and he was great front cover back cover of the tabloids the daily news and the post\nWhen he ran for president that's when all of the good vibes about trauma there were some bad things too I mean he didn't get universally loved praised coverage but\nIt all vanished when he ran\nAnd he was surprised in a way kind of like McCain was\n\nSo when he said to her last night I had no idea I really telling you Leslie I'm really shocked that was really surprised by this honest that's the word he uses instead of biased\nAnd I can tell you that that's true now what else has he learned that he didn't know but he knew\nBefore he ran for office and I think\nLot about the left a lot about Democrats particularly liberal Democrats that he hadn't thought of in ways you and I did but now since he suffered the treatment he fully\nRush Limbaugh\nFees for news radio nine twenty and\nSay Fox the IRS

Ninety seven percent of total individual income tax so other words\nThe bottom fifty percent pay three percent there isn't much more you can do to cut their taxes and yet how often do you hear every ... both parties\nPoliticians running around and we're going to middle class after it was a middle class pregnant burn through brand but we got to cut middle there isn't much to cut anymore\nWhen it comes to when it comes to taxes\nNow which small percentile of taxpayers also paid\nThree percent or more it's fourteen hundred taxpayers\nThe top point zero zero one percent the top one one hundredth\nOf a percent for teen hundred taxpayers\nThat group alone pain free point two five percent of all tax is one thousand forty nine people is the exact number one thousand or fourteen hundred and forty up to the little round it to fourteen hundred and\nFourteen hundred tax payers paid more than the bottom Seventy percent\n\nIn two thousand one and the bottom fifty percent pay nearly five percent the top\nOne thousand percent pay to point three so the burden of paying taxes is increasing on the rich\nNot decreasing\nIt is not true to say they are not paying their fair share\nNow this is as it's supposed to be by the way when there are marginal rate tax reductions when you reduce income tax rates you generate more tax revenue\nBecause people shelter last they avoid if if if if you tell people are going to be able to keep say Seventy cents of every dollar as opposed to keeping\nForty cents or fifty cents of every dollar then they'll work much less hard at sheltering it and she'll it'd be more inclined to pay [noise]\nPlus you have more tax payers because all these people ended up hiring more people as the economy grows so the fact that the rich are paying more is actually part and parcel with the theories behind supply side economics supply side tax policy but the bottom line is\nDoes anybody think it's fair that fourteen hundred people for\nGene hungry people out of three hundred and some odd million is it fair to fourteen hundred people one thousand four hundred people are paying more money in taxes than the bottom Seventy percent combined and yet we never stop hearing how unfair\nIt is\nThe rich are not paying their fair share it's a constant refrain and I doubt that it's ever gonna change because if you get the votes of all fourteen hundred people you're not gonna win anything\nYou need the votes of the people in the bottom Seventy percent so you need to pander to them you need to constantly tell them how they are getting ripped off you tell them how people aren't paying their fair share the left is very very good at this and what the left ends up doing is telling people\nWere going to punish those rich we're going to punish them for you it's not fair didn't fare has so much more money than he was not fair to not paying your fair share and their fair share in taxes and we're going to ... bottom Seventy physical yeah baby punish

Leslie stall we were up here at number oh this is a big\nNumber three this is Trump talking about the necessity of\nConsequences for illegal immigration Leslie stall question what about the force separation of migrant children from their\nParents has the same as the Obama law you know Obama had the same time it was on the books by painting them for sent for lunch that zero tolerance policy [noise] terror\nFamilies with children and then everybody decided and the courts don't want separation and frankly when you don't separate when you\nAllow the parents to stay together okay when you allow that\nThen what happens is people are going to pour into all kinds how are you going to go back\nCafe glasses Lesley from coming into our country illegally\nPart of the reason that I have to blame myself the economy is so strong that everybody wants to come into the United states to get my\nFault Leslie I've done such a great job in the economy everybody wants to come here I'll take the blame for it now she says she misspoke there\nThis law on the bus Obama certainly didn't force separation and just didn't get reported because Obama was cool and couldn't do anything wrong and if it was happening when Obama did it than there had to be good reasons for it\nRemember went down to two tier system of justice in this country and we have a two tier system of media\n\nWhat it was on the books but he didn't force it what is that what\nYou mean it was on the books that Obama didn't enforce the law but Trump begins enforce it but Trump didn't make the law\nThe Democrats Leslie stall included a tempted to make people think that Donald Trump purposely rather law or just enacted one that separate they killed run from the family the ... and you wouldn't believe the number of brain dead people actually believe this happened\nI was watching an episode of law and order in your S. U. V. the other night and they had a whole premise some guy keeping abandon kids in his basement in a cage was a hero because he was saving these kids after Trump policy and force them to be a band and he was saving them\nAnd he was just running child sex rings with them but they tried to make this guy out to be somewhat of a hero\nBecause the whole point of the episode was to bash Trump for separating families whether it's a law that he inherited I've looked at explain why the law exists and it's above and beyond they're having to be consequences for coming here illegally it has to do with the quest for asylum and the fact that\nWhere the parents are taken while their cases are decided is not suitable for kids the kids or\nIt in much better surroundings and Sanders while they're at their family their their their adult\nParents cases are being adjudicate there's nothing\nThere isn't enough for me this is the United states of America we do not due to kids what these people are trying to tell you the Republican Party does the kids it's quite the exact opposite it's just more in a smear\nThat the Democrats on the left of engaged in and Trump does not back down from it and even as I say for writing magazine was stunned that Trump got away with dominating even with these questions a couple of more before the break up next\nShe says do you think that climate change is a ...\nI think something's happening something is changing and it'll change back again I don't think it's a hoax I think is probably a difference but I don't know that it's manmade I Will say this um\nI

because he'd written negative things about the regime Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren says DNA testing show she does have Native American heritage probably six to ten generations ago\nPresident Trump is repeatedly question warrants heritage and called her Pocahontas brushed off the passing said she'd make a parable President Bill destroy\nThat that is well the\nPresident said he hoped Senator Warren will run in twenty twenty because he believed he'll be\nService you know\nThere's votes of the cascades\n[noise]\nAs\nUsual thank you for your patient as we head back to the phones were we have to the phones and this is Scott\nIn Oklahoma City right to have you here hide\nRush good to talk to you know it gives her\nLook Elizabeth Warren is resurrecting the one drop rule or an anti Pelham a rule created by a southern plantation owners Democrats say if you have one drop\nOf blood was black you're black\nOr this was this was a protest school her her for her she was so small\nThey don't have to excuse me second hasn't that rural been adopted by civil rights activists now the ... that if if you have one drop your going to be called black\nBut that's exactly right intersection analogy requires quantification yeah\nAnd so we we need to know how much of a percentage\nOf pressure you are versus oppressed\nThis ... this this rulers is grotesque widely discredited used by the KKK in the thirties used in Nazi Germany against the Jews\nHere she comes again this is actually a dog whistle to her base it's not meant for Republicans it's not meant for conservatives is I don't even about her future run she needs to tell her base\nI'm On board with intersection analogy look how much of an oppressed ram and let's find out your percentage of across her to\n[noise] would you define the intersection out of it is a relatively new leftist activists\nConcept that I find that most people to whom I mentioned that have no idea what it is how would you define that let\nGlad to thanks for the opportunity to\nDo so much more than walk on and so I'm a good host I have ever that no one has a little thinking and asking when they listen to a caller savings\nI agree with that book uh intersection out comes straight out of Marxism march said that everyone is either on oppressor or oppressed they're either Bush law or Pearl a target\nAt its later it's now being adopted the idea of being able to declare ... so what you are how oppressed and how much of an approach where you are it's called intersection analogy because instead of just being one camp or the other\nGets spread across race gender sexual preference and other variables\nYes okay that's red intersection out it'll be for me\nGreat honor to wash your you're talking to your your speaking\nIn language of people's formerly educated on Marxism many people aren't that's why it's so successful a scanner intersection out I mean actually has basically something that has been constructed by these Marxist\nJust saying that all of these different leftist organizations Meek somewhere they all intersect with each other the feminist having this strain about them that that that I'm\nA cohabitation with that with militant Islam is that then with illegal immigrants in their activists and we're all of these people intersect is worried about unified\nYes but it also applies to the individual\nBecause of these let's say five different dimensions you you are on a different scale and all of those and they intersect into a single number quantifiable says that this is how much of an oppressor or oppressed you are this is where you're on the scale\nOf course this is the root of all this and there was a recent white privilege stuff pops ... absolutely\nRight so now Elizabeth Warren because she wants to uh justify her cultural appropriation of a Harvard professor ... has to claim a particular percentage of intersection now with the oppression\nTo speak their language so she is saying that she is an old press\nShe's had asked him anyway she's a woman therefore she's impressed by the patriarchy and now I Am not a one thousand twenty fourth Indian she is impressed by the white man\nWhich is a a again a resurrection of the one drop rule this percentage is so low as to be a joke you know I if I could say I took a DNA test about four years ago and of course you don't normally you'd never see me but believe me I'm whites\nHowever when I discovered was zero point eight percent sub Saharan Africa\nWell that doesn't mean I'm going to Harvard and doing a claim a professorship and African American studies but I have what is that almost eight times more a sub Saharan African black heritage and me and she does Native American just\nPray just admitted sub Saharan is not automatically quote unquote black\nWell that that's right in in this instance because we've identified the ancestor\nFor the Afrikaners are not black\nUh I well\nI I I understand what you're saying I Am referring to blacks can okay All right\nI just want to mess up because that sub Saharan this is somebody what do you mean ... what is it what it was it and then you start talking to the sub continent then some people really get confused you're coming from from India or over to sub Saharan Africa is below those Aaron desert\nOr which is where most of the population of Africa is most of it there is some north of the Sahara Desert as well and I get I I I get your point a and her reason for doing this\nAll of that not withstanding the accuracy of it not withstanding the left is pretty upset that she chose this particular time to do this because they think it is totally self serving it does not do anything ... distract\nFrom the mid term elections which are three weeks from tomorrow or away and so there are some people who are on the left are claiming that she selfish and then trying to haul good what is a lot of light being assigned on politics right now because of the\nHoly\nGentle giants dog food Batman I Burt
