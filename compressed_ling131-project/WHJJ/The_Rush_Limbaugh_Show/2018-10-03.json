PC an advisory services officers securities American advisors and carry on from representative Armstrong advisory group and the securities American companies are unaffiliated\nNews is going to break and we're here to break it down and show what it means to your portfolio built by neutral exchange with very Armstrong in ... on the financial exchange radio network\nNoticing that ten year treasury bond his three ten highest level it's been\nI got three Thirteen actually on it oh boy well since\nTwo thousand eleven yeah where are you going back pre euro debt crisis any a is that a concern I mean these Tucker's mortgage rates going to go up\nYeah Tucker's mortgage rate is going to go up but it I got an adjustable rate mortgage so mine's going to go up to [noise]\nYou know what's interesting is even with the ten year moving into a higher yields recently to last week we had actually seen the dollar weakening the last week we finally seeing it moving back toward strength now or if the dollar does continue to strengthen it does raise some question marks I think you know heading into next year\nUm but it's you know we're pretty much the same level that we were at for the last four or five months right now but if we see you know five or six percent strength above this then I started to get a little concerned\nKind of strange to see the dollar strengthening in oil going up isn't it I mean you gotta will now over Seventy five bucks a barrel but everybody says oh don't worry about it don't worry about it I I I have to find something to worry about\nThat give you plenty no [laughter] no they just put it out there you know you had to oil trading uh Seventy five bucks a nobody's turn the heat on yet yeah when I asked her oh oh I have a story for you so [laughter]\nThe other day my or my mother in law uh she uh decided to put the heat on like ... over and watch it at ... ... why I was like oh I don't know it was like fifty degrees outside of a bundle up let's go [laughter] or else I Know\nI was just like surprise September as aggressive ha ha\nHa ha I was just wander around I'm shaking just thinking of the money that I Would spend if I did I Try to wait till November but it's really hard time getting ready to go to January I mean I think you wait till Thanksgiving I ain't get away with that what\nWhat I used to do and I still lived in ah I Do not if you're married and you want to stay married Tucker who would I used to when I Lived in a city in an apartment building that I Would pretty much ... for people so I wouldn't go turtles will be in the middle for outdoor let everyone else that you know pretty much provide your heating\nFor you that is a nice thing about being on the third fourth floor is oh yeah now that the heat from yellow he had to do it anymore\nYou know now that I have an actual house it doesn't work that's got to be killing you I I Love to find a way to siphon heat from my neighbor if I could but I I just don't know how to do with what\nUh what do higher wages I mean if you're running a dominoes franchise you're running McDonald's franchise I'm just thinking I McDonalds you know minimum wage there's what nine ten bucks an hour\nAnd you're a line cook there you're a\nCashier there are you thinking to yourself why do I have to stay at McDonalds just go over to Amazon Amazon Amazon is higher even Fifteen bucks an hour you have a pulse you can get a job at Amazon\nYeah in in it a lot of restaurants labor expenses typically make up you know between twenty five and thirty percent of the restaurant meal it's bigger than their rent it is and so if you see wages and again let's look at a company like McDonald's let's see a lot of McDonalds jobs being posted for twelve Thirteen an hour ...\nDid you say okay if they need to get up to Fifteen ... that means the twenty five to thirty percent bump in wages that you're seeing there and what that means is all of a sudden that twenty five to thirty percent of sales that that labor expense used to be\nIs now thirty to thirty five percent right so you got to raise the question is do they raise prices by a corresponding you know five or ten percent to match that and and if they do raise those prices do they still keep people coming in if the value isn't quite what it used to be so\nWhat do you think do you think you start to see some of these lower end franchises go out of business like if you're running a dominos do you just say how the heck with it or ... are thinking about a subway cars subways labor intensive you walk into one of the stores even a small store I have three or four workers there\nYeah it's I I don't know if you see like the the big names you're you're getting your domino's of the world you're McDonald's with the world they're not going to go out of business because I think they have pricing power ... the ones that are a little bit more questionable that maybe don't necessarily deliver the same kind of value from ... to what was going to have no problem\nReally upfront customer the McDonalds\nYeah but labor intensive again ... figure out how to do that robotically right they use that say robo burrito robo burrito I'd watch that know how many people there wouldn't be fascinating when you when you go to a ... story about how many different people you're working three ...\nThree you've got the person put it actually for in some cases you've got the person who first puts the tortilla down then you've got the person who in the meat and the other stuff then usually have a glock and special person then you've got the cash register\nPerson I mean it's I think it will be curious to see I think what you're going the end result will be most of these will stay in business prices will go up\nBut the workers if you go from ten bucks an hour to Fifteen dollars an hour that's like fifty percent wage increase dirty bomb\nAnd they get they mean you're going from twenty grand a year to thirty but they spend it here's the difference that that guy that makes goes who their wage goes from ten to Fifteen based spend every nickel of that five dollars more per hour that they're making\nIt will be good for the economy in the long run the other thing that does on the short term and the other thing that does is keep them on a lot of those workers that are at or near minimum wage are collecting an awful lot of benefits whether it's a food stamp sweat right housing assistance so by getting higher wages it reduces demands on those programs and actually cleans up things from a bunch of perspective\nGreat to see happening very great to see happening\nMarkets in record territory I mean in the market is just ripping the Dow is up one hundred and forty one points at twenty six thousand nine Fifteen ...

to get through this\nAbout exposing forward for what she is\n\nYeah yeah yeah I'm going to talk about what Trump there the Trump did not mocked her last night he made fun of her claims he did not imitate the way she speaks\n... but look I understand Republican senators being alarmed about that but you gotta look at it as a Trump is simply providing cover Trump\nIs giving them ... to go ahead and vote the way he did Trump said what needs to be said but these guys aren't going to stay at\nHer timeline alone has shifted\nWhen do you think this incident when Kevin all the alleged incident happened because she is described it as early eighty to mitigate eighty two sometime in eighty three hurt timeline is change based on who she's been talking to\nAnd that has been documented the fact that she has lied openly now about not knowing anything about polygraphs and not helping people pass them there is a signatory\nTo one of the support letters written for her Monica McLean retired F. B.\nI. special agent her best friend for life\n\nAnd she is named as one of the people that Dr forty helped pass a y detector tests in her appointment application for the FBI\nMonica McLean issued a statement the ABC I have never\nHad an Christine Blasey Ford or anybody else prepare me or provide any other type of assistance whatsoever in connection with any polygraph exam I have taken the time\nI ... I think they've been caught big time and I Rachel Mitchell if I have time I've I've just got enough data on this right before the program again I didn't have time to assemble it\nBut the questioning that we all thought was a waste of time has exposed potentially Dr Ford just so many lives that if it ever came became necessary to use them she could be destroyed the credibility credibility can be destroyed\nA and I think everybody's going to try to get past this\nOr through this without any any challenging them Dr foreign because she's a eliciting such sympathy and one of the way she did that was with her speech pattern which I Am one of the only people in the media that I Know of a pointed out her speech pattern I look\nI'm a professional and highly trained broadcast specialist\nMultiple work a\nVoice capabilities voice talents excuse me again are that I may have gotten it out there that time we'll see\nAre especially of mine I recognize speech patterns I Am able to attach speech patterns to personality types you can definitely do this\nWell a voice actress in Hollywood\nDecided to post on Twitter her impersonation of Dr Ford afterwards and the Twitter universe came down on this woman on mercilessly\nSo we have not mentioned her name it's out there but I Want to protect her or at least here\nFrom any further assaults taking place but here is what she posted and it is so spot on\n... ... ... ... ... ... ...\n... ... ... ... all talk about an attack arms okay I'm In my hand I found out about ... volts per pound a little [noise]\nHow her as far as ... and now I'm back on [noise] yes that's correct or ... or ... or ... [noise]\nYou can read\nLike how many [noise] [noise]\nI plan on being found about ...\nAnd ... that that speech pattern what does it make you think you're dealing with a child here the elite up talking at the end of every sentence has said some vulnerability\n... is it fringe ill at the almost in a way a maybe even somebody nervous and traumatized and scared and that is exactly\nThe a personality that I think she want to do affect and she succeeded with it\nAnd it's because of that that I think I don't no matter what has learned about her and how much she has lived if you will a which again Rachel Mitchell has if necessary [laughter]\nCould blow this woman out of a water that's what I had no one else has put this together by the way that I've seen I've just in random show prep Reno a story here story there I've been noticing things\n\nWill be a little reference to what Rachel Mitchell asked her about subject a and her answer and then you read another story and there's one more reference to Rachel but you can put all these together\nAnd it it\nIt's almost as though Rachel Mitchell knew going in that\nShe knew a lot more about balls the Ford than anybody has eluded to she knew about Monica McLean she knew about the polygraph why she asking\nThis\nWhy why are you this is not what this is about Canada why aren't you asking her details ... about her story instead this prosecutor was asking all about seemingly unrelated or not really important things\nSo we will just have to say again Monica McLean retired FBI and this by the way brings up or conjures up\nFBI\nFord has a best friend in the FBI who read resigned retired in two thousand sixteen\nA wonder how many people working on the Trump case that the FBI trying to establish collusion that Dr Ford and ... McLean no you know what kind of a possible connection here is there maybe\nSo it's it's it's I'm fascinated as this letter from the from the ex boyfriend\nAnd the primary reason the ex boyfriend says he broke up with her is how she lied about using his credit card he took her name off the credit card when they broke up and she can tend to use that she ... about six hundred bucks on\nA board was

the New York times tax story on Trump\n\nNew York times did a year long investigation of Trump's taxes now I I don't know where they got the returns that it's illegal that they have them\nObviously somebody up the IRS doesn't care I mean the left is infiltrated everything's obviously that's how this happened what does it matter wants to the times has on that that but they've had them now for a year and note when the story runs\nThey ought not be trying to crowd out the Kavanaugh story right this is something ideally you'd want to wait until closer to the election\nYou want to make me wait a couple of weeks but no they ran this thing yesterday and now there's a companion Showtime network documentary on this so there's been some collaboration might even say some collusion on this\nWhite cover up the Kavanaugh story with the this is providing a huge challenge for the cable news networks what to do what to do we've got Trump out there they claim he's mocking wealthy forty wasn't mocking or\n... guy I understand Republican senators saying what they're saying oh my God this is only acceptable I don't know why president that he did it for some reason\nEverybody's pointing out that the Trump just last week was saying she was very credible yeah he did and we knew when he said that why he set it to everybody has to before\nThis is um investigated and put your but you can't run out there\nAnd start ripping on her even if it's deserved even if it's warranted last week it could not rip on Christine balls before there was nothing there is no upside to doing it no matter if you were right\nEven if she was lying there were teeth and you can demonstrate a last week was not the time to do it so Trump joined the chorus I find a compelling I find her very\nCredible will now she's not so credible she never was but now she's not so credible as all kinds of holes in Trump just pointed amount all Trump did is playing out the flaws in her story which should happen during the hearing\nLast Thursday but the Republicans were not going to go there and they were not going to challenge because it just wasn't\nSmart\nEspecially with that voice that she was affecting to go after her in any way that would seem like an attacker like it is a believer\nWhether or not been politically useful but in a in a normal congressional hearings committee hearing her allegations wouldn't be challenged in tests that they were not that's all Trump did\nTrump pointed out the mistakes or the ... or the difference is the ... she can't remember where when who the people she says we're there says they weren't that's all he did Republican senators should have done that last week but they couldn't\nSo Trump's Kevin uncovered Trump's writing shade for them and let them go out and to rip him for doing it if they want to understand that by this time we have to assume Trump knows what he's doing when he goes off script he doesn't step in it\nIt may look like it but he doesn't but that's not the big takeaway [noise] the big takeaway for me is this one year\nThe New York times hasn't been investigating that Trump's for forty years they've got tax returns going back who knows how long\nAnd guess what's not part of the story guess what\nIs not part of any income tax story on Donald Trump guess what one word you'd do not see in the report anybody want to take a guess\nWhat I often just say no that's not the word\nWhat one word is not in this entire New York times story I'll give you a hit it was the sole reason the last one I didn't get their hands on Trump's tax returns\nRussia ah ten for bad yet they want to Trump's tax returns because their tax returns they said\nWould prove Trump colluded because his money came from Russia because his wealth was be causing due to Russian connections that's what everybody on the left was convinced was true and now here's the New York times story\nYear long investigation Trump's taxes going back more than forty years and then not able to find any Russian money\n\nSo now they didn't find any Russian money and I guarantee you they expected to\n\nThey're the ones who said this they're the ones that said I'm Talking about everybody on MSNBC CNN and go back a year ago back to the two thousand sixteen campaign when everybody was hell bent on proving\nThat Trump was a ... storage Trump\nWants to Tony Trump was compromised\nBy Russia because it was Russia that enable Trump to get rich\nAnd his tax returns would prove it they said so I guarantee you when the New York times got these documents the first thing they did was make a B Line key word search however they search it looking for Russia Russia and Russian names and serve big fat zilch zero not so now they're on to something else now\nActually or whatever is on somebody so far I think most of the hour the\nBottom line and I know what had happened to a woman for political\nNow what grams point there's there's a lot of young people in his audience it don't remember\nThe Clinton years in Nineteen Ninety two when James Carville was trying to destroy all John's\nHey you never know what you got to know when you're grabbing got about go to ... ... what you got to come up I guess what you're not gonna you're gonna come up by women like New Hampshire aren't great it is not a\nBill Clinton and that's Hillary Clinton was right in there trying to help destroy those women and Lindsey Graham was referring to these people in the audience didn't know what they thought he was talking about Ford\nAnd that's when he stopped and said I see that's actually a reference to something somebody said James Carville most of you are too young to remember this\nSo not only do they live in denial but it ever happened now they're trying to shut down anybody who brings it up\nYou know the Clinton years in what they did the women supposed to go down a memory hall now I have a transcript and anti Kevin all protester with confronted I'm a Republican senator and he pushed back\nThis was an attack or a confrontation walking down the hall\nOr any Kevin all protesters have flooded Capitol Hill and they've been allowed to get into the hallways of the offices\nIn Senate office buildings how does that happen\nBut what we all know what happens but they're they're one of these protesters approached Republican Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana on his way through a Senate building walkway Monday\nAnd she said why are you supporting Kevin up where are you supporting Canada Cassidy did not ignore her he took the chance to push back he asked her if she would like it if her loved ones were destroyed by uncorroborated Gerges\nCassidy why wouldn't I support Kavanaugh protester because rapist or bad Cassidy wait a second everybody there said it didn't happen either rape anybody so why am I gonna so you're going to you're going to believe mark judge over a woman no I'm going to believe her best friend\nWho says it didn't happen she wasn't there\nHer best friend didn't say didn't happen her best friend said she wasn't told about it her best friend said she didn't remember it\nProtester so you're okay as a doctor to harm a woman Cassidy wait a second uh you okay as a person to go ahead and do accept the non corroborated charge to destroy somebody's life\nIf you destroy your life your son's life or your husband's wages to answer that question if it was your husband your son your father whose life has been destroyed by uncorroborated when you buy that protester I Would support a full FBI investigation we're dealing with appropriate robots I'm Glad Cassidy pushed back but it's a lost cause on the protester the\nProtesters not even hearing what he says she's got program dancers bought and paid for by George Soros and she hears key words in what he says knee jerk reaction causing things replies accordingly\nCash that you know no would you like and on corroborated charged destroyed I wouldn't marry somebody that was a drunk said the protestor\nOh wait a minute uncorroborated answer the question I don't think you're able to because you know it's unfair protester I Would stand up Cassidy you know it's unfair protester I Would fight it would make sure women or heard clearly you're all care for rapist goes on the Supreme Court castle you know I'm not\nBut then on the other hand clearly you're okay the absence of evidence obviously means nothing view protested no there is evidence look at a standard how many people are in jail for ...\nSo what does this ... unless somebody like me gets hold of a transcript of something like this and help people understand that it's a total waste of time to engage in these protesters especially if you're trying to persuade them you can't persuade them I just like you can't persuade the media\n[noise] you know I I've told the story when I was first at this\nVery young Web behind the ears naive and the media would want to talk but I thought they were really interested I didn't know nobody's ever heard of me a radio shows taking off I thought they were legitimately curious and that's how I went into early interviews I found out that not all they weren't curious about anything they were simply there to discredit me\nMake fun of me to raise doubts it took me\nLonger than I Want to admit to figure this out you cannot for sweat and these people you can't change their minds and debate it's why I say the

there\n\nThis is not mocking her and this is a sign of what really is wrong in this country an accuser comes forward and you can poke holes in obvious places\nYou can't point out obvious discrepancies you cannot reference or make mention\nOf the differences in her story depending on the day she's telling it whatever it is it is it is not mocking\nKristin ball the Ford now\nTrump has a lot of people saying look this is crazy rush because last week Trump was saying that she was credible and her testimony was compelling I have explained this before and I'm going to explain it again\nTrump all ways eventually will tell you what he really thinks about anything and he may not do that out of the batter's box I have a name for this I call it pacing\nTrump woman necessarily go out with a general opinion like on gun control after a shooting or the dreamers or in this case Dr ... for your caller credible testimony compelling and he'll even go so far to say that yeah if if she's telling the truth yeah they're my nomination might be in trouble yeah I'll agree with that\nThat gives him credibility it makes people kind of cock their head they don't think Trump can be that's fair I'm Talking about the media and the left Democrats they don't think Trump can be that that a reasonable\nBut he does it to them every time it gives them the credibility later to be\nCritical and the step away he said yeah I found a credible I've found her compelling then as we learn more and then as events play out Trump is able\nTo parlay his original statements into what he really thinks based on\nWhat is not a knee jerk reaction if Trump were to have said initially when he said last night at the rally why there would have been held up pay but now he can back it up now there's all kinds of evidence that her timeline doesn't make any sense\nWe've got an ex boyfriend claiming she is a polygraph expert and I have taught people how to beat them\nWe have people challenging her account we didn't have that last week it is perfectly fine for Trump to do what he did\nIt gives him a credibility later to be critical just step away it's a common technique you use as he does it on everything\nIt's why I've always told you don't take his first draft statement or his first tweet as a sign that he's caving or flipping you people you I'm sure you remember there haven't been many instances in fact I may have fallen for one myself that's how I learned\nThat Trump will tweet something or say something it'll make you look like he's about late ... before he pulled out above the Paris climate accord what did he say\nClimate change very serious thing to do with a look at it than we are looking at the moon to the right\nTo oh so he's on record as being open about that later on when he's learned when he needs to learn comes up tells you what he thinks really thinks\nIt's a pattern it's a technique\nIf they trumped developed I don't even know if he developed or it's just how he does it naturally and instinctively\nBut I call it pacing now Republicans have not built up this reputation Senate\nRepublicans have Trump has Trump has a ...\nThat after he makes an initial statement on something and he can make fun of things and what really irritates ... he gets away with it I cannot tell\nYou how it irritates them to he shouldn't have survived the Access Hollywood video he shouldn't have survived anything they've thrown at him the fact that he has an just continue to prosper and triumph I cannot tell you how ... insane it has made the with rage other Republican\n\nDo this and pull it off Trump hasn't been attacked so much we're now if you go back to two thousand Fifteen when this campaign started this is two thousand eight this was three years\n\nIn fact it's it's it's three years in three months Trump gets in in June of two thousand Fifteen\nTrump has been attacked so much he doesn't care anymore\nIt doesn't bother him anymore is my point he's not willing to take the arrows he's willing to take the hits for everybody else that's why he is needed folks he is willing to do what he did last night I Know Murkowski\nAnd Collins or shorter ringing cowering in the corner with the vapors\n[laughter] oh my God it was horrible it was so ... was a horrible everything he said is true\nIt was not mocking her the actress video or audio we played mocked mostly for Trump didn't\n\nThey just simply probably she she can't back up she cannot corroborate there isn't any cooperation for what she said why you're not relevant\nWhy does that not matter\nWhy have we gotten to a point where any woman can come forward and accused any man of anything and it's gospel\nAnd then be joined by a so called movement called me to wear all women can joined can you imagine if there was something going on there can you imagine of men organized\nFor the express purpose of destroying women\nYou can't even imagine\nAnd I can you\nYou can't even imagine the organized movement the male version of me too\nWell\nRush or a million women are no there are six we'd do well\n... yeah that does happen but that's not the point this is not about even ban and set it this is not just about sexual abuse this is about Raul power this is about\nFemale rage because of things that have happened to them the leftist women\nAnd they have organized all of these disorders into a giant political move but I'm just asking you to think can you ever can you envision\nA movement of men if if such a group existed and\nOprah Winfrey had invited the leader on her show he'd been thrown off and the first ten minutes and have been ridiculed and made fun up in the rest of his wife ... could not happen\n\nWomen are a minority and supposedly even though they're not uh in numbers\nBut it's so out of balance all Trump did\nSay what everybody following this\nKnows even the Democrats are Democrats know all kinds of holes in her story\n\nTrump doing what he's doing provides a lot of cover for a lot of people as one of the many reasons why he's needed Trump said guilty until proven innocent that's very dangerous for our country that's what this is\nGo just go to a gift certificates to restaurants sponsor

[noise]\nBreathing so welcome back Rush Limbaugh the ivy network books here is the IRS the James them to the gym and guarantee quotes\nFrom a National Review um\nThe more time I spent covering politics the more I'm convinced that a significant chunk a grand\nNational events with yours truly me at Louis Colleen\n... politics at all these people are actually struggling with personal psychological issues and projecting them under the world of politics mango I've been searching for that description for years I have no\nProblem admitting that I was unable to put this together it's one of the rare moments I was unable to\nThis is exactly right we're dealing with people who have suffered some kind of psychological disorder they've turned to politics for the solution for\nAnd they don't just want revenge against who ever did whatever to them they are now demanding that every representative of the group that they are the individual that did something can be made to pay a price for it that's what the ... ... ... ... well\nThe me too movement in large part was never bipartisan it was thought to be said to be but it never was a and even if it if you okay even if it was it's been co opted by the Democratic party look at look at the uh [noise] Occupy Wall street move but look at black lives matter\nI take take any left wing group that you want it's made up of people who for some reason I think they have been unjustly mistreated by somebody\nAnd instead of dealing with that in their lives they enter politics and they demand that the Democratic party take up their cause of the Democratic party willingly has the Democratic party has become the party of all of these disparate constituency groups\nWith their singular causes because the Democratic party realizes that they can combine all of these things into a singular assault on the concept of America that America is responsible for what happened to these people they can be\nAssured that the founding is responsible\nInsult people with psychological disorders are being granted the status of normalcy and then the big donors come along and underwrite them and fund their efforts and they become political movements\nAnd then they become victims and then of course allows them to blame everybody for what has gone wrong in their lives and then they demand reciprocity or revenge or what have you and I can tend to you that most people in our side have no idea how to deal with this\nSo we ended up in about whether\nBoys want to pretend to be girl so they can go on a girls' bathrooms and becomes legitimate\nThat's sick it ... it is in many not that specifically but just the whole concept of what is happening here and it is a violent bullying intimidating movement that has been constructed to push\nAll of these disparate various agendas and the target is America the target is America is founded the target is American Capitalism and so when our caller says\nThat Kavanaugh is simply a stand in for men who have abused every woman out there he's right balls the Ford will end up being supported by other women who have been abused whether she's telling the truth or not it doesn't matter because it didn't\nHappen to them these women we do know that are out there watching this it did happen to them and by God somebody's going to pay for it in this case I mean capital that's how they're going to be heard\nRather than just deal with the specific incidents have happened to them it's the same thing I think with black lives matter or the NFL players kneeling for the anthem a all cops are bad every white cop is a rape every black convict is innocent\nAnd every instance here points to the country at large as being responsible in unfairness in biased in discrimination it racism all of this [noise]\nThe Democrat Party is the organizing party the collection agency for all of these complaints\nDemocrat parties happy to make victims out of anybody who wants to be one and Democrat Party is happy to promise these people that they'll fix it and they never do they never the range of me angered never ends if only gets worse because the Democrats don't fix anything and finally\nIt doesn't even depend on being fixed it just means somebody's got to pay in this case capital he's got to pay\nWhether he did it or not\nNow Sarah Sanders White House press briefing is going on and she just lay the end of the press and she said exactly\nWhat I said if I don't mind saying so she said Trump didn't mock anybody last night he simply recites did the fact\nAnd he said all of this can be laid at the feet of the Democrats there to blame for this none of this needed to have happened in public they had ... for ... ... email or in a letter ... way back in July they could have done everything that's been done to investigate her claim\nOff record behind the scenes nobody knowing about it but they didn't do that they waited to use it as a Hail Mary\n\nShe dispute the idea that Trump mocks she said all he was doing was reciting the facts here it is again this is what the press the media everybody is out now ripping Trump claiming that he mocked Christine balls before\nAnd here it is that there's this they didn't even they Connecticut Senator who himself has been targeted attacks from Trump the target of attacks from the guy was flat out why or what do you mean the target of attacks\nFrom Trump Trump didn't attack anybody told everybody who the guy is\nAnd here is Sarah Sanders from the press briefing just now exactly as I said she got a question from John Roberts and it was all about\nDo you think that maybe the birds we shouldn't have done it marking her like that because you get Collins and Murkowski and it may in fact the way they bowed means or what do you think the president's maybe should have not done it\nThe president was dating a fax frankly facts that were included in special prosecutor Rachel Mitchell's report he was dating facts that were given during Dr ... testimony and it has to make a decision based on those facts\nAnd whether or not face the judge Kavanaugh to be follow five to hold a position on the Supreme Court every single word judge Kavanaugh has said has been picked apart every single word second my second of his testimony has been picked apart yet if anybody says anything about\nThe accusations that have been thrown against them totally off limits and outrageous\nExactly right ya can't challenge her salt Trump did for everybody else who doesn't have to go ... to do it Trump did it in yeah he's provide no little shade for some of these people to hide under\n[noise] and I'll guarantee they may be publicly saying I Wish you hadn't done a Dutch outrageous what prompted their thinking everybody did it privately\nSomebody has to say it it's the freaking truth\nOkay not back to the phones and we go to Tom's river New Jersey ... is next and he is Fifteen Years old ever him I'm Glad you waited you're next on the program thank you for calling\nHey rushed grade to speak to you again a right to have your back\nGreat to be on again anyways so I'm watching this whole thing on me too movement watching the cabinet firings I'm I'm Fifteen I'm just regular straight guy\nThat's into a girl but I think that I really cannot believe any of these women that pop up on TV anymore you can't believe any of them\nOr come an old guy raped me the guy did this to me did that to me you know he had to draw on CNN while you are a couple of months ago saying that a guy raped her because he asked her for her phone number [noise] can't believe any of them and I think that what this this whole me\nGet away ... ... ... that that is my exact point\nBelieve that woman\nI Believe she ... she was raped when somebody asked her for her number that's how she's been conditioned\nWomen's studies on campus the the outright hatred for a man you know I keep talking about it but it's relevant capturing McKenna and this was back in the nineties\nShe was a professor of women's studies at Michigan She taught women in her class that all sex is rape even the sex of marriage the women were lapping up\nAnd women have been taught for two generations now that men are basically predators and that their own kids are not safe from their fathers\nAnd it's not random it's widespread it is part and parcel of higher education today so you have a woman and she could be acting I mean she could be making this up could be a political activist\nBut it's entirely possible at the same time out from that the cause of what she's been taught and heard on the news and talking to her she made all literally believe that men don't have no right to ask her phone number is the same thing as bullying her raping her\nThat's my point she may really believed it\nGoes well rush of you know the same woman that are screaming about living rates are also the ones who want to have the right to having abortions they so they could have unlimited sex\nOr have you\nEver um a year right sex without consequences but you better not\nBut then they claim that all men are predators but then they run to the one hook up and then they want to have abortions for free\nWhether it's their idea then everything's fine it\nHooked on it if not better right by the way here's this ... you're also random it's not all women but it's been made to look like that isn't it\nThe me too movement supposedly includes women\nWomen on across America who do not think this way are being lumped into this movement\nAgainst their will\nIt's just an assumption that the Democrats

B. I. D. O. J. people that were doing this\nAnd I think the objective of Christine balls before this whole thing not her specifically but I look I think she's an activist and then on it [noise] but that's neither here nor there the objective of this was to get Kavanaugh to withdraw his nomination or to have Trump pull it\n\nNow that that hasn't happened this case is beginning to collapse you see stories all over the media about how all this so called evidence just isn't fair\nThey thought that the mere allegation that the cabinet with not sit there and let his life me destroyed like this they fought Trump\nWouldn't sit there and let his nominee need be destroyed like that because they think Trump's ego is such that he will not be allowed to be made to look bad because of what somebody else did or didn't do so they thought there would be a giant cave on this and there hasn't been\nSo now it is panic and scramble time\nSo the zero in on flake\nAnd Trump couldn't hold it in any more or last night at the rally he just on ... on the fact that Christie and Ford doesn't have any evidence is changing her story\nAnd the media is all over the place now saying\nWell you know there's just may screwed it Murkowski and Collins they both think that Trump was horrible and they both now might not vote for Kavanaugh\nOkay well ladies and gentleman I told you some things yesterday but I'm sure people have forgotten but they're no different today than they were yesterday\nDemocrats senators in red states are in heat being ... reelection trouble in fact there was news yesterday polling data late polling that we may be looking at a red wave and the Senate not a blue wave\nIn North Dakota which Trump carried by thirty six points Heidi Heitkamp is in deep doo doo after having come out against capital of the latest poll\nTaken after the Democrats began smearing Kavanaugh but before that committee fiasco last week showed that Kevin Cramer the Republican opponent the high camp has opened a ten point lead\nOver hype camp\nJoe Donnelly in Indiana is similarly nervous Claire McCaskill in Missouri is losing their her challenger Josh\nHawley Joe Manchin of West Virginia they've all been hoping that McConnell when women out\nOr that some Republican senators wouldn't wimp out and not vote for Kavanaugh so that they would be off the hook and not have to\nKnow the words these free Heitkamp Donnelly my cat what's actually were Donnelly McCaskill mansion and high camp have all been hoping that Collins caves that maybe even McConnell would\nCave and Murkowski when cave and its flake will continue to flake and Cape\n\nBut in their states there's held a pay in their states people want Kavanaugh confirmed in fact in North Dakota voters back Kavanaugh's sixty to twenty seven\nPolling has been gun heading the wrong way\nFor Heidi Heitkamp so my point is it may not it may not matters or matter what happens to Collins and Murkowski\n[noise]\nBut if they if if they actually don't vote for Kavanaugh simply based on what Trump said last night\n\nWell that would be embarrassing for them [noise] [noise] now\nSince Trump's on the record as questioning the veracity of Dr Ford and I want to share something with you I found today a power line Scott John sudden one of the contributors a power line of rights that a reader of theirs\nNoted the changes in the timeline that Dr Ford herself\nPresented\nThe power line reader refers to himself calls himself an engineer with a specialty in data visualization\nAnd he made a graphic it created a chart in essence\nBased on public sources based on the Washington Post and other legal documents and it\nIs the dates the varying dates the different dates of the SARS did invent Dr balls he says happened\n\nAnd the dates float she's not even consistent with the ... so the timeline of her story doesn't even add up\n\nThe reader notes the sudden story changed correlating with the time progression in the story date column I'll get that isn't just a second his question of why the sudden change\nWithin a few weeks after July sixth of two thousand Eighteen the answer is that's when Dr Ford came into the Democrat or bits of Anna Eshoo Democrat California and Feinstein and their staffs\nAnd the highly partisan Democrat lawyer Deborah cats recommended by Feinstein right after that foreign changed her story two more times in two months\nShe grew more specific after she began consulting with Democrat activists\nAs they conspired to destroy Kavanaugh\n\nSalt the charge here and try not to try and served a difficult\nTo convey but this is a text charge there is some uh some bars in this thing but it isn't title Dr Christine Blasey Ford's ever changing story multiple inconsistent stories of the date of the alleged\nIncidents in the therapists notes the incident is said to have occurred in the mid ...
