P. Morgan we had a whole has to banks that came out uh with earnings this morning J. P. Morgan being one of them open in positive territory rolling over a little bit here right now I'm curious what your thoughts are on them and general before we get specifically to earnings\nYeah I mean I think the numbers were a pretty solid or you know but they've had a history of beating\nA earnings usually by pretty wide amount so I think maybe a you know this was kind of expected and you're just getting a bit of a pullback or you know because they didn't beat by maybe out larger amount I mean when you look at a new Wells Fargo which is actually still off off on their earnings which weren't nearly as impressive I I think it was just a bar with so much fought\nWith a lot of banks the conventional wisdom is when interest rates are moving up\nBanks are typically going to do well in this case J. P. Morgan open the year hundred and Seventy dollars a share right now a hundred and seven dollars a share even though the ten year treasury has gone from two for up to almost three two I'm curious your thoughts as to why we haven't seen much movement in this ... stock price as well as other banks is well\nNo it's a great question I mean I think that there might be some concerns about the negative effect\nThe rising rates obviously a you know it does make a loan to more profitable a increases margins but you do also have the demand side of the equation they now have a mortgage rate\nThird year fix that you know averaging around five percent or so\nThat might make it more difficult for people to get financing could the a a further slow down in the housing market we've already had a\nCouple of the locations where prices are starting to ah to slow or you know the the ... the increase of slowing in some cases where prices are even going down that they you know that could be a potential problem\nFor any bank with a mortgage businesses large they're\nBoth the last five years we've seen a rise in a large number of fit in tech companies coming in and trying to under cut the pricing structure of the legacy companies like J. P. Morgan it could be the robo advisers on that side of things that could be companies like Ben mon pay pal on the payments side\nWhat is J. P. Morgan Chase doing in order\nTo kind of combat those types of companies and do they need to be doing more at this point\nYeah I think that is a good question I mean you do have a J. P. Morgan with it that that fire or you know credit card I thank God that something where they're trying to offer more benefit them perks to maybe get people to stay with traditional banks\nAs opposed to an online to shit or a mobile apps and I think that's something that all of the big banks are really looking at more closely\nIs there any one in particular when you when you look at J. P. Morgan is there any company that potentially looks like an acquisition candidate for them either smaller regional banks or you know any kind of tech company to maybe get into that space it a little bit more heavily\nPossibly on the tax tired I wouldn't rule out a deal there I'd be very surprised if that shaped Morgan were to try and increase the\nBanking footprint with a regional thing yeah we have an ad for me [laughter] we haven't had a lot of banking ill lately a and I don't think that uh you know many of the big banks are looking to expand their deposits that dramatically especially when you've got it back then there are already\nSo large that uh you know I think that you start running into cap limits and and then it starts with the Federal Reserve they were to do a significant feel\nVery good Paul we got to let you go but thanks for the time and will catch up with the next week they Bola Monica from CNN Business talking about J. P. Morgan Chase\nSome continued news on the uh on the Sears front or as fears apparently is trying to go through restructuring but a lot of its lenders trying to make a push for a liquidation we've got an update just a little while ago that it looks like Sears\nHas received a let's see what this is here looks like they've received the ability I I don't know exactly what but it looks like they have the ability to stay afloat through the Christmas season right now I'm not sure if it really matters\nI mean it's probably a good thing for their lenders ... their lenders are probably just trying to really push them to get one more holiday shopping season and then just close the doors January to just try to get rid of as much as the Tories as much regulatory out of there you know get a little bit more revenue and then take your you know twenty cents on the dollar they can end up with is a bond holder here\nIt it does look like there are some pretty good deals right now like I'm I'm at Sears dot com forty percent off appliances uh you\nCan also have warranty is not worth much [laughter] no [laughter] no you certainly can't you can't get much freelancer TVs are pretty good deal or no I mean they're cheap and general right now yeah let me see if they have anything that looks good out there on the TV saw his voice all black friday I mean the problem is just me no inventory like no one's selling inventory series right now\nNo I mean if you're a supplier you're not going to toss a bunch of stuff and I see your store because you're just not get paid for it\nYeah you you have to figure there's just not much going on on that side of things quickly markets briefly all major into these still in positive territory gifts\nThe point is this guy does he nobody's talking but he goes to the next us database and he figured oh Rush Limbaugh does look even climate change do people who were more than\nJust rank amateur on professionalism but the reason I played this is is not not to mention this guy because while this guy is jumping all in my chili\nListened to this story this is from the federalist papers liberal professor says hurricane victims deserve what thank God because they support Republicans now do you think these\nClowns in Boston with zero in on something genuinely get range like this no they're going to make up the fact that a bunch of people like me who know oh that climate change of man made climate change is a hoax or somehow responsible for people having lost everything including risking\nTheir lives does University of St Thomas engineering school in Minnesota\nBut and fluids sciences professor Dr John Abraham he's a professor actually believe the Florida Panhandle residents deserve to get hit by a catastrophic\nHurricane because they elected climate deniers here's the headline\nIn an article written by this guy was published in the guardian and not some obscure little rag or a penny saver this was published in the guardian\nOn Thursday victims of hurricane Michael voted for climate deniers elections have consequences denying science has consequences and we are reaping what way so\n\nPeople just like this are teaching your kids and they're being paid a lot of money to do it\nThis is the wide chicken my reasoning that he is teaching any engineering school the guy is doing range this is this is hyper political partisanship disguised as science\nHe thinks that voting for Republicans causes hurricanes to hit red states and the people in red states who voted Republicans deserved to get wiped out by hurricanes for voting for Republicans\nAnd his name is Dr John Abraham a University of St Thomas engineering school in Minnesota\n\nDespite the lack of science to support his case Dr Abraham blames Michael's intensity on manmade global warming there isn't any evidence for it it's not the most intense hurricanes ever hit the panhandle\n\nYet he blames the intensity and manmade global warming are needing to his subsequent claim that southern voters brought this upon themselves\nBy voting Republicans into office\nIt's how one or the other states like Florida which will get pummeled by Michael couldn't vote for somebody that denies climate change this doctor wrote\nPointing to governor Rick Scott andme to Senator Marco Rubio on the his argument is that in the last Republican climate deniers or voted out of office that more hurricanes will bring more death and destruction of the south is so this clown\nWho is disguised as a as an engineering professor literally is saying that if you want to stop\n\nDestructive hurricanes striking where you live vote Democrat he's literally this one is what he said in an unrelated story a bunch of which is somewhere are putting a tax on Brett Kavanaugh this week and I'm not making that up\nAnd they are disguised as Democratic Party activists are hacks on Capitol I'd I'd I don't know what the nature of the Higgs is\n\nI mean this [laughter] if if if it weren't so irresponsible\nThat would be funny meanwhile you have the entire left now attempting to destroy Kanye West\nAnd what Kanye West Dan is simply venture off the liberal Democrats plantation that is a no no if you're African American you venture off the Democrat plantation they are going to destroy your meanwhile idiots like this professor\n\nA professor of engineering literally tells people\nThat if you want to stop hurricanes from blowing up where you live vote Democrat it's because you're voting Republican and and denying climate change that these hurricanes are coming after you now do you remember after Hurricane Katrina you people might have thought that I was joking there were people\nIn the leftist medium\nWho literally weren't trying to tell people in New Orleans that George Bush wanted that hurricane to strike Louisiana\nHe wanted it specifically the strike New Orleans this is why there weren't any warnings it wanted it to strike New Orleans because Bush knew that residents of New Orleans would have to abandon the city\nAnd go to Texas where as Democrats\nThey would be absorbed and wouldn't affect any political outcomes but in Louisiana you can turn the state Republican if you can get rid of a bunch of New Orleans Democrats and so there are people out there saying that Bush actually wanted to hurricane to wipe out New Orleans so that residents would have to leave\nWould have to go to Houston\nThere were some even saying that Bush was doing what he couldn't just steer the hurricane that Bush was responsible for it because Bush told the weather service\nTo downplay the warnings well I didn't want to mention it but I'll go ahead and mentioned there were some now these were not mainstream media people but they did repeat this there were people out there talking on a tax on the Internet Hoover claiming that Bush was steering the hurricane\nRemember that\nThe Bush was steering that hurricane Bush himself the president was nearing the hurry and\nThis professor at\nBy claiming that simply the way people vote determines where a hurricane goes how stronger hurricanes going to be\nAnd whether or not the hurricanes gonna wipe you out and he doesn't know yeah it's the redneck Riviera and yeah traditionally the pay load both Republican but he doesn't know there might have been some democratic voters got wiped out the odds are that work because so many people didn't get wiped out\nYou know we we we look at these events are these people do as one wants to political events [noise] some of these people who had been wiped out\nYou you look at that devastation and you say how are they ever gonna come back\nThey didn't have much to begin with\nI mean it's just some of these photos that you see for me to\nDo\n\nIt is it's just heartbreaking to see what happens and the only upside as it was not\nYou know a densely populated area but that doesn't change\nThe impact on the people who live there anyhow there were some who didn't evacuate and I made up their minds themselves in the media found them talk to them they wanted to stay they wanted to hang in they wanted to see what it was all like every hurricane has\nThose people who are hell bent they either want to protect the homestead or they're curious to hear how devastating and how big it how rock is the is the arm storms I Want to see it and they roll the dice thinking that they'll survive it or what have you\n[noise] takes all kinds of people but this when I when I saw this today I thought it had to make sure this is not you know some satire sight and it isn't\nClimate deniers making these storms worse by stopping action on climate change so see\nIf we hadn't just not gotten out of the Paris climate accord and if if Trump ... stop making fun of the UN's ... plant mental whatever it is on climate change\nThen the hurricanes and get their message in a hurricane to go somewhere else they're hurricanes wouldn't get so strong but the hurricanes no hurricanes know that they're attacking Republican voters whose therefore don't believe in climate change their hurricanes are targeting people for destruction of wiping them out and these people need to know that they're making it happen because of the way they vote\nHow absurd how stupidity how\nUnfair to leap politically partisan by the way it was it was getting ... book on it like clockwork just today here come more intense\nYou have such would think of other faiths that starts with the\nWho cares about the ... he is for you that's the best that we get the easiest way you could that's

you look at it when you think of it there was no collusion between Hillary and the Democrats in Russia there was collusion there was a lot of collusion with Russia and lots of other people by the way\nAnd he's right what he's talking about here is the Clinton campaign of Democratic National committee hired fusion GPS founded by Glenn Sampson who's refusing subpoenas to testify to Congress claiming the Fifth Amendment\nFusion GPS took the money from the Clinton campaign the DNC and went to a law firm cut out Carl Perkins ... this was done to make Hillary and the DNC is money to look like they were buying a legal advice and campaign advice but\nThe law firms then funneled money after laundering it to Christopher Steele and have that and went out and created this lying stinking

America is if it's happening in Washington or New York and it's happening everywhere\nSo a psychologist tail here CNN before lovemaking not his idea of a turn on but his wife she can't turn CNN

[laughter]\n[noise]\nBy the\nWay it folks I I've got two more stories that focus on the insanity of the left I mean and I'm not using the term loosely [noise] here's another\nOne's Susan Glasser staff writer at the New Yorker she writes a weekly\nColumn on life in Trump's Washington she writes a weekly column on life in Washington in Trump's why what life in Washington has become because the Trump once a week\nOr this piece the headline I listen to all six Trump\nRallies in October and you should to some had it's not a reality show it's real it's a long piece but do not misunderstand\nThis lady Susan B. Glasser listed in watched six Trump rallies and she is up set that they're only on CSPAN\nShe's mad that Fox has stopped covering them that CNN is stopped covering them that pie MSNBC uh stop covering them because she thinks they are damaging to Trump\nShe thinks if the people of this country's solve these rallies that it would be the end of Trump She points out how Trump lies all the time how Trump exaggerates all the time she\nTotally miss understands the purpose of the rally she does not exactly yes I predict that she does not get the connection or the bond between Trump attendees after rallies Trump supporters and Trump\nShe totally does not get this\nShe does not know how to listen to the Trump She does not know how to\nUh empathize with Trump rally at ten days she has no ability\nTo relate to Trump has his supporters do she watches these things and she is\nAppalled at Trump personally politically he lives all the time\nHe ... he reminds people he makes fun of people he's mean\nMeanwhile people at these rallies or having the best time of their lives it's the highlight of their week to go to a Trump rally and this woman is studying she's watching six of them so far this month\nAnd totally does not get it\nShe is missing the purpose of the rallies she does not see that this is Trump's mechanism for getting past the media she does not see that this is how Trump negates and goes over the drive by me to something Reagan also master\n\nTheir masterful they are formulaic even though everybody thinks they're improv and Oscar if they are formulaic there are segments in every Trump rally and he follows them do what the\nWhat he says differs in some cases but the point is here's a drive by media specialist ... and totally doesn't get it\nIt's the exact opposite if these rallies were televised nationally as they used to be\nThere wouldn't be any talk of a blue wave anywhere except in New York and\nCalifornia Rush Limbaugh cookies I Want to use radio nine twenty and\nMy friends like you I Am thankful every day for the brave men and women and protect our freedom and our country now is Veterans Day approaches I Want to announce that my friends that Mahendra\nAre holding their fifth annual military salute give away the winner will receive a hindrance retriever utility vehicles that's right a brand new read my Hendra retriever one thousand gas model\nLast year's winner army captain Robert forty of Ohio is loving here's my handwritten you could be next\nTo nominate somebody who is active duty or a veteran of the U.S military and to get official rules\nIs it Rush Limbaugh dot com and look for them a hindrance military so little give away\nThanks to my hindered the makers of the toughest utility vehicles on earth and God Bless all of you who protect our freedom\nTake advantage of rock bottom prices and test drive on my ... today at do based tractors center in Daniel ... or visit to bake tractor dot com that's due bay tractor duck\n... [noise] but she put it out there and of course the media ran with it and they've had to withdraw because she had to withdraw because it was a true\nAnd it it's\nFairly common that these people on the left engage in this kind of storytelling insult mongering here it is John ... never Trump or ... or it's\nThe Democrats and blue wave is drying up oh that's how it would be a disappointment\nDon't count your elections before they're hatch that's the lesson of the past couple of weeks or so called fundamentals that supposedly govern the twenty eighth teen mid terms\nStill point to a good a great night for Democrats they are the out party and the out party generally does better than the party in power\nBut\nTo generic polling question this week have Democrats up twelve and Thirteen points respectively that would suggest a so called blue wave in which most house and Senate seats in play will likely he'll Democrat and it's in line with the twenty ten of Republican numbers around now yet yet and we\nPointed out that all of these national generic polls show this gigantic wave would if you go race by race if you go into the state's district by district\nYou don't see this way if you don't see the evidence in the polling\nAnd people have been asking how can this how can this disparity be how can you have a generic ballots that shows the Democrats plus proper plus Thirteen but then you don't find any single congressional race that shows Democrats plus twelve or Thirteen while it must mean the generic ballot doesn't mean much Muslims is\nHow could a generic ballot dilemma name on it by this time when you start pulling people among three weeks away from the election you start asking questions about how they're going to vote without a name and the question what do you think could result is going to be a\nState level polls over the past two weeks showed no blue wave certainly not in the Senate\nThey suggested Democrats appear to have almost no serious chance of winning the ... Senate that would require them to pick up three Republican seats and the whole day every other state that they have\nThey held by incumbents that at this moment it's far more likely Republicans are going to pick up one of their seats\nSo [noise] it's\nAnd it goes state by state the show where this is all happening and then the evidence against a blue wave is primarily in the Senate\nBut\nThe conventional wisdom here is not rooted in specifics but conventional wisdom is rooted in just that conventional wisdom and hope\nThe left hopes that this is a\nTraditional year party out of power wins big that's what they're hoping they've got their generic ballot posed which say that's exactly what's going to happen but then you go into the state's state by state race by race and you don't see it see why to close races some that could go either way\n\nBut they're still hanging on to hope they are reporting the hope they're reporting the hoping hoping that reporting to hope will turn the hope into reality\nNow before we get too much in the hour I Need to tell you a little bit about a movie that is a opening tonight it probably has opened in some cities all reading of certain theatres it's God's Nell\nThe trial of America's biggest\nSerial killer now ... is an abortion doctor who got away with the ... murders in Philadelphia got away with the wants to the murder of\nThousands\nNobody can get the media interested in the story even after he was charged and convicted and put on trial and the reason is that correct guys know\nWas the worst thing that ever happened to people who want to keep abortion thought\nOf and categorized as something other than what it is\n\nThe media wouldn't cover it and nor the trials very much there have been a lot of people who did and covered Michele market was one of the leaders also people at the like and Marcy an hot air was was hot on the trail of guys and I think they rolled over a hundred and sixty different articles\nSo the trick is how do you do a movie about this\nHow do you get it made me in\nMovie equals Hollywood how'd he get stars I think if people start at how do you get money to finance it how do you get it made and how do you get a distributed it how do you find the theaters\nThat will exhibits that thing how do you do or and they they ran into every predictable problem that you can imagine but they ...\nThey got it done and the way they got this ... this is a movie about the trial of ... guys now it's it's it's a\nIt's a procedural movie like a procedural crop cop show crime in a cop show on TV meaning it follows a formula it doesn't get overtly political it doesn't it doesn't want to limit the audience by getting political even with a trial this movie\nHas a rating of PG Thirteen and it's about wanting abortion murder there is not a lot\nOf hardly any abhorrent Gore and violence\nIn the movie it's it's ... in in other ways it's not meant to shock it's meant to entertain and educate it's an attempt to you is a movie\nIn a responsible way to do things in movies are supposed to do entertain entertain entertain enlighten may be informed it's not the political movie that the left would make\nAbout a story like this it can avoid the politics but it is exceptionally well done for the subject matter you're you're not going to be if you go see it you're not going to be watching people advocating for a cause\nYou're not going to see a movie designed to separate you from your money in terms of political fundraising you're gonna see Hollywood professionals who happens to be pro life producing a movie about something that really happened a mass murderer\nHe was a mass murderer of people\nIn the room that nobody on the left one at anybody to know about\nWhat he did Kermit guys now was despicable but he was a charming guy even engaging smile and laugh even and this trial that was said that he was\nCharming people now are all\nNick Searcy directed this and I don't know anything about directing movies\nBut I can imagine some of the challenges in in a movie like this you don't want to preach and you don't want to make your movie a target but you want to be truthful about it and you want\nThe message to be delivered\nBut you don't want to turn people off you don't want people to think you're being they're they're they're being preached or any of that\nAnd so the way I looked at it I didn't I didn't see Nick Searcy you as a bunch of special effect or other things to distract you just let the story tell itself and it's basically the trial there some set up the\nStory itself is all anybody needs to know the number one mass murder in America which he was never referred to as as because of course the left abortion is not even human that's um Bible tissue mass or what have you uh it's got\nStars people that you know people put their careers on the line to star in this movie the odds are that they're going to have trouble getting cast and other movies having been identified with is dean Cain is one\nOf the ah the actor who plays a gazelle himself as a as an actor and I think ... commercials name is Earl Billings\nAnd for somebody that's only widely known as an actor in TV commercial this guy does one heck\n\nOf a job it's probably the finest\nRole that he's played for the best performance that he's had a I Would guess a as an actor but I just want to let you know that if it if you're thinking about going to it's PG Thirteen we're not talking ... we're not we're not even talking ours here so you're not\nGonna be immersed in a bunch of\nRepulsive Gore and again it's it's thought that they don't need to do that tell the story the story itself tells itself\nSo now Yahoo News\nThe American media is attempting here to blame Donald Trump for this Donald Trump and his open disdain and criticism of the media is sent to have made Mohammed bin ... comfortable with\nThe fact that he can get away with murder and journalists because Donald\nTrump made him think it'd be okay this is what the American media is now [noise]\nBeginning district you know this is just a tweet from a Yahoo guy holding cough but this don't be surprised\nIf it starts blowing up [noise]\nFrom this point forward right now\nAll these diner reminds us that breast cancer is one of the leading causes of death in women although the risk for breast cancer increase with age every woman should risk
