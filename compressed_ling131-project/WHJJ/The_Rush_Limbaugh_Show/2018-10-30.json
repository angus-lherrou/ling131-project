districts they're known but they're not as known as incumbents are no not as well known so that that makes some of this somewhat iffy\nI and and then there is the traditional statistical aspect which says that the party\nThat holds the White House in the first mint terms after a presidential election all ways Lewis's seats so forty five seats they caved in\nTough to defend\nAs opposed to if those

those forty five will slip\nAnd then you've got a contest among races are in in other parts Senate of course now they're saying now I mentioned this to all of these people they didn't care and they said they're aware of this they knew about the resign\nResigning members of Congress retiring they ... they didn't know the number not all of them did\nBut their attitude was that it doesn't matter it

Michigan Militia short wave radio network that's what they said they were talking so it blew up in their faces and miss continues to too\nBut why did you get the birthright citizenship this I think as a follow want it to Donald Trump following through on one of the primary commitments they made as a candidate which I think is responsible for his election and that is his promise to\nBuild a wall to get a handle on\nIllegal immigration\nAnd to stop it because of its for ever changing consequences to this country but primarily with Trump is a law and order issue as it is with all the rest of us it's simply a law and order issue we have laws\nDefining legal and illegal immigration we have a political party that is pushing illegal immigration\nAnd actually both parties have to the extent of promoting programs that have amnesty involved for all of both parties have different reasons for supporting in the meantime the very definition of what America is and what our culture is is under assault\nAnd the politicians in Washington don't seem to care because they think they're always going to be insulated from whatever negative changes result\nAnd in some cases it's even worse than that the left wants those changes the left wants this country overthrown from the days of its founding out to the left America\nIs it legitimate to tip morals it's in the sun because we were a slave nation and we discriminated in the original white privilege was the founding fathers\nThere were no founding mothers only founding fathers they're bunch of white privilege rich white guys they set up a country for themselves and their descendents so goes the argument leaving everybody else out and it's time to overthrow it out and change it and it's a serious movement and it's\nIt's a ... you can trace the educational roots for this back to the night teen seventies Nineteen seventies as a [noise] an offshoot of radicalism in the sixties is where\nSo that the mistakes at the founding could be corrected the vast majority of people do slavery of the founding was was understandable but they needed the union in order to fight\nThe revolutionary war they needed the southern states they needed unity to do that so they had to accept slavery but they'd built in safeguards to wipe it out of habit an agent sixty eight the fourteenth amendment begins this way all persons born or naturalized in

amendment here [noise]\nBecause it's going to be relevant as the issue of goes forward [noise] again it was added after\nThe civil war its purpose was to overrule the Dred Scott decision\nWas a horrible Dred Scott sanction slavery\nRoger and than it was the chief justice for ever immortalized in infamy\nIt held at black slaves were not citizens so Congress got into gear and pass the fourteenth amendment guaranteed\nThat freed slaves would have all the privileges of citizenship by providing quote all persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof\nAre citizens of the United states added up a state where we may reside which means the draft or is that the fourteenth amendment had no intention of conferring citizenship I'm the children of aliens who happen to be born here in fact\nThe very author of the citizenship clause senator Jake I'm Howard of Michigan\nExpressly said this is why the original intent\nOf founding documents are so important quote\nThis meaning the fourteenth amendment this will not of course include person was born in the United states who are foreigners who are aliens who belonged to the families of ambassadors or foreign ministers\nIt was expressly ... couldn't first citizenship to slaves and their descendants\nThere was an Eighteen eighty four case el versus Wilkins Supreme Court ruled the fourteenth amendment did not\nEven couldn't for citizenship on Native Americans because they were subject to tribal jurisdictions not us jurisdiction will lead an illegal alien here is not subject to us jurisdiction there under the jurisdiction of where they came from if they're here illegally\nGas when this all changed\nIn the Nineteen sixties concomitant with Senator Kennedy\nWanting to re oh we had shut down all immigration from Twenty one sixty five along comes Senator Kennedy in a pre Chappaquiddick days wanting to reopen it for the express purpose of making sure the Democratic party

I think it's smart to make it an issue\nLeft can sit out there in the ring its hands over oh my God Trump is just trying to roll up his base it's cold winning an election\nWhere we've gotten to a dangerous point here where the left refuses to accept election outcomes and folks that cannot wean the anything good that has always been the glue that's held us together\nI I ... I I have at times I marveled that this country is held together the way it has for many years as if has\nGiven the only thing that really holds us all together as a piece of paper or a series of pieces of paper in the U.S constitution the honor system and the ... the respect for that document is what's held us together\nAnd all of our years we have never elected a desperate aren't tyrant who won an literally rip it up throw it away and establishes on tyrannical dictatorship but it's amazing\nBut we're getting dangerously close to the same thing happening when one of our political parties refuses to accept election results for whatever reason they didn't make it up well it was stolen the Russians this or that if it doesn't matter when they refused to accept it\nMeans that there really isn't any unity around the premise of our country\nAnd we may not unify issue to issue the issue\nBut we always have been unified about the premise of America as founded that's what's under assault today and that is what is in my mind\nA profoundly dangerous and we are raising him have been since the seventies generation after generation of students who have been taught things that have nothing\nIn common with the founding of the country we have not taught children we've ... we've ... you go back to the days when we learned that are in junior high intramural football and softball ... nobody won\nThat there were no outs in baseball you know no kid ever struck out the candy hit until they hit the ball put it in play there were no losers there were no winners\nOutcome based education two plus two was five if you thought it was by we weren't going to humiliate people were wrong the people who are really smart in school or in a slow them down and we're not going to service their superior ability to learn or going to slow them down so it was not to offend anybody else\nAnd we now gotten to this point where kids have been raised ...\nThey had been taught phony notions of self esteem self esteem today does not derive from achievement an accomplishment it derives from I have a right to help self esteem parents have been\nTeaching little kids your perfect little Johnny you're perfect little Suzie I'm In it and not prepared for adversity insult when nobody has been raised to deal with adversity which in this case is losing an election we have temper tantrums and we have a child light snowflake behavior on college campuses\nAnd we have a political party that's behind all of this\n\nRight now it's rooted in the failure to accept the results\nOf an election of that is on going and now on Twitter as I said you can find posts Hollywood people promising that there will be blood if the Democrats do not when\nThe house back there will be blood so people are being threatened if not directly but in a generic sense all of it is designed to limit turn out\nI think it's having the exact opposite impact on people I think the left and the drive by media continue to understand misunderstand\nWho Democrats are Trump voters are why they are Trump voters and why they aren't going anywhere [noise] uh let's see if we were also here being being told that we need a new kinds of civility that the Trump\nPresidency and all of his supporters are promoting all this in ... and the violence and so forth when it could be said that it's the exact opposite I ... I\nThink reasonable I'm harping on the fact people refused to accept election results it's profoundly indicative of who they are and it's a large explanation of why they're behaving as they as they do\nAnd it's ... refusal to accept is not just because Trump one it's not just because they hate Trump it's more than that it's because they lost they were fully expecting to win and they didn't and so they simply refuse it because\nIt's not a matter of thinking it's a matter of feeling they don't feel happy I don't feel good and when they feel bad and something's not right and that's also been part of the education system\n[noise]\nSo we'll get some headlines Tom ... Facebook and comparing Trump to Saddam Hussein\nThis is from what I'm calling the news civility and let's tone it down stack\nThe Democrats and the left and then drive buys her telling everybody and

need that human emotions well you can definitely do with an act of Congress but now they're saying I can do just with an executive order\nBirthright citizenship covered under the fourteenth a member of the constitution the convicted mob boss Whitey Bulger's been found dead in prison in West Virginia he'd just been moved to that prison today from holding facility in Oklahoma moved there from a prison in Florida box Boston reporter Bob Woodward says Harvard\nEighty nine years old we understand his health has been drilling and some are in a wheelchair bound\nCause of death today has not been announced this is Fox News\nOr use radio nine twenty\nDown there\nAnd\nBack to the phones we go this is Dan in Manchester, Connecticut welcome sir great to have you here\nThat get Russia I wanted to thank you for telling people about the truth intent of sexual on an amendment fourteen because I've been trying to do the same thing for years and people aren't in the midst impression that it simply means if a child born to illegal aliens in this country automatically becomes an American citizen\nYou can't blame 'em it's been the case since the sixties and it's it's it's um\nYeah it it it it's ... we're we're dealing with mass ill education that's taken place on a lot of things in this country that's why it's so important that we've got a president willing to push back on it yet right 'cause what's causing this is causing any discussion of it this is how it happens I've told everybody\nThat this is what pushing back is going to look like so\nYou were talking about Dred Scott as a reason why the fourteenth amendment was ratified which was actually on July night they teach sixty eight but another reason why it was ratified is because it goes back to the thirteenth amendment that abolish slavery well\nThe southern states weren't going to accept that so they passed laws are codes that were so restrictive the plaques that it's actually made them slaves once again and they were called the black coach so then Congress said okay you want to play that game\nThen we're going to formally recognized former slaves as citizens which will make them subject to all the privileges or immunities to the citizens in several strays per article for section two claws one\nSo after that they do sweat coach work hours\nAnd that's why we have a ... getting on the fourteenth amendment\nAnd matter of fact you know the one of the ... the the guy is considered the founding father to the Fourth Amendment was represented by the name of John ... from Ohio\nAnd he made some remarks about the fourteenth amendment a few few years later and you can find that in a house report number twenty two dated Eighteen Seventy one January thirtieth\nSo it all explains how this joint committee passed the fourteenth amendment so President Trump with all due respect to him he wouldn't be not be ending birthright citizenship because it never happened he would be appalled in the U.S constitution\nWell that's the point that is exactly the point that I made is why he shouldn't do this and that's his point\nPeople have looked into this may have found different rationale than you did but the point is if you look at the original intent of people who are involved in writing the fourteenth amendment all Trump is doing is enforcing the constitution and taking it back to its original intent the fourteenth amendment was never intended\nTo confer citizenship on people here illegally or the sons and daughters of ambassadors are foreign\nAgents it was expressly\nWritten cooking first citizenship on slams and now it has been expanded and again that you can trace it back to the Nineteen sixties\nWhen this began which coincides with the Democratic party wanting to re open immigration you know I still run into people who do not believe me when I tell them\nThat as a nation we suspended for the most part I mean ... there's always been\nA people being rapid citizenship but we suspended mass immigration\nFrom the mid Nineteen twenties to the mid sixties pretty express reason of allowing all of those who would emigrated starting in the late Eighteen hundreds all the way through the Nineteen twenties to assimilate\nThat's what immigration was people were coming here to become Americans and they wanted to be Americans\nThey didn't have to give up their birthright they didn't have that they they settled in ah in in neighborhoods are Irish have their neighborhoods in New York and Philadelphia the Italians\n... but they wanted to become Americans they learned English or and they became part of American culture ... of which there is a distinct in unique American culture which is rooted in western\nCivilization that's what's different now there is no interested in that\nWe don't even make a serious effort at assimilating we're ...\nIf they use this term tribal but we're Balkan icing our population\nBecause modern arrivals don't all seek\nTo become Americans people trying to get them on the on the legal immigration side of course are but this this mass illegal immigration has an entirely different purpose behind it and the political support is entirely different for it\nThen for standard uh immigration so what Trump is doing is simply with his executive order if he does this\nWill be re establishing the constitution and re asserting it so yeah no you're exactly right about that so two calls to great points that the guy who from Pittsburgh who asked a question he lives there and he watches the news and he's been blamed\nFor the synagogue surely [noise]\nWe've got to tone it down and we got to come together and we got to do this we've got to do that\nAnd if it's being said if that's being said in the media you know it's all aimed at Trump and his supporters are pretty sure that call again Southampton in New York build your next great to have you with us or Hi\nThank you Russian thanks for all that you do for us yes you're bad ... with the ... um with regard to the fourteenth amendment why not take it to the Supreme Court or is that where this is going to end up actually so that they can decide oh it'll be their language says it'll get there and get their okay yeah it'll\nIt'll have to get there that no Senator Graham is going to offer legislation that in the Senate a look we're way way far away from this\nWe're just getting the conversation started here which has to happen\nUh maybe long term a economic relief for any nation having problem is a greater dose of capitalism but there isn't the political climate for that and many of these countries there their dictatorships of one degree or another and\nThis is an immediate problem that's going to have to be dealt because if it's not they're just going to keep coming and it's ... and\nWe're not going to stop these caravans if we start implementing a tax free enterprise zones nominees nations where American companies going to relocate and hire them there instead of hiring them here\n'cause that's if people aren't capable hired anywhere yet\nBut I understand it if you want to start political theory and economic theory it makes sense in the world and otherwise you know quote unquote normal circumstances but this is a short term political movement here this caravan [noise]\nI Know why or George Soros I think George Soros his name has become a like a bogeyman for everything people mean far left wing radicals when they mentioned George Soros I don't know who's behind somebody is and their purpose is to destabilize the United states\nThe purpose is not to improve life from these people\nThis caravan whoever's behind this is not really trying to do something for these people to make their lives better this is being done\nTo it to invoke damage on the United states protect generally Trump and to advance the political advantages and notions of a particular political party which wants to welcome these people in as dependent voters a\nJam in Madison, Virginia great to have you with us You're next on the E R B network high\nHigh yes fresh and I got my husband and I adopted for an extra stairs\nWho were in foster care and we had a couple of years

he has to send all the people that they realize now that he is doing what the country\nWell we'll take them you know whatever they realize it is a is is is fine with me of course it's it's a once you understand what's going on it's impossible to support\nIt's it's just it's impossible support on the less you have particular political notions of what the United States purpose in the world is and what we owe\nAnd so forth but in in terms of being the best policy for the United states it isn't\nAnyway appreciate the jam thanks much will take a break and be back\nTo Russia only nine twenty

Michigan Militia shortwave radio networks what the excuse was so now that's become a me we have here is this a montage\nYep we got about just CNN people and some National Review people uh radicalizing St ... saying ... Trump is radicalizing domestic terrorists just like ISIS listen to this\nWhat are we learning about how the Pittsburgh suspect was radicalized these men appear to have been radicalized these men appear to have been radicalized\nRadicalized people seeing what the president appointed thanks\nWeather is Sarah Huckabee or Donald Trump the half true thing leads to people getting radicalized who was radicalizing people in America Donald Trump certainly a parent's responsibility\nFor the bomber was radicalized into sort of this Trump super fan community Pecker has radicalized so many more people than I ever had\nI off there she is with the I guess the ... she pronounces you off his shoes GQ\nI think she's a followed jive yes G. Q. writer Julia yeah the Trump is radicalized many more people than ISIS she said that while I was a\nGuest on CNN and then she apologizes for claiming Trump was radicalized more people than ISIS she apologized or Monday shortly after claiming a on the air but Trump has radicalized more people than ISIS Twitter\nBlow up after she made the comments except that I used to be when Twitter blow up it was all liberals it was all leftists you know Twitter is blowing up ad leftists all over the place now\n\nHere's the next one CNN Tonight with Don Lemon speaking with the former Republican National committee chairman Ryan ... might shield and Washington Post columnist Max Boot about the links between\nTrump's comments on the actions of the bomber and the synagogue sugar\nIn Nineteen Ninety five when Bill Clinton blamed Rush Limbaugh and talk radio or for the Oklahoma City bombing you have to be very careful that you don't start to tell people that their political speech isn't allowed any more because there was a direct connection between political speech and violent that's a very serious thing to do that\nJihad as terrorists lone wolf carries out an attack\nWe always ask what radicalized than what inspired him to go to violent we have to ask the same thing about right wing terrorists I put him there are a lot more in this country right now than there are as long as terrorists and you could not divorced the actions of the second ... from the sick rhetoric that you're hearing\nThat smacks boats Max Boot used to be as conservative as anybody you know uh in the Washington establishment something you may think that's not very conservative but he certainly wasn't this\nWe have to answer the same thing\nAbout these right wing terrorists of whom there are a lot more in this country right now than there are Islamic\nTerrorists you can't divorce the actions of these ... people from the sick rhetoric that you're hearing\nSo what he's talking about is you have an a jihadi who walked into a mosque one day was a perfectly innocent young guy had no ill intent toward any buddy walks into a mosque starts listening to the among preaching comes out of their Osama bin Laden was you don't hear\n\nAnything that's exactly what's happening in a unit so somebody Donald Trump is is radicalizing people\nDonald Trump is encouraging this the moms are telling people what to do and how to do it they're being taught how to make bombs how to explode themselves with bombs that are being nobody on our side doing this as we get kill us\n\nIt's the comparison alone and it comes from never Trump ers who are frustrated that they have been able\nTo diffuse Trump they've been unable to dispatch Trump\nAnd it's always a one way street we never heard about Bernie Sanders radicalizing the guy that shot up\nThe Republican baseball practice we never hear about the whoever was radicalized\n\nAny of these leftist so the Hillary Clinton right it's always this one way street is always you know what it's rooted in bugs it's rooted in the belief that not a single conservative can make up his or her mind but what\nAbout anything one of the first criticisms of this program dating back to Nineteen eighty eight was that you are a bunch of mind numbed robots and I am your Sven golly and I\nAm telling you what to think every day because you're too stupid to make up your mind on your own I'm telling you what to think I'm telling you what to do I'm telling you how to vote I'm telling you want to go\nThat has been the criticism and what does that rooted in rooted in the presumption up superior intellect to people on the left and the belief that you are literal idiots\nWho cannot make up your mind on anything what they never understood and they made no effort to understand that and the fact that they make no effort to understand it or understand Trump and his voters is what's largely doing them in they never\nUnderstood that you already believe what you believed you already thought what you thought when I came along\nAll I did was repeat\nWhat all of us had been saying to each other but you ... you were not hearing it anywhere in national media what you believed was always laugh dab or criticize made fun of mocked but you were never\nGiven any respect whatsoever\nThan this program came along and it reflected what you think and what you say well you were talking about with your friends and that's why you're glom onto what not because you're sending out there in your relative ignorance day in and out all of a sudden started learning things so the presumption is that you're so stupid and your soul mindless\nThat's been golly you can tell you how do you think are tells you when did it go start blowing things up or window started shooting people\nAnd now we've even got never Trump conservatives or out saying this kind of thing\nAnd it all boils down to you know what I keep the essence of things that keeps\nWorries they're real anger at directed at you think it's Trump and it is but the real anger is for you who voted for him\nThat is where they are fed up beyond their ability to express it and the fact that they can't talk you out of supporting Trump there to be tied\n\nYours the reason that this is all going because you have the stupidity of voting for the guy and now\nYou're blowing things up and you're shooting people just deeply darkly insulting it's not promoting civility it's not promoting unity\nHundreds of miles or ...\nOr ... feet are susceptible to hurricanes and tropical storm or whether you can stream and leave

amendment applies to undocumented immigrants Fox's Sean decker at the White House\nThis is Fox News [noise]\nOh nine twenty\n\nI'll let me explain what I meant I'm suffering here I'm In the last two callers have been speaking a mile a minute and I've been unable to hear enough of what they were saying [noise]\nTo comprehend so I had to put it together after they hung up the most\nRecent caller I lost her when she just how families will gas light a the weakest number of the family I've I've never seen that\nSo I'm rolling it back and forth on my head but then I finally heard when she was talking about her definition gas light a I got an ... her point was that the Democrats the media and get to define everything\nThey get to define that get to decide everything what they say is is what is in anybody isn't that then of course as abnormal or what happened and that that that has been my\nPoint that's just a different way of saying that\nIt irritates the hell out of me too I watch the media that my my favorite example of it and I'm Sorry for being redundant here Indiana and there are countless examples here Indiana passed a religious freedom Restoration Act\nThe media have did it\nIt was in response to people not being allowed to tell gay couples no I'm not going to make a cake for your reception I my religion doesn't allow me to do that so these gay couples but then they would target these places hoping for that reaction and they'd file lawsuits trying to put these bakeries and photo shop businesses out of business\nAnd the media would come right along and act like that was entirely justified\nThat these big it\nWould refuse to bake a cake or take photos on a gay wedding reception or what have you uh so when when when Indiana passes along Pence's the governor the media was out ranged and they\nBegan to report on this as though the whole country was outraged that Indiana was somehow a loan out post of racism and bigotry and homophobia\nAnd it's this this this\nAttitude and all things that they do ... what they report in the way they report it what they say is what is normal and they get to decide who the big it's are and who the ah the racists are and once that happens your tag you're it\nAnd then they ran around and they started knocking on doors asking businesses would you bake a pizza when you when you make a pizza for a while they were and they found a little girl Twenty one year old woman a running a pizza shop for her family you know\nWe wouldn't it would be against the salt they zeroed in on this Twenty one year old woman and they wanted to make her out\nTo be the typical Indiana bed yet\nAnd she was just answering their questions naive way and innocently she was just trying to be honest with them she thought that they were really interested in what\nThey were asking about they were looking for a victim they were looking for a target and she fit the bill and so for however long the reporting of that went on Indiana was odd the people in it are odd weird racist beget sexist ...\nI Know exactly what the caller Mitt Democrats get to decide well let me tell you something folks\nNot true anymore that may be the way they report it and they met that may be what they try to create but people rebelled against they've called Donald Trump people rebelled against that the Democrats since Obama had been losing elections don't lose sight of this\nStarting in two thousand ten the Democrats have lost over a thousand\nMaybe it's closer to twelve hundred electoral seats at federal state local level\nAnd there's a reason for this they are being rejected and the media is being rejected as as well and so gas if if if what the media dead ...\nTo the state of Indiana is gas lighting as if that's what the definition is al heartily endorse it\nAnd uh and accept it and it's this arrogance and just supremacy her superiority that goes along with that kind of coverage and it's it's everywhere it's you\nHave a the synagogue shooting at the obvious the obvious explanation\nIs that Donald Trump and his conservative media posse are radicalizing and this becomes the narrative this becomes just the way it is and everybody thinks this is crucial for me to the weather report these things to make it look like they are the majority and they are what's normal\nWent increasingly they aren't\nAnd what really is happening here is that people who know they're not by definition spreads numbers normal are trying to turn everything upside down so that what they are is normal and what everybody else is is the one that's odd ball abnormal the media's right in their facilitating this or that I'm telling you it is and it used to work like a charm\nAnd on many people still does we still have a lot of people in our side still want to couch how the media still wanted to find whether or not conservatives or Republicans are succeeding by virtue of whether the media as being nice to them or not it's frustrating to know when when I run into people like that and they're out there\nBut the electoral results just in the past two years ah indicate that people are more and more aware of this and pushing back\nAgainst that uh to see what [laughter]\nI didn't see this I didn't watch Fox News Sunday on Sunday but apparently Chris what I gotta I got you know I'm On Fox News Sunday twice a year during ratings\n[noise] and Chris
