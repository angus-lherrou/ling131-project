{"month": "10", "state": "RI", "station": "WHJJ", "content": "Like would they share that with you that would be a I Would say rough justice for Mark Zuckerberg is best for every study out there shows that social media leads to pretty awful mental health outcomes and continued use of it is pretty much the worst thing that you can do so\nOn one level I look at this and I say okay they're trying to do some interesting things with data but as you point out a why should they be the ones who we trust with this power in be is there\nAnything that leads you to believe that if if if they found that there were problems with the Facebook Platform in terms of causing problems that they actually tell you about it\nI feel a little better about somebody getting data from Facebook uh but you know it was part of the medical school or Harvard School of public health isn't this kind of like a beer company doing investigations for DUI\nThat's actually that's a very good way that I liked that metaphor like it's ... it's it's not that they might not find anything it's just they might not tell you anything about it actually might potentially a little conflict of interest you know we're back when all your you remember what all the tobacco companies they have like those Institute for research on tobacco that you know all prove the tobacco doesn't cause any problems\nWith the dysfunction during the chicken coop here like it did not work like it doesn't work like that more doctors smoked Chesterfield than any other brand must be good for you then right\nJack Dorsey the c._e._o. of Twitter\nAlso the c._e._o. of square stock that if you're not familiar with them a square runs a payment platform a boat for accepting mobile payments as well as point of sale terminals that can be used in retail locations\nThe stock had been on an absolute terrier to date it went from forty bucks to share to North of a hundred over the last twelve months it's gone from thirty to share to over a hundred and since October of twenty six teams for the last two years it went from eleven bucks a shared over a hundred\nBut the last month has been devastating for this stock in particular the last couple of weeks going from Ninety nine a share down below Seventy Saddam thirty percent in the span of two weeks now what's the latest news from them so they're CFOs moving on to become C. E. O. a of the neighborhoods social network\nNext door a this is Sarah fire and I would say ... feel like this is great news about squared they've got fantastic talent and you know their talent wants to be rated by a other companies\nIs this didn't bring to mind once last time somebody asks you for a credit card and rent it through a square device plugged into into their phone or maybe ... cell phone ones may actually I was like I Know I I have one about a four or five months ago so I had to have someone come out to fix a garage door that had broken\nAnd it was actually it was the contractor I said hey you get interested in voice goes not just the pulls up a little thing put soon as I Want to go just payment out will take care of it I'm like oh this is greatest either I don't have to set automatically generates a receipt and everything and boom everything's done there I see a lot of contractors using them for their businesses actually interesting because it made me think\nI feel like I saw those things more two years ago than I Do now you see a lot more you see a ton of the square payment platforms in retail locations in particular a lot of restaurants using now I'm a lot of the fast casual places I see him in but\nIt does feel like the ones that are built to go into your phone\nWere more popular maybe in twenty Thirteen and fourteen than they are today I don't see quite as many except again a couple of contractors are that are using them here\nAnd I would say even after the thirty percent sell off its still been a heck of a run since January oh you look at it it certainly hasn't and look I Know anytime you have senior leadership believing it did it you have questions hey who's going to fill that role you know that person was there through give kind of there's up tick here\nBut you know this this person's there had been there for six years you know this is not a case like we saw with Tesla were the chief accounting officer left after a month\nAnd raised all kinds of questions because why do you leave a job after a month the boss is nuts this is hey I've been here for six years and there's a there's a reasonable case to be moving on I think you know certainly there are questions hey what kind of talent comes in to replace\nA miss prior just because you know she obviously did a very good job steering them through in ... but then the few years afterwards\nBut in terms of you know should investors panic because she's leaving I don't know if that's necessarily the case and the cool thing about score you know Jack Dorsey walks into this building and goes to he goes to the left\n\nAnd they're the ones that run around claiming that ever they must be attached to climate change when it is a weather event anyway\nI said eventually don't don't get so upset by this this is nothing I mean this is this is I'm actually flattered nobody mentioned in the piece here but he certainly was mad\nBecause he doesn't know what to do when confronted with abject ignorance like this how do you fight abject ignorance and prejudice and so forth [noise]\n[noise] and you don't you defeat it\nYou don't try to reason with it because it's impossible\nYou defeat it I've got a chart here doesn't go well on the radio but it demonstrates that since Nineteen hundred you can find that with all the chart and hurricanes since Nineteen hundred you can find you know significant trend in either the frequency\nOr the intensity of major hurricanes striking Florida there simply is\nNo evidence\nThat climate change manmade even exists and there certainly is no evidence that it has anything to do with hurricanes either the number of them are the intensity but that doesn't matter because the New York times and the rest of the drive by an offer to running cause they are hell bent\n\nOn getting people to ... and he said why what is the purpose because this promotes big government it promotes the notion of gigantic autocratic\nTyrannical government control over everything once you are the American citizens are blamed and can be blamed for everything that's wrong then you can be controlled to make sure that you you\nStart doing things right and don't keep doing things wrong that's what they want this ... this but in the process they don't even know what they're talking about this guy does know hurricanes from under storms\nHe doesn't know cloud tops some temperatures and it doesn't matter\nI Want to thank Mr surgery for being so sensitive and so concerned about it but I Want to assure you that these kinds of things no longer\n[noise] bother me other than the I I I Do get concerned that there's so much genuine ignorance existing now in\nPositions that influence the thinking of other people\nI mean feminist studies\nAt universities I firmly believe has destroyed\nThe futures of way too many women\nIt has just distorted the life it's distorted gender differences it has distorted the concept of happiness\nVictim allergy it has distorted the whole concept of America the greatest place to live and grow up and seek opportunity in the world\nAnd it's ... and feminism is just one of many elements of liberalism that is doing the same thing too it's other constituency groups for example\nLet me ask a generic question we had Eric Holder out there\nWho is campaigning for somebody to be governor of Georgia holders supposedly going to run for president himself and twenty funny or Eric Holder the\nAttorney general for Iraq Hussein all involved in many scandals himself\nAnd I'm seeing a lot of people on our side and ... so called conservative intelligentsia shock that Eric Holder would say what he said you know Michelle my bell Obama's out there saying no no my motto is when they go low we go high and holder said screw in that when they go low meaning Republicans when they go low we kept\nThem\nSo people's mind God he's out there inciting violence and he said no no no no I didn't mean it literally\nI was saying that we can't take it anymore we after Scott being a nice guys and stopped taking it and he didn't mean it\nObama method when he said they bring a knife we bring a gun Obama met at sodas Maxine Waters when they're both encouraging people would get in our faces they mean that\nThey are already inciting violence they inciting violence inside Capitol Hill buildings and elevators they're engaging in bullying tactics my question is why\nWhy are the Democrats doing all this why are they inciting violence let's look at the things\nThat they think\nAre supposedly on their side things that are helpful to them we start with the fact that they are convinced that they're going to win control of the house\nIt's already done the blue wave it's just a matter of the day is on the calendar passing by until we get to a ... day where we can confirm that the Democrats already won that remember we had a poll from CNN a sound bite John King couple of weeks ago\nHe recited a poll indicated the house races are over there are polls said the Democrats are likely winners of the house of representatives over in their minds they won the house in their minds they all lost won the Senate they have the Mueller report\nAnd the mother report is going to link Trump to Russia right\nThey know that Mueller's got the goods all they can taste it Paul folks\nThey can scratch their bags with it they just can't say you know ... Mahler secretly collected the goods they know that Mahler is going to issue a report and it's got a tie Trump and Russia and it's going to prove the trumps stolen the election from Hillary Hillary shouldn't be president that should make them happy right\nWhy all the desperation CNN\nEngaging in full fledged one thousand percent racism and directed at Kanye West\n\nYeah Kanye West is what happens to one negro when he stops breathing that's what they said on CNN with Don Lemon laughing in New York and get all up wasn't that long ago the cover of time magazine\nWhen was this a two thousand\nFive the drive by media proclaimed Kanye West the smartest man in pop music\nHip hop's class act\nThe firing the rules of rap Kanye West goes his own way [noise] so what would I be Thirteen Years ago Kanye West was in the future\nKanye West was the hero but now Kanye West is having lunch at the White House today with Trump ads is Jim Brown\n\nBy the white Trump was funny that Trump Trump photos and why did you do that rally why did you do that rally with a hurricane coming and climate change destroying and why do you can Trump said you know what\nYou have a point but there were people that have been a lined up for a day and a half to get into this either I couldn't disappoint them I had to go and it was a great time\n\nTrump to slam dunked him on a number of things that are short little press availability at the White House\nSo now\nA CNN handled calls Kanye West a token negro\n\nListened black folks are about to trade Kanye West and the ratio draft don't ...\nSaid\nAll of a sudden cognac because he's put on a ... hat and he is he's an attention\nHorror like the president he's all of a sudden now the model spokesperson he's talking negro the Trump Administration as ridiculous as this\nA female passenger was removed from a frontier airlines flight after bringing an emotional support squirrel on board the plane policeman are lamb do Florida have they have all passengers exit the plan to deal with the passenger after she refused to get off the plane on Tuesday\nAnd emotional support squirrel first thing I thought I was I Wonder if this woman happened\nTo be flying home from Washington After a weekend clawing on the doors of the Supreme Court or trying to harass Republicans in the halls of the Senate office building\n[noise]\nHudson Valley man arrested after allegedly planning to blow himself up [noise]\nBecause he's upset about the\nPace of millions of fear to with that it's fair to team at home for professionals and look everybody's curious what they can get for their home right now will check it out we did an easy website where you can ask for a value and you're going to get a home value report an estimated home value report delivered right to your inbox\nCheck it out home price for one dot com again the price for one on\nDot com and don't forget to take out my radio show talking about Rhode Island and Massachusetts real estate a new radio nine twenty streaming an eye heart radio to the late stage a every Sunday at ten am\nIn a ... voice list price dealer price to be happier if your car shop and you've probably heard these terms of what they mean is\nThis audio is for your review and not for broadcast Internet posting or distribution of others is a ... copy the air quality origin on his property by our media Washington\nConfusing well it was confusing not anymore I'm telling you about true price from ... it's a price it actually means something because it's the exact price you pay for the car you want including season accessories and basketball you'll know if you're a true prices competitive because true car shows you what other people are paying for\nPolitical building that dream home\nTo talk with us about a mortgage loan\nMany options to consider\nFind you've alone that was right for\nCall a civilian gets orange\nMarket can go raped me cry when did it become OK for men to be lazier softer fatter we need to bring them into this country back to greatness and it's easier than ever with age list male Macs\nA patent pending formula within a greeting if that helps boost your total testosterone promoting greater increases and muscle size and twice the reduction of body fat percentage that exercise alone plus an amazing sixty four percent increase in nitric\nOxide flood watch for this afternoon through friday morning two to three inches of rain is expected to fall in the city of Providence announces a potential search for a new school bonds company has the drivers strike continues all eyes on Wall street today after yesterday's huge plunged\nIn sports the Bruins are home for Edmonton tonight get news twenty four seven on demand that news radio R.

lost that's what it is and they're just trying to cover up for it anyway you know people are observe it out there I got another email rush\nCould you explain to me this journalist named ... show gee let me it's ...\nAnd ... if you I'll\nBe glad to tell you what I Know about this and it is it is somewhat there's somewhat fascinates name as ... a shell game that the president of the United states involved in this now Trump has been openly asked about it\nAnd it has to do in many ways with with our new found relationship with Saudi Arabia based on the fact we no longer depend on them for oil\nNow Jamal ... is Saudi I don't know if he is related to add ... ... is is a as a Saudi or Arab name and then your show he was a famous arms runner made famous as a celebrity by a\nA lifestyles are the rich and famous but the guy was an arms merchant he was an arms dealer adamant that the source of his wealth which was made to look like a jet setting party animal\nBy Robin Leach so whether whether Jim aka show is related to him and I couldn't even find out just habit Jamal ... is a critic\nOf Mohammed bin selmont Mohammed bin ... monitors the crown prince\nIn Saudi Arabia his father is the king king sol ... he is the brother of the late deceased king king of double their father grandfather uh start at the house of Saud they are the royal family\nThe crown prince the each of these\nGuys have many sons there are constant battle for power with in the royal family the crown prince is the chosen son he is the air\nNow Mohammed bin Salman is not the oldest son of king Solomon but he has been designated the crown prince meaning he will be the next came as such Mohammed bin ... mom has been trying\nTheoretically to reform the soul of the the Saudi economy and to take it away from being strictly petrol and a oil focused because\nThe world is expanding in ways that the Saudis are not involved in one of the things uh Mohammed bin Salman has been doing has been traveling the world and making friends in the United states who spend a lot of time in Silicon Valley he's gotten to know always wind and dying the Google guys he's winding dined Facebook guys spend a lot of time an apple\nHe wants to build a brand new city out of nothing in Saudi Arabia and make it a tech center he's thirty two\nIf he takes off the Arab garb he looks just like your average run to the middle guy a really attractive short little stocky\nBut he represents if he is being truthful major reforms he is the guy who has opened up driving to Saudi women he's the guy who wants to relax\nAll kinds of cultural rules on on Saudi women and open up speech to them all but not being able to drive a go places on their own without male a company but this made him quite controversial he also last summer not this past summer last I think it was this past summer\nHe arrested the elite of the elite of Saudi wealth some of them even among the royal family and took over the Ritz Carlton\nHotel in Riyadh and that became a giant jail and he put all these guys in jail demanding\nA certain percentage of their wealth on the base\nIf they had stolen it do to corruption and connections in someone's he made a lot of enemies well Jamal ...\nHas as a journalist doesn't buy any of this and has been running around openly criticizing Mohammed bin Salman\n\nEven running stories suggesting that Mohammed bin ... father ... king has grown so upset with his son the crown prince that he's taking toys and\nPower away from it this reportedly has not set well with the crown prince Mohammed bin selmont despite the reforms in Saudi Arabia you still don't get to run around and criticize the government and keep your head you don't get to run around and criticize the government and keep your knees\nFor example\n... wanted to get married he had to get a wedding lie a marriage license he was in Turkey\nIn order to do that by the end it before the hidden supposedly had been targeted by the crown prince and others in the Saudi\nRoyal family because of his open criticism of these reforms that other things so he goes into the Saudi consulate or embassy in Istanbul\nAnd hasn't been seen since\nA nickel trials president has been shown to improve short term memory\n... healthier brain better\nNow available in stores everywhere they must have not been evaluated by the FDA this product is not intended to treat

airlines had to point out that people than we do not allow rodents on our\nAirplanes and a squirrel I Know they look cute but a squirrel is nothing but a tree rat at all it is it'll cuter face as a bushy tail out there it's a tree rats are rodent and frontier airlines doesn't allow them on their airplanes\nAnd people that was just so means she needs to support\nSquirrels and I just wouldn't it be great if this was one of these they lost her mind in Washington over the Kavanaugh stuff and then there was this\nHudson Valley New York guy arrested after allegedly planning to blow himself up on the Washington Mall around election day because he's upset about the country's direction now do you think this guy is going to vote for this guy is obviously going to vote for the nearest democratic and find that this\nIs how they're being inspired and further evidence that the Democrats are not about ideas and not about inspiring\nPeople to vote for them because of the great improvements that will happen in their lives Nancy Pelosi right here\nNancy Pelosi Trump's tax returns a top priority if Democrats win the house now how is that going to benefit your average Democrat voter well I'll tell you how the Democrats have so poison their voters\nDemocratic voters want revenge not a job not raise not a bonus they want room ... in the Trump\nAnd so anything that Democrats can do to harm Trump why the Democrats will vote for who ever will promise to make Trump suffer you think\nThat's a majority of people you think that's the kind of stuff that creates a blue wave I don't\n[noise] I don't believe that the country is that they're ...\nBut the Democrats are counting on the fact they think it is okay to the phones men in Fresno Europe first today great to have you with us or high\nThey rash thanks for having me on Yes sir I\nSo I was there I was going to be the uh for the three days of the non and last week\nI saw the the them screaming and yelling and attacking us and and the folks and and so why was this is all they have the reason that they continue the reason that John Lennon saying the nonsense she said on CNN the reason that they just continue with this game plan if it's the only game plan they have\nAnd they're hoping that the American people are dumb enough to still buy it but I Believe that the American people even in California where I'm at the American people are seeing this crap and they're like this this is an old game we don't find any more\nAnd and and they have nothing else to claim there's nothing else for them to but they just keep doing the same ... and the luck in our eyes it was like they know they're losing they know that we're not buying it anymore but they've got nothing else to say\nNow that's a whole lot you know that's an interesting point because if they do have the maturity of the presence of mind\nThey do have to realize they're losing Trump one Trump is getting elements of agenda his agenda a pastor implemented Kavanaugh was confirmed everything they've done to stop Trump\nEverything from the judges to the court's travel but not much has worked and so I think you're right they do realize they're losing\nAnd you think they're in a fit of desperation that they've got nothing else to do that's why they're not proposing any ideas to counter Trump's that's why they're not proposing any new policies to counter Trump because they don't have any\nAbsolutely they let loose when they're both\nThe right loses when were silent and they they for so long they've expected us to just shut up and go away it\nWell that that's true too I I think they have become accustomed to Republicans caving and Republican voters and certainly conservative media up well set up conservative caving as well I think they've they've gotten accustomed to bullying working that's for rats lying\nYup threats flying all of that and and and they're hoping that it's going to work together and the only way it works\nIs if we don't show up that's why that's why you see the polling data still showing them winning that's why it showed the only really what's going to win in a landslide because they know that if they can to sway does that they can discourage ... us enough to make us not show up that's the only way they win but if Republicans conservative stand up\nWhen every single time we just have\nTo show up we have to convince other people to show up you convince them to convince other people to show\nUp you say you're in Washington for three days what did you actually see what kind of activities really engage like you saw I was\nI was right in the middle of it I Would live streaming the whole time but um I went right up to Linda so sour in and told I look at their out there saying I Know it's um they're they're out there saying you know believe women and stop or the assault on women and my question deliver what what is wrong when it\nDoes how does how does Islam you're you're out here for the anthem and\nYeah

false\nShe and her husband and the president are teaming up [noise]\nThey have an objective\nAnd I will explain it when we get back\nSooner you establish your relationship with an independent financial professional no matter\nLonger time horizon could give you more flexibility\nBroader product choices\nTo respond to market changes more time to take\nWho he does not like echoing remarks from his wife the bully millennia Trump about it doesn't say that but you know they wanted to write it\nDuring a live phone interview Thursday morning with facts and friends the president said it was more true in the past when he was first setting himself up in Washington and he just trust and members of his team\nYou cited Nikki Haley who announced her resignation as weak as an example of the great people who now feel his administration he said he's going to do away with people who doesn't like are there some I'm not in love with yes we're going to weed them out slowly well she said that ... this is not coincidence\nThis is not happenstance so ... and Trump both are putting staff in the west wing on notice\n\nA Trump also said we'll get to it we'll get\nTo it I don't wanna jump ahead what's going to the audio soundbite starting with number seven teams sorry sorry sorry uh Thirteen [noise] this is Trump calling in to Fox and friends that I used to talking to Steve do see\nA do you say you took some heat yesterday Mr President for going ahead with that rally in Pennsylvania despite the hurricane\nI really had very little eat other than the natural haters of which there are obviously some we had thousands of people lined up by the time either making decisions on my decision was do I want to tell people that were waiting ten and twelve hours are already\nThat I'm not coming and I just thought it would be and we're talking about thousands of people when they get there that early and who you know that area obviously has not affected at all by it we had it under the great control I don't think really\nThe grocery hot thrill out of the things I think it was very minor\nSo president essentially saying look these people have lined up they've expected me to show up I follow through I Do what I say I'm going to do\nThe hurricane was going to do when it did and there's nothing I could have done about it last night when I was in this rally my people are down there working on it we got it covered\nI can do both and I'm following through on the commitment\nSo the next question in from the do somebody who probably is not going to vote for you Eric Holder former attorney general said they go low we kick him and the whole room Mr President started clapping and cheering when he said that what does that say to you about the tenor of politics\nTo be careful what he's wishing for that I can tell you better be careful what he's going to discuss things safe and for him to make is a very dangerous stay put holder foreigners held in contempt by Congress older when after Christians he went after our\nGreat evangelicals he went after the Tea Party people you know that they just settled the IRS just settle that case a holder is he's got some problems\nNot used to be talking to like this\nIn the old days Eric Holder can say whatever you send them to Republicans ... away or not even acknowledge porn or they would say\nWe strongest term oh we ... rhetoric co authored by law attorney general holder written ... much much oh totally totally uncalled for and we we routinely unilateral condemning\n[laughter] Trump says [laughter]\nHe'd better be careful [laughter] he's wishing for [laughter] that I can tell you that I get you better be careful\nWhat he's wishing for\nNow the stock market's been kind of the song it's been a roller coaster ring\nAnd Trump is suspicious as he can be up and let me just tell you something folks there are a number of wealthy\nDemocrat Wall Street types investors people that run hedge funds who I Am convinced\nWould willingly take a bit of a financial hit to their wealth and businesses primarily their business is not their wealth but they would they would David in person pain if it meant\nLowering economic activity enough to hurt Trump I have no doubt that there aren't enough looney tunes on the left who willingly do this I think they're that desperate as a previous caller said\nAnd of course it flies in\nThe face of the Democrats in the media tried to say when it was a new age ah yeah the economy's doing well but the president's not going to get any credit for that people don't even leave it I Believe in looking at\nPolling data people obviously that's not true I think they're terribly worried\nThat this great economy is going to be greatly beneficial not just to ... but the Republicans\nIn the midterms and so there's some monkey and going on with the interest rates is the point it's calling are causing the stock market the roller coaster and here is Trump was ... pointed out to him yesterday was not a good day for investors\nThe Federal Reserve is getting a little bit too cute so when I took over this economy this economy was ready to crash we were at one percent GDP now or a four point two percent [noise]\nIt was ready to crash it was the worst if you look from the great depression when is the worst recovery and the history of our country and Obama took tremendous money at it [laughter] don't forget Obama was playing with zero money so he was playing with funny money he was it was very easy [laughter] I'm\nPaying interest at irate because of our fed and I'd like are fed not to be so aggressive because I think that making a big mistake\nTranslation he is worried maybe accusing the Federal Reserve of raising interest rates because the economy's chugging along so well that traditional\nInside the beltway Washington gets very worried when the economy's going great\nMy whole life I've noticed this and my whole life I have been perplexed by this I've asked myself why\nAnd let's look at the fed here as the establishment in this story\nWhy\nIs a great performing and growing economies so for rent name\nTwo official Washington and it is because every time the economy starts talking what does the fed and do they leak they leak that they are thinking of raising rates and what does that do that kills activity in equities markets\nIf these people think the fed is going to start raising rates people start selling rather than buying and investing what Trump is saying that he thinks this is being done purposefully to slow down the economy at the time and totally unnecessary Fort right before an election and he's calling them out\nHe's caught it's another thing previous Republican presidents would not do he's calling out the fed Mr Limbaugh doesn't Trump ... know you may appoint the Federal Reserve chairman but know day to day no way\n\nAnd the Federal Reserve chairman the odds are that the number of the board of governors are going to be you know a bunch of Tommy leftists\nAs they are at many financial institutions are not going to pretty strictly crazy about Trump despite how much wealth they are earning because of Trump\nI have hope for

of kick him here in a minute\nMy\nGod it must be the\n\nNew York magazine and looking at is Obama had a secret plan in case Trump rejected the twenty sixth deem election result\nIs is not a wary of looking back which which retrace steps it was the last debate between the Trump stir\nImage you'll the beast and Chris Wallace was the moderator and Wallace asked Trump if she writes them which swear pledge to accept the election results\nAnd Trump said no I'm not gonna sit here and tell you right now but I Will accept the results of the election I'm not going to do that until the election comes that we've counted the boats\nThey want it I think what was the objective was to be able to create a soundbite Trump acknowledges he thinks he will lose elections that's what they were hoping for because you're going\nTo have you with knowledge what you'll accept the results of the election oh of course I'm a great American ... that go at that time everybody thought that Hillary was gonna win\nLandslide then they the soundbite would be the headline we trumpet knowledge is likely defeat the upcoming election\nBut Trump crossed them up and said no [laughter] I don't know what kind of shenanigans these people are gonna play I'm not going to concede anything tonight Hillary Clinton gets in here\nThis is the biggest threat to our democracy that where your memory I didn't believe me saying there's this is an unwritten sold them Obama we didn't know until recently\nDevised a secret plan in case Trump rejected the election results and guess what the plan was [laughter] the plan was if Trump wins to steal the election away from him\n\nIn October two thousand sixty ... senior staff and the Obama White house\n\nDiscussed what they should do if Hillary Clinton won the election and Trump refused to accept the results\nThey had cause to be worried at that time Trump and openly speculated that the election might be read during his mind a little bit with Clinton on October the lines have he said that his opponent should never have been allowed to run and declined to answer the question of whether he would conceded\nI'll keep you in suspense Trump said it wasn't a hypothetical\nBen Rhodes Obama senior aide and speech writer told the intelligence New York magazine column Trump was all ready to hang it on the campaign trail\n\nBen Rhodes seems to have a problem with English Trump was asked a hypothetical question what will you do if Hillary wins to which he gave an answer based on a hypothetical premise\nThe Obama White house plan according to interviews with Ben Rhodes and Jen Psaki\nObama's communications director called for congressional Republicans former president and former cabinet level officials including colon colonel Powell and condo leaves a rice to try and forestall a political crisis by validating be election results\nSo this is not funny looking like there is hell bent on making sure the Trump concedes despite being dead and certainly Hillary was going to win and if Trump refused to concede that we're going to call Colin Powell and Congolese are\nRice and a bunch of ex presidents\nAnd they were going to get them to validate the election result\nIn addition to the official count state by state in addition to the U.S Congress certifying the election that apparently it wasn't going to be enough they had to go get colon Powell and constantly as a rice\nIn the event the Trump tried to dispute a Clinton victory they would have fun result as well as the conclusions arranged by the U.S intelligence community that Russian interference in the election sought to favor Trump so we're now learning\nNot we're not learning anything we're having our suspicions confirmed\nThey hatch this Russia plot way before the election even took place and no matter what happened no matter what the outcome was they're gonna use your Trump last they were still going to use it to say that even though Trump last he tried to steal the selection of Hillary and it was that\nWas going to validate her election even more that was going to make an even bigger star an even bigger hero she overcame not just Trump he overcame ... she overcame the oligarchy she overcame Russian that's what their plan was\n\nAnd then it got turned upside down Hillary last and she refused to concede remember she refused to go away they refused to acknowledge the Trump and one in immediately became Trump didn't win the Russian stole it\nAnd to this day there's no evidence for it but there is Obama\nThis story New York magazine they think they're doing an ad a boy here they think they're really praising Obama they are admitting\nThat there was a conspiracy behind the scenes dealing with this election and trying to handle whatever outcome\nI Am a former Victor Davis Hanson who is a senior fellow and thinker at the Hoover Institute at a took the Stanford campus in Palo Alto\nSay the same thing he basically said well you just
