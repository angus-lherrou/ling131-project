[laughter] why are these people panicking\nMr Butowsky says this is not a moment for complacency or easy talk of blue waves it's a moment from Boulder\nMaximum action and turnout based on a powerful urgent sense of opportunity in danger says it's possible but Democrats when the house by a significant number of seats\nHow ever it is also possible Democrats again only twenty seats falling short of winning control that would leave the Republican dominant\nWith a smaller but even more right wing majority of the leading loser\nIn the house midterms are comparatively moderate GOP house members Democrats could lose one or two Senate seats continuing Republican Senate does even\nFurther to the right and even more partisan than a GOP majority that day\nBooed ... says it's a ... in this nightmare scenario for Democrats and America if it unfolds a vindictive and try 'em ... Trump having won a victory for the politics of hatred and fear and don't show up [laughter] [noise] [noise]\nSo we will ah will see of exactly what at landfall\nThe the true when force winds speed happens to be and find out how close to the forecast\nA it was you know going back here to the bowling team captain ... piece rent Butowsky then you'd notice who she said that the Republicans hold on if the Republicans hold on to the house\nAnd hold on to the Senate did you hear him very frightfully point out how that would happen\nIt wouldn't happen\nBecause moderate Republicans would be losing and they wouldn't be replaced by conservative Republicans other words it from Republicans hold the Republicans who will win in these districts weren't Republicans are retiring his theory is we\nCan get even more conservatism we can get even more conservative house in a more concerned is that he's putting\nThe moderate Republicans at greatest risk for losing in his theory in his in his code red alert warning Democrats the Republicans could win it so he's saying that moderate Republicans are at greater risk of losing their seats\nIn the house now how is that possible\nGiven everything else we're told by the Democratic party and the drive by media they tell us America loves the moderates\nAmerica loves the centrists America doesn't want any part of extremists America wants no part whatsoever of radicals and yet there is the entire Democratic Party which is nothing about radical now\n\nMy point is again do not fall for any of this hype that it is over and that the Republicans have no prayer and that there's going to be this gigantic blue wave because not even the Democrats in their private selves when they talk to each other\nIn private not even they really believe that\nThey want you to think they do they want you to be this theory of hand or depressed\nThey are very alarmed in fact that the latest polls that show the cabinet effect on the Republican side is ... Ning up turnout ... up interest and they're really flux and ticked off\nAt a bunch of polling data there is an NPR poll out there there was a Fox News poll a couple of others but show some bourbon Republican women\nAre saying in polling data that they have veil reading new interest and increased energy and intense desire to go vote\nThis is not what we're supposed to happen that's why all these attacks lately in leftist media ripping in two white conservative\nSuburban women and do we need them or not and we don't\nThey say so this is not as we sit here today this is not developing as they want you to think it is\n\nBack in two thousand six soon as you remember any pieces before the presidential race\nAnywhere in democratic media warning people hey hey you know what there is a nightmare scenario here where Trump good when you got to dial it back we've got to be very careful you remember any of that\nThere was none\nThey were ... they were definitely of a a convinced that they weren't going to win every Hillary was going to win and the biggest landslide\nI mean they had Trump's chances at three percent seven percent ten percent\nBut nobody gave Trump a chance in fact some of the news even said Trump never thought he was gonna win Trump never even wanted to win Trump was the most surprised guy intellectually in the world when he won he didn't want to when they were all the press that Trump and quarters that's what they want you to believe\n\nNow they've started out saying the same thing is though power is a birthright that every American realizes that Democrats have to be put back in power\nEvery American realizes the mistaken voted for Trump every Trump voter can't wait to apologize every Trump voter realizes embarrassed wants to fix the mistake can't wait to vote for the next Democrat on their ballot\nNow all of a sudden it's not just Butowsky by the way either there are others\nWho are raising red flags out there that this might not be developing\nAs they wish also from Fox News the homeland security secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said yesterday that the ... are engaged in an unprecedented influence campaign leading up to the terms\nThis is the Trump administration's latest warning that the ... are attempting to sway American opinion I handled the elections of ... wants a whim [noise]\nTry comes want the Democrats to win right why do you think that is why why would a bunch of international communist dictators want the Democrat Party that when it comes or not our friends have tried calms want American leadership they can easily manipulate and triumph over\nThe ... I don't want to be a part of the Trump Donald Trump there's this new trade deal getting rid of NAFTA you know what this has done\nThis has put China back on its heels like nobody fought Donald Trump the United states now controls access to Mexico called up all of North America United States and Canada\nYou've got to go through us you gotta make deals with us if you want to export you're going into Mexico Canada United States because Trump put together this new deal getting rid of NAFTA made the new deal the check comes never thought this was going to happen\nThey don't want Trump they don't want any more if Trump they wouldn't be eager for whoever the Democrats put up I just find it fascinating international bunch of communists are trying to affect our elections so that they're friendly Democratic Party in America wins\nThat somebody has to have to say\nI should probably be met for amuse radio nine twenty and want to have\nWhen you put a safe in your home what will you put in it\nWhat are your most valuable possessions well there's just one branch of safe you should trust to put in your home and that's right oh saves\nThe craftsmanship of their iron works apes which are made in America one of the main issue it takes skills sweat and talent to produce the most beautiful and secure or safe in the world and that's what rhino saves are\nBeautiful creation as that help keep your possessions secured part art part furniture and one hundred percent security rhino saves are built to protect you and your family from the uncertainties of this world now\nHow do you get your own rhino metal safe well check out their extensive Deaver network on line at rhino safe dot com\nVeteran own didn't veteran operated for over Twenty years that's our H.

remember\nWomen went for President Trump in two thousand sixteen Hillary seven white women did I'm an for yes that's right white women I forgot white women we don't like white women right Hillary that's right we don't even though I Am one\nWhite women all white women or women went for me white women went for Trump and look white women have been voting against\nDemocratic presidential candidates for decades now the white vote has only then won twice in the last sixty years my husband being one of the two Lyndon Johnson being there so it's not a surprise it's a disappointment that white women vote Republican and not for me but it is what it is\n\nAnd they're in Hillary Clinton's stumbled and swerved in to a truth\nExcept\nFor a very exceptional election year of Nineteen sixty four which was following the JFK assassination\nThe Democrats have not gotten more than fifty percent of the white vote in the presidential election since Nineteen thirty two\nNow when you look at it that way you can understand why in the Democratic party circle there's hatred for white people white people white women had been rejecting the white married suburban women had been rejecting them [noise] this is why the kind of Nazi movement sprang up this is why\nThe left has as it started contacting all different categories for non white suburban women to be plugged into so that they can then be said to be Democrats constituents\n\nThis and by the way this is again why in Nineteen sixty five Ted Kennedy and the Democrats re opened the floodgates to immigration I Need to remind everybody again\nFrom about Nineteen Twenty one and Nineteen twenty three if you're Nineteen sixty five we shut down immigration I Would not does eat row\nBut we put very strict limits on it\nAnd the reason was to be able to assimilate all of the immigrants that come into the country the late Eighteen hundreds through the Nineteen early twenties assimilation was key to American immigration policy\n\nArriving immigrants all wanted to be citizens by the way and there were things they had to do to become citizens they had to learn a language and they had to learn the history of America they had to be able to pass questions about the history of America on a test\nAnd they had to swear and plan their loyalty and devotion to the United states and they were eager to do it and they were happy to do it now they they maintain their ethnicity\n\nThe Irish the Italians unit but they wanted to become Americans and they did and it took a number of years to assimilate them all\nWell Nineteen sixty five is when Ted Kennedy who led the charge to reopen the immigration floodgates which then of course when to once that happened illegal immigration ramped up in an uncontrollable way\nAnd\nThat wave of immigrants starting in Nineteen sixty five came from third world socialist countries and the Democrats\nRealized they can only when the White House if they changed the population of America they were losing presidential elections with the Native American population because they were losing\nWhite women and Mrs Clinton just admitted in here to Christian I'm poor up CNN it never occurred to them to change their policies what they have to do in order to attract white voters what they have to do\nWas change America so back to Hillary she said what was done last night in the White House meeting Trump apologizing for the nation to Kavanaugh\nWhat was done in the White House last night she said was a political rally it further undermine the image and integrity of the court\nAnd that troubles me greatly Christianity and pour it saddens me because our judicial system has been viewed as one of the main pillars of our constitution look to the apps\nThat judicial system has been viewed by you as he lectured insurance the judicial system has been viewed by you and Mrs Clinton's the rest of the Democrats as your private refuge\nYou have looked at the court as a place you can stock like minded the leftist activists to make sure things that you believe in which never could pass legislation somehow become law in America that's why they want the courts\nIf you want to really get frustrated you heard me say this and you've probably heard a lot of other people but stop and think about this\nOutside of Obamacare practically every liberal ... the steak every liberal idea and belief that now is the law in this country would not have become law in Congress because it never would have passed\nLiberalism and the Democratic party's ideas have never been mass popular the only way\nThat we have bastard ice pop culture the laws of the reality today is because Democrat activists judges have been essentially writing law when they take cases and interpret them and then pronounce decisions roe\nVersus Wade is the most startling example of\nThis but there are countless others the simple fact of the matter is the Democratic party has never been capable of winning\nLegislation to implement the ideas they believe in because most of the American people when they know what's at stake don't want them that's the value of judges and that's the value of courts to the Democrats when Mrs Clinton says\nThat what happened in the White House the other night saddens her\n\nBecause our judicial system has been viewed as one of the main pillars of our constitutional ...\nB. S. not by you\nIn fact to Hillary Clinton and people like are the Constitution's an obstacle is well it's certainly not something to revere\n\n... did you see any way even a conservative Steve college where I was speaking to yesterday said the only way to repair America is to try to get back to some civility to try to make it that even if we have political disagreements we're not going to go to war with each other we're not going to destroy each other\nHillary Clinton well certainly\nI Would love to see a return to civility Christian on for listening to one another working on our differences\nBut that is not the Republican Party that exist today that is certainly not the administration that we haven't power right now when the Republican Senate denied the right of President Obama to have his nominee for the Supreme Court Merrick Garland here we go off to the races again ms characterizing that\nYou're blue in the face\nA Joe Biden rule the Democrats invented that rule that presidents don't get the name Supreme Court justices\nDuring vacancies that happened in the last year of their term that's a Democrat inspired instituted rule and she knows it\nBut the Republicans didn't destroy Merrick Garland the Democrats didn't have to fight battles defending his character and his life because the Republicans were not trying to destroy them as they did Kavanaugh\nAnyway the upshot of this is that Hillary Clinton says it's if it's a time for instability it is it time for this kind of extremism because that's what we're up against Steve skill lease\n[noise] who was shot by one of the believers of Hillary Clinton at that Republican baseball practice\nCannot believe a Bill Cassidy senator from Louisiana responded to Hillary at a time when Republicans are being shot stabbed docks beaten\nRun out of restaurants and sent death threats Hillary Clinton urges Democrats to be even more on civil what an irresponsible statement every Democrats should announce they're not going to denounce or they privately publicly encourage written by applauded they supported that is who they are\nThis is the party by the way that has been railing against all this instability\nFor I don't know how long this is why\nI look at average American voters paying attention to this and I don't understand how any of them can want to side\nSo it was just a wanting to comment on on the ... thing with Muslim due to last night and I can't quote it exactly but she said if you disagree or if\nIf the party is destroying the things you believe in love that you should be a civil would that not apply to the Democratic party as well Republicans conservatives I'm being uncivil to the likes of her\nShort would sure what I mean that's the standard if the party that you oppose is destroying your way of life and you must be an civil against\nBut [noise] [noise] [noise]\nAnd you know this in the Hillary Clinton Democratic Party world\nUm our world should be destroyed that is justice\nThat is what's called for conservatives and Republicans being destroyed that is the new morality\nFighting back are resistant we deserve\nWhat we can see the weakest dealers this week so we can\nDeal and Japanese restaurant in sushi bar in Lincoln known for using only the French is\nReading is repaired with ordered whether it's your favorite sushi for one of their new creative writing or they also have a green winding sunk he lived in sort of all kinds of Japanese and Japanese restaurant Ruth\nWon sixteen just over the past and we can all get your fifty dollar gift certificate to end for just twenty five bucks this Friday and eight thirty only if we can dash deals dot com am\nI'm Jim Gagliardi news radio nine twenty four seven FM\nHere's what's happening in the morning I was fired protected under investigation fires started about for this morning we're Doris reading terrorists avenue ... solar energy project in ... and will not move for cities town council voted last night three to against the plants and the outer banks of hurricane Michael\nAre now making landfall in the Florida Panhandle much of the southeastern United States would experience the storm top winds now between a hundred and forty five and a hundred fifty miles an hour get news twenty four seven on demand and news radio R.

we don't want to interfere with anybody\nTo go as soon as possible you have [noise] you know right nearby we have thousands of people going tonight and they've already many they're already\nKnow a lot of people I just got some emails when this stuff happened you know you're falling for Russia just proves what a ... Trump's not doing this for any other reason that he just wants to brag he's just doing this for PR\nNo friends you may think that and I'm not going to try to just ... but the president's doing this because if he didn't\nCan you imagine the stories that would be published Trump doesn't care Trump didn't convened a meeting Trump didn't ask very many questions Trump didn't seem curious Trump hasn't seemed to have any real interest since he doesn't have a home they're all this kind of stuff that they would say about\nHim he does this for a host of reasons but most importantly\nI Believe Donald Trump likes himself and he's very proud of the job he's doing and he wants people to see it and he knows that the primary conveyor as of information in this country do not\nConvey proper information about him is there's only smart here's here's Kennan Oklahoma City we're back to the phones great to have your or hype\nHey it's great to be on Russia or not only are you L. rush but but you are the lead voice with the mainstream media you should have the best stepping on gas\nOr should have the one path and podcast hey my point is a today a with Hillary's comment that are basically\nLiberals don't need to be civil to conservatives anymore it reminded me\nOf a profound critic came across ... years ago and maybe even ... ah but here's the quote a society is either moving toward civility or barbarism and I'd see Trump trying to apply civil law and order to our society\nAnd it's apparent that the liberal after some bracing barbarism again just wanted to get your thoughts\nAre so the but the question is do I do I agree that uh our society has always trending toward a barber is what ...\n... they were trending one where we're not in the middle of the ... eater trending towards the middle of the barbarism\nOff the clocks and the oh it's a constant influx and so what what what what is your question more Trump isn't it [noise]\nUh it seems as if uh the Republican conservatives are taking the side of civility and working\nUh you know towards the law and order or restoring it and it seems like the Democrats have just outright embraced barbarism dry ... with all of their a character assassination attempts on Trump Kavanaugh antifa violent shooting\nYeah there's no there's no question about that it's an active choice I mean Hillary Clinton's endorsing it\nYeah absolutely and uh it's it's sad to see because this is not the Democrat Party of my uh mother and father and I remember\nSo well you know the conservatism here in Oklahoma where I live uh in fact most of the states\nWell let me ask you know there was the Democratic party the Democratic party girl what was it when that was all gotten fine and dandy one more thing that I\nThink it was before the Nineteen forties\nAnd know what ... what not when what were they what were they like when the Democrats were the Democrat Party over your dad or your grandpa what they want but they're doing\nWell um the Democrats at at that time the basic uh issue was a labor laws and um when what purpose\n... my ... the Democratic party hasn't changed that much is my point\nThe Democratic party has always been rooted in the modern era in our lifetimes in this century and the previous at the Democratic party has been rooted in an anti capitalism\nHas been rooted in pro socialism and big government they've just now a band in any pretense of moderation about that and have gone all in honor militant and violent socialism to achieve their means my boys they're not\nThat different there just mass getting less today\nYou know read about it in the paper tomorrow Russia\nI'm going to be met Warren radio nine twenty and\nHey I'm Brandt so there's this guy didn't Jordan he's a healthy guy either dad of sick and he works as a guide in Alaska and it goes to the doctor a true story goes to the doctor and he's diagnosed with cancer stage four\nAnd here's the thing he had switched earlier for medical insurance to medical care where Christians share each other's medical bills so the question for Jordan and his wife Jenny was is this actually going to work\nOur medical bills exceeded a hundred and sixty thousand dollars Medicare members shared all our bells\nAnd it was about more than just the money to this is a real community\nMedicare is is a family a group of people that stick with you to the hardest times of your life I just don't know how I could have done it without ... sure\nIt's worth looking into there's a reason this is growing so fast so if you want to find out more here is a number for you\nEight five five fifty one Bible that's eight five five five one B. I. B. L. E.\n[noise] since where they see the campaigns he's I think I think Fox is dialing back on the potential eat well timed claims even though there are Democrats doing rallies like this\nSo my point is that they're not as many people are seeing that men and the last night this is such a contrast I have to tell your folks and I this was the kind of thing that you just if you have any observation will power is at all\nYou can't miss that these people at Trump rallies they're non violent\nThey are not threatening their not intimidating and and then they're not dangerous\nAnd they don't make anybody feel in danger or threatened these are people having a great time these are people that are upbeat and happy they are excited to be wherever they are\nThey are part of something that matters greatly to them\nThey want to be involved and they are the contrast to the the makeup of people and their behavior a Trump rally and your average ordinary democratic protest if Dr King\nYou contrast the people at this rally last night it was\nIt was a Council Bluffs Iowa you contrast that with with that unforgettable picture to me of these kids are slowing and the front door of the Supreme Court Saturday afternoon right I\nGet banging on the door and clawing at the door trying to get him\nI didn't know if I was watching the wicked witch of the west the army or what but it was it was\nCertainly nothing that was inspiring or promoted wanting to be part of the Trump\nRallies or the exact opposite and I don't mean the people at\nTrump rallies or a bunch of nerds and dry balls don't misunderstand or just wholesome people in there and they're having a good time and there's nothing threatening or intimidating and there's a lot of laughter\nAnd just general happiness and you never see that at any Democrat sponsored event and even if you do have some happy people\nIn the Democrat sponsored have been audience isn't gonna last long because the Democrat on stage is going to get mad and outraged and get everybody else ticked off\n\nAnd I want you to hear a little bit of a Trump rally last night this is it's about a minute worse the Trump rally crowded has find a way they're found a way to recycle and keep lock her up relevant and current about Senator Feinstein this another [noise]\nThat's usually the documents well\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] no no no we didn't [laughter]\nAnd I\nThink that talking about five and can you believe\nWorst body language on another words did she get a hundred percent and mattress join our citizens and you don't give power to an angry left wing mob and that's what the Democrats\n[noise]\nYou don't hand matches do an arsonist you don't give power to an angry oh by the way that word mob the left is is in since the Trump is calling their supporters the mob and so now there are left wing stories defining the word mob\nBoss up on dictionaries in the wake of PBS and trying to make the case that it's Republican crowds that are the mob and not Democrats they're really a bunch of Democrats elected Democrats are just in didn't end up and did that Trump is daring that call their supporters a mob\n[noise] they're just they're so I'm used to having it throw in a ride back at him with the same force they dish it out they are so on you used to having their ideas and behavior being criticized and they really can't stand being laughed at\nAll [noise]\nSo now Dianne Feinstein lock her up I Want to go back to two thousand\nSixty to two years ago two years exactly October tenth eleventh wave a montage sheer of\nPeople from ABC CNN PMS NBC PBS ABC\nNBC\nTalking about the election October tenth to thousands sixteen the election was over Hillary in a landslide Trump had no chance\nSo nobody has ever come back from this far down and one of the presidential race an unprecedented implosion on the Republican side Clinton is most likely the next president you know he's going to live\nHe's losing it probably has lost the election already this\nIsn't on went above lecturing by Donald Trump the election ended today\nThe selections already lost civil war in the Republican Party a flood of GOP lawmakers abandoning their nominee\nThe worst may be yet to come with Trump they may be staring at\nA total collapse of the party by election day the cumulative effect\nHas finally caught up to her Hillary when they don't win big you want to hear the names of their their names are Matthew Dowd he used to be a Bush adviser who's not just gone\nI don't know where he can't total left totally be see total offer reservation\nJeff ... who's ... university graduate and yet he ended up in the west wing drive by media in New York Times now he's at CNN [noise] it was a coal ... of the marsh communications shop\nWho said the Hillary Clinton is most likely the next president you know he's going to lose but this was right after the Access Hollywood video was released by the way it's very close\n\nJohn Heilemann here's all losing and probably has lost the election all roaming sexual harasser Charlie Rose this isn't on winnable election about Donald Trump\nJonathan Karl this election's all rubbing last Lester Holt of NBC the civil war in the Republican Party a flood of GOP lawmakers bending their nominee F Chuck Todd of NBC the war is maybe you have to come with Trump\nThey may be staring at a total collapse of the party do we just saw that headline yesterday\nAt the hill dot com the Republican House is in collapse\nThat's the story that I had the headline that if you didn't know how to read it you would think that two hundred nine house seats are all of a sudden switching to the Democrats' side\n\nAnd that story predicted didn't predict it said we are in the midst of a Republican collapse in the house\nThey do not change everything is so formulaic they are so predictable\nAnd predictably wrong they're doing it all over again and they're doing it on the same basis that everybody hates Trump\nThat whereas in two thousand sixteen it's impossible people are not going to vote for this guy\nThat has become people regret voting for this guy they can't believe they voted for this guy and they can't wait to show up and apologize to America for voting for this guy so they're going to do the only thing they can do and vote Democrat\nThey were wrong in two thousand sixteen some of them as we\nMentioned earlier this ah this ... budget boot ... warning that there's a red alert out they're Democrats in may not be looking\nAt a red wave [noise]\nAh here's the picture\nLet's switch to it I got it in the sweat you're the dead OK I'm now this is if you're watching on the digital camera and I'll I'll get this up to cook us and we'd have at the website as well that is a satellite photo from goes sixteen I Believe the weather satellite\nOf hurricane Michael\nAnd you can see that it is in terms of its total area it's not a large storm it's intense as it can be it's a category\nFive but it it does not\nThere was a as a meteorologist sent me a note a moment ago Nineteen eighties hurricane named Alan that covered two thirds of the Gulf of Mexico\nAnd again the sensitivity here is is due to the fact of media is hyping this and even the weather service is hyping it because there's a course of\nPolitical agenda attached to the climate change and all that so I just wanted to share with you a set photo that was sent to me to show that it's a tense storm but it's not even by historical standards among the\nThe largest every member real intensity these

debate by Stephanopoulos states ought to have the right to ban contraception wide who's talking about doing that George I don't care do you think so\nAnd Romney stumbled around ... finally made the mistake of answering the question Romney's says Exxon contraception Republican war on women was really boring and ... it's absurd\nIt's amazing the things they get away with the idea that the
