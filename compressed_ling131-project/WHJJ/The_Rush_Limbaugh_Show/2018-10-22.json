talk cars and we're joined now by\nAntwon good when from seeing that road show here to talk about the twenty ninth teen Toyota Avalon Anton thanks for joining us today\nHey how's it going we're doing well so I took a look at the apple and just 'cause I always liked to you know look at the cars before we talk about him my first question is what happened to the front of this car because it kind of looks like a giant mouse driving down the road facing right out you what's what's your thought on the styling\nOr well the Evelyn front end is\nRidiculously aggressive this year I think that's the way it is making some large steps to kind of get away from the boring brand that sort of Beijing\nReputation that it had and it might have gone a tad bar on the Avalon if he if you look at it from this died from the rear maybe even from certain angle and kind of see what they're going for with the aggressiveness but no one that I Know really think that it worked out well for them\nSo let's get past kind of what the front end looks like a let's go first under the hood ... what what kind of engine do we have what what are we work with in terms of power there\nYou've got a couple of options are the main option for most people's gonna be a three hundred horse Howard V. fix engine that actually feels really good in this car\nIs going to be made it with a pretty smooth automatic transmission but if you are the kind of person who wants to where the good you'll economy and you don't really care about having three hundred horse power you could step down to about a two hundred horsepower\nA hybrid version and that's going to get you around forty three forty four miles per gallon so if you're concerned with like a mood comfortable ride go hybrid if you're looking for something more power or for passing the veep stakes is definitely a solid option\nWhat about when you when you get inside of this the Avalon is is you know Toyotas luxury cars that they make how close does it get to their brand elections in terms of overall quality and in the comfort that you can get from this\nWilliam period actually my favorite part of the Avalon um especially in the limited trim where they've got really nice leather really nice details like stitching and stuff like that or\nThe interior of the other line in my opinion a is about as good as what you're getting a Lexus yeah and so it kind of makes it a little bit of a toss up between whether you want to pay more for the Lakers ticket lightly better didn't finish\nA or if you're really happy with what uh what what are you able to be called a very luxurious interior and you have a lot has got most of the building with what what you can expect from Alexis or something comparable but for a little less money\nWhat stands out as far as bells and whistles there anything in particular that stands out as far as uh the technology that's available in this car\nWell the I Belong to make the um Toyota steak and then we standard though you're adaptive cruise control your lane keeping hearing is this your blinds monitoring all of that standard teachers for twenty ninth the model year so you don't have to pay extra\nTo get any of those things anymore where some of the competition you have to check on like a two thousand dollar a steak the package to get something like that so out of the box you've got pretty much everything that you could want as far as a driver aid and comfort technology for long highway cruises are slugging through traffic\nUm and the only thing that you really have to pay more for the ban would be nice or things like ... to be\nHere twenty what are we looking at in terms of cost on the novel on where do you start in how Hi can you end up\nPressure on thirty five for the based model which again still comes with all of that safety technology and is still a really nice looking car on the inside at the very least\nA top of the longer looking around forty three depending on whether you go to the stakes are high right there in about the same range they've done an interesting thing where they kind of sports there trends though that you can either go forty or you can go luxurious then at the end of the day you don't end up paying too much more you just have to decide what kind of car you want\nFor good ... we've got to run but thanks for joining us and we will catch up with you soon\nGrabbing\nThat is an twang Goodwin from seeing that road show talking about the twenty Nineteen Toyota\nAvalon pay forty grand for one of the ugliest cars on the road that is just simply log in am I wrong into and out of it does not look good grill I I looked at it and I'm like a big mouth coming at you it just an hideous hideous yeah\nCan I offer my two cents on why they did it sure to stand out it's cheaper to build grilled than to build the new the bumper normally I\nI Wonder if it improves like the weight of the car which helps gas mileage I\nBet it's stuff like that that actually poison as well because it does not look good I'll tell you that no it was like you said it looks like an open mouth ... the rest of it like the the rest of the car actually looks pretty nice but you see the front of it and you're like\nWhat's going on there is part of the ... did the bumper fall off like what's what happened to ...\nThat that's it's it's hideous I don't I don't think we're going to see a lot of these on the road you know and and you know the thing is people don't want to buy sedans and the first place no like sedan sales\nHave fallen a you know beat people want these SUVs see some any us yeah that either the full size ... size or you know if you have a family and you got a lot of kids you're buying one of those dance you're you're you that that's what people are doing\nYou know the Avalon historically if you look at how many vehicles they are still per year\nAh it doesn't look like it's done particularly well recently it's declined for about forty eight thousand and twenty sixteen or it's going to end up being around thirty two thousand this year than actually twenty fourteen it had been around sixty seven thousand you know not going to be many next year I'll tell you that they're they're struggling with the you know being able to ... to grow sales and\nAnd they don't work you know maybe they won't they maybe they just showed in the back half of the car you know that it's a little easier to sell it don't look at the front what if we have your deposits or you can just sell the backup ... we'll option holy smokes a Dallas down a hundred\nAnd

have been taken to the hospital with injuries after a partial building collapse in ... inside of vacant male building on ask an avenue reports are that one of the workers is critically injured\nIn the forefront of his supporters minds so I've been studying the media to try to get a handle on who actually might be behind this\nAnd here's what I found today CNN is spending almost eighty percent of their time on the show ...\n\nEighty percent may okay if ... even if it's just sixty percent of their time on your shoulder you better not\nFocusing on the care of him\nThat tells me that if the caravan weren't a Democrat idea designed to embarrass Trump that they would be covering it and building it up\nAnd with people down there interviewing these people creating sob stories it'd be there'd be man on the street interviews with a mean guy Trump is are they just want to come to America to and that may yet happen down the road but CNN is is not wall to wall but they are predominantly\nFocusing on the show Gabe and of course whatever CNN does just to try to damage Trump let's look at sea wife CNN is so ticked off because Trump's approval numbers are higher than they've ever been now\nAnd there are higher than Obama's war at this stage in the ah in his mid terms of the same point in his presidency after two years there just resigned themselves none of this\nIs happening the way it was supposed to happen now there's more and more stories about how the blue wave may not happen hip hip and it never was going to happen I don't I don't think anybody has ever known whether it's going to be a blue wave they've been relying on polling data but nobody knows for sure that was a media narrative\nIt was a meeting that was not born of any evidence there could be any evidence for a blue wave or a red wave election as an happened yet everybody\nWants to rely on polling data to suggest that it's going to happen but the polling data hasn't been accurate either starting in two thousand sixteen of the presidential race\n\nSo we've got this caravan trucking north and I think you put some things in perspective on this again the way to look at it is is as a a microcosm\nOf what's happening every day at our border every day this is what's happening\nNot seven thousand a day but but but every day this is what's been going on for decades and it needs to stop\nAnd Donald Trump is the only person that's ever talked about working to make it stop now the Democrats\nIf there are behind this one of the strategic ... besides getting somebody hurt\nAnd blaming it on Trump maybe what they're hoping is a Trump actually won't do anything about it maybe they're hoping that trouble\nTheir own country\nAnd if they don't apply for asylum in the first place that they can then they're not technically allowed to apply for asylum here but of course none of this matters the objective is to get to the United states and the objectives are multi faceted\nAnd it's what leads me to believe that the primary movers behind this are the left\nI think it's it's no doubt a leftist operation from beginning to end it may well be a Hail Mary type of October surprise as its eventual waiting but I think this was the left behind it\nFor a host of reasons every one of which we should uphold\nHundreds of miles or for\nAre seated susceptible to hurricanes and tropical

He's on with the bill hammer and Sandra Smith this morning bill cameras says\nMike Pompeo was in Mexico city over the weekend said we're concerned that these migrants may be victimized by human smugglers are others who what exploit them also deeply concerned with the violence provoked by some members of the group as well as the apparent political motivation of some organizers of the care of it by the way the [noise]\nThe details on that story are from the uh oh here's one from NBC and they are literally outraged over what ... saying sectarian state pumped pale raised the stakes last night as thousands of Central American migrants invaders\nHeaded for the United states as they marched into may go claiming they were inciting violence pump pay also they're inciting violence under the influence of politically motivated leaders\nHow was it raising the stakes\nTo point out what is happening what is the secretary of state Pompeo raised the stakes Sunday night how is it raising mistakes to point out what's happening\nWhen\nWe have a party a political party that believes in open borders a media and the party that believes in open borders they will never report anything negative about these invaders\nRight mind would want this\nWho in their right mind wouldn't want any of this illegal immigration who won their right mind would promote this wants this who won a mob an invasion of seven thousand now eight thousand people to storm the boarder who in the world would want that and why\nIt makes no commonsense under the umbrella of what's good for\nAmerica what\nEvery bit motivation for the people who want this to happen it's not for the good of America it's got to be for something\nElse so Pompeo goes down and promptly identifies what's happening here NBC says raising mistake what stakes\nWe have somebody finally pushing back on this because remember the Republican Party up until Trump never did push back on this they they came up with their own reasons for wanting\nAmnesty for illegals and form you know having a fall push on securing the border on Sunday night ... who met with the Mexican president went on the offensive alleging in a statement that many of the migrants were criminals themselves\nBy definition they are if they intend to cross the border illegally they're all criminals but at the world is so damn hard to understand about this\n\nI think it's a classic illustration of how soft this country is getting in one of the reasons this country is getting soft just because the elderly or senior generations are turning over everything to the young who haven't lived long enough to know what's\nBest are being driven solely by emotion govern solely by a motion not any ... any kind of common sense and because of some odd quirk that's happened\nIn our sociology adults today seem unwilling to teach young people right and wrong or to helping benefits from the wisdom that comes from having lived a bunch of life and having a mess the bunch of experiences\nThere is no way under the sun this makes any sense what so ever\n\nWe may as well not have any border if this is something that people want to advocate for permitting and allowing males will just to raise the border and say to the world come on it\nBecause that's in essence the impact of this if it's not stopped if it's not dealt with\nThe people of the world do not have an entitlement to the United states taxpayers back pocket but the Democratic party assumes or seems to think that they do\nThe Democratic party is calculating that there are more people who want to get in to the American taxpayers back pocket then there are American taxpayers\nAnd so the Democratic party is siding with the people around the world who have nothing who thinks it because the United states has a lot they should just be able to come in and get whatever they want\nAlmost as an entitlement we have a political party pushing this we have a political party promoting this this political party ought to be no where near winning any thing\nIn the next elections\nThere is not a single reason to vote for these people under any breakup commonsense\n\nTake a look at the things they advocate take a look at the people they try to destroy take a look at the things they are promoting it\nDefies common sense to support this\n\nAnd frankly I don't think they have as much support as the media narratives would indicate\nI don't for somebody to tell you right now I don't believe and I haven't been here for a long time that there hasn't been a slam dunk blue wave what we're being

Administration is attempting to eliminate the whole classification and I'm going to tell you why I agree with that but all of that coming up here's the final Louie Gohmert bite again bill hammer\nOutward concerned these migrants may be victimized by human smugglers are others who would exploit them were also concerned about this ... saying this we're concerned about violence provoked by some members of this group\nAll of these people trying to force their way and\nIt's called an invasion and thank God we have a president that will stand up to an invasion of like this but under our constitution that Governor thing call out military troops to stop an invasion and I've heard people on TV so called experts say where you can use of military because a positive comments out is look\nThat normally prevents military from being used against its own citizens\nIt has nothing to do with using the military just stopping invasion from another country so there was nothing unconstitutional illegal about the president knowing what went through a Wilson did put tens of thousands of people on the border and make sure nobody forces there way in hell\nIt's a no brainer folks get is a number of the president can do that and has committed to it you would dare you you you\nHe may not send the military and I may call as a as a Congress and the government says there but there's no law says he can't\nThis isn't about what is what is seven thousand Russians\nWere about to force their way into the okay what seven thousand Russians are about to force their way through the southern border to try to affect the mid term elections what if we can make that case what do you think that people will be demanding Trump do\nStand aside and let the seven thousand Russians in so they can hack our computers and make sure the Republicans win them in terms of it's a joke folks at the junk you never know who's listening I'm just asking you what if it's seven thousand Russian\nCommunists think always trying to get in\nAn invasion either way you look at here is Mike in Youngstown, Ohio getting a call in here in the first hour welcome sir how are you\nGood good Russian I Hope you and your family's all doing good Russian I I think this has all the makings of a bad set up\nFor Trump because of the optics are I don't care if you're a militarized border that if they bomb rushed the border like the ... down in the southern side of Mexico where they tried to stop them what's our military is supposed to break out the times or water hoses or\nTear gas that's just going to look so bad that Trump is going to take the brunt of it but he needs to do is call a\nA house and the Senate back into the emergency session and doing national address and\nEverybody on the line not just try to deal with this self\nSo bring him back in for a special session or do what passed legislation specifically saying that this mob is seven thousand can't come in\nSomething though that sort\nI mean you you think Trump needs to share the burden of providing the obstacles that if Trump since a military down and they started cracking the heads and it looks bad for Trump exactly and so you think that's what the actual intention here is the best people playing this thing\nExactly and that's where he can't try to deal with this on his own she leads to put everybody else's but I'm a little I get 'em on tape bond film or whatever what should we do what what do you like to do if they come across\nActually like that in a way I like making Schumer and Pelosi stand up for letting these people in\nAny way it's a good point it's a it's it's it's a it's a dangerous situation but it is in a whole lot of different ways will be back my friends that we will continue as we

everybody outside Texas thirty eight million dollars he\nRaised in a quarter except there's a problem and that is it Ted Cruz has been creeping ahead in the even the polling data and it's it's being acknowledged by the Democrats that that it is real\nAnd yet they have continued to maintain that Beto O'Rourke [laughter] gonna be the guy can take a Ted Cruz has anybody\nFound a hundred thousand people trying to get into a Beto O'Rourke event\nYou have\nA venue that whole Seventeen thousand people you have anywhere between Seventy five thousand in a hundred thousand people who want to get in\nThat is not the kind of thing that happens with a ... a political party that is losing losing favor losing support losing elections every where Trump goes these rallies you know I'm not opposed to this Rush Limbaugh dot com I have some friends\nAre out in the in the Phoenix area\nAnd that the Trump rally in Mesa, Arizona they thought about going through it until they got there and found out how impossible it would be they sent me a video that they took what their iPhone tennis max\nDriving along the entire line in order to make the video fit to be in a size they could email it to me they had to run it at twice normal speed\nAnd it's still thirty five seconds long it never ends and then there's a note\nThis is that this doesn't even show that people ... through the parking lots to get in there was a mile long line of people to get into the Trump in Mesa, Arizona the media is not reporting this aspect of the Trump rallies\nThe media is not telling you how many people want to get in are trying to get in how many people\nAre showing up in the standing in line because if they did\nLocal media may I don't know national media CNN PMS NBC ABC NBC CBS are not showing this because if they did it would put the lie to the notion of all the energy is on the Democratic side meanwhile there's not a single Democrat drawing anywhere near these kinds of Bradley's these ... these kinds of

asinine\nProtesters shows up and just started shouting things internal just sits there doesn't acknowledge him doesn't move doesn't say anything\nThe other patrons in a restaurant or just watching all this go by but this guy's making a spectacle and I watched him talk about this on Fox today and they were talking about such A M the weight loss of loyalty and so forth and\nThis isn't this isn't about civility this is about what I brought up three weeks ago this is not how decent people behave and I said decent\nPeople don't know how to deal with this kind of in decency which is what we're up against on the Democratic side I Do whatever you want to call it lack of civility in decency whatever it is it is not the things you associate with winning\nIt's not the kind of behavior you associate with good times good vibes positive outlook these are people in a rage and angry disappointed depressed what have you\n\nThe the contrast here is striking and that's why you do not see any news coverage of the size of let me tell you something\n\nThe ... the number of people the size of crowds to get into what Donald Trump rally\nIs ten times the size of this mob that is invading the country currently coming up through Mexico you've seen those pictures in the media is happy to show you those pictures\nThe media can't wait to show you this so called caravan of seven thousand people soon to be a thousand people and they claim might end up being ten thousand they'll show your pictures those people all day well here's what you need to do when you see that picture a seven thousand people or\nWhat is said to be seven thousand people multiply that times can that's the number of people trying to get into a Donald Trump rally in Mesa, Arizona and even more than that at a rally in Texas\n\nI Wish they use AT and T. stadium is Jerry Jones palace for the cowboys play put a hundred thousand people in there\n\nSo you think that Democrats can get together a mob of seven thousand people have in March ... through Mexico wow man look out for those people were really and we're supposed to sympathize with if they don't show you\n\nThe thousands upon thousands standing outside lining up twenty four hours in advance to get into a Donald Trump rally and I'm telling you that kind of thing does not happen to people losing elections were about to lose elections who are losing favor with the American people it does not happen\n\nHow many of you by the way how many of you wouldn't joined a crowd of of of of Seventy five thousand people at a Seventeen or Eighteen thousand seat venue\nOkay back to the phones we go to a voting in Macon\nGeorgia great to have you with us on an E R B network Hi thanks for having me on Russia appreciate it you know Ben Wilton it's great to have you here\nHe thinks the reason why I called it and I spent a lotta years military are retired from the brain and although we are very good at a lot of things we are not good\nAt basically civilian type a non lethal warfare we've gotten much better at it since Afghanistan and Iraq started but that is one saying throughout the years we not be good at so this situation and look I'm One hundred percent for putting the military before but this one's perils and we have to be careful\nWell when when you said the military is not prepared for an invasion you're talking about\n... this is not a military invasion and talking about a ... a human way of uh invasion of people that are largely are going to be thought of is starving thirsty poverty stricken this kind of things simply demanding\nLife or am I gotta let it play in the military is not used to standing up to people like that certainly not in Flint thing and the harm on them is that what you're saying\nI think the difference is you know when it comes to ... we're very good when it comes to less lethal we just not something we do that well we're individual what you're sort of very good at it but that wouldn't be enough\nTo okay what about this what about just the president's here's the U.S military standing at the border you will not cross\nOkay what happens then if they do and the end\nOf the problem that's the peril is part of the problem\nWhere am I you know you and your like your your ears bullet you use ah one of the dummy is called I forgot about the use use some kind of force but not lethal\nYou only have a quality of the things you but you know all it takes one person going down and squeal like a pig and then there's you know we we just have to hold up I don't see anything good coming out of this but the president's would be tremendous\n[noise] but the presidents would be okay so there's ... you\nThink the military showing up is let me just put words in your mouth and you tell me if I'm right or wrong in interpreting you you think the military showing up as a Lowe's Lewis proposition\nNo I think initially is a great idea but we have to be prepared for the next step\nWell but you say we can't take the next step because the next step is not what they're good that they're not used to it I don't know how to do it\nNow that still peril you've got all these I think we should but we have to be prepared politically and militarily well then what is it what's the proper it has to be read have to be prepared to use deadly force like\nOkay well let's let's let's let me give you a scenario then okay I'm just doing this in the interest of time on my bed may it may sound insensitive don't mean that they hold\nThe line I hold the line provide a visual presidents a visual obstruction they send the signal not welcome doing not cross there will be constant warnings but somebody dies and they have to shoot one or two then what happens\nThat we'd have to wonder I'll tell you I think you see a lot of people fall in line and probably what Bush or talking about members of the uh the immigrants illegal aliens but we'd have to be prepared to take that one or two it's terrible but that's what it\nTakes you don't think if one or two got hit that it was storm that caused the mob in rain storm the military just in and and and it it essentially stormed the bullet storm that guns do you think they would cease and desist\nI'll tell you they will cease and desist I'll tell you there's a lot of times you guys have a tendency to fold up when they are met with equal strength or we just have to\nBe an even if there is a casually or to the drive by have their story Trump ... Terry fires on harmless or an armed hopeless people\nAnd there's the peril yeah okay so the alternative is still a lot of men no no I have to hold\nThe line and and like I say somebody's you know what the Democrats are always saying hey somebody's got to eat one for the team or you're going to delay the lifestyle let's see it's unfortunate but this is what they this is what they've taken all by taking there's just\nOwn okay right so the responsibility for what happens to them has to be on them you think the media is going to allow that that this is um [noise] a left I I look I Can't start in other\n'cause I couldn't finish it got to take a break\nRush Limbaugh speaking radio\nYou're listening to the worst radio nine twenty\nI'm pretty handy around the house but now that I had kids I don't want to spend my Saturday installing a toilet or fixing an air conditioner but thankfully there is ...\n... or helped me find them back home ... in my area the handle any kind of project you can read reviews of the ... ability to even look appointments on line and what my wife love most is at home in lines are completely free to you\nAt ... dot com or download the ... to get started\nIt's people we believe investment advice is about more than helping you manage or well our investment advice about it's about providing your kids with opportunities for head start in life feeling secure and your retirement and realizing your dreams just may become a reality because you have a point\nWe believe in\nThe bathroom investment advice starts with your people financial advisor find your new steeple financial advisor rich people dot com that's S C I F E L people make wasn't company incorporated member S. P. C. N. N. Y. I. C.\nU. do sing\nBarney way along and just to rewrite the wedding of\n\n\n[noise]\nI don't\nWant you to think of bugs that if this last caller scenario happened was [noise] and one of these [noise] one of these mob\nMembers particularly a child would get harmed by any American military clan officer you think there's going to be held to pay and so forth we need to\nAnd just to remind you Tom parameters on CNN Today the chairman of DNC no no no no we we always knew this election was going to be close [noise] we always you if you\nKnow the right places to look the drive by and the Democrats are really walking this back\nNow I Know a lot of your St rush don't get sucked into this they're just doing a rope a dope they're trying to make you think that they've lost count but they haven't this is just I don't believe this folks these people are not rational right now\nThey haven't been rational for a long time in their irrationality really was jammed up\nAfter Trump won but there's a companion story to all of the people showing up for Trump and that is not up for the people showing up for by the Democrats are sending Joe Biden out to try to draw crowds for various Democrat candidate\nAnd it isn't working now by showed up to do a rallying for the Democratic candidate for governor of Florida Andrew Gillum who as an aside and he'd debated Ron descent as last night on CNN [noise]\nAh this this this guy Gillum for those of you who live in Florida I I Know he seems attractive to some of you in an Obama like way a would be the first African American governor\nAh is is supposedly just filled with love and compassion that guy is a full fledged\nLeftist Marxist that really makes the bones of an evil just talking about Florida as a collective that's communist ... she was talking about Florida as law or a collective\nHe he he would be a disaster\nFor Florida right now to well liked anybody like this guy because of what he will do\nIn racking a growing economy do you know the Florida and Texas economies are growing like gang busters and you and it's not just because of of senior citizens moving here from other areas of the country it's about tax policy\nFlorida and Texas have no state income tax as such people are moving here in droves editor businesses in Florida are growing left and right and this guy wants to shut it down\nThis is this guy is a ... is Andrew Gillum is a classic classic modern day Democrat leftist who doesn't want there to be in the private sector success\nBecause the private sector is corrupt it's unfair it's it's illegitimate I and and it it's it's not everybody's treated equally as important this guy wants government in charge of virtually everything\nFor his express purpose of determining outcomes based on what he thinks his father tea and fairness\nHe doesn't know about running businesses it's like every other Democrat in the world that's never run one has want an open criticism for them\nAnd the people around them and the people who found them and the people who start them has a deep resentment he's part of the Elizabeth Warren Obama crowd you didn't build that you didn't look that up a\nWould just be just bad news horrible knows a thing that worst time\n\nFor anybody like this guy to be elected governor or in in Florida Rick Scott the outgoing governor gosh I Hope this guy beats Bill Nelson he's running for the Senate down here and he is Rick Scott is one of these guys self made\nAnd as as a has gotten become very successful and as governor he tackled a whole bunch of emergencies and disasters in just came through with flying colors and and and Nelson has become a just a static flat line\nJust a ... a walking echo chamber for whatever left us leadership in the Senate wants done whether it's a benefit the Florida or not but the Santa\nWould be great defense as as a as a regular night conservative Republican who happens to have a good relationship with a with\nTrump a but Andrew Gillum ... this is the exact wrong decision to make there's nothing\nHere and it's not just Andrew Gillum this is no time to be electing people\nWho want to put the brakes on what is happening in this country right now we've got more job openings than there are people to fill them we have people getting raises getting bonuses businesses are growing left and right the economy is rising we've got trade practices coming back into balance now\nWe've got people feeling more optimistic about America at least ... surveys then they have expressed in quite a while\nThe trend is constantly upward people have have are exceptionally positive thoughts about the future and electing me\nExtreme leftist Democrat as governor or senator or even as as president in two years would be an absolute disaster\n\nIt wouldn't constitute rolling back every achievement that has been made in the past ... if you want to go back to flat line economics of decline where\nThe president tells you this is as good as it gets and you've got to eat better get used to it because America's greatness in the past really wasn't deserved\nWay way stole a lot of what we had we mistreated people all over the world if you want to invest in the idea that the United states is the problem in the world and not the solution then you'll elect these Democrats I Can't\nI Can't imagine people\nWho are engaged and thinking about this and living lives actively involved when ... in any way want to put the brakes on this\nAnd for what reason because they don't like Trump tweeting because they don't like Trump's manners because they think Trump is goldfish or whatever some of the silliest stupidest reasons that's not why Trump is supported\nTrump is supported because he's in the last line to hold off on this attempt\nAt transforming America into being something that it was never found it to be if you want if you want America to actually be determined by shaped by\nLike this this mob seven thousand people demanding entry into the United states and demanding benefits from the United states because they are deserved because America is responsible for what's going on in their home countries if that's what you want America to be then you got to vote Democrat\nBecause that's what the Democrat Party of today wants to happen successful America needs to be punished whatever else is going on it's still boils down to an age is old argument over philosophy and it's this\nAre you better at running your life or is the government better at running your life\nThe Democrat Party believes your not capable of running your life and they don't want you to learn that you can\nThey don't want you to learn that you can be self reliant and achieve great things they don't want you to realize that you can be happy and content on your own the Democrat Party wants people to believe all of that is only possible\nIf government makes have happened or less have happened but more and more what leftist actually want government to do is punish\nThe Democratic party has become a party of groups of victims\nAnd these victims have turned over to their own futures to the Democrat Party they have decided that life is too unfair and to me in and they can't overcome any adversity without the Democrats running interference without the government running interference and so more and more what they want\nBy voting for Democrats they want Democrats to punish\nThe successful or anybody that these people believe is responsible for their unhappiness the Democratic party has become a party of means\nSpirited extremism\nThe Democratic party has become the home of people sadly what psychological disorders who are demanding that the political system of the country address those disorders and normalize them\nAnd that's not the purpose of the United states government and it can't succeed any way I mean this is just hands down in this Andrew Gillum personify is personify the exact\nTotal wrong direction to take at any time but especially now the only go to these photos put but one of these up\nOn the digital camera if you're watching this is Joe Biden at a rally for Andrew Gillum the
