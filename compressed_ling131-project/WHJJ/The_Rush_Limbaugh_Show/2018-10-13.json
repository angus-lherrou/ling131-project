over ... gonna have to ah Rhode Island's going to get an opportunity to get the ball back\nAnd Maine gets their off installed once again and that's a poor pads to poor pat yeah wonder right and the second poor pass was to blame for that time in motion because he was a ready to catch that ball at the marker and continue this drive and he left the down low\n[noise] and um and and they had something there because we're running was in men and there was a nice pick play and and you're right wide open in the flat right the ball behind him if he catches up to out in front of them might still be running for pass in Rhode Island out converts over three a studio for for for me now uncertain\nDown situation burgers and get hurt early in the year and then he ah Robinson was the quarterback Ferguson back for the first time here today fair catch call for by Dorsey at the twenty nine lawyers who've ever in my you know that's usually usually does it when when you think\nYou got about five or ... like that one was okay they don't take that one but it usually that that right arm is put into his side he doesn't want a fair catch that thing at all he wants to try to make

few paces behind everybody but he's becoming more and more part of it in a you know to be the fourth guy on this uh this grouping is a pretty select position because the three guys in front of you are all really playing it all conference levels\nBall came and hit the ground you did a nice of extending himself out there to get that one through that ball and a double coverage but just a it was accelerated and and and got himself some separation there almost made a great place I could have done\nAll right forty two yard line after the incomplete pass to watch to either side back to pass the ... in the flap the Sanders in and out of his hands at the catch you gotta make he's got [noise]\nIn front of them that's open get closer to that first hand mark Hurd but uh that's a drop all that you can't pin on ...\nNo not at all and as you write that he probably turns that thing up and just probably six or seven more yard so it's a big drop it really no third down in a tent made his old for today on third down conversions this is a long one third and sent\nTrips to the right side now nobody on the receiving side off to the less I think at the tight end on the left side of the line and Belcher [noise]\nBut other than that it's a young [noise] Edwards and right [noise] inside out on the right\nSide of the quarterback Ferguson's back to pass rolls out of that size genetic chasing them

plus to the right side pushed out of the pocket knives Jones came off the left off of your friends have left side and push Ferguson to the right\nScrambled genetic almost had to make us a chance to make a play burgers and stuck it right down the field I write about fourteen years down the field\nYeah Jeanette he had a clear path just couldn't catch up to Ferguson first intense on forty four in motion now is Blair left or right hand off goes to Sanders Sanders gets into the light of breaks it\nTo the twenty five yards thirty five yard line up to the thirty cross the thirty bumped out of

the play they're not going to give them a chance to review this they're getting up right now off sides I\nMean just sites they just Johnson is going to take a direct snap\nNo flags are down hands it off turn a dive to the end zone is Fitzgerald he gets through for the touchdown main picks up six\nBoost to within three point after a temp coming up sixteen Thirteen\nMain what no huddle one right to the line is Terri said the judge didn't want to get any chance to review that catch at the one yard line that was essentially a jump ball\nAnd young came down with it and then one player later they got into the end zone and\nAs a a hill talking [noise]\nI don't really officials saying probably exactly what you're saying yeah I don't understand how it's not all sides I made the guys jumped to cross the line of scrimmage and then they\nThey they pulled him back let them run the football [noise]\nThat was a weird sequence right there I I thought that they\n[noise]\nUh he clearly got in the ... right I don't know why what they're going to review on this one but just a whole sequence of the them throw the football down the field in a young making that play I thought like I said I thought homes had a ... I thought homes had to pick right there for Rhode Island\nBut then they gave the ball to young they didn't even review it they went right to the line and looked like made jumped off sides reset themselves and then ran a football into the end zone so sixteen Thirteen right now [noise]\nThey're reviewing the touchdown I guess to see ... and then I looked like he he looked like he was way in running for sure I don't know what they're looking at this far as that goes has to\nBe something else yeah they're going to come back and say we must have probably a couple of places to go [laughter] start well back just make believe that\n[noise] yeah no kidding [noise]\nWe didn't read of you for that I was working for you because 'cause he was it was much there wasn't much there you are I Am a battling it out here at ... stadium Ninety seven\nMeeting between the two main sport in the last eleven believe it or not that's crazy right out of that is one twenty seven last year and I came was what to think it was twenty three to ... twenty three and a half or something or to\nBless you All right one was free nothing yeah two thousand six months yeah you're right I point after attempt coming up here\nThat's going to bring a\nKenny ... fifty two yard it'd be Villanova last weekend at the time expired he puts his went through as well sixteen fourteen now two point lead for down to do\nThat was a nice win against Fillon over Thirteen to ten toes at a Alfonso stadium so was at Maine but ah he's\nA ... special teams player of the week and why not [noise] fifty to your previous long was like thirty eight so that so [noise] put a little extra charge Jeanette\nBeat Villanova those two top twenty five teams at the time\nVillanova take a step back may take a step up and now it's you know the picture in the league is starting to make itself a little more clear Terry you've got a [noise] as far as the coaches polls go Jim you upset by utilize gesture you on that note here and I'm going to\nHave you on some six in the country right now Jim you never a grid islands uh Fifteen third of the sea Eighteen\nThousand is Eighteen and the top twenty five stony Brooks twenty would go there next weekend [noise]\nIt means that twenty two in this cold twenty and the other four so you have to go you have to go to ... you have to go to ... you have to go six eight and twenty here on the road yeah that's not a ... and with the CIA this year you look to post season play see a strong but\nJust to a a tick off of their usual strength\nSo how many teams they get so where does Rhode Island fit into you'll be tough it is one of the fact that door she takes it at the goal lives gonna bring it out on the\nKick return to the Fifteen your line to the twenty door she's still on his feet running horizontally gets to the ... one more guy you're getting close but uh he finally ran into somebody could not get around and that was price Coley\nYou know you go you talked to a\n... you look at this leak Steve and and with the reputation as it has and has had in the past if you get to eat wins\nI think you can thinking you can get yourself a spot yeah you know ... to get to eat when they're gonna have to win all their home they exist in there and it's still one of those ones on the road\n... seven to do one year and then or\nIs that a one I I think it was right there yeah that was the year that we played Maine here we're both top twenty five teams but uh in the last three or four last foreign didn't get him so\nIt all depends I guess on how you get there [noise] here's a second the backfield great penetration by main that time to get through the first guy to them as the Sean Stevens he is a tough customer I mean next to Sheffield Stevens is their best offender or see a defensive player of the week last week with\nEight tackles two ... two and a half tackles for a lawsuit against Villanova picks up a shack on the first place from scrimmage Rhode Island Lhasa for second down at fourteen now from the Nineteen\nYard line yeah now you know the momentum has clearly jumped on that main sideline over there and um for forty to go in the first quarter excuse me first have rose up sixteen fourteen they've got a they've got a string of Dr together here Steve\nFrom the shot down ... back to pass quick slant\nIn and out of the hands of the intend to receiver in his incomplete it's going to bring up third down and fourteen\nForward island as they get off the pilot was Coulter on that land play for doll and that that could not hold any at three guys on him\nA lot of contact right around the\nFive yards out there so ah so he was a it was pretty well clamped down on that one third down to fourteenth from the Nineteen yeah when you look at it you know you say okay I'm going to get it from the CIA three four you know in All right and so then it get in line you get in line behind jammed ...

in high school football how ... how are you are an air on your ass while you have a basketball game or\nIraq as well fly on a on a sort of rice so good so I Want to talk about this 'cause this the first year so far [noise]\nA ... or a credible ... uh he goes down veto comes\nTalk about as a receiver and take so many reps which you off but I get a few was beat up a you know obviously the large majorities withdrawn\nNow veto priorities in there for however long before John ... a big difference and catching a ball and one guy versus the other ...\nIt's not it's not a difference at all like goes or say veto been preparing to start every week isn't [noise] either the backup ought to start because like you said it's a next man up thing and we had to deal with this a verse it is so that's what we're going to take all of them got to make the playoffs are so I Would go about how about\nYou as a uh like this the the philosophy the ball coming to you the touch or is there any difference between the two to one better or worse or just different\nUh I Can't really tell you I'm just I mean these are catching a ball and both of them just because we wrap it up so much and practice so a\nKnock can't really tell the difference\nNow you know most teams will have [noise] that'll eat receiver they'll have an air and park where they'll have an idea called ... have\nOf a bull ... who are kind of your debt and you know and his guy because\nWe've got all of a right to defend Rhode Island a task defense has to be so tough because they really can't tell you right right yeah that's a good thing about it\nGet it done in different phases good again and I would probably go out there and we all want to see each other do good\nSo uh to an old ...

times third along the jump shot Dickerson [noise]\nRight there to make that tackle and ah [noise] they'll be Mack put pressure on the quarterback it was a screen so they let them come [noise] unabated but I think he made him throw that football a little bit earlier than you want it to him a shot diction right there to make that point in a bacterial third downturn [noise] means converted the last two times they've had a third\nDown along situation and we were just down now\nStaying do the right side as he comes back to the right one off to the left [noise] look on the sidelines ... got nine seconds on the clock [noise] twelve Eighteen to go third quarter Rhode Island had twenty three fourteen Ferguson back from the shotgun rolls out on third intent looking like what do you see that will be back as a lose lose them\nHe dumped it on Iceland only doing their loss of two as Dickerson symptom end\nOver end after the catch is made and uh Rhode Island is going to get this football back in the defense coming up big there is a flag down and think it's a whole new twenty yard line got to be against ya again goldie I mean they'll just clean it all along for ...\nIn the backfield to find anybody that every second that goes by makes the likelihood for holding penalty increase exponentially [noise]\nAnd ... did a nice job of making that judge but then he got drilled right on that side need area by ... and make a nice open field Taco Bell too was limping as he went off to the sideline they're nice job by this Rhode Island defense first uh\nIn the first series they turn to the ball over Rhode Island does a great job of putting it in the end zone and now they come out after Rhode Island scores and they called three in a nice job by this Rhode Island ...\nYou know right punting team is out from Maine and that means David Gale is going to let it go and again they kick a short of ... my door\nShe gets it though like five fifty forty five forty a main side to thirty down to the thirty yard line nice job brought down from behind by all means\nChecking out attempts on the twenty five yard line to watch the right side they handed off to Ferguson or check that Trump is Gerald ... down to the Twenty one year ... about half of what they need four or five yards on that makes it a manageable third down that can be third and probably five market at the ... got to get to the Fifteen\n... thank goodness he doesn't have a good set of eyes because if you just kind of slipped through the ... there was a broke that thing instead of instead of clear but he had his head very just rented right up until the line of scrimmage right they're\nYoung stretches out to the right side for some moving up to the line looking sideline looks like he's calling us from the line third down and six [noise] for me trying to keep this Dr going to put points on the board he's back to pass\nGood protection there was a bit of\nSays no they said it drop a bad liquid daily rats\nAnd complete Paso brings up\nA fourth in six for main\nRoads are around almost had that ball their hands\nI was going to a brownie de under cut the receiver and a looked like I think he was trying to run Steve before he caught the football cleanly\nAnd the and the ball kind of popped on his shoulder pad and then he lost his balance and as he hit the ground the ball came out [noise] so they're going to force me now I'm surprised they're not trying to take three here Steve to try to get some points on the board of forty on often say six is a tough\nTough get before the one I might be on their side four to six I don't know how to fix some twenty now they're going to call a timeout I think in talk this over\nThat or I mean I'm ... you know what are they saw on the\nTime out or if the Rhode Island [noise]\nOkay [noise] what's that Rhode Island's challenging to see if it was an incomplete pass out I thought it was an incomplete pass I thought that he didn't control it as ... and and when the ball hit the ground or when he hit the ground the ball kind of popped out\nNow it's also gives me some time to\nThink things over I wouldn't be surprised that they came out with a field goal team yeah what is it going to be able to write a third quarter yeah all afternoon to get\nComing to school going right now so I mean it's a you know theoretically yeah look through school game at this point without asking a lot of who's successful to point conversion [noise] go get your three you get back to normal to score and then go from there I said I agree with you know\nYou take the points when you get a chance to take some points and forth and six as you said it's a tough jet\nI agree with you [laughter] but\nMaybe we'll go with a Joanne Harris ... in his third year in Maine is Thirteen and Thirteen coming into this game and a\nPretty good job of the black beers\nHasn't been a playoff contention this year\nGym Fleming into this season for the University of Rhode Island has turned the corner Sheena Terry [noise] year and year out each recording classic\nComes through the same as getting better the either now you're seeing is All right ... and you know the the the thing that [noise] and the\nThing that they've they've done a good job with this year Steve was taken [noise]\nSometimes you get a little [noise]\nThe junior college kids sometimes are hit or miss yeah right and they are not as well and transfer as well they've done a good job of hitting on those especially this year with the guys that are playing you know defensively it often simply [noise] um [noise] for this team and and you write to transfer has done a\nGood job for him also so it's all hitting form they got to continue to keep doing that\nWaiting for the word on this wouldn't take it a long time jumped political they started out down here to our right above the ... and then they had to drive there to\nRun all the way down to the other twenty year old line to to get on the headphones sort of comes there's enough gyms is kinda weird as long as I think it was a ... but it was going to take those logs\nLooked at each other [laughter] [noise]\n[laughter] [noise]\nHe just to the end of them are ridiculous [laughter] I tell you what\nYou know what a he's a very good coach and he is one heck of a guy is a funny guy to hang out with Jim\nPlumbing these good few one he's won role do it\nI'm happy zero man he was going to continue to go for it here on foot down to six which was a surprise\nYeah yep but anyway see what happens here from the Twenty one yard line your eye territory\n[noise] you know in essence\nIs a little bit of the ball game here ...\nCats needed in the yard or two and didn't get it I don't think he's short I think he's short gonna be close so it's going to be close they might they might not until the stepped up to Fifteen yard line and then was pop back from there were they mark forward progress will tell the story\nOh they're not even going to measure first found me home man they give it to him [noise] okay I thought it might have been a little bit short I would look and see Jim same way as I Am you got to measure that former you got to make sure on that you got to give our guys a chance to to to make a playwright deal which they did you measure that thing and maybe they don't get it [noise]\nIt was very very close worth of measurements ... percent chance on the fifteenth so main stays alive here [noise]\nOh man under center to take the snap this time has Ferguson Fitzgerald deep back for him to walk to the right side doubled tied in\nFerguson on the run to Edwards Edwards on the end around it gets to the tent yard line tries to follow a block or in some there can't get any more on the ... shark Dickerson brings him down with the help of a few others as a hill than that uh\nThat grouping as well for it out but he picks up five gets down to the Taliban that big a big yard is two thirds of what they need to get to the patron here so second down and five from the ten\n... Edwards has a nice job of running a football to the outside there\nAs a judge sweet that everybody runs in Maine does a good job of blocking it picks up five yards and\nPuts them in a second and five to ten year old\nWho wanted to the right side one off to the left quarterback Ferguson takes it from the shotgun fix the hand off last set up top [noise] it is incomplete intended for Blair well covered down the sideline that time and ah [noise]\nCouldn't get his hands on it [noise]\nIn the end zone so Rhode Island or [noise] or virtually scare their\nThird down and five on the hand once again on the coverage for an island that time was once again rank Campbell mention the name of job today\nFilling in for DJ Stewart is out with an insurance steward spend one of the main stays [noise] four dollars to a third of the team and tackles a twenty eight so it's a big mess and not have him around but a gamble on a nice ... he's one of those junior college guys are they hit on tap have hit on a few of them and this one bird Dorsey being another from the shotgun\nFerguson rolling out to the food is wide elections I look at in zone has this man it is complete for the touch down in the end zone Devon young and Maine gets six back on Rhode Island [noise]\nNow let's see if they go for two I imagine they would at this point should there was a little miscommunication back there's a couple of defensive backs looking at each other with their arms outstretched going you know what happened the because he was wide open as somebody missed an assignment down there to leave him that wide open their five\nTwenty three to go and the third quarter play Rhode Island still a by ten here means going to try to get a to a one possession game with a to point conversion\nQuarterback\nFerguson with Fitzgerald on his right shoulder about to take the snap trips bunch to the right side close to a lot\nThey flip it up and the other side of the field and they get there two points from Michael Wright makes the catch in the end zone so they pick up eight get half of what they need to tie this game thirty to twenty two and the game was starting ... right now actually I'm going back\nToward made a little bit so ... will have to save them off here in uh [noise]\nThe latter stages\nOf this one will stay right with you\nDuring the break here junior ... says the official kids' clubs of Rhode Island athletics records as open to all kids in the eighth grade and below group features exclusive benefits including free admission\nTo Rhode Island athletic events invitations to special events and more joined the junior Rutgers today [noise] for just twenty dollars at ... dot com slash junior records so are so many cuts and a half and takes up momentum back from Rhode Island\nYeah and you know the it was thirty to forty and Rhode Island as I said before it's what they put it on Neal and the cough yet when they scored the thirtieth point but then they kind of ... main off the hook there are a little bit let 'em\nGo right down the field and scored so now you know\nClassic bought boxing match Roman gets the ball back they've got to be able to do something and what are we got five minutes ago and this five twenty three to go in the third quarter so\nIt's not like me to stop Rhode Island and and run for the most part of stopped me in a couple of long drives that they've given up for touchdowns so\nDorsey unnamed Jones out there to return for Rhode Island to kick this one off as kind of do the hero of last week's game with a fifty to your Google they go to the door she takes it at the ... the fifteenth of the twenties stays on the right side of the field up to the thirty yard line and goes down to the thirty one\nYard line a couple of guys and on the tackle for me but the first one that got to them was er when Eliot\nSo a good return up to thirty one yard line it's it's not fair it's not fair to Amir Dorsey but every time he touches the football factory right so you know you get it at the five you bring it to thirty one that's not bad you know but the it's a little does have one [laughter]\nHe is\nFun to watch [noise]\nI mean [noise] fun to\nWatch veto pre already out there once on a first intensive thirty one yard line for an island a hand up goes to show Bryant Bryant gets a push down at the line of thirty for your line picked up a couple of a yard and that's about it on that one for\nFor you are right five minutes to go to Alan would love to burn that could walk but still it's a little early to getting the clock burning territory is still in the third quarter play and uh\nAnd take it the other way and Kenny was able to would that second attempt to bring it down kind of change the direction of the ball gets away from Madison otherwise he might have had a floating ball and six points on the other end but a\nLot of success would that play to the moon and if you just get that thing down he probably would have picked up five or six yards\nKennedy is a pretty agile guy for a big I mean he you know he [noise]\nHe's got he's he's a little bit more of a past catching tighten that I thought he was that's for sure from the shotgun ouch ... low snap a bill handle it throws a timing off a little bit he's going to throw this one nice to\nAs a forty one yard line I looked like he was going to throw it away initially which wouldn't have had a bad idea to guys bearing down on a member came out of this girl at the forty one and he just putting right on him\nHe did that was the only guy that had a chance to catch up on been broke with running a corner route and as you say broke that pat broke his pattern off when you saw that ball coming back and [noise] and I used to play nice adjustment there by a by Tyler Burke\nOne Seventeen to go third quarter replay Dorsey person tents on the forty one yard line Dorsey is the wildcat within averted wish bone around him some heavy guys protecting him door she's going\nTo run into he runs into trouble and he's going to reverse\nGo to the right side in a way [noise] avoiding contact and finally down behind a lot of scrimmage or do you want to go up late hit on Rhode Island [noise] flagged down doors she went to the left side and\nGot snuffed out immediately was Patterson that was right there couldn't bring them down but made them change direction and go back to the right\nYet looked like Maine now when I'm especially when he's on the short side that left test when a pre already goes out to line up is that why don't they take 'em that that a corner and it just puts them because they hold it it does nothing gonna happen with brewery out there and he just pushed off that corner and and disrupted that whole play and and then at the end of that thing [noise]\nI I was [noise]\nWas racing jobs [noise]\nSo now you get the loss of yard plus a Fifteen your penalty so you're really puts this thing way back stop toward a looked\nLike it was going to be a pretty good Dr ... and you know there by eight right now you put any points on the board you get feel go range of ... through the approach makes it a full or makes it a two possession game right now Maine has a chance with a touchdown and a to point conversion to tie it up so taken\nOut of that rhythm is a crushing blow for it outcomes all the way back to the thirty eight yard why now and that's where it will sit second down in thirty one you\nGot any place to check it out of somebody wants to [laughter]\nScreening I'd get screened again turn to the left side one of the right one remaining back low snap again we're already picking it up throwing it away is behind the intend to receive a Bouvier buffet well covered by Kate Lee ... who was\nThrown out of the game oh no no no no the guy who was throwing would occur K. and where they are yeah um so um so yeah yeah nine nine us yeah one of those single supper [laughter]\nKeep going for got got over it was nine right oh you are calling bingo over there or something\nThe south ... el ... [laughter]\nHow old are your cards that they got up and go but hey all\nThe guards you know a third down in thirty one after the incomplete pass Burke is a\nComing up to the age back position on the left side of the law to hand off to Brian and play it safe he's going to get to the forty five yard line Brian flip them end over end up to a mid sealed came down pretty hard but I'll start back up so it's about mid field as well shy of the first day on a by about ... Seventeen Eighteen yards themselves or down all the sort of way and hopefully\n... main inside the twenty maybe inside the ten from this fifty\nYard line punt Garrett was going to set up at about a thirty five to kick it away so given his foot you probably looking at the twenty twenty five yard line a show that's pretty much where the guys are setting up for the return that would be right\nPrimarily he's on the and the Edwards is out there with them so the clock clock goes to zero for the third quarter replace oh thirty twenty to Rhode Island up by eight ready to punt this went away on the first possession of the fourth quarter to the University of Maine will take a break we'll be right back you arrive football's only or feel\nPeter injustice Sherman know first hand the

education local fifty one continues to strive towards the schools are providing the highest quality and most skilled craftsman\nIn the industry so a third quarter statutory as we take a look at 'em here for Rhode Island they've got two hundred Ninety five yards a total often hundred Ninety seven passing Ninety eight rushing\nFor main two hundred and sixteen totally yards one hundred and Fifteen in the year and now they just to close to one hundred Mark Warner one on the ground and Gary's and they'll get an opportunity to have the football their hands once again is ... to kick off\nThe only got sixty yards in that half the Rhode Island but they got excuse me and a quarter but they got a fourteen points so you know that that yours is not a huge indicator but they've got to be able to stem the tide a little bit here thirty to twenty two\nYear already had a couple of short feels to start off after a turnovers by may catch Gulfport the twenty so it may not have a first in ten from their Edwards halls it in and a good job I guarantee\nTo get that one up in the air and get it down a little bit to the ... it's a pretty good punted ... good\nFor him and it does a good job with that you know hanging up there what's those guys get under making that forcing that we're catching now road he's going to come up big defensively [noise] you know\nThey came up with a huge play last time we there'll be Mack knocking at that a third down [noise]\nPlay but ah [noise] in that third quarter looked like they struggle a little bit with their tackling so now we've got to come up here you get them\nKeep them pinned down here and get this momentum back on your side when\nI write first intend for the main black bears from their own twenty yard line Twenty one to be exact\nFerguson look sideline incomplete well short of the intend to receiver looked like there are a mix it up on the case all their Edwards was going deep and burgers some thought he was coming back\nYeah it looks like you're trying to throw that back throw back shoulder stop it about Eighteen years down the field you could have a pretty wide shoulder to get that one no kidding [laughter] about uh twelve yard shoulder [laughter]\nYeah he thought it was going back to them in a Edwards is going which was going down right yeah check it out of ten Twenty one now Ferguson\nLooking here no reason for Maine to panic and ... minutes a football so not the toss it on every now and I got to tell us that he or slant pattern over the middle and it's like it's a car bomb at the\nThirty or ten or twenty nine yard line which can be a couple of yard shy of the first down I got a call to catch their nice job going down and get that football I think it was a it was Blair Blair to get it yeah and I do the job of\nGetting shielding and she looked like it was Ryan Campbell again the number one now in the game I'm defending that slant route thirty two now\nOn the twenty nine yard line because they play [noise] from the shotgun around showing blitz off over in there and it looks like he may have\nWhat do you need for it got to be awfully close needed to get the thirty one ... and over and over the top of the defense no way did he get that\nThey're going to borrow the way they market it looked like it was they marketed the guy at the headlines the colonel's over thirty I [noise]\nI got to side with me to go get a measurement here but uh\nCertainly the way it sitting right now the tip of the football is going to be ah\nAcross the the lines\nGet my guide Kenny boy do does our feels over in ... he gotta stretch that Jane okay\nLike getting a little some extra for you [laughter] oh yeah it's going to be a first down a credit card credit card oh first and Main they continue\nTo hang out of the football you're fourteen teeth to go [laughter] yeah I can eat ... eggs matter what you gotta you gotta know one at a link that on that is [laughter] you're off the shoveling list later on the air sorry about that or go to\nMy guy he does our feels over the ... aren't as good work job\nGot a big one later on today right yeah it's person ten uh for me the thirty one yard line [noise]\nGetting wide to the left side now is young in the slot to that side as Edwards Ferguson from the shotgun\nHanded off right side that's Edwards right side running it to the [noise] ... yard line last the yard or two on that and\nYeah twenty nine so it'll be a loss it to be second down to the eleventh hour twelve [noise]\nBubble up and up to get it and makes it thirty twenty eight Terry now it gets to point conversion coming up you still up as football you're going to make one play right here to keep this leaders what nine minutes and change go eight and a half minutes ago and this football game so\nBig play right here Ferguson direct snap [noise]\nFix the pitch rolls out to the right throws up the jump fall into the end\nZone it is incomplete intended for the tight and air soared islands still as a two point lead thirty to twenty eight with eight thirty ... to go pretty well designed play I just left it a little bit out in front of Belcher that family couldn't go get it [laughter] he was hoping\nIt was open they just in it and they just kind of half role that things are the right side of bell Jews the right to tell you then snuck across the formation all the way into the back corner the end zone but luckily for the Rhode Island\nRams frozen food I think too far and it's just out of bounds and office fingertips so are you still one of his football game thirty to twenty eight now if you think your any good you got to put a drive together and you haven't been able to do that really and the second half your too short feels for touchdowns\nYou got to be able to put a drive together here in an enclosed this thing out whether you score\nOr not I think we have to say as a uh the Rhode Island team as they are going to get one more possession if I can take ... minutes off here\nAnd then they get one possession whether a score or not and then I can run that clock down on the other side and give them one chance and and then if you score on either of those ... a series and that's fine but but they have got to stop him in the fall back on three and out\nThe oh yeah you're right you know and that you know the ... that extra points coming back to haunt them ... you know three points now\nBeach in this football game absolutely here's the kick\nBy mange place kicker Kenny built the heroes last winter comes out of the Seventeen yard line or Seventy or live up to the twenty five a mere Dorsey of for the thirty year old out of the thirty five yard line a good return once again\nBy Dorsey is you can pretty much pencil in each time a Danelle or Rica's ends up bringing 'em down at the top of the rodeo ramps to go to work on the fence aside put a lot on the shoulders of veto Pretoria realize that he's a young player who's\nBrushed into a big position last week\nWas astronomical numbers but it was also a pretty easy situation to be in relative\nTo the situation in the sense that there wasn't much of a game after they got rolling and brown steep and she was a little soft but uh now he's being challenged by\nArguably the best defense of the CIA their number one ranked that's for sure they have shown it from time to time or else get twenty or thirty points on the board that's that's pretty significant play actual that if you're a lucky man it is complete the culture good for the first doubted picks up about Fifteen rings across midfield to the forty seven yard line nicely done\nExactly and that's nice that's a that's a nice thrown a nice catching a nice route you get that press men covered so if you press them down the field and you put the brakes on and they just throw that back shoulder throw about Fifteen Years down the field shortsighted thrown nice easy throw forum [noise]\nGot to do that going to continue to do it\nCulture wise to the left side park or in the slap to the left\nAnd Kenny on the left side as the H. back Burke tight end right side here's and off to Bryan Bryan get stuffed up the line gets forwarded across the forty five to the forty four yard line as he was tackled from behind by the Sean Steven and Steven's kind of wrote him for a yard or two so ended up picking up about\nThree or four gonna bring up a second out of seven from the forty four yard line\nFrank's out of the game here for holding that left shoulder down\nBackup running back would be ... Jones Ford Island\nYou ended up bringing interim it as like a set of Joe ... lantern over thirty two\n[noise] he'll be on the left shoulder of the quarterback leader ... spent all\nBrian so far today back to pass he sacked nice job hanging\nOut of the football by ... just so ... came over from the right side to pick up that Russia and that didn't get a clean block on him he got in shake up pre already by the or by the armed soldiers Sheffield gift yeah got 'em by the arms that Paul Springer lose a lot we already been a nice job\nHanging out of the football yeah ... ... just didn't get enough I'm you know there but it just didn't\nGet enough of them in a which didn't allow priority step up and I got a big third downplay here [noise]\nThirteen fourteen out hey you know main last couple of times it's converted third and ten Thirteen Fifteen so are you going to be able to come up with a play here you certainly got the receivers to do it sort of run nuts run that\nTrips to the left side puree back rolling out\nUnder pressure being chased throws it away lag is down subtlety\nHold\nHold on main maybe oh ... big you know that can be a game changer bigtime game changer\nPuree ended up throwing it away didn't find anybody down field and he was really\nHad to Sean Stevens bearing down on them\nLook like they would try to seek power is out of the bacterial and throw that we'll route on the sideline 'cause um\nIt looked like the year olds are slim and [noise]\nOh that's too bad taken the flag or a boy\nAll right so a\nFunny situation for an island now Guerra coming back out trying to pin me down the the advantage for an island other than the two point lead this affect the main\nDoesn't score quickly they've been using the ground game to move down the field is six twenty six to go to the clock starts to become a fact that they still get the three time outs but as you move to play the ball on the ground you're going to take away some time and uh you know ... other than that that last\nPlane to write for the touchdown or actually the the play before that\nTo Blair yeah they haven't had the big play capability [noise]\nIt was a ... flattened short comes up the twenty four yard line\nIs that the two words you want to know grab your on right now I don't think it was a lab but it sure was short [laughter]\nAnd so they asked the coach or how'd you do you look at the very big but we sure are slow [laughter]\n[noise]\nSo what we've got to got to come up with a stop here now [noise] um [noise] you know or is this the ... it was a\nI don't know how big of an event Johnny Vander or\nTo return to gauge them for the full they say is the first out and play it goes to Sanders Sanders cut through the line gets across the twenty five out to the twenty year yard line ed or fix up about half of what he needs to get the first down John entered\nJunior ... seniors yeah that was a political ... see not [laughter]\nI Hope it was [laughter]\nCaring about a year [laughter] did you get that excited John Yoo me or Terry we all got to keep it secret or an even keel check it out of six other twenty eight yard line your eye defense calling up big now Jones directing traffic for you are out of hand off the Sanders tries to get to the outside has the first day out\nSet of going out of algae cuts back and picks up a few more gets across the forty and then a gang tackled at that point a James ...\nPercent on top of them to bring them down and helped out by a few other guys for island as well Andre ... ends up in on the play\nThere'll be ... makes his way over there\nOh tj flag is down holding against me that one back maybe\nThat's a big game that's about a third yard penalty right there because of the the amount of ... again and then you get the ... tacked on the end of it so that's huge for Rhode Island\nFive thirty six to play a fourth quarter thirty twenty eight Rhode Island ahead by two against the main black beers [noise]\nOne of the uh the way I see it one of these two teams is going to be playing them post season play and one of them is and I'm hoping someone in a blue for al ... as well as a winner here it's a big big step up into that jam you eat all on\nA category back to pass the ... play action over the top looking for Edwards got um oh my\nIt came out the other hand though in\nFall off and then it just slid right down and ended up on the ground\nOr is it through a nice fall right easier to spot because a judge wasn't anywhere close to that spot and then all of a sudden it was accelerated right through the defenders and yet his hands on ... just drop the ball than\nGoodness and Edwards is good and what he does he not going to miss that fall but once a year man that is that he put it on him and he had to try do justice necessary [noise] gonna catch that ball Ninety eight times out of a hundred and ... thank God and one of those two times came up right there are certain\nSixteen now from back at the ATV ... back to pass again satellite has a man it is complete ... right\nI guess the first down across the forty five to forty seven they'll marketed the forty eight right wide open on the sideline aid the catch went to the ground immediately and they are able to maintain possess some football first attempts on forty eight this easy do they have no third down and how many can be as\nGood as long as it's a story of the game right now from Maine as far as them being in this football game as conversions on third logs oh mission all sorts of third ... version of early now they can't uh can't get away now

it\nAt a main Jersey on and he wasn't able to pull it in either Enriquez I Believe was the guy and ah\nAh when did it out of his hand that would end of the game and the fact one twenty seven to go in the football game or announced down by five thirty five thirty two teams trying to stay at the very top of the CIA and stay very much in the hunt for a playoff spot checking down and ten forward island from midfield again\n... takes if I'm a shotgun back to pass sideline to both ...\nLocks man away\nOh it's an incomplete pass and\n... wrapped up that time on the play by Jeff to von and again do flex yeah I couldn't get\nCouldn't [noise] couldn't make a play on that thing because the guy was wrapping 'em up [noise] Kobe trying to turn around his back was trying to do that that is true of all he tried to turn around to look\nAt the ball and are\nBecause you have to have on took them away alright third down and tents on the forty nine yard line\nIt sounds like\nWe're homeless but this has been bad this has been really bad at home as much as the rest of the left side one of the right for an island ... back to pass pressure time rolls out of the pocket throws down The Elders in complete intended for Arab park about if you don't want to add up you gotta you gotta\nYou gotta get some space there was some contact there but it was at the time of the ball that was not one that should have been called Richard car was playing I'm In this ball came in there was a bump\nOn impact but a Aaron he went right after that official that could have been serious and so forth down and ten here it goes for an eye on one Seventeen to play need another a\nGame saving play like ... gave him a big deal to keep this Dr going [noise]\nTo time outs for an island they may take one now to talk it over [noise] we're going to stay with you during this time out is just a short one we don't want to\nMiss out on anything as one play the go Terry foot down and ten from the forty nine poured island in order to keep the drive going obviously they need to convert on this where do you go\nWell I think you've got you know what I really like is that you put the\nReceivers to the left or to the right three and three by one and and colds are on that that a factual to throw that they threw earlier uh in in in the fourth quarter here give him a chance to to ... down the field and he knows now he's going to press it like he's running and go route\nPlant at Fifteen Years and I both should be on that back so that that's probably the best chance to do it a nice job of really covering Aaron park around the inside there so\nYeah they are you taking away that plant yup [noise]\nStuff like that give seems like the better chances have been to the to the sideline [noise]\nOh boy [noise]\nCulture goes out there Bryant's out there\nCan be done in the game today you are right now for the first time we've seen I've seen them all day\nYou know he's in earlier but uh not a not a factor social trips to the right side that's Parker Danny in the slot why did that side as both cultures alone on the left side and Brian is on the right shoulder or the left shoulder the quarterback or so he doesn't already got one\nOn one up top Newman called time out main will force in ten you know the only ...\nSomebody's taking a look see what the set up is now if your gym Fleming or will climbing the fence a coordinated you change things up after they have a look at what you would only add lay like similar planet\nIt looked like it was going to be some type of to\nCover too was man underneath it and uh [noise] it looked like they had a match up there with Cary Denny against the linebacker he was the second receiver to the inside\nSo maybe they're gonna try to take advantage of that I think I'm going to stay with what I had unless they change their coverage you say hey listen we're going to stay with the same way unless you get a different kind of covers and then we'll go to this one so\nUm it looked like Maine was going to run some kind of two men right there underneath man with two guys over the top [noise]\nAnd and it would have given you what you want or what I wanted which was meant to men on the outside with um [noise] with a cold or the left side there and try to throw that back so look [noise] stop route you know ten twelve Fifteen Years down the field\nTo maybe get a flag of somebody decides to tackle him before the ball is released by Vito ... of the good gravy [noise] haven't gotten one of those flags in a while [laughter] man so much for the content for the forty nine your lives one Seventeen remaining in the ... and had the lead\nThirty two uh fourteen now it's thirty five thirty so that's what Twenty one on the answer points\nSo now ... in a different set the Cory ... out of the game and they bring Tyler Burke close tight end to the back side [noise] and now you're going to get a different coverage\nTrips to the right side now Ford Island Vito ... going to take it from the shotgun showing blitz now is me back to pass priority\nGoes sideline and complete it was awfully high Parker flag is down as you're already went down my goodness this could keep it alive [noise]\nWe take that drivers that was a very slow to get up but he seems to be okay [noise]\nYou gotta be kidding me that as a nominal [noise]\nPast one and complete one close early to anybody would do was rides that isn't happening so now first intent to give it a little that on a cause a ... a Sheffield was on the ground and they call out against him I'm not sure how do you know number yeah\nWhoever was going to be talking old talking do after the game I Would imagine a person can from the thirty six and made territory now one thirty to go and the football game forward island low snap ... handles\nIt out of the hands of Aaron Parker had it was a little low\nBut it was a catch a ball and he made a very nice catch right below the knee or just couldn't hang on that would have gotten out of the morning and so yeah big time because he ran into a ... a defender down there would have taken him down and he was right in line I think with a\nWith Enrique as would've brought 'em down so a timeout called by Rhode Island that's going to be their second leaving them with one thirty five to thirty\nYou know they had a stoppage of ah the clock with the incomplete pass\nOr using this time out\nLeaves them with one tearing it kinda takes any kind of run play away from you know you're you're thinking that because ... they want us to want to say well you're not saying that if other people go 'cause it's a touchdown but she got one you got one left but that's the those are gold because those\nLeave the options open for a pass or run [noise] anyway around still that is one time out trips to the right side one on one on one up top right to assume for the left yep ... back to pass looking that way for us that way\nIn and out those who get it in a fair it's looking for a flag got it at the seventeenth yard line I think this one's going to bring Rhode Island and other first down and get 'em down field but [noise]\nShould be defensive interference she comes to talking about what needs to catch it I asked right [noise]\nFifty yard penalty right from there to see because they're outside of the area where you have to just go [noise] so it was going to give them great field position here now with a minute and five to go [noise]\n... ah it's gonna be person can ...\nSee where the actual mark is the fall of the Twenty one year old yet to exactly where the putting the [noise]\n\nOne yard line as world be marked clean it up that football put down one of those five on the ...\nHuh how do you have plenty of yeah which is less of a factor it's more situation down right now for Rhode Island first intent starting this thing up over the middle\nYard line up in the past where I think again got another flag down to the backfield but the catch is made\nOut of the five yard ... Burke the grab that one right now I was a hermit Parker Parker no\nWe'll ... we'll wait and see but uh it gets inside the five\nGoal team if they get close enough [noise]\nDo get one fifty two yards to Villanova last year before that his long was thirty eight so that wasn't something that he's doing every day twice on Sundays a that was\nReally move they'd like to get closer than that [noise]\nTo watch it all aside and went off to the right back to passes for civil looking he dumps it off now to Fitzgerald Fitzgerald picks up some yard is across the forty it gets out of bounds at the thirty nine yard lines so a very good\nWay catching the flat and yards after the cats to get it down we do have a flag down I think though yeah black back in the defense of bacterial\n\nSome blocking down feel if it were to see what this is here very important call coming up would be a second down to one or maybe second out of three from Maine this play held up your fish all getting together to talk twenty six seconds remaining on the game clock\n\nComing to the sideline now officials still talking things over flag was thrown back about the twenty five yard line of so pretty deep in the secondary [noise]\n\nAll right so what island or called for illegal substitution so made all take\nThe five yards [noise]\nBring it up for the forty two year on line [noise]\nAnd it's going to be second down and five now for main trips\nTo the left side one off to the right that was on the uh the spike ball back to pass Ferguson has this man is complete the micro right skips out of bounds at the thirty two yard line so a main is getting close\nThey are now within\nThe limits of Kenny built on the back edge [noise] twenty three seconds remained on the clock the game clock that is\nI'm going to hit by one thirty six thirty five first intends on the thirty two yard line\nAll the main black bears they have that one time out remaining [noise]\n\nSon his Leary now the meat stadium [noise] it's gonna be trips to the left side\nFor the black bears one remaining back now Mike ... is in motion micro right that is back to pass ... looking he's under pressure he throws\nAnd it a couple of receivers in that general area said no intentional grounding but Rhode Island got the blitz on I think it might have been ... now the blitz but just the pressure from the front for I think it was ... that got through it got to buy the ankle and for for the past that thing away and just get it out of bounds so now it's\n[noise]\nUh he's declared down at that point I guess they're gonna they're gonna say he was down so now they need ten yards for the first and second down at ten trips to the left side again back to pass the ... dumps it off this time to Fitzgerald Fitzgerald gets out of bounds at the twenty five ... picks up about five or six on that play\nIt's going to give them a third down and for [noise] for the main black bears third down to four so he was in the grass before\nHe got rid of that football was called\nThirteen seconds remain on the game clock for an island by one third down and for for the main black fears from the U.
