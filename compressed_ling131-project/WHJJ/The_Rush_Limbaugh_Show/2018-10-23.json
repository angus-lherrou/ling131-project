United States and Saudi Arabia right we both want high prices between those two countries we produce twenty twenty five percent so if they could clued\nThose two countries could absolutely keep the prices high no question about that but you know ... and I think we've both been kind of bowls on the issue of prices and also I think I don't know about you and I I've been a bull on some of these oil companies\nCasting aside any idea that they are objective and fair and balanced\nThey have now gone all in in total now they they're unified diverted don't misunderstand I'm not I'm not\nI'm not\nIgnorant about this I'm not a unified every day I'm told they have a theme that they have all unify behind today and I think for the remainder of the time\nFor these next two weeks and it is Trump's spreads lives and the stalks fears\nAhead of election I thought when I got in here and saw that\nOne time I figured it was just you know a graphic guy riding graphic to represent what they were doing at that time but every time I looked up at the TV over the next three hours I saw that that that manner\nIt didn't matter what else was being discussed it didn't matter who the guests were then I saw the Washington Post thing and so I check the New York times and there it is spreading fear\nTelling lies a hand of election this caravan thing you know I [laughter]\nI continue to study this and try to pick it apart to analyze it and and make sense of it from a political standpoint and I still can't find\nAnywhere in the media any concern about it I Can't find anybody concerned are worrying or thinking that it's anything abnormal about it in fact what you find in the drive by media isn't tired total miss characterizations\nThese are desperately poor people wonderful people fleeing poverty in their homeland\nAnd that's not an all what they are they are part of an organized mob\nThere is no question about this it is an organized mob and like everything else the left is behind some point in the future we're going to learn exactly how this thing was pulled off we're going to learn who did it we're going to learn who paid for it we're going to learn who scripted it\nJust like we've learned how they did the Kavanaugh saying what Dr balls the Ford how bad was structured how that was planned how it was kept in reserve part is that nothing that appears spontaneous or organic\nWhere it benefits the left is spontaneous or organic is all structured it's all planned it's all scripted it's all paid for its all focus grouped it's poll tested from their perspective\nAnd the the obvious you know there there there's no you look at this you look at this caravan and it is\nIt ought to scare everybody is exactly the threat this country has faced forty years we now have a focused concentrated microcosm up with\nSeven thousand people that maybe a thousand or ten thousand if they get here by election day there's still a thousand miles away yet vowing to get here by election day at the drive by claiming they're walking there not walking they can't they'll never cover a thousand miles in two weeks have been walking it's physically not possible\nSo when the cameras aren't there some of these people have to be being driven but it is all\nOrchestrated none of this is organic none of it is real from the standpoint that individual totaling eight thousand people decided on the same day or in the same week or even in the same month just start walking\nFrom Honduras to the United states that just didn't happen and it doesn't happen somebody is making this happen somebody set this up\n... obviously is a bunch of leftist set this up and when you look at that and examine it from that standpoint you've you've got to wonder what it is that makes them think they are going to win the massive elections and it is clear to me\nNot only examining the caravan the mob see there I go I even got caught up calling it what it is it's not a caravan that's a mob it's bought and paid for and structured scripted mob\n\nThe Democrats clearly believe and they have believed since the two thousand sixteen election\nThat the way\nTo win back their power is to stoke and create Trump hatred that they think organically natural really exists in either a majority of Americans or close to it and that's what they're trying to capitalize on is massive Trump hatred massive Trump resentment\nThey're not doing it by talking about issues in an individual campaigns you'll hear Democrats promise to repeal the tax cuts and roll back things that have led to economic prosperity but in terms of the national message from the Democratic party you're not getting one you're getting\nTrump fear Trump hatred promoting the exacerbating it or what have you and it's\nIt's silly it's not the way you build a movement now\nLet me share with you a couple of\nStories today on the polling leading up to the mid term because it is all over the place and it is contradictory as it can be five thirty eight this is the adored do and the indispensable and the eagerly anticipated Nate Silver\nWho has now said the Democrats have an eighty five percent chance of winning control of the house of representatives the Republicans have only a fourteen and a half percent chance of keeping the house\nThis is almost identical to five thirty it's forecasting two weeks before the presidential election in two thousand six Dan where Hillary Clinton had anywhere from an eighty eight percent Ninety two percent chance of winning the presidency and Trump had\nWhat twelve percent to ... percent chance of winning which was effectively zero and even on election day throughout the day and that is how five thirty eight and the New York times reported\nAnd we all know what happened Charlie Cook considered the dean of political analysts and this company analyzes races individual house races and Senate races and reports on which way they're going to go\nThe cook Political Report today has shifted it ate house racist toward Democrats\n\nWould it be a crime\nTo have helped organize our fun this mass movement at ten thousand people the objective of which is no doubt to crash the U.S border\nWhat is more likely that Trump loaded with putting the influence the presidential election today I was sixteen or Democrats colluded with organizers of the invasion to influence this election serious charge\nSerious serious charge this is an attempt to interfere with our elections is\nWhat if the Democrats are found to be behind\nAnd testing and they can't hold on to my to someone

don't care what Donald Trump lives about miss tapes are there is no body in Morocco bombers league\nIn terms of purposely lying to deceive people such as you like your doctor you keep your doctor if you don't like your health plan you get to keep your health plan with\nObamacare your average annual premium will be reduced by twenty five hundred dollars those lives were told over and over and over again to dope\nOn winning Americans into believing that Obamacare was going to a centrally be\nCost free that it wasn't going to cost them very much of anything at all and that if they want their doctor in plan that wasn't going to be any change and we later found out course we knew from the beginning he was lying about it tried to tell everybody he was\nLying about people didn't want to believe the first African American president would lie about\nSuch things so much hope was invested in Obama misplaced as it turns out those lives again and they were just the tip of the iceberg those lives were meant\nTo deceive people those lives were meant to make fools out of people they get them to agree with Obama's Davis takeover of one sixth of the U.S economy\nFor the express purpose of being able to control people's lives if\nYou control their health care if you control people's access to healthcare you\nControl them you can determine what there'll be allowed to eat or not you can even determine what political party gets preference if there is a line at the doctor and this is exactly what Obama and the Democrats were doing it didn't get a single Republican vote\nDid the media run banner headlines Obama's spreads lies and stokes fear to pass Obamacare\n[laughter] no way how about the Benghazi disaster with Obama and Hillary lying for months\nThat video produced by somebody nobody ever heard of cause the unrest that led to the right to mend gutsy knowing all along that it was a pre planned and executed terror attack that the Obama administration did nothing to defend\nThose are all lives designed to mislead to deceive and to protest himself\nAnd Hillary Clinton and everybody else that was in on that damn fool decision\nAbout the law is Obama told about drawing red lines in Syria\nThe Obama administration was a series of lies upon lies and deception upon deception and the American people quickly saw through it and began defeating Democrats the polls in record numbers starting at the two thousands hadn't been terms\nThat Obama is outlying today he went out and get his own little rally in Nevada and he tried to tell everybody\nWill what'd you think about it was ... you remember who started or remember\nWho was and he had his face in his head up in the air looking up over everybody like God like you've got to look up to him but you're you're so far beneath them you can't see you we just woken up like this over everybody\nKnew just remember you just do you remember where it is critical I'm going to strike for rock Obama\nAccording to create these economic circumstances if his wife depends on it because he doesn't know how and he doesn't know how because he doesn't believe what has happened in the last two years was possible but beyond that he did not want this kind of economic activity he didn't want this kind of robust economic growth\n\nHe didn't want it demonstrated that people have more control over their destiny acting on their own behalf that if they stabbed aside and led government take care of things\nThis guy was a walking talking disaster for eight years\nAbout Obama colluding with Russia on getting rid of American nuclear weapons or an open Mike after the twenty ... right before the twenty twelve presidential election Obama's overheard talking to ... number one the aid he says you tell\nBlatter mayor to be patient I'll have a lot more flexibility after this election flexibility meaning I'm up to run again and so I'll be able to even get rid of more nukes in our stockpiled than I could be for\nWell the proof and the evidence that Trump stole the election it's just how deranged they are this is how distant and am since they are from commonsense and reality\nThere's something not right about these people folks they've gone off the deep end and collectively so this is not just a a few Democrats of fuel left us this is pretty much all of them believed to one extent or another that Mueller has the goods because of the goods are there to be found\nEven though the media haven't been able to find a report on they've got this hope invested so now tour three different stories warning Democrats the lower their expectations\nAnd this latest one here from the week it's a it's a really long piece how the mother fairy tale and I'm the author Matthew Walker hates Trump he isn't bitter is bitter about having to admit that the investigation has gone nowhere\nThat's why you're calling it the Mahler fairy tale [noise]\nThey really believe despite the absence of any evidence despite what there is to know about how the FBI stacked the deck\nAnd planted spies and invented the steel ... that was Hillary despite all of this that's known they either don't know what because they have an expose themselves to media reporting it or they have\nHeard it enter ignoring it we're we're we're actually in a political battle with people who are not right mentally forget emotionally these people are not right mentally\nSee them protesting Mitch McConnell and his wife having dinner at a restaurant and Kentucky I mean they're not right\nThere's something really really off about these people and I think they've been driven to various degrees of insanity by professors teachers and the media [noise]\nThey'd been lied to for so long about things that the things they expect to happen the things they think are real are so devoid of reality and truth that they're on able to accept that Jim Jim Jim Acosta having the president whip people up\nAt a rally after rally he says is the most depressing thing he's ever seen as a journalist this is it the citizens CNN conference yesterday in New York City\nIf you want to ask me what makes me the most depressed about my job\nIs covering the rallies and it gets to the larger point of what it's like covering the president United States and in particular Donald Trump in many ways the danger is not what Trump is doing to America the danger is how\nAmerica is changing under Trump and I never thought I Would see the day where I Would go to a political rally in you know people would give you a hard time I'd you know people yelled at me that Hillary Clinton rallies during the two does make campaign\nBut at rally after rally after rally\nHaving the president of states where people up into a frenzy got attacked the press to me is the ... the most depressing thing that I've ever witnessed as a journalist man\nOh man where has this guy been to the Trump\nWhipping people up at a rally after rally and having people get mad at me as a journalist is the most depressing thing I've seen as a gym you can\nGive you got all kinds of 'cause you could go be a waiver you obviously listen well\nMr Acosta however was not finished somebody needs to walk the guy back from the ledge here you know thousands\nAnd thousands of people who are willing to join in\nAnd do the same thing I'm at the rally in Montana the other night when President Trump praised courage and Ford say for bodies slamming Ben Jacobs I remember looking over to the supporters in the crowd and there was one guy one young man\nWho was doing these body slam moves you know and and he and his buddies were all getting good laugh out of it and then he looked at me and he goes like this\nLike I'm going to cut your throat and you know just ... yeah I went up to him after was over and I talked to him about it and and he was a sort of laughing about it and I I guess he wasn't serious about it but to me that the Trump effect on America\nWhat do you make of this so it's it's no different than when Trump is onstage hey Russia hey Russia or maybe you can find Hillary's emails and media is looking for making maybe you can find Hillary's missing thirty thousand a Muslim the media they love to hear from you\nAnd everybody on the left the media has a heart attack thinking Trump is asking the Russians to hack Hillary server Hillary's already done the hack Hillary's already done whatever she has something to hide the\nEmails no sense of humor these people have no ability whatsoever to relate to people as they actually live so Trump praises guy for being able to body slam somebody\nThey see no humor in it they don't have any idea how to relate to that they see that they think Trump they really do they think Trump is promoting violence [laughter]\nThink Trump is recommending and praising gr violence Bobby landing zone but they just I I have never seen\nA group of people this large that is so distant and absent from reality from day to day life and how people talk to each other he goes up\nTo this guy and the guys laughing hey man hey Jim Acosta how you doing I really didn't want us what you're ... you don't just fun and with your dude you're out there trying to destroy everything I Believe in Mr ... I'm just having a little fun with\nYou so these people in journalism they can go out they can destroy anybody they want they can take shots at anybody they want the people at that rally have respect for Trump the media can do whatever they want to try to destroy Trump\nBut you let somebody throw it back on them and it said ... get a disgrace that show something terribly wrong with American culture what's wrong with American culture is that the elites of Washington DC not only do not understand real life America they don't like it much\nThey really have I think what they have about Trump more than anything is those of you who are elected him\nI think that's what this really boils down to when you get down to brass tacks more on that when we get back\n[noise] somebody has to have to say you\nShould probably try being met for use radio nine twenty\nAll right to all of our listeners out there who are aged Seventy five or over and only one hundred thousand dollar life insurance policy or larger I Want you to get a pen and I want you to write this information them\nIf your age Seventy five are older and I'm a hundred thousand dollar larger life policy did you know you can convert that my policy into cash right now I'm not kidding you can turn your life insurance policy in the cold hard cash\nI Know the economy's been a struggle for many people need cash they need it right away\nAnd you can get cash right away for your life ... if you're over Seventy five you haven't won a hundred thousand dollar or larger life ... you don't want you to write this number down give these folks who call it's all free get rid of those insurance premium stopping those turned that policy into cash right this number down eight four four\nWe buy Seventy five use the cash to pay bills medical bills whatever call eight ...

Ohio David Europe first that I hire\nI rushed thanks for taking my call Yes sir\nThis morning I was listening to NPR and Steve as a reference to the mob but he didn't want to call 'em all he said it was only a few thousand people\nAnd then I take my lunch break and they have another NPR a personality\nSaying that it's such a humanitarian disaster now that they're standing by the hardest jobs in the ... making his eyes water so they use the mob\nThey don't want to say mom they use what whatever it is to them it is to them they don't want to say mom they want to say it's only a few thousand people well that's good for them but when it's not good will and they want to use the humanitarian side it's such a disaster\nBut there's you know thousands of people on the line well and he couldn't even see the end of the way they can go to the bathroom\nRight so uh your conclusion from all this is\nThat oh NPR's at great did you want to listen to NPR you want to know what the enemies doing or what they're up to that for that day listening to NPR and they're trying to use the situation for whenever it means for them and that meant it they can do it for\nWhen it got bad we've got a a a a bad a connection here uh\nAbout the only time I registered NPR is when they run and pieces to translate what I've said\nOffered her audience and and\nHappens when I get the soundbites on that maybe once every two or three weeks\nA ... of course NPR's not going to call it a mob NPR is supportive of whatever this group of people is doing and what is this group of people do it who are these people we're\nBeing led to believe that these are average ordinary Hondurans Guatemala El Salvador and fleeing poverty\nWar\nTorn poverty and the violence in ...\nAnd they just organically happen you know these people is amazingly on the same day the site and they believe\nAnd they just they just they just they just because they're human beings just to have a decent life you know in in in in and they're coming to the United states\n\nAnd of course Trump and the Republicans are a bunch of mean spirited extremist cold hearted s obeys or want these people that keep suffering\nThat's the picture that's the picture being painted one of these people really doing\nWe've got reporters embedded in there now we know we hear what they're saying they're talking about Trump being you know an assault me screwing Trump Trump simpler trumps the Nazi this there's no doubt this is a political movement it has been orchestrated an designed them as being paid for by somebody\nAnd it has one express purpose it has as its purpose to flood the American the southern border and to demand to be let in\nSomebody thinks\nOr some group of people think somehow that this is helpful to the Democrat cause\n\nOther ways this could be helpful to Democrats causes if some damn of violence occurs to them or if I'm a they're able to show that\nTrump and his supporters are so mean spirited cold hearted that they don't care about the suffering of deny the entry in this kind of thing [noise]\nBut but for the media to act like this is a a normal news event like any other normal news event it just happened to we're going to cover it and we're going to report it but that there is no political objective attached to this is absurd\nI mean I I saw a um [noise] I saw a video tape of what's this guy's Jorge\n... Ramos or whatever\nIt is it is what does it tell among do ... what what what does it tell her tell her no but what is it Univision right and he's standing there as as a bunch of these people are

you want to run in to [noise]\nYou know on the street I mean they they just anyway he's standing there and these people are walking past and he's not looking at it on their behind him and then they walk past him on his left shoulder\nAnd he's ... he's telling everybody who they are\nAnd what they want and why we must let them in and that there are different people and all they want is a better life and we as Americans we owe it to these people don't let them in all they want is what we want we all\nHave these various humanitarian objectives in common and I asked myself how in the world can this guy vouch\nFor whatever it is now eight\nThousand people but there he was down there vouch in trying to tell everybody watching\nHim that these are ... these are the prince and princesses in Central America these people are beyond reproach\nAnd he doesn't know them he has no idea who except I think he does I think he knows what the political objective is here and I think he supports it and doing everything he can to advocate for this bunch which intends to be disruptive and destructive\nBut to sit there and to try to vouch for eight thousand people as a tell his audience who they all are and why we owe them and why we need to open our borders to them\nThen these guys say Trump sees a twofold advantage it's a way to argue his opponents have turned a blind eye to the problem\nAlthough Democrats remain strongly favored to win back the house overhead TV pictures of thousands marching north\nHave the Democrats book asked about the\nTiming worry them and national Democrats strategist said in the Senate yeah\n[noise] what [noise]\nSo in the house it's a good deal in the Senate it's not a good deal they're Democrats are admitting that there spoke to over

relatively few of those polls to vote Democrat\nOn Monday Trump unleashed an explosion of immigration focused statements warning on Twitter that he made the point the military to the border and threatening to cut off aid to Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador which she has doubled\nDown on by the way so this is a story trying to tell brain dead people read political why Trump is talking nonstop about the care of him because it's going to help him with immigration well\n[noise] [noise] who they think is behind this some of the stuff\nIn the media is literally mind boggling that that they they attempt here to be on attached to it or disengaged from it\nWhen when you get down to brass tacks most people in the media would be supportive of the people is caravan and being allowed the lead in the country because they are every day anyway\nWhether people show up and groups of two or five or ten or in a Bob up seven thousand the left as in favor of letting them in\nAnother worried that this was going to be a boon to Trump right before the midterm elections which it is\nThat [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nWhen you stop and think the Democrats are behind this has to be democratic donor money behind those and the reason I say this it may make no sense that makes a word that cause this report is right this is helping Trump's allied with the Democrats do the smoke they're not rational right now\nThis group of people throughout the media the Democrat Party itself and and all of their social media base voters I'm telling you are so poisoned\nWith hatred and resentment all of these emotions they have felt following election night two thousand sixteen and all of the times in the past two years they thought that Trump was gone\nYou gotta put yourselves in

like the capital a thing as backfiring on them now\nWell see out there promising subpoena power saying yeah we're going to investigate Trump or going to investigate everybody in his administration as the reason for the Democrats to win back the house\nThey have they have lost all grounding here in in rationality\nAnd their perplexed because none of what they have done his work in a white has worked ... it's it it's getting back to the same old thing\nThey can't persuade you to abandon Donald Trump they can't persuade you to stop going to Trump rallies they can't convince you to look at Trump and see him the way they do and they're just\nFit to be tied\nOver there at their which candidate right now so they're running these polls showing the blue wave eighty five percent chance are Democrats win just to make themselves feel better about sex but they really don't\nWant your personality or by Rush Limbaugh radio nine Twenty one\nMy friends I enjoy things that are ... takes cigars

it's had the exact opposite effect it has forced people want to come into the United states to first and go down to Guatemala El Salvador or Honduras and start the track from there because\nCurrent US law makes it easier to get into the country if you're a trek starts south of Michael\nAnd that's a lot of what's going on here but if you in any way permits\nThis mob but to enter the country after the track you may as well just send out engraved invitations to anybody else around the world and say come on it\nJust can't do that and I have no doubt that whoever is behind this is attempting to pressure border control\nA American political systems and it's it's designed to make people I think put up their hands like summer started we can't stop at rush we can't stop but we just got a lot of

right alongside the ... lights for literally destroying the United states by overwhelming the social safety net apparatus and that's of I think another microcosm of what this mob is\nIt's a visual aid that shows America being overrun\nIt illustrates America is by itself and wealth and prosperity and do we owe it to the rest of the world to Sharon it's not fair we have so much that they have so little and they live so relatively close\nDon't doubt the politics of this for eight minutes and they are not humanitarian the politics of this are decidedly\nRelated and associated with an assault on America for the purposes of trans forming it into the kinds of country of the Obama heights\nWe're seeking and failed to accomplish thank goodness now\nNew York times on that are made and not does not determine gender what what is this about why in the world we're we're talking about a percentage of the population it's not even one percent here\nAnd yet it's become a this group of people has become a major major support group of the American the left and the American media for what purpose\nDefining janitors says the New York times as a condition determines strictly by a person's genitalia is based on a notion that doctors and scientists the band and long ago as oversimplified and often medically meaningless\n[noise] are you kidding me determining whether somebody's male or female\nDetermined by a person's genitals is old fashioned is no longer applicable and needs to be abandoned because it has been abandoned long ago by sensible scientists\nSo this is the party of sites a Democratic Party science consensus of scientists and something about climate change\nWho studied gender issues and provided health care to people who do not fit the typical male female pigeon holed said that the Trump administration's latest plan to define gender goes beyond the limits of scientific knowledge\nQuote Dr Joshua was safer and in ...\nThe chronology just an executive director of the center for transgender medicine and surgery at Mount Sinai health system in New York says the idea that a person sex is determined by their anatomy at birth is simply not true and we've known that it's not true for decades\n[noise] so you have a baby and your baby has male genitalia but we've known for a long time that you're a baby is not male ... necessarily\nThe same thing when you have a baby that has female genitalia but no it's not necessarily female as we've known this for decades\n\nAre anatomy does not say what it says\nSo then the New York times asked well then what does determine gender identity a person's powerful core knowledge of who they are is not so clear\nHere again as the doctor from Mount Sinai in New York\nWe know that there are a and there is a significant and durable biological underpinning to gender identity what we don't know are all of the biological factors at play that explained gender identity\nAs far as we in the mainstream biological medical community understand that in two thousand eighty and it is hard wired if is biological is not entirely hormonal and we don't\nHave identified dean so we cannot specifically said that it is genetic\nGenetics plays a role in determining your a gender\nHas a in studies of twins\nIf one is transgender the other is far more likely to also be transgender if they're identical rather than fraternal identical twins are ... what is going on here\n\nAnatomy does not determine gender experts say a companion story here\nThat's also in the business NBC News US President Donald Trump said

to protect the L G B. T. kill humidity Trump said I'm protecting everybody\nI Want to protect our country under a proposal first reported by the New York times on Sunday the Trump Administration would narrow the definition of gender to a male or female at birth than it would be on changeable later in life\n[noise] okay\nYou're asking what's going on let me very simple eighth and yet very controversial you explain what's going on here\n[noise] this is all politics\nPure and simple total politics disguised as something else\nThe Democrat Party has embraced\nAll of these various psychological disorders and abnormalities and is in the process of trying to normalize them all by in training them as policy planks ... issues in the Democratic party platform\nAnd this is how we we end up with people that represent two tenths of one percent of the population being given the whole white\nThe Democrat Party thrown behind them to make their issue one in which they otherwise vast majority it ended up being bullied into submission\nI have I have long believed that\nI just didn't have a I I did not stumbled across the correct way of expressing it but I finally did and I really do believe that\nThere are many psychological disorders out there that have been adopted by the Democratic party as political issues\nThat are then used as a as as\nThe joined the list of demands on government the government fix that government acknowledge the government to deal with other government funded a that government protect and this of course then turns the Democrat Party coalition into an even larger group of minorities\nBut it it conveys political issue status\nTo things that\nBigotry or any of this what happens is that people are minding their own business one day and confronted with the fact that a guy wants to use a girl's bathroom on the basis that he's not really a guy and we in society I told you got to put up with it you got to tolerate it you can't discriminate you can't read my book what
