a nice play just a fifty fifty ball and that my guy go up and get it had to get all air on to that ball in order to get it to Parker and it was able to do so [noise]\nI ... to expand their leaders nine nothing now see Jae Carrick out for the point after attempt [noise]\nPerfect on the year and sends another one through ... takes at ten nothing lead over Brown University fourteen eleven remaining here in the first\nHalf of play it will keep it here right now ... you look at some of those numbers from the first half so far you know pre already now five of six throwing the football for just about Seventy five yards and you got to be pretty pleased with [noise] the numbers have been able to put up in a difficult situation for him\nAnd I really liked the job that will swimming is doing calling this\nGame again obviously they saw something on film with with brown giving up over three hundred yards gained rushing\nThey really liked to match up there and they've just taken Brian running him up inside\nHe's got about fifty yards and ... and the the the past as if they're throwing for the most part have been a ... that was a straight dropped back right there and that was just say I'm going to take a shot down the street with Aaron Parker at six foot three over and and probably more athletic no definitely more athletic than the corner\nAnd numbers give him a fifty fifty ball go up and go get it and\nAnd ah he just did just that and\nYou gotta like so far what they've done often simply here mixing the run little plaques and passed a new wrinkle with the uh with the wildcat getting the guy getting the ball into guy's hands that can make twice\nThat nothing around ahead governors got belongs to brown\nUniversity they would like uh the governor Gina Raimondo who will be here later I may be here all ready to be handing that to Jim Fleming in the viewer Iran's rams or three\nIn one seventeenth on the country coming in daycare let's just wouldn't go it's going to go into the end zone for touch back [noise] so good boost that time by Carrick\nGoing with the wind here need wind blowing left or right a\nGorgeous day [noise] so good football ... so far no you know the defence when you look at the numbers are not highly ranked\nIn the CIA they'll give you yards but uh they're pretty stingy with the points and a lot of those yards came like in the Albany game that fourth quarter yeah that was there so you know already decided [noise] and those will always linger and hurt their overall averages but you got to say the defenses really come through in a\nBig way for down today they've held brown and just twenty five total ... round gives the ball for the first time in the second quarter\nRight now Michael governed the quarterback set to take this map\nFrom the shot gunning back in ... he gets sort of a fashion it's incomplete inside all balls picked off and had a chance to go grab that football over the middle was where the ball's thrown when he started concern coming in\nAnd a hobby I could steal who has just been a great great edition at the linebacker position for an island at the ballpark right to him\nAnd it just wasn't able to pull it in a lot of traffic around them\nIn that pile buddy I could have had that ball he was jumping up and down saying oh man I give me another shot it that way or the govern play action over the middle nice break\nUp by Rhode Island right job getting known that one out and Jones is leading tack learn Rhode Island we're talking with Peter ... gets on the show on Thursday night at the gym climate coaches show pizza defensive coordinator and boy you know about the [noise]\nThe long journey that now is Jones's spin on it was a db or early on and he makes his way to the linebacker position leaves a team and tackles this year he's a\nHe had got Saxon CFLs and he's just so active a big break up there to stop or what or could have been a decent drive for brown\nLooks like they're going to stop them in their tracks if they could hold him on third and Ken what's like blitz again it's stewardess coming this time in other governors going down the Nineteen yard line that defensive line and a lot of blitz packages for it out on now\nIt's going to different Shelby Mac once again the guy in on um along with some others\nAnd Eddie also go ahead no judge their friends you know he's in a nice job also in that and they're doing a good job Steve I'm just getting forming pressure looked like a [noise] it looked like a ... remember\nWas ... it was like he was going to come off the uh the we sided but then he pulled back and kind of mirror that quarterback in the law that defensive line\nTo just get off the field and get that sec [noise]\nAll right now the funding situation door she set up his own forty five to bring this back spiraling ... a good one backs them up to the thirty five no fair catch call for tries to get away from camp is down to the thirty eight that was the only one at a brick pick and choose your spots last one [noise]\nGolf or the fair catching probably should have rented out this time ah should have called for the fair catch and\nSteady runs it gets a couple of yards that'll bring his average down a little bit person can from the thirty seven yard line on their side of the fuel for an island Thirteen twelve remaining in the first half a player without a head\nTend to nothing over brown and really dominating the game so far we sure to join us at six o'clock next Thursday October eleventh at the ... to the gym plummet coaches show going back shepherd's pie\nSo it will be for a third and ten from the twenty five they'll call it an incomplete pass and a\nRound still in a good situation but then all of the football in their hands anymore that a fumble recovery by ... by goes\nOff the charts as well so a third in ten from the twenty five their own twenty five for Brown University trips to the left side one of the rights or governors struggled so far in this football game one of six throwing the football actually one of seven with that incomplete pass [noise]\nGot to try to get something going here on third long trips to the left side one of the ride but governor back to pass pressure again throws into the flack for the money back out of the backfield he drops it so what is going to be a panic situation for brown and Dorsey is going to be lining up not too far away from it feel to get this one's going to\nSit in that part about the forty yard line on his side of the field so around should get some excellent field position as they have pretty much all day long\nYou know it was a good job right there by the difference too because even if he makes that cats they're going to make that tackle for about three or four year old game so you're given that underneath cell phones are down along situations all day long and a brown gender difference during a nice job of getting thrown off the field and getting that football back to Europe and it's\n\nOn route to do the honors spiraling high ... the good one comes down to the twenty nine yard line door she does not call\nFor a cat she gets away from one ... thing goes down to the twenty nine but the first guy that came in on um [noise] uh yeah I Believe was Jackson Jackson came in he just basically took them through the cracks on his shoulder shrug and read all mad and\nHe's got something going on there that is for sure first intense on the twenty nine Ford Island beat up here already back out doing a splendid job a quarterback so far in the football game filling in for John Lawson is listen to this day to day not able to go today they're hoping that\nHe may be able to be ready for the continuation of conference play next weekend or so that is the goal right now for the island and all conference performer so far this year but Vito ... already\nHas failed in admirably round on his trip to the left side puree handed off Jones going up the middle across the thirty five yard line to the thirty seven his name Jones\nAnd he picks up about six seven yards on that\nGets good chunky yards he can keep doing that on the ground against a run defense and brown that has trouble stopping the run they have allowed three hundred and two yards per game on the ground brown has and one hundred and thirty four in the year [noise] so we get to some verdict\nBone right here with veto brewery\nHe's going to hand it off it goes Joey Kenny Kenny dives into the wind picks up the yard maybe\nThat's the only time that joy turn you will be called on to be a tale back in the song yes right there\nBut he's been active as sure as throughout the years ah had his number called on a number of different situations so already now the third into Lebanon five to go in the first half of play their heads Seventeen and I think and they bring that line is Coulter back in his book bag [noise] also are\nSetting up or down his fury the quarterback and he's got one remaining back on his right shoulder\nFrom the shotgun now he's going to hand it off the bride to get those two yards you get stuff that the line trying to push themselves forward I don't think he's going to get what he needs a white allies you're ... years stood him up at the lineup Bryant tried to apply for to see where it goes [noise]\nLooks like they've got a pretty good spot initial contact he did it have it the guy that going to give it to him first down you are I that's a big one right there [noise]\nPut able to control the clock Terry yeah exactly you know move this football a little bit further is ten twenty two to go on the half of they can get around to the locker room without any points on the board and his game as in full control Rhode Island is eight in the league\nAnd rushing the football so it hasn't been their strength but they're doing a good job of it so far today\nHere's another run play across the forty yard line up to the forty four and a it's going to be named Jones on the cherry picking up about three or four four dollar getting a little closer to midfield so the third and points in the league at thirty five points per game and uh their seventh and points allowed allowing twenty nine to their opponent\nRushing yard shirt island eight in the league passing yards fifth on the lake and that the certainly not taken the dip today with fury of the quarterback position and total offense their seventh in league with three hundred and forty two yards\n\nAgain that have you back feel for down in the auto of priorities and I'm looking down field as an adult I think your health or gets yeah\nFrom behind trying to get that pose pattern into the end zone\nThey catch the ball goes over his head but the flag comes down to the penalty twice going to be on a ... who absolutely grabbed his Jersey once and then went back and got it again it was almost cartoonish the way that culture was trying to run away from him that he was just dragging them back by\nFormation Rhode Island is able to isolate I say a culture on this backside corner right here and I do that all day long just throw that fifty fifty ball because he had to be right there and luckily for brown I mean they just did grab Jersey\nFor brown it's a smart move to make I mean that's six points if uh they don't get that indifference calling all they do is walk up to the forty one now Rhode Island's got a lot of work to do before they can put one in the end zone it's one of those rules that\nReally doesn't have a lot of equity to it nine twenty to go in the second quarter replay Seventeen nothing brown ahead\nFirst intent from uh the brown forty one again the handoff diving into the lie to the forty ... getting up to about thirty eight\nJoy Kenny\n[noise] they've got a deer in there now is just playing another\nHeavy full back that's a big backfield back there with with ah you're going to you know it come down and you've got a name Jones comes in Rhode Island I can never do and you got ... ... it's just a big big back bill\nTrips to the left side one off to the right now for ... one remaining back that's named Jones [noise]\nBy the end on the left side of the line and Kenny fertile on the line of scrimmage little bubble screen it is complete up to the thirty five yard line diving to the first out mark and not going to get their ...\nOn the uh [noise]\nCatch for an island local guy making good for you are I and his numbers a little bit down this year with the advent of Parker and Coulter just emerging\nIn that often the role of the wide receiver position but when my above is your third receiver about you're pretty good you are really good certain for after again of six hundred thirty five yard line [noise]\n\n... from the shotgun once again [noise]\nHolds if they're under some pressure now steps up in the pocket he's going to go down to secure the football he did but uh boy he was hold nothing out\n[noise] for anybody to get\nThat apparently he was able to hang onto it

you know you really look into statistically is that all American type thing which you know everything is early it's still early in the season but\nYou know um [noise] you'd look at veto a you've got a you know very good understanding what we're doing I really certainly think that he's got a [noise]\nYou know he's got a really good opportunity you know if she gets more snaps this weekend to continue

I think that all of them have prepared well all of them will be ready and if you are sitting there are throwing a dark out there and say okay this is a guy up this week I think our whole team would be a rally behind that one quarter back and and they will give us an opportunity to win but as you know to a team game we've all got to\nDo our part and and I'm really looking forward to seeing are going to want can perform and if if it struggles a little bit will have to go to another guy you\nMentioned Rwanda what he's been able to accomplish ... of course a two time see a offensive player of the week right now in passing average is number five in the league with two hundred and forty a yard for a game pass efficiency is number one of the league and\nTotal up and she's number two in the lake so uh you got a guy in June ... put up some serious numbers for your Seventy Ninety nine completing Seventy one percent of his past is\nNearly a thousand yards already passing for him ten touchdowns

with it\nYou know I I he be a nightmare I mean one of the things that you know defense of background which of course you know I spent a lot of time on the defensive yeah the ... you can get everything covered up and you can never good pass rush but when you use capable quarterback that can extend drives\nA it becomes a real heartbreak or defensively can really break your back a little bit but uh\nYou know ... you know performance to numbers those have been off the charts but you know watching him evolve as you know our leader you know a guy who's been here a short period of time\nNamed as a captain you know those things being volumes and I think you just really has a ...\nA good demeanor about himself which is you know continue to compete go to the next snap and he's able to make those

decision to [noise] you know let's be careful with this thing and told him let's go to will go when the game with our second quarter back and I thought\nYou know veto came in and did an admirable job I think that there was you know there was some slight overthrow you're caught reading in the early you could have dropped that one on which I've seen ... million times and and the other one that got
