I think it will be successful because they're because wherever there\nAre large margins Amazon can come in and disrupted there and there's no industry that is better margins than the mattress industry yeah well they're willing to lose money\nThe Amazon yeah they've shown that uh they become more disciplined about that in recent years which is one of the reasons why the stock is doing well\nBut this was a new mattress from out of business and then raise the prices Russia that that's that's how they do but the mattress companies are ... are making so much money you can go to small towns that have very little in terms of commerce\nAnd they have a beautiful mattress store in part because I was listening or freakonomics broadcast that said you could just like two or three ... week really and make pretty good money because there's so much profit in it\nGood business to be in the U.S [noise] applications decline at Harvard Wharton and other elite business schools as the degree and they were talking about an MBA yeah loses its appeal to young people us\nBusiness schools received a hundred and forty thousand applications that may sound like a lot but it's down seven percent and there's definitely a lot more competition yeah so if you wanted to go to the good news is if you if you wanted to go to a really good school\nAnd you got decent grades and your way to pay for it yup got pretty good chance of getting in you do have a good chance of getting in a day but the the the kids must feel that doesn't have the value right I think there is that feeling that ah that the NBA has lost value else the job market's good now right day if the market was it ... it was terrible\nBut the if you're a bright young person with you know say three to five years of business experience\nYeah why why go back to grad school you're you're already making good money I you know I think that's the reason I think that even though the ironically because the economy's doing so well\nYou can get a really good job without an MBA right and and the NBA your applications are hurt on two ways in bad times people don't go there because no one's hiring people the NBA\nAnd good times you don't need them be I Do remember back in two thousand nine\nPeople would graduate and they'd say on the job market's just terrible wife's I'm going to go back and I'll go to grad school for two years and hopefully the economy will turn around by eleven or twelve or through you know there was a period of time there were a lot of people are going back to law school in grad school\nBecause you know you weren't going to make any money anyway yeah so I it's it's a challenging situation and we've talked about every situation is different for a lot of people in MBA can you really can raise the ceiling of what they can earn by a lot for a lot of other people it's not necessarily a good day on the market so far\n... up five points the guys have a hundred and twenty nine points excuse me yes in ... up five points the NASDAQ is up to twelve\nAnd the price of crude oil we didn't get to talk about it today but I I got to tell you frankly I'm very nervous but Myrtle at six Seventy five dollars a barrel guy sitting in my right thinks it's going to hit a hundred bucks the bearer of bad happens Laymon you\nThe preceding program was paid advertisement by the financial exchange and does not reflect the views or opinions on this station its advertisers or I or media\nThe biggest music festival of the year and it's coming to their cw\nDon't miss the iconic performance just shot\nWatch on the heart radio\nHominid tuned into the gym planning radio show on news radio nine twenty four seven FM every week and find out of the show we live in your town a news radio R.

[noise]\nRhode\nTraffic and weather station news radio nine twenty had ... when you wake\nI argue radio station on George Morris news radio nine twenty four seven at them here are the top of local stories we're following city leaders are expected to speak today\nThe question was oh my God\nOh no Harry the polls are tightening oh my God no well what what does that tell you what what [laughter]\nWhat what what's going on Harry ...\nAre so many races that are within the margin of error\nMissouri Nevada Tennessee Florida the list goes on and on and on we have all of these close races which means we have a best estimate about what might happen in the Senate come November but it really could be a democratic wave or could be a Republican wave at the polls rough on what the Republican wave in the Senate a mouse and if that not in the house\nRepublican away in the Senate all know that means no impeachment of Trump means an impeachment up the Democrats get the house and don't think so but if they do it ... it would die in the Senate unless there's a bunch of Jeff Flake clones in there because they would never vote to what took an effect if the Republicans hold a senator even swelled the ranks\nSo the panicked host Jim shoot I couldn't believe when he heard their\nBlue wave red wave in the Senate\nShe says there was discussion of a blue wave being generic battles advantage for Democrats do you notice it tightening their as we get closer to the election\nI Will say the generic ballot does seem to be tightening a little bit which is good news for Republicans you know there's a lot of talk oh with Brett Kavanaugh on this whole confirmation map that in fact that might hurt Republicans but it doesn't actually seem to be so far we're actually seeing some tightening in the Senate races and more than that we're seeing tightening of the house races\nBut I'm going to leave your little sigh and observation about this but what did I tell ya he's generic ballots way back last December that's when they first\nStarted harping on this and back then you know nine months ago the Democrats had a twelve point advantage\nAnd that's when all the talk of a blue wave bitten yeah and that's when all the talk of the Democrats winning back Congress began and it went all through the year Democrat advantage in the generic ballot was twelve five seven and the Republicans pulled even in a couple of 'em that Democrats once again broke away\nAnd all during it I your host of doing this a long time and it doesn't matter\nIt doesn't mean anything\nMe remind you of a motivation technique utilized by the coach of the New England patriots won bill that will check\nPrior to one of the super bowl the patriots rarely might do it frequently I but I Know of one time\nHe gathered the players for a team meeting and so we're gonna have more fun we're going to watch horse race he had videotape of a horse race that nobody obscene and it was not a big race they don't allow the players to make friends leave that said why Andrews on who was going to win\nSo the players made their bats and Donald ... starts to tape of the race and stops at at the first term it's OK layer bats tell me who's gonna win players go nuts making their choices\nTape resumes that much ... stops at at the halfway point anybody want to change their bed anybody want to double down players go into gear making their bets\nHas the final turned ... stops the tape but the horse race again asks the players if they want to make an additional beds or get out of ones they've made\nPlayers do what they do that much ... resumes tape to the finish line makes the point it didn't matter at any point in this race when I stopped the tape\nThere is no way anybody could have known as the first term at the halfway point or at the final turn who is going to win yet look what you're doing you're making beds you bring guessing some of your probably were certain the bottom line is finish\nYou never know before it's over who's going\nTo win no matter what any kind of expert tells you it was a motivational technique designed to get the players to realize first quarter halftime of third quarter\nFinish doing your job [noise] same thing here posing January\nIn front of ... election doesn't mean anything polls in June July don't mean anything\nThey're interesting for the media which is trying to shape public opinion with these polls but at the polls do not give any indication the final outcome appalled in July or August would not contained any of the Kavanaugh\nNews so how relevant could have been answered none zilch zero not up\nAnd so now here we are on October second CNN is panicking\nRacist or typing in my house this wasn't supposed to happen why they had all their pre election polls they had the generic ballot\nThey've had this in in in the in the can it's been in a bank since last December in their minds it's been over it's just a matter of ... out now all of a sudden house races\nAre tightening and there could be a blue wave in the Senate\nBut wave red wave and is that Republicans could come out of nowhere at about fine on her in and take over\nWell\nWe don't know if the Republicans were ever really far behind we don't want anything because there was no vote back in December or January or July or August we don't know anything\nAnd we don't know anything now and we won't know anything until the day after\nElection day or maybe later that night now one of the brief observation here once again do you notice Mr engines knock it in there\n\nI think you know there's a lot of talk Brett Kavanaugh this whole confirmation mess that in fact might hurt Republicans it doesn't seem to be self\nLadies and gentlemen high and the reason he saying this\nAnd everybody else because of my viral prediction of last week that if Republicans don't confirm Kavanaugh as the Democrats are going to win everything that production of mine went by blood drive\nBuys loved it they love it when the leader of the G O P reminds me starts ripping the Republicans when I start predicting Louis that's when I become totally credible that's when they run the sound bites me predicting it all over the world\n\nYou notice how easy it would be to trick them they run with that and they ... now all of a sudden it's just the exact opposite he's just the exact\nOpposite why all this attention on Kevin on what the Republican is actually going to help them how can they live on just said they were going to lose\nThey are totally totally confused\nAnd as I said yesterday what what what is the sense in saying that we have to do was in order to win you know people will lead Kevin I'll go down that are really fire 'em up that far but I Know the way you get on the bandwagon the way you get people on the bandwagon the way you get people wanting to be on your team is when\nIncluding winning\nThe capital nomination now let's go to further news is about

local talk shows but\nCNN's the only cable out there is no Fox knows there's no black sphere and there's no new alternative media uh aren't really conservative websites or start everything's starting to to to to block it at that point but but this program nationally was still in four years after our\nAnd Clinton have blamed angry voices on the right for Timothy McVeigh blowing up the uh building in Oklahoma City\nAnd the federal building and of course uh I I was living there was not going to accept that would challenge the White House automation a correction claiming though we were talking

why you should have no doubt I Know what I'm Talking about here I haven't been subjected to this\nLiberal machine and the way it operates a number of times I Know them I Know I Know how they lie and make things up and strategize\nI Know their their techniques their strategies and everything better than they do so a cartoonist by the name of Chris brick that was his name drew up a cartoon of a fireman\nCarrying a dead baby there was actually a cover of time magazine this picture of a fireman carrying a dead baby from the rubble was a cover on time magazine ... the artist that his cartoonish\nInterpretation of it and the fireman\nIs thinking as he is carrying the dead baby damn right wing radio\n\nWell one of the local host of the time John Carlson on the radio in Seattle got hold of that fireman had him on the air wanted to know if that's what he was thinking as he was performing rescue duties\nAt the Oklahoma City bombing the fireman said no no no no we all love Rush Limbaugh we listen to Rush Limbaugh and the fire\nHouse well that cartoonist is back\nYou remember during the hearings Brett Kavanaugh said that his ten year old daughter was praying suggested the

going to kill you\nYes right after she dealt with the unborn baby is going to do that first\nYou will never ever see your unborn child ... the Democrats really want to\nStand behind this\nIs this what they want to vouch for they're backing off this is again I don't mean to be redundant but Dianne Feinstein all of a sudden this after the bringing up the fact that we need to start looking again of his roe versus Wade decision or women's reproductive health and is assault weapons or a thinking on why\nThat's been that long ago and you didn't have anything to oppose them they're just so you imagine how they feel about this\nI mean they're fools to believe this was real and the first place but they're so damned desperate [noise] uh [noise] one let me I Need to go back I Need to find Sheldon wise here it is number not Sheldon Whitehouse this guy's money this is a Democrat\nWho on friday morning the morning of the vote held up one of the enlarged pages of Kavanaugh's ... said that he had figured out how to translate it and the date in ... he figured this could be the gate where the incident Dr foreign described it happened\nAnd he thought to try to translate some of the nicknames and phrases that capital used on his calendar\nOf course in incriminating ways a toward capitalism\nSo under Morning America today George Stephanopoulos of the Clinton war room\nIs talk English Sheldon Whitehouse is a Democrat in Rhode Island are you satisfied with the scope of the FBI inquiry can they finish this by friday\nI think I'm satisfied and we don't know\nAll the details yet but clearly if they haven't been given a free rein to interview whomever they want and that's a very good sign the last thing we want as a sham investigation\nI also think that there is a fairly small universe of witnesses here on a very big FBI so yes I think they probably should be able to get this done by friday affairs really\nPut the effort into it now wait a minute [noise] that just makes too much sense that just doesn't fit\nWith Chuck Schumer today on the floor of the Senate who we have we have audio soundbite number eight this is Chuck you he went to the floor right after the turtle did\nAnd basically made the uh the case that\nWe're nowhere near ending this FBI investigation as the turtles set the Schumer and the Democrats are moving the goalposts\nWe are looking at what judge Kavanaugh says at age fifty three not what he did\nWe're looking at his credibility now is a grown adult\nAnd if you believe Dr Ford\nJudge Kavanaugh\nJust yesterday NBC News recorded that either judge Kavanaugh people close to the judge who are in communication with his classmates [noise] to get them robot allegations by Deborah Ramirez it seems that judge Kavanaugh was at least very misleading to the Judiciary Committee about ... story\nSo now it's about capital lying if Kavanaugh perjuring yourself and that means he's not quite on what they've got to make up their minds first he's a serial gang rape is now the throws ice on people at a bar Denise negative fall down drunk and now\nHe's a liar they are flailing\nBut Sheldon Whitehouse totally out of character with his majority minority leader in the Senate Chuck Schumer\nYeah I think friday night yeah there's not too many people to talk through here FBI's got a lot of shore or we can get this done that's just to central maybe White Houses out their\nTruck in the spirit here to be the public face of a reasonable Democrat Party while everybody else stays insane\nBut they they are moving the goalposts but\nAnd yes for a delay but they're also trying to move the goalposts as a target or they can catch Kavanaugh in anything\nUh there's one more that I Want to play and I'm looking for it and I just found it I Want you to go to audio soundbite number twelve [noise] the question\nOf who leak Dr ...\nOrange is letter to Dianne Feinstein\nYou'll just dozens of leaking this letter my memory on this is kind of fuzzy but I remember Feinstein during a press conference or either on the floor to the gym judicial committee or if I remember her showing the letter holding it up or talking about it\nI remember I don't know if that was the lead but she clearly talked about him and said that she'd had it since July and that she told us all about\nIt that whoever Senate didn't want to be named and didn't want to go forward and she didn't want to do with it she's holding this thing I don't know what I don't know what to do with us\nI was all part of a strategy so\nLate yesterday afternoon on Shepard Smith

Smith\nAnd he had\nThe legal affairs correspondent for National Public radio on their Nina Totenberg if you said Mitch McConnell said friday he thinks the Democrats won't agree that we're limited scope and the FBI investigation now today they're asking for twenty four witnesses to be interviewed\nWhat are your thoughts on that missed out\n... I remember when I broke the story I thought this was the closest kept secret\nAnd I managed to find out about it I found out they were probably a hundred people in Washington this secret and kept it for a very long time you and I are not stupid people we may not be praying for I not stupid\nAnd once you get us on a case like that and lots of people are talking to each other one leads to another
