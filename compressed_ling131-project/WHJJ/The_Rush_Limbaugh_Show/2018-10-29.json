information and reservations\nJoining us on the line now is Amy hall from seeing that road show here to talk about the twenty eighth team jeep wrangler Ruben Cohn ... thank you for joining us\nThanks for having me I always get to talk to you absolutely so I mean where does the ... fit in within the wrangler I guess a brand in of itself what what exactly does that tell us about this vehicle\nThat Ramadan is the top dog out their wrangler line up there is a vehicle that you want if you want to go off road completely off the grid I'm completely stock and be able to get ready much anything that you can throw at it\nIs it called that had excellent ground clearance excellent offered ... um it it got a set of really really be the offer choir\nI'm right and we're locker connecting play by like this is the dog and that the fight and it will be paying a thousand dollars for a new report on it that it\nBut it is also very very good\n[noise] so what's what's\nAbout this thing in his element first off road ... is there anything that this this car really struggles with off road is there anything that you know as you're putting him through its paces just been and say gee that might have been too much for it\nI have not come across anything that would be too much\nFor it um I have taken it on the very\nFamous Ruben ... which the vehicle is named for and normally you don't see doc vehicles on the contrary normally the thing with um you know thirty five thirty eight and higher and you'll see things with\nThick thank led by that because it's very very difficult you're basically going over I'm older it's not that it ... and older\nUm and we were able to take stock river con over there\nI mean it's slow going it was able to do it um I just took it seven days off road I'm from Lake Tahoe down to the Mexican border through\nEverything from the rock Johnson valley which is where a very famous awkward race or have helped me get a hammer on all the way that even in Guam as with the highest in North America um I did not have\nAny real problem that did not result from driver error I mean I I Will get back once in a but not not doing the right thing\nUm but I was able to self extract thanks to the ... and I'm of the root cause and and the seven day than we were the only we were the top vehicle we won the competition and about stock vehicle we were the first ... when that was not modified um so if I were to get a vehicle or their zombie apocalypse\nIt is going to be at the brains of ...\nWhich is great but what if ... apocalypse doesn't actually happen what what what was going on the road because look at it might happen eventually but today and tomorrow I don't see zombie so how's this thing hold up on the road\n[laughter] I Love your positive outlook I'm Still in the coming in two days to all bets are off them though [laughter]\nOn this thing does have solid act will in the front and in the rear and that can cause um\nIt can cause it to write a little bit rough on the road and that has been true in the past and it is not the mood is writing vehicle I'm offered vehicle that you would be an eye for that I Would say probably the ram Fifteen hundred or the heavy the are those are very very with on the pavement having said that\nAny kind of uprising any kind of the first instinct that the drive by media has\nAnd I would I say drive by media may as well be selling it saying a Democrat part of the first thing I think they have is to try to find a way\nTo link who ever committed the bad deed to the Republican Party or\nThe so called conservative movement\nAnd of course now it's blamed Trump everything everything at all what ever it is blame Donald Trump\nBlame me blame you blame anybody that supported Donald Trump\nAnd frankly I'm worn out with this reaction I have had it I Am fed up with it's been this way for years there were showed up during the Obama administration there were mass murders and at no time did the drive by media ever try to link any of it to Obama\nAnd yet [noise] people have forgotten wasn't inflammatory\nTo say that Republicans were going to be responsible for millions of deaths if Obamacare was not passed a law anybody remember that because I sure as hell do because I was set up on it then\nWe're trying to oppose a government takeover of one of the great industries in America better than anywhere else in the world we're trying to take a to prevent a bunch of incompetence a bunch of government bureaucrats in the left wing politicians from taking over the American health care system meanwhile\nObama is lying to everybody about it claiming that if they like their doctor keep their plan they didn't get get get to and that their premiums are going to be reduced by twenty five hundred dollars a year or lie after lie after lie not called out not reported\nAnd then the Republicans come along and try to oppose it on subsidies grounds and the Democrats and the media start running around talking about how the Republicans are going to be responsible for the deaths of millions of people you want to tell me that's inflammatory or not\nHow many years\nHave average ordinary Americans had to listen to this like you and I have\nWhere every time something happens the Democrats politicize literally everything and that's why none of this stuff ever gets fixed it's why none of this stuff is ever going to get resolved until this politicization of everything stopped in other words\nYou have some guy who's been mentally ill for ten Fifteen Years [noise] skills me\nThen decides to take action and all of a sudden it's ... it's the fault of a political party or it's the fault of eight presidents and it's so predictable because they hate the president will do and then they can to get rid of him they spent two years trying to get rid of him they fail to get rid of him they're fit to be tied over their failure they're ratcheting up this\nThis anger and\nIf it were getting so far away from the notion that whoever did it is the person that\nWe're getting to the point where in this country because we politicize everything nobody's responsible for what they do whatever anybody does it's because of the politics of the Republican Party or the conservative but\nAs far as the drive by meeting is concerned it's not because somebody is mentally ill disturbed who knows what's been going on in their lives the media doesn't care about that except to the extent they can link the Trump\nWell I I for one am am fed up with it I Am sick of this reaction to every freaking event\nEven though whether we can't even get away from it from the women are extreme weather happens it's our fault it's the problem of the Republicans or Trump\nBecause we don't sign on to this asinine manmade global warming theory so we ended up being responsible for deaths in print Domenico\nAnd then when we stand up and defend ourselves against then all of a sudden we're attacked and we're assaulted for being anti war many anti anti black anti minority what have you\nBecause they politicized literally everything [noise] and you know what\nI have gotten to the point I Can't tune it out it is my your men too\nProtesters we need to give them space to destroy\nWe need to stand back and let them get it out of their system\nThey say nothing when the Republicans were gunned down they abuse power to hide the Hillary's crimes to fix elections to runs ... coups against the duly elected president\nSo the left wants Trump to tone down his efforts at self defense that's what Trump is doing he's assault and he said countless times if I'm here I'm going to hit back\nWhen Trump is blamed for the actions of a lunatic he's told to be more dignified remain silent be like Mitt Romney would be a be reserve didn't so forth\nBoth just sit back with Occupy Wall street black lives matter and the purple we haven't rode out\nHundreds of miles or Frisbee\nOr speed is susceptible to hurricanes and tropical

[noise]\n\n\n\n... wanted Brett Kavanaugh to sit back and take it you see the way this works is [noise]\nThirty six year old allegation can be banned for which there is no evidence for which for supposedly witnesses candy been placed themselves at the place because the victim doesn't aware it happened doesn't know when it happened but it becomes real and we got to destroy somebody's life we have to destroy somebody's career we've got and Kevin ... is supposed to sit\nBack and just take it he's just see those are the old rules in Washington\nPeople under assault take it\nThe best way to deal with it they are advised to non make waves sit there and take it and that's how responsible reasonable Republicans always acted well that's not a Donald Trump is it wasn't elected to act that way\nYou ask me the wrong people being told tone it down\nThe left needs to tone down it's organized violence the left needs to tone down all of these political stunts\nThat are in many ways designed to provoke a reaction from people because they utilize abuses of power and character assassination\nAnd the the character being assassinated just supposed to sit there just supposed to take it\nThat's how you get ahead in Washington if you're under the gun you take it you just sit there and you take it\nAnd you realize it's just politics don't take it personally judge Kavanaugh don't take it personally it's just politics because everybody hates Trump we can't let you on the Supreme Court and you're going to have to sit there and that's the price you're gonna have to pay for this guy being elected and he's supposed to sit there and take\nHe wasn't supposed to be angry\nWhile he was smeared and while his family was threatened in his life and future we're in the process of being destroyed he wasn't supposed to say anything\nJust to sit there and take it that's the rules that's the way it works in Washington\nNot personal just business just politics and then a couple of years afterwards everybody forgets it and everybody likes Kevin except Kevin O's life was ruined\nAnd he's never supposed to want to get even he's never supposed to fight for himself\nTrump Defoe not supposed to stand up to this not but that's who Trump is they're not used to it they thought they would have sent Trump packing a year and a half ago they thought they'd be rid of Donald Trump\n\nAnd they still aren't let's go to the phones we have Steve in Pittsburgh with us You're up for us today Steve thank you for calling hello\nHey rushed pleasure to speak with you thank you sir\nI can tell you the last week in front of the Pittsburgh School board they had a proposal to arming school police and it was voted down to one\nWell it's been happening in school but you know similar situation where President Trump came out and said if they had an armed guard this could've been prevented\nAnd then you have a mayor who's very anti Trump very liberal come out and say that an armed guard would not stop that's what we need is more gun control I mean how many more things have to happen before they realized that more gun control not answer not putting someone with a gun that can stop this\nWell look I hate to be the ones who tells you but uh there's no amount of death there's no amount of shooting\nWhatever get your mayor to change his mind about what he believes\nBecause you say it's really not about guns he thinks it is supportive but it's not really about guns it's about something\nMuch larger than that it's about being able to tell people what they can and can't have it's about it's about telling people that they have freedom of speech except\nYou can't say this you can't say that's kept but other than that you got for freedom of speech with us leftists [noise] uh yeah and you you want to have gotten you're going to have a gun except it needs to look up to that but but but but but we're all for freedom as we define that he mentioned this let's\nGo to the audio soundbites I Want to start here with a [noise] Trump himself this is this is this is an example\nYou [laughter] well I I'm sure some people were shocked a\nOn Saturday when this was Trump's reaction speaking with reporters he was a joint base Andrews it used to be Andrews Air force base case you're wondering what does this joint based business\nWell it used to be Andrews Air force base and then there was another military base close by another branch close by to unify them all the cotton joint base\nWhere multiple services are on the same place\nAnd so that's that's where air force one is part for Trump takes the helicopter to get on board Airforce one way is going to travel a reporter said\nMr President do you think you need to revisit\nBroadcasts that someone who is from right here\nBehind the golden me I'd

been hacked and sold it to a cyber thief so this guy open one checking account after another got himself a bunch of check books and then started writing bad checks for merchandise\nHe'd show up a day later to return the same stuff asking for the returned amount in cash or you do that enough times you can be holding sixty thousand dollars or so and cash that's how much money this particular

Sharpton are busy promoting all those people\n\nThey feel sorry for them to get right down to brass tacks to feel sorry for them they think that because of the ancient history of America with slavery discrimination and all that 'cause it's just that that really we we we can't\nHold them accountable we have a skill says you know we can look the other way not exaggerating on that but the point still remains that Obama was chummy with Farrakhan and Al Sharpton and the Reverend Jackson are as well\nAnd there was Farrakhan standing right next to them all up to read the Franklin funeral and none of them seem to want to not be in the photo with him and many drive by news organizations crop Farrah Khan out of the photo\nWhen they sent it down their news wires so they know but it's this is the

I got this\nThat's exactly right I was just wondering misses all headed this is all headed toward atheism anti God that's exactly what is a unifying the people on the left whatever they claim a religious views are\nThe trend is towards atheism and no God or at least agnostic because that removes any judgmental ism right it removes any limits on behavioral morality or anything else if there's no ultimate\nPower that can meet out approve or disapprove of ... than one is totally free correct\nAbsolutely\nWell I I just I'm so\nHow this of this event in Pittsburgh given everything else that you say that you are\nThere's all the liberalism to creep in to Judaism and a rising anti Semitism you're right it's it's anti Semitism is rising in Germany and nobody's talking about it is rising throughout Europe and there aren't very many people talking about it so this has been in Pittsburgh did it did it\nAdds to any of the uh discomfort or on the eve you're having about things in general\n[noise] ah I I I don't I don't\nFeel like that there's a million people out there targeting a Jews in a way that they would want to go she'd have to think Iraq I think that that these are isolated is an incident in this country because the country it's so good at that so many people I mean this guy is facing the death penalty he he ... he certainly wouldn't be facing the death penalty\nAnywhere else and I I mean I don't I don't feel unsafe\nAs a person who is Jewish walking down the street because I'm Jewish I and I and I obviously don't think Trump has anything to do with it at that absolutely ridiculous and it's it's not going to make me not vote in the mid term or anything silly like that\nI Am glad used because I'll tell you there's a lot of people that think and they were predominantly ... thank you thank you so much\nRachel I purchased racial Thousand Oaks California [noise] um [noise] I don't think these events are going to have anything to do with the midterms [noise] a lot of people do\nA lot of people think it's going to dampen a turnout what do you think I'm wrong or you\nYeah I don't think it's going to have a thing to do with them in terms like now after Caesar say a dare I say this year I put my hands together and look to the lord and do I say this\nCaesar sidewalk and his pipe bombs none of ...\nWhat do you think the odds are to the drive ... and the Democrats are thinking well I don't have to ask as we know what we had people talking about how that whole thing last week was suppressing turnout remember even Trump alluded to the fact that\nThat story was maybe going to dampen some people's enthusiasm remember that\nOK well there were some people I'm sure not too unhappy about that\n[noise] and then the second event happened on Saturday in Pittsburgh and\nWas the to the people that politically\nA separate thing\nAnd that's the people I'm Talking about and that would be the media and the Americans left ... people politicized and of course you've got extremists out there in in the fringes everywhere who [noise] irrationally try to explain things away\nBut the people at politicize everything who look at both events through a political ...\n\nHad to be thinking are right now this is going to this is going to really help us in the midterms this is going to dampen turns going to dampen enthusiasm for Trump I have\nI have an entirely different it's why I did the show open today that I did I don't think it's going to have that impact on people in fact\nI think the media in their natural state drives more people to Trump each and every day and I think they've been doing it since the Sunday shows yesterday with is\nThe attempt to politicize this the attempt to blame Trump for this\nThey can't help themselves they have spent the past two and a half years trying to get rid of Donald Trump they have thrown everything they know\nEnd of the public domain hoping to influence people to abandon Trump and it hasn't happened to these two events come along and David I this is that this has to be what it is their thinking\nAnd they just can't help themselves they start blaming Trump for the synagogue shooting started\nAsking the president what he's going to do about guns as you have a different view on it as though he somehow responsible and what it does it portrays it gives away the fact that as
