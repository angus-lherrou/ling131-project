Don rollers wrapped it up my mother is gonna be releasing at\nAny moment they're going to be talking it up before the midterms in hopes in the hopes this is what they're hoping they're hoping\nThat the acknowledgement that Mueller's report is done\nWe'll be perceived by voters as the proof that Trump stole the election is imminent that is what they're hoping they're hoping that you and well I don't think they think you're going to fall for it but they are hoping that the great on washed out there\nThe ill educated under educated on educated miss educated are going to believe\nThat it's only a matter of time\nBefore this reporting proving that Trump colluded with Russia and that well then he influenced the way they vote that means they will vote Democrat that's what the effort here is they will create this\nCloud of suspicion this cloud of danger that port handles\nDisaster for Trump they'll reference this each day leading up to the mid term elections\nAnd you'll hear people in the media speculate oh it could be Trump will be removed after the midterms when\nMullet releases this report it could well be Trump's going to have to be removed to report that all of\nThis is going to happen to one degree or another to second thing\n\nThis tells me is that Mahler himself is waving to see who will be running Congress before he decides to\nReally end this because his report goal is to Rosenstein\nWho is technically his bosses at the department of justice and to Congress and there is decided whether or not\nThat it has made public so if the Democrats do when the house\nFor ... and ... when does your support for Trump again\nDuring the campaign OK okay during the\nCampaign one of the reasons that I think\nDuring the primaries are during the day after he won the nomination\nPrimary primary okay against a seven anyway he um [noise] I became a a Trump supporter one degrees is was because she's got to be so good for the country and he is and I'm ashamed that Democrat my whole life\nThat these people aren't happy to see the country doing well that's what amazes me the most I mean I was always brought up the Democrats for fair\nAnd my dad was a Democrat by ... and that they sort of the country\nWhat you thought the Democrats for for the little guy looking out for the little guy in trying to help the little guy make it economically and overcome obstacles Republicans wasn't away\nExactly and so so I'm very proud to be a Trump supporter but I'm about to pack it in I'm going to tell you why frustration is so high\nRight now for not only myself if you put in a neighborhood because she said it before with Stuart gardening\nUm he said the Trump ... and he says is the only reason the only way I can get my message out well his tweets are good but not that many people really here and I can't understand why he does not address the nation I don't understand [noise]\nWait a minute when you say when you say packing it and you mean you're about to abandon from\nThat advantage Trump but I'm really losing a lot of energy in frustration I really am because so many people don't know the good things that are happening they're not gonna learn preaching to the choir which ... most of the time\nAnd the fresh prince ... they skew anyway so if he addresses the nation and he should it should be proud of what he's done this is the greatest time economically that I can never remember I'm sixty six I can never remember anything like this\nIt is amazing in it but you know you said something here very by I Want to I Want to circle back to something you said\nAn observation you've made in the modern day Democratic Party that they don't seem to be happy right now the country's doing well they don't they don't seem to be encouraged or want to be included in it they don't want to even try to get some of the credit\nFor the country doing well in that shock geo right\n[noise] you know not anymore it's a ... year and a half ago but I'm starting to realize they don't care about the country\nThey really don't care about social issues they care about taking this guy doubt who I think the strongest guy since Reagan I've ever seen how we can take each bullets day after day I mean he's just won this guy\nYour frustration is noted and I think it's shared by a lot of people what you're you're really\nYou you made it sound like your frustration is with from because he won't do a national address and try to reach people that his tweets don't read chore audio ... that ... that he doesn't reach but your real frustration of the U.S is with a news media and many people in the same boat\nWho were doing their best to hide all of that and make sure people don't know it's\nIt's a joke amazed the frustration I've never been so frustrated in my life I Can't do it ... me it baffles me out of the country so it was so well and so many people are going to go out and vote and they have no idea they hear it newscast and they\nWell I think you are well why do you think you're one of the few people that led realize how great the country's doing if you think about why why do you think more people have\nListened to you if the reason\nThere but the economy you you said you've never seen anything like this in your life you don't need me to tell you the economy's doing well you see this on your own\nThree point seven unemployment are you kidding me with all the jobs and all of them a wage is going up what am I ever seen anything\nMy point is I think you can be a little confidence that you're not\nAlone in seeing all of this and that more people are aware of it than you may know and of course you could be a it'd be understandable if you fear people don't know the media is doing everything they can hide it or even worse lie about it\nAnd you are of the impression that most people get their knowledge information from the media but\nI think what happened with a lizard Warren here they could not carry this October surprise they could not cover for the fact that she's bogus they used to be able to do that they're not able to there's a reason for that and I think it's also helping get the truth out about Trump's achievement\nTake a break for that has to have much to say you\nShould probably be met for news radio nine Twenty one more time and\nAll right to all of our listeners out there who are aged Seventy

modern day\nAnd it's amazing how honest if he is about what journalism is now this is not about contemporary events there's nothing in this series about Donald Trump or\nTheresa May or anything current in either country it is a modern era I'm generic piece in other words the storylines or all fictional all made up\nAnd it is\nAbout two competing newspapers one of them's big one of them small one of them is very serious take themselves very seriously don't do tabloid anything [noise] don't focus on celebrities the other one is nothing more than\nPure trash and it's the one that wins it's the one with the biggest building is the one with the more employees\nThey're reporters are stars and so forth but you know what this does\nIt's flat out amazing how honest it is\nIn terms of what people who do journalism think its purpose is destroying people\n\nBoth of these papers in this in this miniseries end up targeting the same targets the same powerful people some of them in government some of them out\nOr some of them not but it makes it clear that journalists think their job is to destroy the\nBig people powerful people rich people there\nObviously have to be something they're doing like breaking the rules and there's the gun stitch breaking the rules there has to be something there miss treating people they are sexually abusing people they are stealing from the public Dole they're doing something and the purpose of journalists ... call 'em out\nAnd and and ruin them\nWhich\nMany many years ago when I first began to encounter the media as a target I was never I had a little taste of it when I was in Sacramento\nThere were a couple of reporters at that paper that that that that have me and their crosshairs simply it was it was liberal versus conservatism\nBut I mean I I didn't really get a full dose of it until this program started and I remember sitting talking to some people about it and they said you have to understand what journalism is\nI said you mean the bias well there's that but that it's it's it's more than that it's about ruining people it's about targeting and destroying people how do you think resumes are built\nJournalist ... little medium size markets are small markets don't target somebody and they if they run a profile or or on a piece on somebody\nThat can be made to look accurate that nails them as guilty of this transgression or that transgression particularly against the little people in that report or is going to get noticed and that's how that's how that reporter climbs allowed if you go back to the early days of sixty minutes it was all about that\n\nAnd it remains so today it's just it's it's evolved to adapt to the current climate which the only person they want to destroy the day now is Donald Trump\nAnd any Republican who gets in the way like Brett Kavanaugh it's all about destroying people the thing about this series is it makes no one's about\nIt I I don't recognize the names of the writer or writers I don't recognize the stars I've never seen them in and things for I don't recognize the names of the producers and I haven't taken the time to Google that many of them but I watched\nThis I've seen two episodes so far out of the ...\nAnd I catch myself my mouth is wide open it's agape a couple of times watching this thing at how brave in early on is this is one of the the editor the head of ... of the of the tabloid paper is one of the most is fixable human beings I've ever seen portrayed\nWho is not set up as a criminal who's not establish he he's just too many years and he is totally on affected\nBy life to him\nEverybody's a bad guy you just have to find out why\nHis favorite his philosophy in life\nAnd the waging guides his journalists is the world has no solutions I'll stop what what is that where your world view of the world has no solutions\nAnd he's telling it it's not your job to fix things it's not your job to feel bad about who you destroy it's not your job to try to solve problems because the world is not about solutions it's your job to sell this paper it's your job he one episode\n\nWent to great lengths to show how this this sleaze editor\nWho has some kind of a secret relationship with the prime minister the u._k. no no no no not sexual just that they're that they have some kind of a relationship not pretending like each other but they owe each other from way back before the series began\nAnd the editor\nRanges a cover story about appear to file and then puts a picture of the prime minister on the cover with his his picture only an inch away from the wind Peter filed\nYet the story is not about the prime minister being Pete if I was about somebody else the prime minister is limited and outrage calls the guy in any editor says you don't run me you don't control me and it was a mistake I I'm Sorry well then you wish you want to ... I'm not apologizing for anything you don't like it went with it\nAnd the private ... I didn't want to do the story in the first place I didn't want to pursue the pictures the editor says you did I mean this guy has no empathy or feeling for anybody\nHe doesn't [noise]\nIt's just it's ... it's it's perfect if the kind of personality you wouldn't have to be if your job is destroying people\nNo conscience\nThe belief that everybody is flawed that everybody's a dirt bag that everybody is a rapper ... and at some point their time to be called out is going to happen\n\nDecent nobody's white [laughter] it's\nAnything at this in the eyes of a journalist an editor\n\nNow I imagine real journalistic gotta look at this thing some of them are going to marvel at it and think it's wonderful others are going to have it because it's\nIt exposes too much uh\nPeople who've never had encounters with reporters have never been targets I don't know how they're going to react to it other than the entertained by it it it starts kind of slow but it picks up speed\nOr\nMany of the primary characters are women\n\nThe competing editor of the clean paper the above board paper is a woman who gets out smarter than tricked into not publishing one day because she can't confirmed the pita file story while the other paper puts it on the cover of having confirmed it\nBecause the editor at the other ... doesn't care whether it's true or not whether he calls the guy that was a beat if I'll just get it up there and get it on the newsstands or as the female editor didn't have the guts to Rob it and sell the paper doesn't rot and I'm thinking\nThey obviously you're not worried about the me too movement here\nEver put this thing together so the name of it is press I have no idea it's it's I think it it just completed earring 'cause I've got all six of them so I just competed completed it's um it's run cycle in the u._k. which means it's going to be on Netflix\nAmazon Prime wherever I don't know where it's going to be but it won't be long and if you remember me talking about a year and if you watch these kinds of things\nIt's it's fast it because it's not about politics not a current but it's not about Trump it's not about conservatives liberals any of that [noise] if it's it's bad hit\nEverybody everybody is a ... including the people at the papers\nThe reporters uh\nI I have to admit I was so [noise] anyway here's Donna Brazil now I Would I did not lose my place ... bill hammered a day and they're talking about the blue wave where she thinks we're headed\nAnd remember now this is a woman that used to be one of the head honcho so the DNC the Democratic

rating is better than you think\nSome pull quotes as a matter of fact Trump's approval rating is now higher than are tied with\nThree of the past six presidents at the same point in their first terms he is currently tied with Obama at forty four percent he's above Clinton at forty one percent Reagan at forty two percent at this time in his presidency\nBut there's a broader plus year Democrats in the media keep describing Trump as a\nHugely divisive figure but the polls show that his approval is starting to wind up with previous presidents and what's more Trump's low numbers are almost entirely because Democrats are universally opposed to one\nAnother poll quote at this point in Obama's presidency ten percent of Republicans approved for the job he was doing and that was after the failed pork you it was\nIt was after the signing of Obamacare in after the signing of Dodd Frank another policies highly antagonistic to Republicans Trump on the other hand gets approval from\nOnly five percent of Republicans and that's where it's been throughout his presidency so Republicans in other words were far more forgiving of Obama the Democrats have been a Trump\nSo who actually is being divisive trumpet the GOP or the Democrats who will hate Trump no matter what he does I have to think that the drive\nBy are fully aware of this may not want to admit that Trump's approval numbers really much stronger than it's being reported and is a much higher hears that story certainly you didn't believe it Daily Beast Democrats fear Obama going soft for the midterms\nHe's not out

or Jim off your shoulders [noise] my\nQuestion is a really rather simple one where was this concern for our ambassador and three other men brutally murdered in Benghazi somebody explain that to me you realize how much attention is being paid\nTo what\nHas been confirmed if something happened since this program ... has it been confirmed that shell game was murdered by the Fifteen hit men from Saudi Arabia has it been confirmed not confirmed so much they'll likely or thought to end the story is that\nIt took him seven minutes to die that they dismembered\nHim alive at some point gave him drugs to knock him out\nAnd then they listen to music while they did all this and of course\nUntil I blew up the theory and at the apple watch contain the evidence they ever going to try to make it look like proof existed in the form of audio recordings show ... knew what was in store for him and then he goes apple watching to record this stuff and the somehow is iPhone that\nVery very unlikely because of it being technologically impossible barring a ... just only two exceptions that I Would have a tough time believing shall we even knew to do or how to do\nAll of this concern and remember\nHillary Clinton when repeated questions were asked about how in the world for Americans were allowed to be murdered in ...\nWith no assistance and Hillary Clinton's reaction what difference does it make now she said the frustration is is anybody see a a disparity here in proportion now of course\nWe all understand why the Democrats seriously believe they have a way\nOf blaming Donald Trump for his CNN\nAll afternoon has tried to make it look like the Trump knows the Saudis did it and is trying to provide them cover\nThat's it's despicable graphics that they are using to try to make that case\n\nBut I think there's a lot of a proportionality missing here and again I don't think the media realizes how obvious\nThere's subterfuge is the people now anyway you know every uh every home has a a front door with a lock on it Dr balls the Fords home had to haul two doors did you know that\n\nDr ball the Ford had two doors that something to do with a claustrophobia and fear\n\nAnd handed over to Google employers reading this\nWait a minute was a five hundred square foot place yet to front doors ...\n\nI've ever Google employees going back and I had her own separate front door oh well that's that's a big difference than meeting at four claustrophobia and PC has to be\nLike being afraid Kavanaugh was going to show up at any moment in the last thirty five years well anyway\nEverybody has a home with a front door and the lockout um most people have one front door\nFor some people that's all they need to feel secure for others securing every door and every window is what's important to feel safe in the side\nNow how you go about securing all of those entry points now that's another thing early home security system providers gave you one solution and it was it was fairly expensive\nAnd then simply safe home security came along offering a solution to protect all of your doors and windows in the most effective ways for far less money\nAnd they get that done by using states will be our technology and the systems they make\nThey use ... folks to connect all of these components together the sensors on the doors and windows the age the cameras the motion detectors the glass break sensors all of that they communicate with the primary base station in the house my wife I started the virus drug that is so\nSo important so crucial\nIn making this last complex less of a problem and it makes it much harder to hack it I mean cutting wires is easy but disrupting why fi connections takes a little bit more work\nThey use white flour and they use computer chips in their sensors in an detectors in the age the cameras that come with every system sends signals doors and windows are open\nAnd if you've armed you're simply say system as you've left the home you get a notification when there is activity I e somebody tried to break in or there is a fire or something simply safe pays attention to every detail of their home security system so that when you do the installation it's\nSimple and actually fun to do when you finish\nYou will have an intimate knowledge and awareness of your system it comes pre tested them freaking figured\nAll you have to do is installed or get something that help is no big deal you can do it in less than an hour but don't let that make you believe it's not serious it's deadly serious it is serious serious it is just as
