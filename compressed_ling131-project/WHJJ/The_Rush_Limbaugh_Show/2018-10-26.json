you've been talking about how you don't think there's going to be a red wave\nOr a blue wave I'm Sorry ... and I think I think these folks know that there's no red ... I think they know they're in trouble with these elections I honestly beginning to think that the Republicans are going to gain seats in the house or or you are not nearly going to lose as many as people are thinking they are\n[noise] and I think it's all goes back to what like Jordan saying about that ...\nYou know and this and this whole cover up but if they don't we\nTake that house once the elections are over I think the real investigation is going to move forward on that Feisal document and that the CIA and I think these people are terrified the deep state I mean they cannot let that happen\nAnd I think the I think this package bombs or a means of disrupting these elections to the point where they can then say\nBetween ... between these crazy right these these national right groups planting bombs and the Russians conspiring we cannot legitimize the win in the selection for the for the Republicans and I think they're going to try to throw the whole thing into turmoil I really do\nYou think that as we sit here today the deep state they are going to lose their not an American to win the house back Democrats and the same state thing not going to win the house back not going to win the Senate back\nSo all of this is designed to create so much chaos that whatever the result is if Democrats and the deep state laws as they can say the election invalid too much was

I have compassion for oh people all over the world we live in poverty who live under a horrible condition [laughter]\nBut it it kind of the world's population live on less than ten dollars per day fifty percent but less than two dollars and fifty cents a day so my question is are we obligated to let all of them and to the u._s. um our support them all with us tax dollars and it's not\nHow do we choose who to give the gift of coming into the U.S and she was a trick question\nI'd like to suggest that we have an answer for that and it's called the legal immigration which is the only way to make that choice\nHere here exactly right the way we have always done it\nYou know getting into this country under legal circumstances has always been a privilege it's always been an honor its always required some effort you have to learn about America you you have to want to be an American\nNow as for governor case that I don't think governor Casey was advocating for anybody in poverty around the world being led into America that's not what he was doing\nHe was simply trying to advertise the size of his heart to I think governor case sick is still one of these people that thinks Donald Trump has destroyed the Republican Party and the things governor casing cares about the governor case it once everybody's you know hey you know I saw a big heart\nI look at these people that are down trodden the disadvantages that I still love 'em and I still care about about I don't think all of them and we've got to be able to put ourselves in a\nIn in their shoes and understand he he just want everybody to understand that he is a caring fought for compassionate person as opposed to this bump couldn't he thinks is into the White House\nAnd a cause he clearly not advocating for every one of the lead in the country\nThat's a ... it's not possible number one um and and would never happen so that's not his uh his real objective anyone I'm so glad you called Tammy thank you again have to take a brief time out of time is racing on stick with\nUs all the way we're ready to bring it on a ... fee for nine Twenty one\nHey I'm Brandt so there's this guy didn't Jordan he's a healthy guy he's a dad of six and he works as a guide in Alaska and it goes to the doctor a true story goes to the doctor and he's diagnosed with cancer\nStage four and here's the thing he had switched earlier from medical insurance to met issue here where Christians share each other's medical bills to the question for Jordan and his wife Jenny was is this actually going to work our medical bills\nExceeded a hundred and sixty thousand dollars Medicare members shared all our bells\nAnd it was about more than just the money to this is a real community\nMedicare is is a family a group of people that stick with you to the hardest times of your life I just don't know how I could have done it with a ...\nIt's so worth looking into there's a reason this is growing so fast so if you want to find out more here is a number for you I have a radio apt to win the average\nNews radio nine twenty and one oh four seven ... [noise]\nYes\nYes yes books I'm I'm I'm not just\nMoment I might give I'm collecting some thoughts all share with your mind later on\nNow I\nI don't know that any of my thoughts here a minute thing obviously I'm just sharing with us some of the\nThoughts that I've had that I and I ... process but you know I just didn't work these out when I first started noticing this stuff\nBut let me go to audio somebody's number twenty six we have there there is a CNN sucks\nSticker on this man's [noise] [laughter]\nHe goes to a post office kiosks where there are cameras\nTo mail these these bombs none of them went off\nAnd from what I'm told from reliable law enforcement none of them could help now there's also a story out there that some of them are so unstable that law enforcement Heather detonate them rather than transport them into the FBI lab in Quantico, Virginia you know these watches excuse me so I'm ... I'm OK I'm OK\nI did not fall you know these new watches have fall detectors ...\nMeaning if you fall if the watch the tech ... that you have fallen it will offer to call emergency services for you\nIf you're incapacitated all you have to do is do nothing if you do nothing after a certain number of seconds passed it'll\nCall us a call nine one one where you are it also gives you the opportunity so no I didn't fall I'm fine I'm OK this thing goes off on me twice the show while I'm sitting here\nMy wild ... just ... my expression field manner of speaking is drinking my watch triggering my watch into thinking that I Am fall and and I can't get up\nIt starts vibrating no you know what this is a great health featured that a lot of people are buying this watch for grandma and grandpa because it does it work they've ... they've tested this watch on Hollywood stumped actors\nAnd stunt men and women and it works but it's also it shows it nothing wrong with is comes back with false positives\nBut I'm my my hands on even hit the table at ... just wildly just sticky waiting around to her in my fall alert has been triggered him to watch that's what just interrupt me but my my point is it this guy here\nHas been screaming notice me and now here comes Dana Bash from CNN justice after the CNN sucks sticker on this man [noise] CNN sucks [noise] here we go\nThat image than in fact the president in Iraq that he's not\nTechnically of responsible for that but he is responsible for not just allowing the cat than south at his rallies joking\nMaking clear that he likes and all you need is one forgive me crock pot\nAnd we've been saying this for ten years\nOne may have emerged and fatter danger and that is a reason why leadership is the way it is and you can have an enemy you can have a political discussion you can have political discourse but when you've crossed the line\nIt is extremely dangerous and that has what has been shying away mission and everything we've heard from anybody at the White House\nOkay so in CNN's as that's Trump's van and its Trump's bombs\nAnd you know in a in a vacuum and in a narrow world what Dana Bash just sent here would be perfectly fine\nBut the thing that really irritates me about CNN and the rest of these people in the leftist ... is that they permit themselves to say all of these incendiary things about anybody they want\nThey permit themselves to attack the character and the intentions and the decency and the honesty of any of their targets\nAnd they can call every president Hitler like they did George W. Bush like they do Donald Trump\nThey can accuse these people have some of the most outrageous things in the world and of course there's never any danger that at one of their crackpot viewers is going to take action except the theory is\nCrackpot CNN viewers shut up a Republican baseball practice crackpot CNN viewers storm buildings where there are Family Research council members and think about\nLetting loose with gunfire\nWe have example after example\nOf attempt in violence against conservatives and right when he was in fact one of the one of the central elements of Democrats strategy in this campaign is the public threatening and the public bullying and the public harassment\nOf Republican elected officials in restaurants in public places\nAnd these are genuinely for ... ... people and they are confronting people and demanding that they leave and and there's not there's never any condemnation of ... you never hear CNN can damning any of this\nKind of behavior they chalk it up well you know this is what Donald Trump has Raj this is what Donald Trump's presidency is meant there says what Donald Trump is doing to people he's making them insanity is creating all that so it's it's a one way street with these people\n\nAnd I believe Donald Trump is reacting by the way\nCNN starts this with their unfair bias coverage and unlike other Republicans who just sit there and take it\nAnd ... the stuff well this is politics you know it's hard wall you got to be able to take it and I'm sure that people are seeing her find people's data that Trump fires back at them\nAnd that's what hasn't been done before Trump fires back at him and a lot of Republicans are very excited about this fighting back because for ... for too many years we've had to sit here and watch powerless\nLay as CNN and others in the media have taken potshots at us and our issues they have lied about the misstated the miss characterize them they attempted to impugn the character in honor of conservative people\nSpokesman policy people and so forth now all of a sudden\nAn actual Republican get shot by a gun and a bullet there is no ringing of hands over what's happening to our politics because the shooter was a Bernie Sanders supporter\nSo a chalk up where of course yeah I was ah mentally unstable Trump wouldn't do that to anybody waste comes down to Trump\nA lot of people separate Russia or something like two wrongs make a ... I'm not talking about two wrongs make a right I'm simply ... and I'm Talking about who started it I'm Talking about these people that want to sit here and a high judgment over everybody else while exempting themselves\n\nWhereas they said Donald Trump is perfectly capable and responsible for any behavior on the part of his supporters CNN is it they're not responsible for how many of their viewers act or how any of the people on their side of the ... act\nAnd then there's this demand that they have for insulation\nAnd to be exam from having any impact on people that frankly offends me\nBut this man I mean if you [laughter] if you wanted to decorate\nIn dress up a van that says noticed may and if you wanted everybody in the world to know that you are a Trump supporter who is unstable and a little over the top are major over to stop this is what you would do\nSo my two cents for now here's President Trump at the White House today as he convened a meeting black Leadership Conference\nA young black leaders from all over the country this was not been\nDone before in in this in this manner\n[noise] uh [noise] and he's talking about the arrest in these bombs here\nI'd like to begin today's remarks by providing an update on the packages and devices that had been male too high profile figures throughout our country\nBand a media organization I Am pleased to inform you that law enforcement has apprehended the suspect and taken him into custody\n[laughter]\nJob by law for us we've carried out a far reaching federal state and local investigation find the person or persons responsible for these events these terrorizing acts are despicable and have no place in our country\nNow I wanted one can remind you of Trump pacing if if if you think Trump is not as on the point is your\nBaby or selling out just hang on I Want to remind you of Trump's first reaction after ... forge showed up\nAt the ... at the Senate Judiciary hearing what a Trump say I've found her very credible I really hope that she continues to testify I think if what happened or happen in Kevin are maybe ... that's what he said at the beginning and he did it\nCalling for unity when he is responsible for all of the\nChaos and division they will say that Trump was on believe all bleed brazen for talking about this is if he's not complicit they'll rip him for acting like he had nothing
