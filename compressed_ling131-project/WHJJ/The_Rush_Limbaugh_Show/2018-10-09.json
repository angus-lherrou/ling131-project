dispirited by this because it's it's a if it's CNN\nBut on the generic ballot in the CNN poll individual congressional races are tightening Republicans are gaining ground in their generic Paul the Democrat advantages widening now to\nPlus Thirteen that I I just I maybe it's my desire maybe it's my home but I just doesn't make any sense that the generic ballot would be plus and the west the sample is so warped\nAnd so out of kilter and out of balance that it makes sense that way\nI just I I find it really hard to believe\nThat after the last two to four weeks a majority of Americans Thirteen percent want the Democrats to start taking over Congress the house representatives\nI Know what drives a lot of that is the formula\nThat the first midterm elections after a new president is sworn in the president's party takes it on the ... this is standard operating procedure it's been proven\nIn Ninety percent of auto elections there are exceptions to it I think Nineteen Ninety six was an election certainly to the exception two thousand two as well\nBut I don't I don't look at what's going on here the last two weeks especially I and even the last four I don't see where there's this massive realization that the Democrats are the answer to what ails America\nNow the dry and buys want everybody to see it that way so they report it that way in their generic polled the Democrats have their back to a plus Thirteen margin advantage but then you\nLook at individual racism and nowhere near a Democrat Thirteen points up [noise]\nAnd then it elsewhere in their poll Trump's approval rating has gone up since the Kavanaugh's confirmation fight came to a conclusion with independents disapproving of the Democrats' handling of the capital nomination by twenty eight point margin\n\nEven though the Democrats on the surface was seemed to have public opinion on their son\n... says the Washington Examiner just thirty six percent approved of how they handle the nomination compared to fifty six percent who disapproved\nA further breakdown finds that fifty eight percent of independence disapproved of the way Democrats handled everything compare to thirty percent who approved other\nIndependence also disapproved of Republicans handling of the matter but by and narrower fifty three of the thirty two percent [noise] so what does that mean independents disapproving everybody did it\nYou know big ... [noise] I\nCan't prove anything all I have to go on a experience\nGuided by intelligence and intelligence guided by experience an instinct\nI just I don't I everybody believes this\nBlue wave it doesn't matter where you go every story that drudge for example links links to on his page\nIs a story of the Democrats with a massive landslide retaking the house of representatives and there are stories\n\nWhere Republicans supposedly think the same thing is going to happen\nCertainly you you've talked to swamp dwellers you I mean you do hear from a lot of Republicans who think their toast big march you do you think they're toast big margin toast in the house of representatives\nWell what I Know what what what what [noise] ... well\nYeah I'd like to get an individual polls show nine percent in nine seed advantage even after the worst happens all that that's getting into the into the militia I'm I'm just talking about over all the national\nAttitude um and I look I'll be honest I'm always having to dial myself back um I I'm One of these people you probably are too I'm On these people are thinking everybody agreed with me we would have the best country in the history of countries\nIf everybody looked at life the way I Do and looked at other people a way I Do it looked at issues of everybody looked at America the way I Do nobody would ever stop it\nAnd I'm sure you feel that way now and then but we have to temper that with the reality is is a lot of loony tunes out they're incapable of seeing the country the way we do\nFor a host of reasons heavier heard ladies and gentleman that the Clintons are going to start a massive stadium tour\nBill and Hillary won again in want to get in on all of this Trump action\n\nNow I I'm I've been wondering how long it was going to be until somebody in the Democratic party cried\nThis Trump's rallies dating back to the two thousand sixteen campaign and do not doubt me on this either the Democrats in the media publicly acted on concerned on interest in\nAnd would always say a variation of you can't judge voter interest on the basis or rallies can't predict how people are going to vote simply because of the size of crowds at political rallies\nThese Trump rallies are not telling us that anything does it mean anything he's heard just rabbit people upset with their lives and they think Trump is going to kick all the people out of the country they don't like it's not that it's not anywhere near representative\nOf the population is is what they all said that every Trump rally\nPrivately\nDo not doubt me privately they were jealous if they could be and they were the thing because\nThere's not one of them on the Democratic side who could come anywhere close to ... that kind of excitement that kind of loyalty and knows sized crowds\nObama couldn't do it not in two thousand sixteen Hillary couldn't do it ever but certainly not in two thousand she couldn't she couldn't she couldn't draw flies to her book signing ceremonies\nHillary Clinton who couldn't draw a crowd any weren't good people knew she might not be able to stand up for a full twenty five minutes\nWithout some ain't coming out the proper up by the elbows but\nSeriously I guarantee you they were looking at those crowds they were looking for those Trump rallies and they would never say so publicly but they were scared to death by them they would never say so publicly they would never admit it publicly they would say just the opposite but they're human\nBeings in any kind any any time anybody in politics has that kind of popularity and that kinda\nThey don't need that equals jealousy envy and anger and all things that attached to jealousy and that'd be they have the Trump to begin with and the fact that Trump was turning everything they believed it upside down the fact that Trump was being able to accomplish things they couldn't\nJust in terms of average Americans being interested in the campaign interested in the Kansas City and those rallies twenty thousand Fifteen twenty five thousand as many people lined up outside who couldn't get in wanted to get in\nTrouble with his airplane perfectly place so that Trump in giant letters and the fuselage was behind him at every stop when he made his speech except for those events that took place inside actual arenas [noise] so I\nI've been wondering how long it's\nGoing to be before somebody on the Democrats' side tries to get in on this action and I always thought you know who I thought it would be that would make the first Abbott trying it Joe Biden I really thought that Joe Biden would be the first guy to try to replicate this\nThen I thought maybe Michelle my bell or bond that but then I thought no they've got too much to lose if it doesn't work\n\nMaybe Kamala Harris maybe some of these ... somebody's going to do this somebody's got to try if they've got\nTo be able to show the Democrats thinking they've got to show that there's as much excitement as much loyalty as much attention as Trump and draw up till now nobody on the Democrats' side has even given it\nA prayer until the Clintons\nThe daily wire has the story Washington Power

Michelle my bell yeah\nIf the Democrats do not retake the house\nI think\nWashington may be on the inhabitable for a while I I think we haven't seen the meltdown\nThat is going to happen among many elected Democrats the charges of a rigged election of Russian interference that Trump did it again um anything they can come they are ... so certain they're going to win this\nThey've already banked

two hundred nine seats familiar\nDemocrats I'm exist if the Democrats [laughter] nine seats\nWith this this is a white by the Republican Party would have to be a party of for this to happen a party of

there's gonna be an Alan ... sanity anywhere to be found on the Democratic side of the aisle or in the media\nTo hundred nine seats firmly or leaning\nIn the Democratic column let me ask you a question what could be causing this let's let's assume for a moment just as a as a hypothetical exercise let's assume this is true\nCan you tell me what it is\nAnything one thing a series of things that have American voters [noise] so so ticked off at Republicans that they cannot wait to go out and vote Democrat\nSo that the Democrats run the house what is it what have the Republicans done or not done that would warrant this kind of nationwide this ... with the party\nNow the left will tell you the answer to that question is Trump that the people of this country despise Donald Trump as a people in this country have been poised to send Trump packing ever since the election\nNight to thousands sixteen they can't wait to get out there and showed their ... for Trump and the only way they can do it has to vote against Republicans\nAll right well\nAs I say we're hypothetically pretending this is true what has Trump done to generate that kind\nOf disgust other than be alive and be president what has he done no no I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm being serious what you want it\nAll started when he said he separated families at the border I'm Glad you reminded me of that\nIt's getting harder and harder to watch television shows what was I watching me or you know this this last week was premier awake for all the new network prime time shows I think it was law and order in yeah law and order and you're SUV or something and and\nUh the show started out focusing on a bad guy who had little kids in his basement in a cage and the FDU\nCops are running around trying to prove this guy is

you don't drive around and yellow cabs\n[noise] you have a car service a limo and drivers why anyway she asserts that happen in a cab that John Powell tried to sexually assault you in the back of the tax that\nYou didn't come forward them and you didn't come forward when the senator was nominated for ... that's what it was they nominated\nThe guy for secretary of defense and that's when all this

ran out and gotten a cab and he came out and jumped in the cabin jumped on top of me and basically he tried to it and the and the poor cab driver was desperate 'cause I was screaming and pounding at and senator stop and\nI was living at Fort Myer Virginia where my father was ... he was in general and the army at the time and a cab driver would lie about Ninety miles an hour because he realized what was happening in the back of the carbon screech to a halt in front of our corners and I think\nAnd the tower got scared because he thought maybe the general would come out with a shotgun but I went in the house that night I cried all night long I was absolutely traumatized I never tell my parents are very until much later several years later because I was so ashamed and so guilty\nSo Sally
