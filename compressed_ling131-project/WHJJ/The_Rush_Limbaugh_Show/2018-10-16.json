there's a good news scenario here that is that rates are up and investments are up so that obligation looks more attractive less burdensome\nIn a weird way that actually increases the chance that they'll get out of it and the ... the reason I say that is they have the ability to offload this liability to insurance companies who will assume that liability at a cost\nThe nice thing for people who were corporations is it's now an attractive time to do that\nSo they're in a position to be able to unload these full responsibilities off to insurance companies who are actually finding them

alongside with them and if they set their their crosshairs somebody there as good as gone Oregon damaged beyond repair they haven't lay the glove on Donald Trump\nThey're running out of weapons and then the process of running out of weapons they're losing their minds they're losing their rational sanity I Believe and this latest debacle over Kavanaugh\nDon't doubt for a minute that this thing was orchestrated unplanned from the get go as a late breaking\nUse only if necessary event they didn't leave with this because they knew it was Clinton say they didn't lead with it because they knew they couldn't prove it they didn't leave with and it was it a central part of a Kavanaugh hearings because they knew there wasn't any evidence for it and they knew that ball the foreign could not pull this off under pressure\n\nI'm Still shocked and balls he showed up to testify I I think that took everything they had to persuade her to get there 'cause I don't think she ever intend to do and I don't think when they pitched her on this whole thing was ever partner plan that she would ever actually have to testify\nAnd does anybody believe that uh fifty one every year old woman literally

to you like he's in perpetual fear of being hit or damaged or harmed her yelled out or whatever\n[noise] ah anyway the point is none of it has worked and by work I mean do two things the the\nReal objective from the get go from all of this the cleanest way for this to have happen would have been able to turn the American people particularly Trump voters against him if they had been able to do that get Trump's approval numbers ... to the thirties then to the twenties then they could get rid of him\nThey failed at that all they did with cement Trump's supporters to him even more firmly\nAnd then the process Kavanaugh saying they actually turn some people who are sympathetic to them and the Trump supporters because people in the same portion of this country simply do not feel comfortable with watching\nThe most powerful apparatus of government unified at a line and for the purpose of destroying a human being and a life when there isn't any evidence\nThat one of them are at such a thing but the Democrats get care that there wasn't any evidence because they never have any\nThey always rely on the seriousness of the charge\nWorking with the media to create a daily image that whoever the Democrats are targeting is worse\nThan poison and must be dealt with as though he or she is poison well none of it has worked\nAnd even in their own post Trump's approval numbers hover in the mid forties Rasmussen Trump's at fifty one\nThey see the\nApproval numbers for Trump of the African American community they see the economy they ...\nI I'm telling you that they are teetering on the brink\nOf being hold it altogether being able to hold it altogether and it's\nIn this universe framework contacts I just I don't see this massive blue wave that they do and I'm not sure they even see it and if you're hoping I think it's a birthright to them it's the way things ought to be should be [noise]\nAnd I got to do everything they can to make it reality but these are massive elections all over the country and it's going to be a challenge for him [noise]\nWe'll see I mean look it's possible that I I'm like Nate Silver I have no idea what's going to happen only difference between that silver and me is that I make no pretense of knowing\nWhat's going to happen all I'm doing with you today is sharing how I break this down using common sense\nI've got\n... two thousand twelve to six years of on the ground actual experience of Democrats losing elections of people turning against the Democrats having fewer seats electoral seats in Washington\nThan they've had since the Nineteen twenties and I don't see anything is going to reverse that Iraq who's saying oh\nSinglehandedly made this happen for rock Obama's presidency is what turned to people against the Democratic party\nAnd it was based on substance because Obama was a likeable guy and he was African American in check off a box I'm not racist look at this I voted for Obama instill when people had the chance they voted against every aspect to the Obama agenda they could\n\nWhereas Obama by the white campaigning for all these Democrats trying to retake the house and Senate\nWhere is the worst plugs\nBeto O'Rourke

interrogation and murder\nBecause Joe ... show he was wearing an apple watch his\nFiance was outside in the family said Dan she had his iPhone in the family sedan that she had instructions to call\nA man I've got his name here I'm not going to bottom look ended up she adds instructions to call somebody didn't come back out he was going to get you know divorce officially recognize so it can marry they fiance that it's waiting outside in the family's ... and she had instructions to identify mutual friend if he didn't emerge meaning he thought\nHe was lord in there he bought something could happen are reporting that he'll sample watch\nWas recording everything that happened functions not possible in the first place an apple watch is a slave to the phone\nAnd\nApple does and even if if the show me how to know watch the series for what she didn't because it hasn't been out long enough\nBut even if he did if he if he bought it in the United states and had it it's still not capable of L T E operation in Turkey apple has not yet brought\nL T eve service to the to the I watch the apple watch in Turkey which means that there is no way his watch could have worked independently of his phone\nNow there is an app there are a number of apps\nOne of the best ones is called just press record and on your watch is just a giant red button than you press it and it starts voice recording and it ends up saving the recording on your paired iPhone but the phone has to be within range\nAnd I'm I'm here to tell you with the fiance and the iPhone in the car outside of the concept was no way\nYou know\nIts its maximum twenty yards blow to that that connects watches to phones twenty yards twenty five hours I'm from that I got a golf course when I lose the range of phone stops talking to the watched\nIt's maybe twenty or twenty five yards at most lowest be Seventy five feet on the tops on the outside sixty feet more like if there is no way his watch\nWas recording anything and transmitting it anywhere so there there can't be a recording of what happened to it besides that the Saudis would have seen the watched by taking it off\nA and they would have needed the fiance is iPhone to find out what was on it\n\nThe watch is still not an independent piece attack even watches that can operate under LT they still needs to be fair to the phone [laughter] there's not enough storage capacity on the watch to store the data of a recording it doesn't start at you can store I think up to a\nHundred songs maybe more now but for the most part that has to stream them it's not an independent device although there probably is no evidence on the guys watch or even on the phone\nIt well the [noise] except for his heartbeat stopping not even that the phone will still have to be at some point put back in ranging connected to the fun to watch wouldn't need to be back into close proximity of the phone\nFor his heart rate data to show up on the phone\nIt's simply ... it's simply not possible what they're saying the way they're saying it it's not\nPossible to watch is not independently capable of doing what they're reporting it needs an iPhone and and to remain paired to the iPhone you can't be more than I Wish I knew this exactly I'm I'm I Know when I lose my connection when I'm On the golf course and it's\n[noise] thirty yards Ninety feet at the tops tops and this guy had walls to deal with inside the consulate or he couldn't have been that close to the phone which is in the car the family said Dan\nWith the with the fiance now uh [noise] I've got the audio here of James okay if a secret audio taking enough Claire McCaskill and her campaign aide Rob bills\nI this is this is important\nBecause there's no it's just not being reported in Missouri\nWhich is Claire McCaskill state it also happens to be my home state but what we did hear we went and we did a Google Search\nFor new laws of the secret video from project maritime Claire McCaskill and we wanted to see where this\nParents' House news have been reported so we got Washington Times the Daily Caller Daley wire Russia Today a PJ medium Breitbart News in oak cure report but there's no way piece here\nOr there is no New York times here there is no St Louis Post Dispatch here there is no Saint Louis globe Democrat her even though they know publisher and fifty years there's no Saint Louis penny saver here\nThere's no Saint Louis TV station mentioned I don't know about Kim election St Louis but we're covering that by me doing it now\nUm there's nothing in Yahoo News nothing\nNot one drive by Oregon mainstream media outlets shows up\nIn a Google Search when you Google Claire McCaskill and project ferrets us every site running this would be\nA conservative side or a conservative bloc there's not one mention of St Louis papers at TV stations here\nAnd what it basically is is McCaskill recorded on secret video admitting that she cannot tell Missouri voters and the truth what she really thinks about things like gun control because she might not get elected\nWe can't\nOpenly said that says whatever age we got to soundbites here the first one is McCaskill herself and her staff talking to the on identified project beret toss secret journalist and in this particular soundbites Senator McCaskill\nAre talking about it and the project maritime secret journalist are talking about
