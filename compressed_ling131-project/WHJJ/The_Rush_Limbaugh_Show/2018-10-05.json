Roberts has put out there playing off and they're not saying that this is too often that the decline of beer and wine and other alcoholic beverages because that business is doing quite well for the constellation go corona investment your sales rep eleven percent and the last quarter nothing to he's that there\nWill ... and beyond just the the big brands I think that a lotta people are familiar with constellation also has been over the last five years investing in a number of different craft brands most notably ... point where I think they spent a billion dollars to buy him a few years back and and that turns out that hey that's been a pretty good move for them given where beer taster going in the u._s.\nYeah definitely I think that has been a smart move you've seen other big beer companies most notably a\nAb endeavor ... making a significant investment and color you want ... microbrewers uh but uh I think the case of a constellation ... you know adding the craft element to the corona ... which are\n... brands that actually are still growing in uh in the U. S. wild I think there's been a lot of talk about a backlash to big beer where there's been some sluggish bales of some of the more well known not most recognizable for has like a like wiser and die and Coors Light\nThat hasn't really been something that's hurting or corona at all\n[noise] for good Paul what's your vote will catch up with the next week and joined the weekend thank you very much you two\nPolar Monica from CNN a scene in business the brand new name by the way check out the Web site this morning actually pretty good they got some good stuff on their whole Monica from CNN Business talking about constellation brands are and where they go from here let's talk about where\n... Iranian oil is potentially going from here ... Europe and this is a story out of the New York times Europe apparently is working to try to figure out a way to actually have ... these new sanctions that the u._s. is gonna be putting back on Iran in the near future ... what are you making this Mike\nI'm what I make of it is the Europeans are desperate to keep this deal that they fought foreign place um but it's likely not going to work so what their trials tell them that\nIt's very very difficult to move money between countries without a bank involved it's incredibly difficult ... you're subject to\nYou know massive a risk by not using a world wide bank and uh if they do use worldwide back then the u._s. is going to hit that bank was ...\nI think you also have a tough time convincing big companies to go do any business in Iran right now\nLike ... for instance ... oil company had a bunch of plans to go invest in Iran US actions flip back and they said yeah you know what I Know this isn't a French law\nBut if we do this we're not going to do any business the United states that and we're going to get crushed and so it makes no sense but I think any large company is going to shy away from doing any business with Iran so long as you say US sanctions are in place\nI think what we're seeing right here is the tip of the iceberg as far as\nUh the push for a number of countries to move away from the u._s. dollar we've seen obviously China Russia and Iran\nAre talking about doing so and I think the fact that Europe is sitting here saying\nThe most important thing to us is being able to get you know our energy needs ... rather than where that comes from and I think that's the message that they are largely sending here now\nAs you said it remains to be seen whether or not they actually go through with this but the fact that the discussions are taking place signals dummy hey look they're willing to at least consider a world where they don't necessarily use the dollar as the primary means just conducting\nInternational ... that would be very concerning the Europeans teamed up with say China to allow the Chinese currency to be the one traded in Iran or\nForward you know for the barrels of oil that are moving out of that country that would be ... and important first step it wouldn't be significant to the impact the dollar but it'd be an important symbolic first step\n[noise] this is something again I've been harping on this for the last year so\nThis is something pay attention to this\nBecause what this means when it's all said and done the reason why the u._s. is able to finance the deficits are the reason why the u._s. has been able to finance it's growing deficits over the last thirty to forty years\nIsn't because US citizens went and started buying up more U.S debt yup it's because internationally Europe China India all those other countries said yeah this makes sense will continue buying this up in in funding your deficits\nAs of the last three years that's effectively stop there not buying any more ... basis ... and so if you see a further push away from the dollar what that potentially means is then it becomes incumbent on us to finance our deficit internally\nWhich we've never really wanted to do we've never really had a huge appetite for it because quite frankly like it's it's not good to do that like ... crowds out other spending another\nUh other winning that you would potentially be doing\nSo this is something to watch okay not so much because of what it means in this specific instance but because of what it could potentially signal as a big shift over the next several years you're still keep the story in mind uh Mike you've got\nThree young daughters now sure do two of them just north of two years old and we've got senators now calling for a federal investigation of children's ... as to whether or not ah these apps are misleading by misleading parents by labeling the ... child friendly they are your thoughts on this because you know way more about this than\nI Do I mean the basic story here is that there's a bunch of free apps both the Android Amazon and apple stores that are collecting way too much information on children and while that may be okay for an Eighteen year old\n... nothing should be collecting location data phone numbers or or email addresses\nFor five and six year old set that ... can be a very clear red line that shouldn't be crossed and uh it sounds like there may be existing laws on the books here that are being broken and ... may seem like there needs to be new laws put into place but specifically location data and children is not something that I feel it'd be shared\nCreepy right yeah and ... little creepy I mean incredibly creepy\nNow that said shame on parents who are allowing that to happen [noise]\nAgreed I can agree with that that ... do your research on what you're letting your kids do and how you're letting them do it but in this day and age the the companies are at

it meant was taking on issues like climate change and health\nCare for everybody and all this transform America but what they really want to do with transform America away from\nOur unique founding converted to a socialist democracy some of the radicals even want to go further and and and have this country become totally communist back\nLooking there's a poll out here today this from the Daily

on the grounds as to what you see [noise]\nEven though it may be anecdotal evidence indicates that a lot of them have fallen for this millennial men were far more likely to identify a some kind of socialist than women a total of forty percent responding affirmative late to the question now how would that help can that be\n'cause there's one thing there's something just doesn't jibe with socialism you know what it is self reliance\nSelf reliant taking yourself seriously standing up for yourself believing in yourself relying on yourself\nBeing a man just does not jibe with socialism socialism does not work well with self reliant people socialism and communism attempt to our race self reliant people self reliant people people that do not need\nDo not depend on anybody but themselves their immediate circle are huge threat to social is in Congress or how the hell is this happened\nHow is it forty percent of millennials men have become socialist more than women it ought to be the exact opposite\n\nWell hello modern era feminism\nWhich has had as one of its targets but the masculine as they should have men and they've been very open and honest about that they've even

over the Democratic National Committee and in various Senate offices and offices of Congress members of the house and so forth heat up I've never seen this before I've never seen these guys on our side call out the Democrats like this\nI may have to be tied now I think I have something that might relate to it\nI got an email last night from Salinas Ito who has made a name for herself\nBy traveling through all of these blue states during the election campaigns season of two thousand sixteen she went through all of these places in blue states that were going to vote for Trump and she learned anything about these people she could\nShe took them seriously\nShe went and met them and talk to them learn about them nobody else in the drive by media has done anything like this\nBut she wanted to find out who they are she lives in Pittsburgh she had a sense that something was happening out there that the Washington establishment didn't see and rather than gas she actually wanted to find out who these people are she went to a lot of small towns\nMedium sized town spent serious time they're getting to know these people she has stayed in touch with them ever since the election she has written a book about it if the Democrats in the media wanted to know who they voted for Donald Trump all they'd have to do is go get her book they haven't they don't read it they don't care to know who the Trump voters are\nThey're not interested in appealing to them they're trying to find out ways to make Trump voters irrelevant or keep them away from the polls they want to separate Trump and his voters from themselves but they're not interested in finding out who they are so as to maybe convert them\nTo uh never Trump or is there an about Trump presents an amazing display of arrogance\nAnd by the way the same can be said of Republican political consultant so they don't care who the Trump voters are all that matters is that they are laughed at him ... made fun of so I get a note from last night\nAnd she is\nExplaining to me what the camping on hearings have meant\nAnd what has happened out there in these areas she has studied\nAnd she made essentially two points\n\nOne that something has needed to happen after the two thousand sixteen election to keep the coalition that voted for Trump to gather\nNow a lot of us of assumed\nThat if people voted for Trump in two thousand six day that they did sell for very specific reasons among them Trump is alone in fighting the Washington establishment that Trump is alone in in in pushing back against Democrats and the so called Washington conventional wisdom\nAnd then the assumption is that if people knew that in two thousand six game that they would not forget that and if they would realize the need to continue\nTo vote in ways that would continue to support and unable Trump to be successful and she makes the point that it doesn't work that way sadly\nThat after a single election with the non result something needs to happen besides just another reflection of party members or Trump is not on the ballot something needs to happen to make those people as eager to vote two years later as they did in two thousand sixteen\nAnd that\nIs the Kavanaugh circumstance in her mind the conservative populists coalition\nThat elected Trump needed something outside of Trump to coalesce around in the midterms in other words in her study of things\nFord didn't write the letter Ford would know that we wouldn't Kaiser would presumably now that we wouldn't Kaiser is not a man\n\nIf we can Kaiser is one of ... for

four witnesses that could have supported\nThe final votes effect as Mara oh afternoon\nTwenty and one on one\nHand [noise]\n\nSaga continues [noise]\nOkay to review and heard a letter to Feinstein balls the Ford reverse are best friends leave when Kaiser is a he falls they forge best friend is a woman boldly Ford will notice\nSo if we win Kaiser's referred to as he he and the letter it's logical to conclude in Boise for getting write a letter\nOkay well then who might have helped her well that would be Monica McQueen whose home ... was in robots Delaware at the time the letter was written McQueen former FBI spokesperson also worked for ...\nThe reason I'm going through all this is ... ... Ford is is using people that are tired and wings ... hip and the heart and the brain to Democratic Party activism from the FBI to the department of justice to the Senate Judiciary committee\nNow Monica McLean warrior happens to be a guy named David Wasserman according to the Washington Post David Wasserman helped oversee the investigation of Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server\nProblem which she was exonerated\n... also helped oversee the Russian interference in the Trump election or campaign in two thousand six neat\nSo how is it that ball the Ford ends up in the home\nOf a woman who's tied to the D. O. J. and the FBI\nAnd characters who weren't involved in the Hillary Clinton email investigation and the Trump Russia collusion investigation how does that happen\nIf you're just a woman out in Santa Cruz or Paolo Alto and you'll see that Brett Kavanaugh has been nominated to be on the Supreme Court\nAnd you don't think you should be because you think one time he\nAttacked you you send a letter to Dianne Feinstein to the next thing you know\nWell no no no that's used and find signed a letter after traveling to Delaware to meet with your buddy Monica McClain who probably writes the letter for you because of the inclusion of Cleveland Kaiser as a he is not a woman which she is\nSo you're just you're a beach ... a psychology professor whatever from California and you end up writing a letter after traveling to Delaware after saying you're afraid of flying\nAnd their lawyers don't tells you that the committee is willing to fly out to California to interview you\nI I I Want I didn't know I I didn't know you were ... I ... I was ... you know my home if you\nHad ... I don't even think I buy\nYes they she didn't want them to come out there because she was going to go to Delaware to meet with McLean she doesn't want the committee seeing who she was meeting with\n\nThis whole thing required her to come to Washington for this to\nPull off she had become to Washington\nSo we look at Hillary Clinton's email server investigation and the Trump Russia collusion or what do we find a woman who happens to be helping balls the foreign defeat Brett Kavanaugh and his nomination to the Supreme Court\nWith every Democrat staying\nMinutes of Kevin are being nominated they're going to oppose them\nWhen every Democrats that they believe her even though she doesn't have any evidence in time magazine just put her on the cover\nNew covered time magazine was was a gift like ... a lasting she's she's she's seen taking meals um [noise] it's pathetic\nThis whole thing is going to set up is my point and the people that set it up are the same people that have been running the silence coups against Donald Trump\n\nAnd every Democrat on the Senate Judiciary committee knows everything I just told you but rather than it'd be a problem they're telling themselves how well organized they are and how brilliantly they pull this off in their world\nThey've made the American people really believe that this woman was minding your own business one day when she was Fifteen and this nominee to the court came and brutalized her\nAnd she's just a woman [noise] the teacher\nLike your children and it's terrifying we hear [laughter]\n\nThat's what a masterful way pulled off we got everybody in this country thinking hey but summing it didn't happen did that we have nothing to do with it when this whole thing is an orchestrated screenplay\nAnd that's why ... won't turn over any of the cycle the therapy Emily a polygraph information for the Judiciary Committee to look at\nAnd the Republicans notice too but the power of the Democrats look at the Republicans that are quivering and a little afraid to go ahead and can confirm Kavanaugh\nThis democratic machine is a scary scary bunch Democrat machine includes the media and all of these\nWhen you put a safe in your home what will you put in it\nWhat are your most valuable possessions well there's just one random safe you should trust to put in your home and that's right oh saves\nThe craftsmanship of their iron works apes which are made in America one of the main issue it takes skills swept and talent to produce the most beautiful and secure or safe in the world and that's what rhino saves are\nBeautiful creation as that help keep your possessions secured part art part furniture and one hundred percent security rhino saves are built to protect you and your family from the uncertainties of this world now\nHow do you get your own rhino metal safe well check out their extensive dealer network on line at rhino safe dot com veteran own didn't veteran operated for over Twenty years that's our H.

saying that our minds not made up\n\nThe link is a Reuters story and it says essentially Murkowski has not\nMade a final decision\nYou could have fooled me it sounded awfully final to me this morning when I read that\nBrett Kavanaugh is not the right man for the Senate right now\nNow she's saying it's not her final decision something is happening in that regard [noise] here Kimberly ... tweets

Republican Alaska voted to legitimize and sign off on\nThe most ... pick a boat tactics ever in the Supreme Court nomination Lisa Murkowski Republican Alaska voting today just stand with Diane Feinstein\nCory Booker Kamala Harris to leave judge Brett Kavanaugh's subject to claims of perjury and the impeachment which they're going to pursue by the way [noise] [noise] oh yeah or\nDoing [noise] [noise] so the other interesting thing had let her do develop it here but hang on just second here's a second tweet from Kimberly stress all\nLisa Murkowski Republican Alaska\nToday voted to abandon due process and the presumption of innocence she voted to potentially if the Supreme Court and a four Ford that block which puts loaning Ninth Circuit court of appeals in control of everything that matters to Alaska her state\nDevelopment property rights gun rights environmental rules Lisa Murkowski has made quite the statement\n\nThese are two devastating tweets as they are right on the money legitimizing and signing off on the most is fixable tactics ever standing with Feinstein Cory Booker Kamala Harris who is in a class by herself\nIn men das city and and a number of other things just just [noise] not much redeeming there\nBut more importantly Lisa Murkowski has voted to leave Kavanaugh's subject to claims of perjury and impeachment\nAnd then leaving the court if he has not confirmed a court stays up for for a deadlock what the what the reason that matters is that in a ... ... if the court votes for four on any case then the decision prior to the court hearing it is affirmed nothing changes\nAnd that means that the Ninth Circuit court of appeals wouldn't be the highest ranking court\nThat could make decisions regarding fundamental aspects of life in Alaska her own home state\nIt is it would be idiotic to put the night if you're a Republican and and by the way she does believe in property rights and development and gun rights and to put the Ninth Circuit court of appeals in a bunch of left us in charge of those issues in her state this is shooting herself in the foot\nAll to supposedly be in unison with me\nToo movement [noise] so I mentioned that we had a couple of photos\nOf Dianne Feinstein looks like she has cornered Murkowski\nI don't know when the photos were taken presumably they are recent we can find out we just have checked Feinstein's

face Feinstein's looks like\nShe is\nWell the picture speaks for itself it it it would that hand that she got her cornered she's got her hand up on the wall framing Murkowski\nIt's an aggressive move it allows Feinstein's leaning in to Murkowski\nNow let's switch to the close up of that photo for those will be watching under dental ... do you see\nThe pain the expression on the face of Murkowski and the expression of in hand seriousness and you better be listening to me\nOn the face of die for\nNow we'll have these photos up at Rush Limbaugh dot com to I'm not trying to leave it buddy out but

looking here's a voice Feinstein sure does look like a bully in Murkowski looks very uncomfortable she not\n\nI mean it's it's been a really pained look on her face and it it looks like Feinstein is running this relationship it looks like Feinstein is giving her what for [noise] [noise] I\nDon't know when the picture was taken and I will acknowledge that our interpretation could be wrong we we have no context here other than the hearings and the way this has been going\nWell I wouldn't call that romantic I take that back or one of these is from California and romance there has all kinds of

I Know what to Tennessee and it's deep red that'll just wants to win and so forth but\nThis he expects this to pay off for him in his campaign this is obviously a reaction and reflection of public sentiment for Kavanaugh in the state of\nTennessee Phil Bredesen is by the way we're starting to lose ground to Marsha Blackburn in polling data this this record cruise seat And Corker by the way he was also tweeted today that it is outrageous\nTo punish somebody who hasn't done anything to anybody\nFor all of these ... pose the actions are men have engaged in against women but his point is we

then we're going to deny because they committed perjury and I'm going to deny him because he threw ice at a bar back when he was in college\nBut Corker made it plain that he doesn't think\nKevin ...
