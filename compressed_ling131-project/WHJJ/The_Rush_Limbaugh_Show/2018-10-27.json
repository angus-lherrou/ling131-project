down\nBehind the line of scrimmage the Gulf or a loss for genetic as he continues to flood terrific football for down she is based on the team and ... was twenty five thirty three and a half tackle for a loss\nAdd another one to that list now so he's at four and a half tackle for a loss for him and he's got one and a half ... having a very very steady and good year and I will be back around he gets all the accolades because his numbers are off the charts but genetically has been a day in and day out steady good customer for it out for the twenty five\nThey're going to have to punt this what a way to do the honors will Michael comes out of you have just thirty six yards per ... off the grass nice job scoop it up to the way a line drive that goes to a door she makes a catch in the thirties tries to return it but get wrapped up and brought down that's a good job\nAlright get back to business here third down and for from the Thirteen yard line and your eye territory for William and Mary knocking on the door here quarterbacks\nAnd nobody's buying it they take shown Mitchell and crew him down for a big loss fake the handoff you Ryan I'm the middle with it and when I was right there to greet him take\nBoston Mitchell to a kind of redirect himself building an obvious steel came in to make that tackle but good job of\n... going to force a few go\nWill be thirty three yard field goal from the left or\nKeep calm and junior and they are in the defense alive for an island or having an impact on that play as well so for seven\nFrom the sixteen they're going to try to ah\nGet to within one school of Rhode Island [noise]\nWith what will be eight thirty three yard field goal attempt [noise]\nChris Cooper out to do the honors Mr push it off to the left no good ... days ahead by eleven\nRoutine or not to go and take over possession of the football every\nKick is a dicey proposition in this weather and ah [noise] it's still raining hard and the wind is swallowing it seems as you look at the flags it's not just a one direction of wind is really chicken all around out there and makes it\nDifficult even for a kicker to play the wind because it doesn't seem to have any consistent direction to\nDo it makes for a difficult proposition and ah [noise] Chris Cooper\nHad trouble he is one of them to on a day\nA field goal attempts five of ten on the year so first intend for down from the twenty fourteen ... to go [noise] we got to feel good about again we're William and Mary needs to scores [noise]\nTo surpass you are [noise] catch up to you\nIn a game where a scoring is going to be at a a real premium the rest\nOf the way because of the conditions\nThere and you look at you know William and Mary don't tell you that ten points to the field goal in the end they had this the strip or by the defender so we're very often is really haven't done anything to score on ... points today\nFirst place from scrimmage to hand off the named Jones you get through the line across the twenty five yard line up to the twenty seven puts them over a hundred yeah nice ah six or seven yards gained that time for him\nTo get them a second in short they'll give them six and ... down in for the city I hit Ninety eight going into that runs so it's going to put them just over one hundred yards after an impressive weekend last weekend were fourteen of Seventy six with a couple of\nTouchdown runs against Phil Bryant out for the second week in a row and named Jones doing a very good job\nShowing it showing blitz has time to give it a Jones you get the head of the blitz and brings it up to thirty are lined looks like he's got ... down laying across at thirty except for more excellent effort that time there were blitz from the right side and on your own sort of the middle [noise] took those guys out of the picture\nOr early and then you ... it's a good first don't you take time off the clock but you can just to impose your will right here and just drive this ball right down their throat down the field and make this a twenty eight turn game it'll be over\n... you take five or six minutes off the clock and punch going home and it's pretty much game over at this\nPoint especially like I started with rumors offerings really doing nothing today\nTo walk to the left side hand up again to just try to get to the outside got some real good thirty five yard line [noise]\nHold off on defender gets up to the forty five dementia finally thrown down across meal feel and the forty nine yard line what a great run by name Jones that was big time now the little room on the outside to the left and just sniffed it out and when I got it\nThey're gonna call holding called down the field I'm One of the all kinds of one man I [noise]\nDidn't have anything to do with the play [noise]\nBut on culture yeah and that's the second time no not named Joneses had a hold and coal take away a huge run for him to be about a hundred and forty yards [noise]\nSo that's going to take a huge chunk of this play away almost all of it for your game\nOut of that bring it back to the thirty\nThree yard line [noise] and it's going to be [noise]\nFirst and seven for down from the thirty three [noise] boy died in ... formation now Kenny the age ... to the right side of the line flags down again named Jones get some more room gets shut down again flags on both sides of the field go down [noise]\nSo he was able to give himself out close to the forty five yard line but they swung back as well be offensive line do [noise]\nBoy oh boy was I went to ripping off big runs there and they're just they're giving them back\nWith penalties should be another five year apparently some out put them in a first down in about eleven [noise] they should be well past midfield at this point in the wind up at the twenty nine year old like [noise]\n\nNamed Joan stone doing\nHis job [noise] and neither the penalties really affected his run park is why do the right side now [noise] Dorsey in the backfield with three already [noise]\nThey're going to end up ... ball it looks like ... has a bad move for down and try to hand it off the door scene Dorsey didn't seem to want it both fell between the two of them prairie stretched out for just about gathered that ball and that was being [noise]\nSniffed out by a couple of William Mary guys coming in and ah he was able to get it just before they got to him call Fowler was the first one to the ball the priority was able to just [noise]\nGathered in [noise]\n... and his chest area to make sure nobody could get it away so second and in Fifteen for around ... things like being on a treadmill [noise]\nIf I can remember from back like that\nThey're going to end up this time looking over the middle east in and out of the hands of the agenda receiver coming across the field for allowing Aaron park was the guy on the crossing pattern the slant pattern not able to pick it up another ball there was catch ... for him and not able to gather it in the car they tried to get to\nUnderneath the football was positive back up in the air and give a couple of defenders of chance to get after it and maybe get the interception but it fell right in front of colon Parker the safety\nAnd goes as an incomplete pass they're down to Fifteen so the twenty five yard line now for it out [noise]\nDifferent complex and they say how they're forced to pass now before they had their own game going smoothly [noise] to watch the right side for an hour and went off to the left they aren't going to run this time they just try to get to

in time to I Believe it was two thousand eight when Hillary was going against uh Hussein Obama\nThe uh iron my shirts folk started coming out I don't know if you recall that or not I'm sure you do with your memory\nOr yeah and I think I'm responsible for that because of a joke I used to tell about Hillary\n... yeah and so Michele milk and you know put that to bed as far as it was you know it was a plant\nWill tell people what it was ... tell me because I stepped on and tell people what it is\nOh sure sure so back in two thousand and eight or in order to garner sympathy and empathy for the ... um there was a gentleman or series of gentleman that were walking around the Hillary camp for president campaign of two thousand and eight with\nSigns saying iron my shirts or you're in my shirt of course because of you know can't have a woman for president those you know those sexist Republicans\nRight and you know what you're going to do Hillary and be a domestic beer housewife an iron my

waste it was Hillary's plant there was nobody legitimately anti Hillary doing that\nRight correct that's another time Tony I gave my idea but anyway I don't want to step on keep going with the

department of public safety\nAnd here's what I have found today CNN is spending almost eighty percent of their time on ...\nEighty\nPercent may okay even if it's sixty percent of their time on the show again they're not focusing on the care of him\nThat tells me\nThat if the caravan weren't a Democrat idea designed to embarrass Trump that they would be covering it and building it up and with people down there interviewing these people creating sob stories there'd be there'd be man on the street interviews with a mean guy Trump is\nAre they just want to come to America and that may yet happen down the road that CNN\nIs is not wall to wall but they are predominantly\nFocusing on the show Gabe and of course whenever CNN does just to try to damage Trump let's look and see wife CNN is so ticked off because Trump's approval numbers are higher than they've ever been now\nAnd there are higher than Obama's war at this stage in the ah in his mid terms of the same point in his presidency after two years there just beside themselves none of this is happening the way it was supposed to happen now there's more and more stories about how the blue wave may not happen\nHint hint it never was going to happen I don't think anybody has ever known whether it's going to be a blue wave they've been relying on polling data but nobody knows for sure that was that the media narrative\nIt was a meeting that was not born of any evidence that couldn't be any evidence for a blue wave or a red wave the election hasn't happened yet everybody wants to rely on polling data to suggest is going to happen but the polling data hasn't been accurate either starting in two thousand sixteen or the presidential race\n\nSo we've got this caravan chugging north and I think you know put some things in perspective\nOn this again the way to look at it is is as a a microcosm of what's happening every day and our border every day this is what's happening\n\nNot seven thousand a day but but but every day this is what's been going on for decades and it needs\nTo stop\nAnd Donald Trump is the only person that's ever talked about working to make it stop now the Democrats\nThere are behind this one of the strategic ... besides getting somebody hurt\nAnd blaming that on Trump maybe what they're hoping is that Trump actually won't do anything about it\nMaybe they're hoping that Trump will be all huff and puff talk about sending the military down they're talking about setting a National Guard down but not actually doing anything they might be rolling the dice that Trump isn't going to do anything because they think they've rattled Trump\nWith their stories earlier this year about how he separated families the border and how Trump didn't all white the network the infant didn't want to laugh so he did what he couldn't to change it I\nI Do know this despite\nEverything that you think you would know but common sense there are still Republicans elected Republicans look at this caravan and their solution is to let them in\n\nAs elected still they are so you're about peace yesterday they are so scared of this issue they are so scared that when ever the subject to legal immigration comes up Democrats automatically when\nRepublicans think they've got their show they're not cold hearted mean spirited and all that let them they're not publicly saying this but I Know that there\nMay be the Democratic gamut is too is is is a wild guess at Trump's actually not going to do anything after huffing and puffing and I'll tell ya if Trump doesn't do anything if this caravan allowed to get to the border and come into the country what do you think that wouldn't do the Trump\nThere's one issue that could separate Trump from his voters or at least make his do voters began to\nI don't doubt is the right word but they would be mightily disappointed particularly after Trump has said over and over again that this caravan is not going to get it\nIf if if if some Republicans are behind this than than it is obvious uh but I just somebody has to be\nSomebody has to be making this happen folks we're talking with we we've got how many\nTwo thousand miles stop and think of this from Honduras to the southern\nBorder of the United states since ... Arizona is around two thousand miles\n\nSeven thousand people one day just decided\nTo start walking to the United states\nTo thousands of miles\nI also think if you're looking for people behind this you have to look at the drug cartels and if you want to start trying to analyze will what couldn't bear politics in this would be that opens up a whole new can of worms but I don't doubt that they are playing a major role in\nTransportation but there has to be political involvement here too because money has to be available there has to be money being spent on this so you've got seven thousand people\nWho all of a sudden undecided all of a sudden 'cause nobody saw this coming and there was no advance word of it seven thousand people decided to start walking to a thousand miles\nWe don't see pictures of of of where they're using the bathroom\nWe don't see pictures of them gathering or getting food and eating it\nI mean look at random video you might you might see some people's choice things I mean we don't see how this is being handled we don't see the port a potties we don't see in our day just urinating and rivers and streams and what would the environmental wackos think about that if that's happening\n\nWell [noise] I guess you you may have a point welcome to San Francisco they could already be accustomed to it especially the deaf occasions in the street and they got maps in San Francisco for the tourists come voided the piles of human the fate [noise]\n\nSo how long would it take to walk two thousand miles along with a tech\nRemember they're vowing altogether I just
