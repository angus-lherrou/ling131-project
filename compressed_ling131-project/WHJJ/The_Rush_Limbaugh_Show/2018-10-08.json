GMC Yukon in the hall from C net Roadshow thank you for coming on\nYeah I think that [noise]\nYeah I don't know that's a lot of money to show to shell out for a for a new car a I Am just not in that market at this point for eighty thousand bucks I Want you know a BMW land cruiser something red with a convert\nI Can't even imagine what a land cruiser most costs at the gym so you can't ... grand at this point by\nYeah the Suburbans all these cars are just they're selling you know there's a reason that GMC keeps you know getting rid of their small size sedans and pushing out more cars like this that they are incredibly profitable\nAnd they're selling like ... people want the giant giant cars I just wonder how high gas prices need to get before people start saying yeah\nWhen I totally lovers or out in the suburbs when you see like the hundred and ten pound mom would the eight thousand pound ...\nThat was my mother my mother had a a Chevy Suburban for like years growing up she plowing down the highway you can only see like forty eight eight and ... and a steering wheel or five feet tall as it was pretty funny [laughter]\nUm so before we close out more news about Amazon age to chew we still don't know where this thing's going to be there apparently making some followed visits right in the traveling around the country taking a look\nSniffing around Miami sniffing around Chicago apparently a there's a sixty two acre undeveloped parcel on the south loop in Chicago so that would be you know potentially a very interesting centrally located a location Illinois pretty terrible business climate I think I'd be surprised if\nYou're that anyway I think New York Chicago even Boston probably fail with the Amazon each cue too is because they've already got each one in Seattle which they've had some difficulties with in terms of their political climate I don't know if they're going to take one of those three cities where they're probably going to be faced with similar issues down the road\nAustin Nashville you know you may want to look at red state America I still think Atlanta could be a fantastic to ...\nWaters is out there encouraging it Mazie Hirono was out there in your Mazie Hirono Mazie Hirono says people are totally justified in harassing Republicans in public in restaurants and even in their homes\nAnd forcing them out because they're white racists white supremacist totally totally justified so there's a part of me that knows that Democrats are promoting this there's another part I think some Democrats do not think that this deranged psychological upset\nIs tied to them well let me put it this way\nIf we had people on our side behaving like this it would worry me to death it would worry me to death that voters are going to think that conservatism is made up of deranged lunatics like this the Democrats don't seem to be concerned about that\nWell some of them like Nate Silver here don't even think that that behavior is assumed by voters to be the behavior of mainstream Democrats\nAnd I I Wonder if that's true and if it is true how can they be ... to ... if it isn't true and if they are aware of it and are proud of it and are encouraging it\nThen the question becomes this when you get into turn out for the November elections in the midterms and by the you know what people are now saying Mr certainly ...\nThe Democrats some of the people on TV are saying well I I don't think that we know yet what issues are going to determine the vote in the ... [laughter]\nI Wonder where they heard that I\nWonder why they heard that idea well\nWe don't know you out of the issues are actually going to determine turn out and vote of happened yet they're still among the oh four of them in during the election\nIt is a interesting question though well any of the passion fade away on either or\nBoth sides of this and that's I'm a Democrat side it's not going to fade away and I think everybody needs to know this on the Democratic side this deranged lunacy has become the defining characteristic of today's Democratic Party and the American left\nYou have to remember these people have been off their rockers since November of two thousand sixteen\nThey have been mad insane crazy percolating compounding come pressing all of this ever since then they haven't been loaded for bear ever since election day and the day after a two thousand sixteen\nAnd this ... situation comes up\nAnd I don't think on the Democrats' side they can get any more hysterical and I don't think they can get any more motivated than they are I think they're at their peak right now\nI mean they're still talking about investigating cabin off for under ... wants to see the F. B.\nI. documents released she wants a full fledged\nInvestigation of Kevin all the Democrats are fucking you're talking about Gerald ... house\nJudiciary Committee ranking member of the Democrats promising if the Democrats win the house that they're going to impeach cabinet they're going to investigate him getting thrown off the court\nThey're not they're not going to let this some side this cabinet thing is not over and they're going to continue to rile their side up and motivate them and encourage them to continue engaging in what you and I would call this massive civil disobedience\nAlthough it's more than that it is it is genuine child like I don't even try like ... ... we're just we're dealing with a complete emotional breakdown\nAnd a group of people I don't care whether they're paid or not ... that I don't I don't want to fall back on that to suggest that this is a anger they feel is not legitimate is legitimate whether they're being paid or not I don't think that means that the real enthusiasm a democratic voters is less than what we think\nIt is just because some people have announced that they accept the money to go do this stuff I don't I don't think that they would sit\nAround and do nothing in twiddle their sons all weekend long if they weren't being paid I think the demographic rages real and it's been a real sense election night\nTwo thousand sixteen they thought they are going to win that aren't they going to win at a landslide they haven't been able to come to grips with that even now the capital of the thing is just further evidence that the election and consequences\nThey censor themselves losing control and losing and losing and they can't deal with it I simply cannot deal with it rather than do what's necessary to put themselves back together and become a winning\nEnterprise they continue with their primary strategy of trying to tear down and destroy the opposition and eliminate it\nRather than do what's necessary to reach a broad swath of the majority of the American people which they cannot do in their current makeup which is why I ask\nOver and over if the Democrats ab large elected Democrats really are unaware of the impression these people are creating about\nThem\nAnd when these are mad in saying this gusting Democrat protesters and they are identified with the Democratic party and I don't know if some elected Democrats really get that\nI can be all wet that could totally get it and they could be promoting it and which is probably closer\nTo the to the truth than not\nBut for those that don't get it in amazes me but it is possible that these\nProfessional Democrats are like Nate Silver do not consider these protesters to be members of their party in representative of\nThe ah the party\nAt large here's J Christian Adams rising PJ Media Kavanaugh's fills Senate gallery was sounds will be insane\nSo it was any doubt that the opposition to Kevin always on hinged on civil disruptive rooted borderline nuts my experience in the gallery made it clear I haven't visited this is Chris Adams riding I visited the hospitals for the seriously mentally\nIll enlist shrieks from this woman in the Senate gallery weren't as odd and on earth weight as anything I ever heard in side a mental hospital they echoed off the halls and ceilings outside the gallery and decreasing the stunning dude\nAnd then the role was called but it sounded like the gates of hell opened up nearly a dozen women erupted in unison shouting howling screaming in an unrecognizable venomous whale and they wouldn't stop this was fury was rage\nWas hate it was poison in the noise\nThey were the sounds of a group of people tinkering with this court ... madness and they were the sounds of irrational on their hands down on more word limit lunatics\nThese were the people who oppose Kavanaugh's nomination they weren't an embarrassment to themselves\nAnd their rights pay attention that's what the left sounds like yeah it is in the Democratic party doesn't seem to be the least bit concerned about it\nThe Democratic party doesn't seem to be the least bit embarrassed by it the Democratic party at large it doesn't seem to worry at all this\nKind of discord madness is going to negatively impact them in the elections\nIn fact they may think the opposite they may think that this is\nWhat's going to further inspire more discordant madness which will result\nIn massive turnout\nThey believe it's going to frighten Republicans in tune not confronting them and basically letting them have their ... and it because who wants to deal with lunatics Andy and same face to face\nBut what it means to me is I don't know that they can get\nMore rapid\nI don't know that there's anything else it can happen to get them more fired up than they are\nSteven a cold beer\nHas a writer on his staff that show couldn't to curb without writers very proud to say here no writers on the Rush Limbaugh and every time I see this

I Can't read but she says that a family show and then she admitted she was emotionally\nShattered by the current state of affairs which just proves the theory that Democrats are mentally disturbed people who project or mental problems on to the public\nOn the politics is exactly what is happening here do not underestimate that and I don't think that I'm I'm I'm being flippant or exaggeration or to make a point I really do believe that we're talking about mainstream mental and psychological disorders becoming standard operating procedure politics\nThe America but there's no other way to explain this\nNow folks to show you how deranged this is I have a stack today I have um\nTwo maybe three one night when called teachable moment things they are opinion pieces that appear in the mainstream media both today and over the weekend\nThey are related to Kavanaugh but they the\nPieces attempt to say what all of this means for America and of course for the\nFor the Democrats and much of it is I mean I just saw dead wrong in the simple recitation of the facts of all this if it stuns me\nThat people on the left cannot even face the facts of this and react to them they continued to react to what they think has gone on based on how they feel and these are some of the standard bearers of American journalism on the left\nOne of them is or isn't John Harris at Politico one of the founders Democrats fear of there are a wet rag party you don't just pieces about this piece is about how the Democrats get their rear end handed to them every time because all the Democrats are a bunch of cowards\nThe Democrats have no guts the Democrats are a bunch of paper tigers and Democrats or Republicans walk all over\nNow how many of you think it's the exact opposite this is pretty common to there are a lot of people on both sides who think their own side is a bunch of war says\nBut I don't know how anybody paying attention on the left can think that their sights a bunch of ...\nBut the fact that they do is fascinating to me\nNow here's another such pace and we have said that this woman once before I don't remember specifically when her name is Alexis Grinnell she has written on gender and politics for the New York daily news the Washington Post and other outlets\n[noise] she had a piece on Saturday in New York Times it may have been actually published on Sunday and released on the Web on Saturday Night the dates I told her six since I don't read the paper anymore I don't know when the stuff actually shows up in the print edition\nSo my guess is this thing was released Saturday Night on the Web to be published in the Sunday paper but it could have been in the Saturday paper as well doesn't matter white women come get your people\n\nI I don't even know

behavior that warrants\nA stamp\nOf approval of winning elections yet they win them within their closely\nContained bases districts and states their enclaves which is actually\nA very small portion of this country in terms of square mileage\nPopulation centers of the big cities on the coasts and then the great lakes\nHere's the\nIt's not a dirty little secret but it's some things don't always keep in mind\nAnd frankly I was happy watching the news over the weekend to hear a number of people on our side making this point because it's a point that's been true for as long as I have been doing this program and the longer we say constantly to the left uses the court\nTo act as insurance policies against losing elections that the left cannot\nSucceed in ... in implementing his agenda nationwide except to be the courts and\nThat's why the courts are so important and that's why the courts a liberal Democrat presidents have stacked as many of the federal courts federal appellate courts as they can with leftist activist judges not just plain old simple judges who rule on law\nAnd there is a dirty little secret behind this folks\n\nThe Democrats simply do not have\nThe numbers in the country to pass their agenda in Congress they do not have the numbers to implement and pass their agenda legislatively otherwise they cannot get their beliefs their ideas\nPast as laws in America they have to rely on activists job just to do it\nNow you might miss it was Russia or ... before no nothing new there well there's nothing new about it but particularly its in its relevance its power and it's important has been magnified in this current Kevin a fight and explains in one reason\nWhy why this is so important to them they are in their minds on the verge of losing the highest court in the land\nThere on the verge of losing the ability to have the highest court in the land a rubber stamp their policies if you go down and look at leftist issue by leftist issue\nThat these issues that have royals our culture turned our culture upside down you won't find any of them that have been passed into law by the elected representatives of the people except for Obamacare\nAbortion the American people haven't decided that\nThat was forced on the American people by a leftist activist judge and a majority on the Supreme Court\nAnd any other number of cultural issues which are designed to strike out at this white power structure that the left so despise isn't so hates\nThat they cannot beat they cannot win they cannot do this legislatively they need activist\nJudges dominating courts in order for what they want to be forced on every ... this is the\nPoint what they believe in the idea is they have\nMust be forced on the rest of the bus if they are to happen\n\nThey cannot withstand legislative tests\nIt's the same reason why every Democrat president up to and including Obama never tells the truth about their agenda they would not win the presidency if they were honest about that which they intended to do\n\nIf Obama had been honest about the way Obamacare was going to end up and how much it was going to cost you and how much you deserve to pay for it because you've been getting a free ride all these years\nIf Obama had been anywhere near honest about that or what climate change was going to cost you anything he would have never been elected\nAnd no Democrat ever wouldn't be\nThey routinely soft sell what they really believe they do not come out an advocate socialism or communism in presidential campaigns they will do it as it was a case of Alexander the gift

sexist and massage sticking all these other things that are despicable we must do away with it\nThey don't have the ability to to win any of these issues legislatively\nAre you left us you can get mad at me all you want out there but you cannot review\nThis every thing they want everything they have achieved\nOutside of Obamacare has been forced on the country the country has been bludgeon into accepting it\n\nThe country has been bludgeoned into looking the other way and if you don't look the other way and if you find it then what do they do they show you\nThey try to ruin you or they bully you or they harass you\nOr what have you this is not the behavior that does when things legislatively and yet the Democrats firmly believe that all of this is going to lead to this giant ... blue wave and I don't care even today\nThere are links all over the Drudge Report where if you click on them you're going to find a story saying yeah it's over Democrats when and when bang and even the

here is the brilliant answer from Rebecca Traister\nAre we angry that it has to be white linen before we take they started seriously or\nI think it's an do we also acknowledge that we need to wake the white women and if their power their products small power\nCan be useful in revealing the degree to which women are still oppressed\nThen in fact this strategically necessary and this goes back to the question do we need white women question that every candidate\nIt's an electoral question every candidate needs to ask do\nWe need white women [noise]\nNow this wouldn't be happening if it hadn't been for the realization that a lot of white women supported cabinet and I don't know if it was so much that white women supporting Kevin ... is that they were ... it it it scared to death at what they saw being set up\nAgainst men they have sons they have brothers and anybody with half a brain watching what went on the last two weeks\nWould have to have been blind just see the Democratic party had a line the itself in such a way\nThat men were all told met Dick clay guilty simply because they exist\nSimply because they are capable\nIn fact [noise]\nLet's see there's actually a story with that exact point may the here and I think I moved to the bottom of the stack but it is it is a woman making the point that Kavanaugh\nIs as good as guilty because he could have done it and he could have done it because he's a man he could have done it because he has\nMale genitalia that's all this woman in this story requires to believe\nBall Z forward that Kevin ... could have done it well if you're old woman with the sun is and a husband that you love and some brothers and you're watching this\nYou wouldn't miss what is transpiring that men are automatically guilty all it takes is an allegation the obligation doesn't require any evidence in fact the fact that there is no evidence adds to the fact that the allegation is likely to have happened\nIt they just change tactics and the new tactic um you know they employed with a judge Kavanaugh with Christine balls before they had a two for that someone that not only educate argued\nThat someone that was going to put on a suicide vest for um oh I just think that this is the new battlefront and thankfully we tromp through cannot\nHas put ... on the final Republicans\nA ... true true but maybe I'm\nMaybe I'm silly for trying to force this issue but let me just ask you point blank right since you have talked to was willing to address the issue do you think of this insurgency as you've described it which is this behavior but just the we've seen the last two weeks do you think that kind of behavior which was widely\nPublicized Democrats loved it the media loved it they tried to make heros under these people they didn't try to hold them back\nWhere they want to disrupt the Senate vote they disrupted the Senate vote when they wanted to get in the halls of the Senate Russell office building they did so they got an elevators they shouted these people down to the Democrats have not once called out that activity they've never once told outside their side to stand down do you think\nThe American public watching that is going to be turned off by it\nAnd want to vote against it or do you think the American public\nDoesn't care one way or the other and doesn't even really notice it [noise]\nI think it's largely going to be turned off but like you said they've they've completely changed their base now they've given up on the working\nBlue collar class and they're now they're now trying their hand and see if they can somehow um increase the numbers with women on these type of issues but I think largely that the American people are going to be turned off\nAnd I I think it's all going to come down to a who who is able to get out get out the vote in a month but that had\nWell see my point twenty twenty\nLet me okay this is my ... I don't think given what we've seen the last two weeks among people in the public who watched it I don't think the Republicans need to do when he got out the vote this was that\nIn my scene and just world the Democrats just exceeded and getting Republican turnout larger than it's ever been for a mid term I Know I'm probably wrong about that but that's how I look at it that's how it ought to be and I'm a king a book's title the way things ought to be an automated people were outraged by this\nIt ought to be that people can't wait to punish this month just column for the way they have treated this country the past two weeks alone the Republicans ought not have to spend the time getting out the vote based on this but I Know that's not the reality kind of frustrating to me but that's the case [noise]\nDemocrats think they're going to have turned out here to dwarfs anything the Republicans have to show up on election Democrats think the whole country is except they really don't they know they don't have enough Americans to win legislative battles but they think\nThat they're going to be able to put together enough people to dwarf whatever Republican turnout there is\nAnd they've got new stories predicting that very thing so people are going to be reading it people can be reading Republicans don't have a chance\n\nYou may replied\nNo I I agree and um I think they energy I think they energize the base and they did exactly what needed to be done and I think it says the issue that you were speaking of a month\nOr so ago that the the event hadn't happened and what twenty nine days but it it happened\nA true yeah I went on when I said the events that were going to shape the midterms hadn't happened uh thirty days ago I was exactly right and there are some people saying that this is gonna be forgotten by the time the election comes around\nA lot of people I saw him on Fox say a lot of learned puns and commentators oh this was going to be so old by then I actually heard a couple of people say the things that people are going to vote on probably haven't happened yet [laughter] I just have to chuckle\nUm\nNow I can I can see with the passage just be you cannot maintain miss\nHer passion for long nobody can\nWelded but we're talking about I'm Talking about reasonable people I'm I'm I'm saying it's it's understandable to me that some passion on our side is going to fade there's still a month ago the other side they had been chomping at the bit since election night two thousand sixteen and they're only getting more\nAnd Rush Limbaugh\nFees for news radio nine twenty\nYour brain is an amazing thing but as you get older it naturally begins to change\nCausing a lack of sharpness or even trouble with recall\nThe breakthrough in preparation helps your brain\nActually improve memory the secret is an ingredient originally discovered in jelly fish in clinical trials prohibition has been shown to improve short term memory\n... healthier brain better\nNow available in stores everywhere things up and evaluate anybody at the product is not intended to treat you prevent any disease\nDoes your dog itch scratch tinker shed like crazy come to dynamite for help order Ninety Days supply of dynamite pick up two bottles of liquor chops get the third bottle free new improved liquor chops with the mega sticks omega three vitamin E. and now it's six extra direct fed microbial\nEven better for the digestive tract and immune system and dogs ... try liquid shops by to get one free business Henry look authentic for died by\nAn hour [noise]\nAnd I saw the envoys list\nPrice dealer price to be happier if your car shopping you probably heard these terms what do they mean it's so confusing well it was confusing not anymore I'm telling you about true price from two car it's a price it actually means something because it's the exact price you pay for the car you want including\nIn Florida of the hanging chads the Democrats believed that the Supreme Court Hamdan George W. Bush the victory ill legally\nNever mind the Florida Supreme Court was out of control the way it was handling all the legal issues here\nThe U.S Supreme Court had to step in and stop it because it was out of control and when they did the Democrats were fit to be tied and from that day forward and George W. Bush was an illegitimate president\nAnd he didn't stop being illegitimate and they finally got his approval numbers down to the money's six years later in the middle of his second term so we get the two thousand two and it's the first chance the Democrats have\nTo pay a country back to pay the Republicans back to pay Bush back and they are going to retake the house and they're going to retake the Senate and they're going to reopen the Florida recount and they're going to make sure that justice is finally done and that Al Gore\nBeing duly recognizes it legitimate winner of the presidency even though Al Gore didn't want any part of it by that\nTime they were feeling so up so shore so confident\nThat when it came time for a memorial for their late great senator from Minnesota Paul Wellstone they totally blew up what was intended to be a memorial honoring and celebrating the life of Wellstone\nIt was about three weeks [laughter] prior to the mid term elections in November of two thousand two\nThe Wellstone memorial was hijacked by activists Democrats and turned into a store Paul lyrical rally\nThe purpose of which was to destroy George W. Bush and Republicans in memory of Paul Wellstone\nRepublican senators who were friends of Wellstone who's doing it fully showed up\nAt the arena they did this arena in a place that whole Fifteen thousand people if my memory serves ten Fifteen thousand people it was some time after ... most of them died in the plane crash and it was some time after that but this was the official memorial and it was\nI don't think it was ever intended to be a memorial I think it was a political event from the get go disguised as a memorial\nAnyway Republican senator is not knowing up from down as I'm Trent Lott into boys all showed up thinking that they were showing up to a memorial a religious memorials honor their form and colleague Paul Wellstone\nThey worm Bunni and bullied and harassed out of the place within thirty minutes of having a rival didn't sat down\nIt was identical to what we saw the way Jeff Flake\nAnd others were assaulted in elevators animal hallways of the Senate office building except this was after memorial and this was a Democrat voters going up to the worthy Republicans receded and getting in their faces and pointing fingers and I'm a booming at them they thought they were there\nTo participate in a solemn occasion they got up and they walked out and they left\nAnd this memorial turned into a hate fast a hate fast aimed at George W. Bush a hate fast aimed at George W Bush's policies they couldn't even set aside what had happened on nine eleven for this memorial\nThis Morial took place about fourteen months after nine eleven\nTook place so then the men terms a curve\nAnd I remember I was invited to the last time this happened I was invited for election night coverage on NBC Tim Russert asked me to join him and Tom Brokaw I Do to fully accepted and I went\nAnd I was not on camera all night maybe four or five times while they they cycled other people through and they brought me and after it was clear that the Republicans hadn't gained ... seats on heard of\nThe Democrats just like now we're supposed to win big because Democrats told it everybody hated\nBush everybody resented the way the Supreme Court stole the election for Bush\nThat Al Gore had won the popular vote just like reached and the the American people felt betrayed by Bush and the Supreme Court and nine eleven and Bush's general stupidity and competence and as such couldn't not wait for the Democrats to take back control\nOf what is right probably there's Washington DC except it didn't happen the Republicans gain ... seats Tim Russert was great broke all brought me out and so what do you think happened here I said the Wellstone memorial\nBut Wellstone memorial is what happened and I went on and told them why in a truncated version of what I just said they knew they were shell shocked they weren't\nI was shocked is just not in the formula the party in power does not pick up seats\nIn mid term elections the first ones after a new president is elected so that's a formative experience for me and if it's\nI like ... if it's happened once it can happen again something that hasn't happened before probably won't happen but if it has then it can happen again and this is a replay of that\nExcept this is a replay of even more outrageous behavior the Wellstone memorial took place on one night the Democrat Party has been insane on display for two full years\nAnd actually longer than that but in the in the context of Trump's election it's been two consistent ears of public arrangement\nPublic insanity psychological disorders on display childlike temp by the way I too have sat in the Senate gallery as a young boy my parents took my brother and me in Washington DC one summer\nAnd the Senate was in session and I'll Remember a Barry Goldwater was among the senators speaking when we were there he was speaking on the farm bill\nI was fourteen or Fifteen\n\nAnd I remember being in the gallery and I had a it was a pamphlet or a book some some kind of a a manual explaining what the Senate was and what was going on and I was turning the pages and the Senate page came and grabbed that book away\nFrom me and said you are making too much noise I'll give you this back after you leave just turning up page was not permitted\nThe gallery could not do anything more than ...\nYou were not allowed to chew gum people were chewing gum and the pages said you're leaving Russia or putting it in a piece of paper and tossing it you're not staying in here to income\nThey would come what spurred this to you they took my little pamphlet a

number of them won't even take a call from we need a proper a member of their own party\nYeah but they said they had the chance to do that and and uh they didn't want to go there\nBecause they couldn't take the risk of offending people who believe bossy but the fact of the matter is and I will say and again the Democrats don't care about sexual assault as evidenced by\nYour recitation of
