one now sex down almost two percent truck [noise]\nYeah I mean is that when you have the kind of volatility that we saw last week it doesn't go away overnight it suggested investors don't know how to fundamentally value\nA what they are seeing in the market right now and usually that takes a little time to go away if you think back to earlier this year it took us almost three months to you know kind of see volatility calmed down for early February\nTo mid April so you know I wouldn't be surprised if we elevated levels of volatility through out the rest of the year just because I think there are still big questions that need to be answered about where things are going to be going forward specifically with regards to inflation in gross and really that's what you're worried about when you're buying stocks inflation and growth\nCurve on Netflix shares even I mean they had a great quarter and they're down Seventeen dollars Tesla shares rallied yesterday I guess Musk said what he was

sixty four at the open up to two eighty to back down to two sixty five so you know giving back a decent chunk of that over the course of the day why would he announced that before he bought and not after\nJust to get the message out there you know hey I'm buying you know you know ... so to try to create enthusiasm toys are so focused on that stock price right now 'cause she's got all this debt

aluminum whether our cars that he was a looming him ... hands you know you you name it car stocks have been getting crushed they have I mean you General Motors floaters cells don't look good\nAnd a quarter sales numbers don't look so good distance of\nI I just think that you have a case with auto sales it's it's the the two groups that you need to match up it's the people who have money to buy a car and the people who actually have a demand for car right now\nAnd if you were previously one of the things that kept us a foot back in twenty Seventeen was actually the hurricanes ... people it created a lot of short term demand\nThe hurricanes this year ... haven't done that and you're just you're not seeing auto demand the way it had been previously\nBut the darn cars you want to go buy a car it's thirty six thousand forty thousand dollars you're not getting any special\nAnd that's the thing is I think where the demand is it's on the lower end and people just you just don't have enough

fly you to go do community service for\nThree or four days ... it's kind of a cool little promotion that they do but just to be raised visibility for the airline it's it's good that they're doing some good as well but it costs too much and they sure got a lot of publicity out of town out of it so it's a it's overall you know I wouldn't be surprised if you start seeing more of these types of

briefly explain how they work\nThere are three ways that an apple watch can receive and transmit data\nAnd the biggest one the one with the longest range the one that is most capable is not even available in Turkey and met his elbow he or cellular signals two years ago\nWhen apple in well actually a fourteen month when apple introduced the series three watch they activated L T E cellular service which for the first time\nMade the watch independent of the phone\nYou could take it out of work out you could do anything you can take it away from the fault inhabit operate it would still get emails and messages and their record your workout data and so forth if you could receive herself said well you didn't need your phone nearby\nSo it was the first time that they they watch\nFailed to be or do they just ceased to be a slave to the phone\nThe other two ways or blow to and why fight\nThose are the three ways that day they can get to watch and data can leave a watch\nYou take out he out of the mix because it doesn't exist in Turkey\nThere there there's no watch no apple watching the world and that it's an watch they claim he was wearing\nThe story is that his fiance has his phone out in the car in the parking lot at the consulate\nThere is only one way that watch could communicate with that phone while there's two ways there'd be why and\nBlow to blow to if you have to

thought going or whatever [noise]\nSo I Want to show you something of a digital camera I got an email here of um this is about yard signs you know when I've been hearing\nIs that people all over the country are afraid to put yard signs out because literally afraid of leftist knobs coming to their homes and not just ripping the signs out but doing damage to their houses and so people who are tending to vote Republican are not putting yard signs I remember\nWe had a call here I just maybe three weeks ago now from a caller who said Russia I'm worried I'm not seeing any yard signs we saw trumpet yard signs everywhere in two thousand six now I'm not seeing any yard signs at all\nI said well back camp that camp that does it looked into it and I found out that there is the leftist scaring the hell out of a lot of people and if that fright also includes scaring them not to go vote\nThere are a lot of people scared to death with these maniacs and that's\nWhy yard signs without being put out I I just part of me understands it another part of me she's afraid of yard signs are you kidding [laughter] from the country that stormed the beaches of Normandy we're afraid of a yard sign\nBut it's a different era and these people on the left or crazed or making doing good job of making themselves look that way\nSo I have a video taken by Ted Cruz worker I Can't I'm not going to show your video on a digital camera so I put it\nTook a still shot that would have papa pop up here just second this picture you're going to\nSee us from a video taken by cruise worker who was putting

cruise support or how much she hates cruise despises grows\nAnd I've taken still shut up put it up there and this is the guy that was running around taking cruise lines down ripping up out of yards\nAnd this still shot he is storming the Cruz supporter who is holding the camera he actually got within two inches of the camera I didn't still shocked that point 'cause all you see is the guy's flaring nostrils\nBut this guy\nIs out there following cruise people around taken a cruise yard signs out and then threatening\nCruise supporters who have videotape him doing this by the way this guy

called a porn star a horse race but this election\nIs really important and people that are involved in this election now how important it is and people that have voted for Trump in the past and have voted Republican know how important\nIt I just don't I don't think the media's weren't just lesson yet ... this is not the kind of thing that is going to cause Trump to lose an election you mean there's a few votes here\n\nIt may it may have caused other Republican candidates to it'll lose maybe holy elections but but but not\nTrump's [noise] I just think it's all part of the equation in which Trump critics still don't get it they don't get the bond between Trump and his supporters they never will understand it because they're not curious to understand it\nAnd so they take these things that they think are just outrageous insults just so totally permissible in American politics and they assume this is it that Trump's finished this has to be yet and\nBut even the Access
