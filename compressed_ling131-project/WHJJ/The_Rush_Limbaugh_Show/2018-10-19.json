{"month": "10", "state": "RI", "station": "WHJJ", "content": "Throwing stuff while the seat what books they can even things that you would have thought we'd do well like iron which is part of the whole Disney marvel empire they cancelled that after two seasons 'cause you know it just\nWasn't a show that a lot of people are really into so I think that like taking a lot of risks and you know many of them are paid off but it just a lot of money that they continue to spend I think that is you know on state I'm all for the long term\nBut one of the things that I find interesting here is this is a market over all of this year that even though it's it's still up somewhat for the year it's marketed gotten cheaper because earnings growth has outstripped what we've seen as far as appreciation for the broad market\nNetflix isn't in that situation they've gotten more hype and who say they're definitely not yeah so ... their company even with this quarter you could make the case it eats riskier today than it was at the beginning of the year still\nYeah I think that that is a very good argument that gets to the counter that I Would ask that is that Netflix seems to be treated in this club like Amazon or you know\nIt can you be overvalued for two decades that mean that really you know when it comes to Amazon ... always been over ... type yeah and it keeps going up and up and up and I think it's really just because\nPeople have faith in what Jeff pays are doing it and then the numbers kinda you know prove it with all the growth there and I think with Bree tasting that and that's like\nYou have a similar ah no argument this kind of a cult that the c._e._o. sort of a warship if you will people really seem to think that they can't do anything wrong\nBall in terms of competition for Netflix you know we we we're asking this earlier this week in terms of who the biggest competitors are\nIn my opinion one that's not a pure streaming service but HBO just because they have that subscription model in a hundred and thirty million subscribers worldwide obviously they've they've got that good base that's already built in\nYou've got companies like Hulu you've got companies like Amazon who even though they don't split it out they still have a big streaming service who is the biggest competitor in your opinion foreign foot right now\nYeah it's a tough question I think much really difficult to try and figure out with regard to competition and a lot of people talk about how competition could be bad for any of these services\nMy counter to that would be that as long as the broader economy is doing well\nIt's not really a kind of binary option I Know that many people who say well you know what I'm not going to subscribe to HBO even though I Love the game of Thrones because I only can afford Netflix and I want to watch the final season of arch the new black I think people\nAre very ... consumers live\nStreaming content right now and you know most people I Know they they have an Amazon description for the Amazon shows they watch HBO they watch Netflix and you know various authors as well I think it is going to be interesting to see whether or not the Disney Fox\nStreaming service that launches next here takes away some of the uh you know a traction for Netflix but uh you know even\nI'm not so sure that people are going to drop Netflix just to go to it\nBut one of the things that's missing from Netflix right now if you will get all these other services out there\nThey all have some other kind of live content they can offer whether it's you know Amazon has some Thursday Night Football games and some soccer games even Twitter has some of those uh you know obviously the legacy players like a Disney and Fox have sports news and things like that\nAny chatter but Netflix getting heavier into those areas because it's the one thing that seems to be missing from their portfolio right now\nTo achieve their objectives within the quote unquote democratic process and the political process they want a United Arab world and the Saudis are the biggest problems that because the Saudis\nAre too close to the United states\nThe Saudis are the number one buyers of American weapons number one they spend more money buying American arms than any other nation\nThat might surprise you but it happens to be true the Saudis have also become recent allies with us and Israel against Iran\nNow don't laugh at this\nMaybe go back and look at Iraq Hussein oh who the drive by the media loves\nWell Obama loved Iran and to Obama paying Iran one point eight billion dollars in power loaded cash Obama signed a nuclear deal with Iran was\nEssentially a pathway for them to achieve nuclear weapons Trump has since ... up that checked 'em off that's that's another rewind of an Obama policy\nSo if Obama loved Iran or thought it was okay at least they have an allied relationship with them or less adversarial then soldiers the drive by media\nBut\nNone of this about ... is designed the ... not not intended they deserve to die don't misunderstand this just folks were were were between a rock and a hard place here every day we're faced with a challenge the media picks a story that is their number one story and its purpose is very clear damage\nDestroy\nWhatever as much as they can Donald Trump we\nHave to defend is at least I think this this is my reaction to all of this\nI don't want 'em taken Trump out I don't want them damaging Trump I don't want any of this to happen\nIs this all bogus\nI Want the trajectory this country is on to remain I Want us to remain on that trajectory I Want to be back\nThe insanity Emmy abnormality and the psychological disorders that have become the Democratic party I Do not want those people in charge and leading in governing this country it will be a disaster if that happens\nIt will be an absolute does I Can't I got an email from a friend of mine last night\nWho just beside himself over the fact that Republicans might lose the house he is convinced this guy's a former New York the liberal by the way\nHe reformed about Twenty years ago he can't he can't\nHe's having trouble dealing with the possibility that the Democrats might when the house he's having trouble dealing with the fact that the majority the American people might want that\nI understand I agree with him completely\nDoesn't make any sense of Democratic Party doesn't deserve to be winning anything just on the basis of the way they can portray themselves in the Kavanaugh situation\nBut that's just the latest the Democratic party has become the home of the mentally unstable\nWho have used the political system\nTo fix whatever problems they have ... or their grievances that they think they have it all revolves around the age old argument of the purpose of government\nIt really is is to take all of this that's happening domestically and then when you synthesize it now when you boil it all down to its essence it's about the role of government\nAnd it's about the fact that the Democrats do not want to promote self reliance they don't want to promote rug in individual lives and they don't want to promote people dealing with life\nFixing situations dealing and facing adversity and overcoming it becoming better people they want people to remain inept incompetent dependents grown up in a mass thinking that government\nIs the solution and the solution is not really a solution the solution at the Democratic voters want is punishment for people they think are responsible for the misery of marijuana ... why would we want that\nTo try amp\nWell we don't but in the in the in the mission to bring that about here comes this ... story and as far as the drive by ... it's an open an opportunity\nTo blast theme Trump to damage Trump the ultimate aim is to get Trump the cave and abandon Saudi Arabia\nNot it's and it's not that the drive by have anything on that Saudi Arabia is just to get Trump the cave period just us just to prove that they can manipulate intimidate Trump\nIndian going against his instincts they've been trying to do that since the campaign they have failed practically every effort they've made their die\nTo be able to say they pressured and Trump into doing something you didn't want to do because he's afraid of them\nThey think they're getting close when Trump's out there saying yeah it looks like a show you tired\nLooks like it's a pretty good rep to show what they think they're getting close and they're all jammed up on their own tree than there are all getting more jazz\n[noise] for this that's why we tells you hope to show is not because anybody thinks he deserves to die but the media never tells you the truth about anything not anymore not work concerns Trump how many of you think let me just ask you a question\nThis faceless nameless on his op ed\nThat ran in the New York times supposedly written by somebody in the Trump inner circle in the west wing talking about how bad it is in their housing dangerously childish an immature\nTrump is how unprepared how ill equipped how it'll competed how at risk we all are but then we were assured by whoever wrote this thing don't worry\nThere are adults like us that are protecting this country from President Trump and you can count on us to commit well everyone is who is this who wrote this in the beginning\nThat's an pillow city has recently suggested that there's more of that on tap if the Democrats will people that don't vote for them they'll go along with them are going to suffer the consequences she said\nBut the Democrats have tried to punish all these people but it is not made their voters any happier there isn't any happiness\nOn the left you can't find any

I like football watched it and all of them but was not really into it but I got caught up\nAs a as a resident of Pittsburgh when that dynasty was warming I got caught up in it\nYeah and I was there here Nineteen Seventy five and I just got I I like everybody in that pets are amazing to me that's where I first involved the\nTheory of how the performance of a sports team can have so much impact on the self esteem of the population of a city\nThe ... own ... that's ... well they did even before they were they were lovable ... but then when the super bowl years came it hasn't it hasn't dropped off it hasn't it hasn't evaporated or is it is incredible I got caught up in it and that's why I became a Steelers fan so I didn't hear it\nIn retrospect I think that the writers of Nineteen Seventy two a bad some level book characters and some crazy players but uh to me there that they were the policy back then and the Steelers were the Trump as soon as Franco made that catch Mitt airways\nBrings us polo see about the rate is the raiders were man sized Kleenex\n[laughter]\nLet me tell you something for people who do this is that this is honestly true people who have\nCome of age or that if you're watching the the NFL of today in the past ten years if you weren't alive or old enough in the sixties and seventies and even the the early part of the eighties\nWatching the NFL you would think the game today\nIn many ways not all but in many ways has become Ropper room compared to the way I'll give you an example I got very little time here but there's a lot going controversy between the Cincinnati Bengals and the Pittsburgh Steelers the Bengals have is linebacker number fifty five ... perfect to purposely try standard people\nAnd he purposely tried to injure number eighty four Antonio Brown again last Sunday for armed to the helmets should have been suspended but wasn't leagues tired as suspending him\nWell after that after a bad place\nShortly after Ross burgers says he's going to get under center and birth ... points number Nineteen ju ju Smith ... says your next\nEnron those burgers says we can't have that in this guy saying your next should be suspended in the seventies you can take somebody's head off with a with a close line I forearm clothes line\nUp and it was just the way the game what they've really they've really tone of the game down I'm not advocating one of the other I'm just I'm just saying that the modern NFL is somewhat reflective of the snowflake culture of today it's still a brutal game do not anybody misunderstand me but it isn't the game it was in the seventies\nSit back and then you need to know show me I'd be we're using radio nine twenty\nIf you've ever experienced heart racing shortness of breath or dizziness as possible you could add a trio the relation one of the leading causes of syrup might happy for dealing\nWith Khartoum alter the FDA cleared personal EKG divide and just Ninety nine dollars [noise] to order the cardio dot com K.

bullying the appearance of insane rage an anger is all they have left\nThey don't have any issues or policies to run on for the same old reason they can't be honest\nAll they've got plenty of policies all day got plenty issues\nAll they have plenty of ideas they just don't dare tell anybody what they are\nNot at the run up to election time\nThey have no leaders to rally behind what do you mean when we look at the presidential front runners of this party\nJoel bite me crazy Bernie who is losing popularity and if you haven't heard\nHillary Clinton has all but made it official she's running again in twenty twenty\n\nHillary Clinton the a two time loser wants to go for the trifecta\nAnd I'm telling you there are a lot of people in the Democratic party hierarchy particularly in the media who don't want her anywhere near a presidential campaign again\nKamala Harris big walk by the time the microscope to get to her we're going to find out how really intellectually vacant that woman actually is and the same thing with Cory Spartacus Booker these people survive on imaging reputation built by the drive by media\nBut when the time comes to find out what really goes on between their ears you learn that it isn't much\nThey're frustrated because they've tried everything they can to get rid of Donald Trump and not only have they failed he has thrived so all they have is rage and the rage is actually the anger associated with fatal here\nThey have failed in every ah tempt every effort to get\nDonald Trump's approval numbers down to the thirties and forties so one of the primary parties in America the Democratic party has now become a party of range and violence mob like bullying behavior it's their only\nAngle and they're actually paying people to go engage in this kind of behavior\nLet's review some things that were in the news twenty four seven\nAnd the reason they were in the news twenty four seven because this was how to drive by media working with the Democrat Party was going to get rid of Donald Trump\nAnd yes folks I mean get rid of Donald Trump I I don't think what this has been about as simply waiting until Republicans lose an election and such as the midterms I think they've actually sought\nTo have Donald Trump for being moved from office since the day after the election I guess what ... about that is what the collusion thing is about that's what every one of these stories has been about\nIs somehow magically forcing Donald Trump out of office and effectively canceling the results of the two thousand sixteen election this is not about been not been about setting the table and making a case for removing Trump\nSay at the ballot box and twenty twenty or having the Republicans lose the house in twenty eight teen this has been about literally removing Donald Trump from the White House that has been the mobilizing energizing thing that's gotten them all out of bed every day\nEverybody from the drive by media leaders to the Democratic party leaders to the arranged abnormalities that make up a Democrat base [noise] and I mean that specifically I I guess one of the reasons why the range and anger is now so out of\nControl is me cause usually these people are able to accomplish\nMost of this kind of thing against any other Republican they want to destroy Mitt Romney or George W. Bush praying pretty much they know they're going to succeed they've tried everything they know what Trump haven't even made a dent really\nAnd it's all been about\nHaving Trump thrown out of office twenty Fifth Amendment that's now that's not two years down the road day how many times that they brought up the cabinet needs to get together and determine this man's not fifth they they want him out of office every day now\nThe failure compounds the rage look at just some of the issues that were twenty four seven for at least two weeks and then no particular or to hear all of these were designed to take out Donald Trump Christine balls e forward\nThat was a two for that was get rid of Kavanaugh as well in that case they didn't care if they destroyed Brett Kavanaugh's life his family his

time and then there were a couple of days where it made the lead\nHow about the shooting\nAt the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High school in Parkland, Florida\nAnd the creation of a couple of new Democratic Party activists camera hog and I forget the under ...\nHow long did that story go on how big a star did they turn camera hog into and where is he now where is the issue of gun control where is this story and that young people\nHigh school and college students have had enough and they were going to take control of the apparatus that government and they were going to get rid of guns that are going to wipe out the un alright where\nIs that the day what [noise] but\nOh camera hog is still there and the next time something happens that makes him a useful to be brought back to live there he won't be again\n\nMy point is these are all manufactured\n\nTailored people and the issue is based on a happening or a moment but none of it is organic or real when do you mean Russia's sitting there won't be long he's totally real but he's a media creation\n\nAs David ... doesn't have an audience David hog did not literally create a bond neither does okay seal ... these people do not have connections\nWith an audience they don't have connections with voters like Trump paths are like other successful people and maybe you do they have been made media heroes by the media but it isn't real\nLike ... gone but nobody's alarming ... where we miss hawk we may want to see it nobody saying where's hog\n\nI'm that's not a criticism he hasn't had time to build up a connection or an

go I\nI've been way back before that even fell a but hey I've got a theory about this caravan\nThe last two years there's only one\nThing that the Democrats have won on and that's the wall and as a Trump supporter every time the the issue of the law comes up I get aggravated that it's something that they want on income Trump is caved on\nAnd I think that they've done that fit this time just to put an exclamation point on and to emphasize the Trump is not the winner that he says he is\nYou know that's an interesting thought\nThat it that the idea to flood the border to demonstrate that Trump\nDoes not have the wall can't just don't call maybe isn't going to get the wall so maybe people should abandon from do you think that would work\nWell it's not going to work on me but let me tell you as a as a Trump supporter that is the big thing that aggravates me every time you try and want to leave or one of these things to keep the government going that got nothing in it it burns me up\nAt all the time so are you are who are you a little concerned that Trump is not really trying hard enough for the wall\nYou know I I mean I've got a political theories as to why it hasn't happened yet maybe you\nKnow Trump Trump I trust in Trump I I think he knows what he's done a ... it could be that he wants to do their next year right before the election to get everybody energized you know I don't know if he's a ... all I can say these are smarter than I Am\nA maybe but but I uh [noise]\nThey they seem to your theory is really quite insightful but it requires ... for the Democrats to pull it off a lot of Trump voters would have to believe he's not trying not trying hard to and for for the Democrats to capitalize on flooding zone\nWith four thousand people that get into the country just to demonstrate the Trump hasn't been on foot wall that Trump really can't stop these people that Trump therefore as ineffective\nThose people in order to abandon Trump would then have to conclude he's not really trying very hard I I don't even think they would have banned it in this soon yet over\nAll I don't I agree I I Know I'm not and I don't think most of them well\nMy question is what else do they got\nWell they've gotten my behavior a lunatic insane range\nRight but I mean on on Trump they got\nThey got nothing they can they can put up the Trump peasant band that he's promised and that's the that's the uh well that's exactly\nRight and right there that's for and the Trump supporters that we haven't got the wall and we want but it's not even you know that they aren't even begin to foundation yet and I didn't even start so it really aggravates me personally but this is something that\nThey just keep the continuing resolution then leave things to keep the\nOh hey yeah I'm with you all up you're talking about all of the spending bills we've had new budget deals we've had continuing resolutions um we were Democrats can't stop anything in the house they can in the Senate\nWhat what here's what Trump's up against and I'm ... before you go to Todd I Want to get your thoughts on the Trump is still up against the fact that the leaders in both parties do not want that wall\n\nIt's not just the Democrats are opposing Trump on this it's all so there are a lot of Republicans don't want that wall because of Republican donors the Trump is still pretty much fighting the establishment the swamp on that\nThey they didn't want tax cuts either no they didn't and there's\nA lot of other things that they didn't want that he's he's a a that he's come through and he's twisted them a into doing what he wants\nOut and many of the ... I think many of the Republicans have blocked the idea that Trump was going to be a gardener um before now\nI I they are so convinced the media will get rid of whoever the media targets I I think the first is certainly the first six to eight months of two thousand Seventeen\nTrump's first year I think the Republicans didn't do anything to help him because they didn't think he was going to survive and it it that's one of the reasons that the Obamacare repeal and replace didn't go anywhere because the Republicans just bought into the notion that most of the country actually hated Trump despite the fact that he had been elected [noise]\nAnd it's been a slow reversal than a slow realization on a part of the Republicans the Trump is the guy\nAnd the Trump is immensely popular particularly on the Republican side well we'll see if this story on the caravan turning around palm pay or is there a palm pale left Saudi Arabia after having met when king Solomon and Mohammed bin saw him on the crown prince either floated may call\nAnd they have to know the Trump is not going to put up with this and I think that was the message ... talk so I got one report from a peanut the caravan has turned around now if that's true whoever is paying for this\nBecause the\nClimate roast turkey yet Recep Tayyip air to walk he is not one of these guys that wants to western influence as we look on

screeching halt\nWith the murder of democracy Yogi which happened in Turkey [noise]\nIt didn't happen in Saudi Arabia didn't happen at Washington happen in Turkey which is also an Islamic country not happy with the way the Saudis are running Islam\n[noise] there's so much more of this then the drive by is are\nSuggesting 'cause the drive by just want to use this to get Trump\nTo show Trump's ineffectiveness or to show Trump puzzle lined with tyrants or whatever I by the way I was thinking there is one\nIssue that the media and Democrats you have to say had some success and that was the allegation\nThat the Trump Administration was separating children from their parents at the border\nThat when they had some legs that wouldn't work and that might be what this caravan as about\nAs a as well uh even though it was\nTotally manufactured and made up it required the ignorance of a lot of people for it to a I don't mean stupidity ignorance of a lot of people on the policy foreign bat technique allegations separating families at the border\nTo uh to work so up next what I promised that was going to do in the first\nOne hour south of ...\n[noise] now medium we transform for ... for

memory coverage and healthier brain\n\nAnd I think that's a pretty good theory then you add in the chaos that will happen then you throw in the possibilities if they do get to the border and do cross but they wouldn't be separated and that's the one of all those issues and I went through in the last hour that came and went and didn't have any glue or have any legs that went dead\n\nI'll never forget I was out in California I I I got so frustrated I was playing golf with a friend of mine is one of us\n\nAnd it was during the time to drive ... and the Democrats are making all this noise about how Trump separating families\nChildren from their mothers ads and this guy\nWho's up to speed on this stuff's us Russell's pictures look past come on you know the pictures are made up this is Bill Carrick the pictures look bad it looks really bad you don't you're not really fallen for just rushed the pictures look bad we've got to do something pictures Louis oh my gosh\nI I was on the guy was smart enough to know that he was falling for a media trick\nBut at the pictures with what he was telling me was I Can't defend this\nI have people complained to me about Trump's separating ... I can defend the pictures rushed the pictures so that's the one thing that has had legs\nOkay so the audio sound as if you're on hold if you're on the phone just be patient were coming to you ill quick oh this is the soundbite from the hands of the interview last night uh that Fox has been playing all day long to get people's reaction\nI still say that I think there are things that have yet to happen and then I'm going to determine\nOutcomes in some races that we don't know so it's still very hard to predict Kavanaugh feedback reaction was one hundred percent positive for Republicans and Democrats really blew them\nBut the water to thirty five of these things I don't know I just rely on hope which is again naive I don't have survey data I don't trust the it hasn't been the right\nConsistently enough for me the people doing these surveys desperately wants Trump goal and I don't know how they can take that out of their work I don't believe in pure objectivity is like this ... if I put on the spot production but we hold the house and we increase the set of\nBecause I think that's just the I think that's just I think the Democratic party deserves to lose in the single biggest electoral landslide defeat in my lifetime meals they actions they've taken just in the last month\nOkay so that by that bite\nLit up the Fox news channel the day our first stop is America's Newsroom bill hammer a an savannah is Julie ... out there talking to fame ... Republicans strategic wrist Ed Rollins about my comment\nThat as deserve to lose like he's bar act on that front half right on the other front I think will add some Senate cities I think the house is very very much in jeopardy\nWhere you are not buying into his are scenarios they'll hold it Rush Limbaugh said they'd hold it they don't count those flights I Do I ran a congressional committee I've been doing for a long time\nThere are Fifteen seats that are now gone nine of those are the open seats there's another twenty five to thirty that our our seats that are in play only about two or three Democrats seats are in place totally on defense everything has to go our way to basically break even\nLet me run through them I say this is stuff that is going to be honest with you I I Do not get into this stuff this is this is wrong or stuff and to me this is totally absent uh any any what what's the word personality or\nI mean this is just raw numbers are based on data that is the result of polling and I know as well as anybody that polling sometimes is right sometimes it's wrong and and I just sat in the bite\nI'm just suspicious of of polling units because I think I don't think these people can take their passion and their desired\nOutcome out of their work and we know that they know we look in the presidential polls in two thousand sixty and I mean that those people were literally caught short there was no way Donald Trump is going to win it was just not possible Hillary was going to win a landslide maybe not the biggest ever but Trump didn't have a prayer\n\nAnd there was one maybe two polls that showed that he was really in it and couldn't win at Rasmussen was one neighbor ignored\nAnd we've got a replay here see one informs me what makes me make these kind of predictions\nIs reality and as I also mentioned last night since rock Obama was elected in two thousand eight starting in two thousand ten including the midterms in two thousand twelve\nAnd the midterms in two thousand fourteen ... election as you thousands sixteen the Democratic party has lost twelve hundred seats\nThe trend is people voting out Democrats and that was happening\nWhile the Democrats work in the White House with Obama there that could be a factor Obama's gone\nSo maybe the anti Democrat ... is not as high as it used to be when he was there because I Do believe he was a drag on the Democratic party\nBut then I asked myself what has happened in the last two years\nTo make people all of a sudden you want to elect Democrats again\n\nAs everybody's telling us is going to happen house is gone Raj the Senate yeah we're probably pick up a couple of houses gone\nAnd then they said because rush these house races have nothing to do with any of the way you're looking at this these are really local races and they are have have to deal with things that are not on any national radar will not true if these races are being nationalized by the various candidates\nHim [noise] but anyway what has happened to make people all of a sudden stop rejecting Democrats or the Democrats have they done at one eighty are made now performing\nAnd executing an behaving in ways that make people\nLove them again well no not in a just an insane world the Democrats aren't doing anything that would grow support their promoting rage in anger\nAre promoting insanity and a lunatic behavior so then okay maybe as a Trump is there's\nThis much opposition to Trump from people who didn't care one way or the other two years ago\nHas the media succeeded in creating a bunch of anti Trump sentiment\nIn a mid term turnout profile of voters well that would have to be what it is\nBecause the Democrats are not the Democrats say the justice associated with the Democrats are doing his landslide defeat the Democrats are not responsible for anything good happening in this country\nAnd they're not even trying to be associated they don't even trying to claim credit for the economy they did for a couple of weeks they tried on Obama out rumor Obama's trying to say the economy was his\nWell that went on for like a lead the balloon and they died with it so they abandoned map\nAnd outside of that there hasn't been one attempt by the Democrats to associate themselves with anything good happening in America\nThey have in ... dad continued\nTo try and portray America as this unfair\nOn just on deserve\nExceptional superpower that discriminates that violates that ... that [noise] it's all negative so I'm just so where\nIs this body of evidence that suggest the trend of voting against Democrats is reversed again I acknowledge house races are\nNot the same as a presidential race with a national issues of national turnout on balance Shannon Bream last night Fox News at night with Shannon brim a wonders what my strategy was in predicting what I predict\nCome off no polling shows that the Republicans are going to hold onto the house so where do you think that they're coming from with Rush Limbaugh what's the status\nI tend to agree with him um and I think what we could be saying is again the phenomenon ... the Pony Express called the spiral of silence the shy Trump voters the shy breakfast votes as a kind of people who know that it's not a dumb thing necessarily to support a particular view but secretly in the polling booth that's what they do\nThat Steve sheltered and who has a weekend show on Fox and he was instrumental in the Brexit vote in the u._k. and so a reason why what was Limbaugh going this I mean it's not a single pulled out of the shows this happened precisely my point\nIt's not a single poll not a single poll shows so from this where to conclude and these people live and die by polls I'm telling you folks nine out of ten of people in D.C live and die by their gospel and I really think um if I Lived in Washington each and every I don't\nI couldn't I I wouldn't it be ostracized after not too long I just couldn't get with the program living there I have known that for for many many moons so he'll just yeah I tend to agree but I think there's a lot\nJust live their life back in the day we read\nYeah yeah they they can't really ... and their economy now and you know they they said\nNo no\nWell you know kind of typing into my phone [noise]\nThat was basically yeah I don't know yeah yeah yeah well maybe you know uh yeah yeah uh-huh off his\nShoes [noise]\nSadly clueless uh and and credible typical product shepherd goal of the people that Democrats think represent\nTheir future hang on Fox coming back me back before

you doing\nGreat thanks for taking my call\nI was calling I just wanted to make a show that you actually um that you did years and years ago that I thought it was just great which is probably one of the best show ever hacked\nAnd we're really simple and you basically had a roll call and people just called in with their you know start a business here you know small businesses and talk about\nHow they're doing you know when we're there are\nYou know you don't want that was did you hear what you remember there was a a that was it was a period of time it was the early nineties folks\nAnd white collar employees were being laid off\nExecutives and magazines and newspapers like USA Today we're happy they were running stories how wonderful it was that if people are getting laid off it's finally executives it's finally white collar people and not blue collar people [laughter]\nAnd so I decided we did three days of this we took calls\nA ... as as best we can manage it from people who had been laid off in their forties white collar managerial people laid off in their forties or earlier and asked what they were doing about it\nRight and that's what you remember hearing was all these people calling saying\nOne version or another of this is maybe the best thing that ever happened to me because I'm finally focused on doing things I Love I finally have because of necessity I'm I'm I'm looking at at the kind of job I've always wanted to have starting a business or what have you and they were\nThey were all amazingly upbeat and positive about what had happened to them not depressed and down the dumps or angry or anything about\nRight now it was it was just it was just I mean with my my second year in business so I remember I remember it well because I was working in January one or ... or at least one maybe with another a rip off from that other\nThree day things like that but ah right I just I just think it'd be a good a good thing to try you know what I mean just maybe on a friday instead of doing you know Republican good Democrats bad stuff I mean which people the people were bought by um\nWell I don't want to downplay the Republican or Democrat bad thing because there's still\nA whole slew of people who don't get how bad the Democrats are much let me ask you something to do you think that\nPeople need to hear business people calling in describing how great the economy as before they'll believe it\n\nIs that why you want them to hear it so that they'll believe it or you ask what are you thinking some people don't believe it or to doubt it\nNo I just I just think it's a Brotherhood and I think that it's a way to support one another that run an operator own businesses and I don't think that we get enough credit for what we do because you know like most people I ... I work a lot of hours and I'm and I'm grateful for what I make and what I can provide for my family but\nUm it's just it's a great inspiration for the people who do it and we're the people that make make this country work you know so that's all I mean it's it's it's a it's a simple as that way I see\nWell small business small business there's no question that small business is uh the vast majority of of employment in the country in some concerning the backbone well\nOkay I Do remember that we've we've done a couple of instances of this and it is inspiring to listen to individual stories of people describe how they started their businesses and why and how they're working and why\nThey they are working so I appreciate the suggestion I really knew other hosts would maybe get a complex and think GMI failing and the audience is telling me what I but I'm not that week and I'm not I don't have any self doubt so I can take any kind of criticism from any one and not take it personally\nSo don't ever fear folks telling me how you think I ought to do this because everybody else does too here is George thinking this is Lloyd in in in\n... lost in Wisconsin It's your turn Hi\nHow're you doing their young man why not just fine thank you\nAnyway and I was listening to a guy named Donald Trump he was an Iowa discussing how he has done over three billion dollars on the wall so they have been breaking the law you had a caller earlier that did not know that\nWell yeah but there's not a Britain has been all aimed at stopping anybody from crossing is the point his his point was that the Democrats may be trying to illustrate the Trump hasn't gotten that done isn't going to get it done\nMaybe doesn't really care about getting it I remember these people are focused on trying to demonstrate that Trump is a phony is not who he says he is and they want to distance Trump's voters from it but that's all the callers theory was\nHow I don't think that could happen either done too much into little\nTime no I don't either get\nOn the leaders but it was it was his theory as to what the purpose of this caravan is uh I I Know that there have been a little incremental appropriations aimed at building the wall\nBut his point was how many continuing resolutions if we have independent budget deals if we had and then there's not and we have control of the house and control of the Senate and there isn't any money in the wall for it", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Providence", "day": "19"}
