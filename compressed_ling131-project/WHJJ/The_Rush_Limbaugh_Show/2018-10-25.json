what are you what you've been watching what you've been observing over the past six hours what are you see\nWhat I've observed a president who examine leadership ... attack he called for unity response from the liberal media today ... president\nNixon instead of blaming the president take a cue from the president's\nLeadership yesterday called for the country a kind of can gather instead of attacking one another with partisan politics time than behind the president came fall out that the New York times today tell us to publish an article that the fascination and the president of the United states we're twenty four hours from anything I can think they'll ever and how painful and the New York times\nI now I mentioned that through your toward the tail end of the hour they actually did they published a fictional piece by a writer fantasizing over a secret service agent\nTending a Russian agent his gun to assassinate Donald Trump not the president not just the president know named Donald Trump you've got a Russian agent trying to assassinate his gun\nDoes that go off\nAnd so a nearby Secret Service agent hands the Russian assassin his gun says here use mine the times runs this story and they excuses by say well\nWe must published stories that relate to react to live with the Mueller investigation of Trump and put what they've got to deal with Trump being assassinated anyway even if there was something to it which there is not\nAnd and then they're preaching to us why publishing that story they're preaching to everybody about\nCivility and why you need to dial back what Donald Trump is saying into Donald Trump needs to dial it back and Donald Trump needs to the training to Donald Trump the\nMeanwhile they can call him a Nazi they can call him a Hitler or they can lie about the things he says and does all day long with no recourse and that's what Mac and then he's talking about here now isn't the Tonight Show on a top response\nSaying that the president controls ten thousand that's the kind of laugh at it has rally that he was poking fun at the whole idea of oh I'm not going to talk about the things I'm going to be a presidential which is essentially\nSaying to the audience you know what I'm thinking I'm On this morning so that it was ... fall which basically is they can tell if a woman gets actually thought that was her fault for wearing a short time has\nBeen completely inappropriate say that fan on and was responsible for the fake news that they're spreading this is one fault\nBut the ... that offending does\nI Hope of all let me just add a van and that's all I Want to be on the record of Latin python showed up and not culpable\nFor the python culpable for the rhetoric that we're seeing back and forth than anyone an anchor on that network indoors to play in Central Park to pick the me assassinate the president\nSaying that the leader right now you heard Natasha on on top they say you really you you want to be on the record saying that when a pipe bomb showed up how about her analogy that Trump blaming CNN is akin to because they got about\n... is like blaming a I'm a ... a woman who sexually assaulted blaming her for the assault\n[noise] [noise]\nI mean that's that's that's the logic that's the analogy to she used okay so so um the conversation continues here now you'll hear the senior writer for Washington Free beacon lose Harrington or join the conversation at resumed here by by Natasha on atop\nThe kind of rhetoric at the path and I think four years recently commanded fat congressman about bodies planning the reporter he has called the ... the enemy at the people have to pay the legal for anyone who's guiding fellow at about\n... what about the language in the same time than my own hair or in\nIn ten and had a choice cat sort of how the president announcing abhorrent to what America than for black half I Want to be an engineer who can blame it on the president can glean from Sarah Sanders John Brennan echoing that how\nDoes that move at Fort or if it's for that fight have helped the low road President Trump that the highlights Clinton said last week they can have the ability\nRight we cannot have civility [laughter] so what your hand here yet on a top actually trying to blame all of this on Trump\nAnd of course using this\nI'm from the high road and I'm I'm from uh I'm from propriety and so just simply because she's on the on the left now before we go to the break\nWe're going to we're going to we're going to switch gears you've written just a bit to talk about the caravan\n'cause I saw this coming up right after I saw the soundbite that you just heard and I switched over to see it and I caught the governor of Ohio there\nJohn Case it and he is being\nI I don't know who the reporter was at the CNN another matter being interviewed about the caravan and America and how to deal with it\nAnd just I just want you to hear this we have to buy your number one\nWe have a caravan coming north we don't want all those people coming across our border and there are ways to deal with it I Believe that if we would check those who are legitimately in need of asylum can be vetted before they even get to the border\nBut you know why we're born in America you know how lucky we are to be born in America and not be born in Guatemala where they would say to your daughter\nYou know if you don't do what we want we will rape your daughter or we will kill your son if he's not a drug meal\nThey're marching north and you know what it could easily have been all of us that we're in a caravan there were marching north trying to save our families and save our children\nAll right so what is the rule is here or the technique here is a moral equivalence\nThere but for the grace of God go I Phil Donahue your sitters all the time Phil Donahue was hosting the show and when the subject of illegal immigration would come up he wouldn't be he started preaching about the accidents have his birth\nYou know I was born just a few miles inside the U.S border and it's it's what difference it made for me and if they started a stolen the guilt if he felt over how the accent of his birth resulted in him being an American how basically an unfair that was\nTo want to other people in the world as though being born into a country of prosperity and defend the is something to feel guilty about\nAnd\nIt may be something that feels very grateful for I have no quarrel with that but it's how you deal with this\nThat matters we simply can't take and everybody in the world they answered a solution is to spread our area of dominant influence and to get rid of tyrannical regimes and dictatorships which treat their people like dirt\nAnd condemn that and do our best to spread our way of life around under the belief that it's good and decent but there are way too many people don't they were the good guys and they think that the American way of life is an imposition\nTo others we don't have no right to impose our views on people but somehow we ought to stay on the side and let everybody who wants him in\nBecause of our guilt and he\nSays uh you know it they're marching north it could easily have been all of us that we're in a caravan that we're marching north trying to save our families and save our children\n... I got pregnant I'm Sorry but I just I mean you know workers are trained to look for the Cuban looking packages cheesy if you're a joke and it looks like a joke even if I can see that there's something
