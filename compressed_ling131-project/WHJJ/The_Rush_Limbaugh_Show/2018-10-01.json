book\nIt was it was supposed to be a fictional book it was it was a it was a an eight and ... attempt to help him through his problems it was not a memoir and\nIn this book it talks about safe way a lot and he works there didn't work there so she automatically places herself in a safe way where\nHe is Rachel Mitchell found this highly suspicious and like much else that she said impossible to prove\n\nHer report I mean I printed it out it's like six pages here I I it it is\nDevastating the inconsistencies in her stories the variables in her story\nThe fact that none of the stuff that matters can be proven the fact that the people she said in the room the number kept changing from the original letter to subsequent interviews and then to the\nTestimony she had the idea\nThat she was afraid to fly and yet here she is vacationing all over the world how did she get there the idea that she refused to talk to the committee even in California we learn that she didn't even know the committee had offered to fly out there because of the lawyers didn't tell her\nBy the way a couple of Republicans are not demanding an investigation Tom Cotton says we're going to investigate Feinstein we're going to investigate this leak and we're going to investigate these lawyers who may not have told her to the committee was willing to go out there because they believe that she was

corroboration of the charges sixty percent believe Kevin all should be confirmed according to a weekend harbored Harris Poll of a thousand three hundred before the registered voters\nSixty six percent of Americans support the decision to have the FBI investigate that includes eighty percent Democrats sixty nine percent independence with only forty five percent of Republicans who are the smart ones\n\nHuge numbers in the weekend and poll reported seeing parts of it or reading about it forty percent thought she alone was credible\nTwenty three percent thought Kavanaugh was twenty seven percent said both for believable if you combine all that the poll findings indicate sixty seven percent found her credible and fifty percent found him to be\n\nBut the credibility of their testimony doesn't appear to be the decisive factor in ... the question comes down to collaboration is the standard for tipping public opinion on whether Kavanaugh should have some of the high court in terms of

calling these people we don't even know if the people calling him or not Democrat activists to begin with just to create the phone traffic\nMike intention to you is that the me too movement alone\nHas no doubt inspired a lot of women to courageously step up and accused guys that have mistreated them it's not a new phenomenon\nIt's not something for which she deserves all kinds of credit because this is it the tail end of this new awareness insensitivity\nAnd yet\nIt's being spoken of Christine Blasey Ford's testimony on her inspiration is being spoken of as though it's a stand\nAlone and it's never happened before and that adds to her credibility though don't you see\nAnd I think we're all being played oh yeah I Do know I'm not accusing\nI'm not saying women are coming forward I'm saying it's not a new thing that they are\nBelieve me [laughter] talk [laughter]\nGo go ask Harvey Weinstein go ask Matt Lauer and go talk to Les Moonves and asked them if they think that there's

the\nConsciousness raising has been going on since wind staying or even before that but every time there's a\nPublic incident like this involving male abuse or alleged male abuse part and parcel of it and I'm hearing from women all over America who are so thankful to Dr Ford because she has given me the courage to ... the me too movement not work on um\nThe me too movement not give them courage\n\nJust think we're being played here folks\nUm [noise]\nAnd of course it gives flights covered for what he has done\nTo make himself out to be a hero yeah we need more information we need more yeah what's wrong with more information\n[laughter] what's wrong with more information is not the question why do we need to give the Democrats more time to make up a bunch of other information ought to be the suspicion here okay so the Trump soundbites\nThese are from the oval office was during a an announcement\nCeremony for a new trade deal in ... getting rid of it brand new trade deal\nThe drive by Israel under orders not to ask questions about Kavanaugh which meant they ask questions about capital and Trump after making sure enough time was spent on NAFTA started entertaining the are the questions and what we have one in three or four of them here\nAnd here is a Trump ... this is this is not actually in response to question he's just riffing here during the\nCeremony talking about the uh mid term election fake news Kevin ... things\nWe have Senate races that weren't even in play six months ago as you know there are a lot of repression poles or polls there aren't very accurate [noise] we had areas and we had congressional seats to\nWhere I Know it's got to be a positive outcome\nBut you look at what's going on and it doesn't seem to be broadcast that way but I certainly had that with my election [noise]\nThey were telling me I was you know in trouble in certain states that ended up winning like in a landslide and I knew I was going to win them in a landslide but they wouldn't reported that way you know why fake news\nNow during the Q and a Cecilia vague go\nABC News the White House correspondents said in a tweet this weekend as you said it's incorrect to say that you're limiting the scope of the FBI investigation into Kevin what your statement on friday made it very clear you said this investigation must be limited in scope so which is that\nThis is our seventh investigation\nWho has really you know you look at his life until this happened what I'd change he's gone through what his family's gone through the trauma\nFor a man that never had any accusation any he's not a bad state Nevada misled I think he was number one in this class it yeah he was number one in his law school and yeah and then once he's gone through over the last three weeks his incredible [laughter] so\nI Want the FBI this is now their seventh investigation so it's not like you know just starting I Want them to do a very comprehensive investigation\nLet me explain that answer let me let me these soundbites and got to be yeah number thirty coming okay [noise] ... this\nWhole FBI investigation started everybody knows we we heard\nFlake demand a week for his vote one week\nSo that's how the committee vote in Lebanon the pen and paper Kavanaugh with the provides though that flake was not done a vote well I'm a floor vote for final confirmation silly FBI had spent at least a lot of weight walking into this\nSo that NBC runs a story out of nowhere fake news claiming that the White House intends to limit the scope of the FBI was a set up\nIt was a it was a trap\nThey lay in a trap NBC News which is complicit with the Democratic party in most things later trap accusing Trump and the White House of trying to limit the FBI ice go because you see there are things to find the Trump wants to cover it up Donald Trump has had so much\nControl over the FBI the last three years same FBI that's been doing his best to get Donald Trump thrown out of office somehow Donald Trump has been able to walk in there and tell those guys to limit the scope of their investigation\nSo Trump or his I'm not limiting the scope of anything I've told the FBI the look at whatever they need to look at\nOh OK thank you Mr suffered needs to go to we can go to waste some White Houses now claim there aren't any limit to see how this works\nIt was a trap it was a set up and Trump tweeted out he's not limiting the scope NBC is why course they're lying it was set up\n\nAnd so now it's out there that we may not be enough now Fox News is reporting along with Fox Business news\nAt the FBI is saying they might have this wrapped up tomorrow\nBecomes what to do with that if the FBI just finished talking to everybody I talked to\nIn one of the Republicans do with that they hold on to it till friday and art art art or do they move on it\nJust tell you if this ends tomorrow if this is all accurate\nAnd the Democrats here but the Democrats are going to be fit to be tied to the thing didn't go on till friday and they're going to demand they're going to start saying that this thing is rigged they knew what was going to be rigged and they're going to demand even more\nTime to fix the fact that it was read they're going to do that anyway they're not going to let this thing and on friday if we let them have their way this\nInvestigation isn't going to end on friday it won't be long enough besides Trump said\nHe's not going to limit on the FBI so why are they stopping now it isn't possible they could have found everything there is to find on those labels to which the response as well they found nothing in a hundred thousand or more Hillary emails and a couple of days\n\nOr let's say look let's skip forward here to um\n[noise] audio soundbite number

is\nDelayed delayed delayed delay and I'm going to tell you what needs to happen there is an assumption operating out there that needs to be shut down and that assumption is that the investigation\nJeanette has taken place since Kavanaugh was named is somehow insufficient\nAs somehow incomplete somebody needs to stand up and say it's the exact opposite that this is the seven now Trump has but somebody besides have needs to make the point that this has been a thorough\nInvestigation that every last minute Jack in the box that's popped up here has been looked into and the

room she says we're their claim they weren't\n\nThis investigation somebody needs to stand up and vouch for it somebody needs to stand up and promote it it needs to be spoken for\n\nThis has got to be stopped because the it's not real\nThe Democrats are allowed to make it up as they go submit names they want the FBI did talk to\nThey dug it investigations don't work that way FBI follows evidence leads and when they don't find anything on my Bob Mueller face stop\n\nMueller's been looking for collusion with Trump and Russia for two years and has been found anybody is still going and that's

the investigation is taking place there are six separate FBI background checks of Brett Kavanaugh\nSomebody needs to speak up for him somebody needs to vouch for um somebody needs to stand up and say they have been thorough and they haven't found anything or you wouldn't be where he is now sitting on the DC circuit court of appeals\nBut that's not happening somehow weren't letting the media get away with the idea that the investigation here in the Kevin hasn't been half baked lukewarm and or incompetent\nBecause of Christine Blasey Ford coming around at the last minute with no evidence no
