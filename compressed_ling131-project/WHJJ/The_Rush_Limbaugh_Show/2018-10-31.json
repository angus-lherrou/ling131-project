supplying bill said\nHospital staff and personnel gave the president and first lady a standing ovation have you heard about this no oh you're hearing about is the protesters outside wherever the president goes you're hearing about forty four thousand people who signed some petition saying we don't want to hear Mr President\nWe don't want you we don't want your wife we don't want your Jewish pretend daughter we don't want your joints son in law and we don't want any of you here go away but\nTrump goes to the hospital where the professionals treated the wounded and gets a very very warm welcome you don't see that report it\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] um\nThey continue to try to lay the blame on Trump for this and it just wears you out I Know people are telling me it just wears you out every day you get the same thing different degrees of intensity different details in this story but it's the same thing and people\nSay Russia's gonna win them in terms folks there isn't a soul out there who knows who's going to win the midterms\nThere isn't a single person out there who has the slightest idea I don't care what pulling you look at I don't care what professional here talk to I don't care what great really an analyst there is there isn't anybody who knows\nWho's going to win the midterms you have all kinds of people who want to impress you and how smart they are and how analytical they are\nIt's like anything else in the future nobody knows and that's because there are so many races according to the polling data can break either way\nThere are so many that are so close but then when you say that okay do we trust the polling day at a polling data versus two thousand sixteen not all that ... nobody knows bottom line\n\nNate Silver or given exam Nate Silver is considered a girl do you know why I think it was was it two thousand four teen two thousand twelve was one of those two elections were Nate Silver lucked into calling every state on the money\nAnd that seat\nWon the election I go in the past whenever it was gave him this reputation and he's in the tunnel\nSince that won election where he was an infallible he hasn't come close\nDoesn't matter because he came closer was dead on the money when Democrats were victorious he's become a guru he's become a shrink he's become a psychiatrist or psychologist Democrats tuned to Nate Silver to stay sane when the information they're hearing doesn't go the way they want it to go\n... get us in the silver guy nice guy but he's never run a campaign he's never taken a single poll all he does this analyze them\nHe's never participated in a ... even the polling company he's never run a campaign and it's a ... point was you need to temper all these so called experts with some reality\nThat guy hits it on one election that happened to be exactly what the Democrats wanted to hear turned out to be\nTrue and so it becomes a girl wrote and the media continues to cite this in like Nate Silver is out there saying eighty six percent now chances Democrats when the house nobody knows\nSo you can't you can't succumb to the temptation here to go ... and to become flat line and it's hard I I look I Will admit it's hard\nAs I say the human emotional reservoir can only hold so much and at some point it's going to get depleted and maintaining fever pitch energy becomes a challenging thing to do precisely when the news every day is Ninety eight percent slanted Ninety two percent slanted against\nYou and what you believe in and what you want to happen\n\nThe Trump print to end the or the birthright citizenship today the Dems are still mad about it all kinds of experts being trotted\nOut it's unconstitutional no it's certainly constitution no it isn't there you've got Republican leaders that we don't want to go down this road is a silly we're all in favor of his many people getting into countries again Democrats saying the same thing\nBut it's out there it's a conversation starter nothing is going to happen anytime soon the leftist saying yeah conversation started his own of is Trump doesn't really mean it is trying to rile up the base that's where you're wrong Trump\nDoes made it it is about time this was changed we have a crisis brewing\nWe have a crisis burrowing in terms of what kind of country we're going to be what kind of culture is going to dominate in this country and we are under assault by people who don't like the United states of America the way it was founded\nThe snow complicated mistreated this this is what it is that's who the opponents are very hell bent\nAnd they're not going to stop until they until they went another Mahler investigate looking at all of us in the motor investigation trying to come back\nTo life remember I told you I say how many leftist were convinced that Muller by now was going to have issued a report proving trumping colluded with Russia\nYou know how many people on the left believed that\nAnd how many have been thinking all this time that Mahler was timing this release for right before the election was going to happen and if it didn't happen that it would be a leak wanted there would be some kind of education and yet ... zero not at the latest from Muller is it somebody is running a scam on him a sex scandal of some time\nThat they so boring to me I haven't even delved into the details but Muller is saying that people are trying to run a sex scam on him up some kind or tried to or what have you all all I Know is that that's the last thing that the left was counting on Robert Mueller having to say\nIn the days and weeks leading up the election is a big deal psychologically I'm telling you these people really thought you you wouldn't be amazed at how many people\nThat drive by media the American leftist propagandize significant portion of this population they have believed from the first day that Trump first day they herded the Trump stole the election they have believed Mahler has found they believe Mahler was going to find it and didn't find it and it's holding it and it's going to release it to the most opportune time\nSpite the factor in any evidence more there never has been any evidence for because it didn't happen\nIt did happen to between Hillary the Democrats but it didn't happen with Trump there isn't a shred there will not be a shred of evidence and yet\nThey're still holding out hope Mueller and his people trying to remain relevant\nRising from the dead looking like Trump may answer some questions after the election remember the news stories about that how many months maybe over a year now\nHave there been stories about Trump will or won't submit the questioning by Mahler lawyers thinking short lawyers making sure the Trump wants to set the story is but his lawyers say no way\n\nMeanwhile the conversations never happen from never met with mother never answered written questions they weren't submitted a total non story\nThat both sides are participating in the news now is the Trump might speak with smaller after the election might answer some questions after the election\nThe takeaway is that the primary weapon the Democrats thought they had to get rid of Trump and when the house and Senate has fizzled\nIt's not there so they're turning they always do to other things\nWe also have the usual parade of celebrities\nBrain dead idiots celebrities vomiting their opinions throwing away their money we have proven that where you really are not motivated to do anything celebrities advised\nIt has been a long established the celebrities do not move public opinion when nobody is worried about celebrities think or do in that sense because they don't and yet they persist\nWe now have the Oprah we're told the old ... is going to go into Georgia and campaign for the Democrat governor for Georgia Stacey what is your name Abrams what is the last time the Oprah was a factor in an election can anybody telling me\nYou think Obama's first victory was was was it was time to to the Oprah\n\nYou think was helpful\nI Will admit that she didn't hurt me you think if Oprah hadn't been out there doing what the offer was doing it Obama would not have won\nOkay Obama what is still won despite\nWhat the offer was hounded Barbra Streisand Barbra Streisand's out so she's trying to gin up anti Republican vote by promising people to move to Canada if the Republicans hold the house\nDid anybody cares about that other than the people say go get move it's going to motivate me to vote Republican\nAnd how many people on the Democrat oh my God we can't lose bathrooms oh no we can't have him over to Canada we got to vote Denver how many people\nThink that that's going to be the way people take their vote and yet it makes the news\nIt's a big deal that Barbara Streisand who nobody cares about might move to Canada how many Democrats over the years of threatening to leave the United states if they lose the next election and after they lose the next election\nOrganizing energy force behind much of radical liberalism today\nThat white men are the problem from the establishment of the American government is a capitalistic

[noise]\nOkay listen to and again this is Monday Night on CNN it's taken a couple of days for this to reach the mainstream [noise]\n[laughter] ... lemon says it on Monday Night on CNN and its noticed today and again he's talking the\nFreight Cuomo about all the recent shootings in mailed pipe bombs and ... says there was another have filled criminal just last week and can turkey another white man in custody for shooting and killing two African Americans in a grocery store we barely had time to cover\nWe have to stop demonizing people and realize the biggest terror threat in the country is white men most of them radicalized to the right\nAnd we have to start doing something about them there is no travel ban on them\nYou know they have a Muslim ban there is no white guy ban\nNow John Lennon uh what what is your reaction to this I mean there's the folks I'm telling you this is not a one off this is I\nMean the specifics of a white guy bad and invent that may be something that he individually holes with the idea that the opposition\nAs far as the leftist concerned is white men predominantly white Christian man that's that's that on the money that's right exactly where they are aimed in the perverted view of the American left is white men who created this racist and bigoted\nUnfair unjust immoral country do not consider me to be exaggerating here that is what we are up against and this all of this from the from the ... days all the way up through the Obama administration and a real objective has been\nTo transform America away\nFrom the traditions and institutions of the founding based on the fact that it's all racist and it's all bigoted and it's all unjust an unfair they continue to point to slavery as the primary uh\nEvidence the primary example or exhibits\nOf their claim that America is unjust or unfair of course pay no attention to the steps America took to end racism that gets no credit gets no mention whatsoever as far as they're concerned racism and slavery still exist in prisons on the caravan immigration policy you name it\nAnd so this is what's animated and this is certainly what has energized and Phil ... of women all over this country with rage leftist women it's being utilized\nTo what to great effect but that's the single organizing purposes is racial or I was gonna say racist but it's racial in uh in its origins now it covers much more ground than that in terms of its objective but that's their target that's what they're using and had been for a while to energize\nEverybody who is not a white man they're using a victim of allergy and victimhood into a she\nThey are making people think that they have no chance in America as long as white men continue to run it and be at white men or continue to be the majority\nAnd they just continually enraged people they ratchet up the anger there has to be an outlet for it I think they are if you if you want to start attaching if you want to start attaching\nMedia responsibility to the actions of people you notice how quickly they want to do bad notice how quickly on the left the people who commit crimes are not really responsible for it on their own ways the result of environmental things\nAnd so it's a left telling us that these guys are being motivated by Trump they either love Trump or they hate Trump but whatever Trump is making them do these things\nI think it's day if you're gonna if we're going to go down that road never going to start attaching blame the people who don't really have any responsibility for making the bombs or pulling the trigger on the guns who is if that's in raging them like I say you cannot turn on the news today and find a single thing positive about anything\nYou can't you cannot find any reinforcement anywhere in public media for the good innocent decency of America it's quite the exact opposite\nAnd so these people are the vast majority immediate you know they exempt themselves from having any role in all of this while they are eager to try to find anybody else in the media who might be to blame for this\n\nDon Lemon said a stupid Monday Night also that he doesn't see Democrats killing people over politics\nYou mean Don like the followers of black lives matter aren't Republicans in that group look in the number of police officer been murdered Mr lemon by black lives matter

does\nDon't know if one I don't know of a business\nWho ... who who rejects half if not more of their consumers are customers like the news business\nDoes but the news media has a habit negative is is assuming\nAnd then operating on the assumption let whatever thank thank and wherever they care about is what everybody thinks for everybody cares about so I'm not so sure that all that momentum got interrupted\nIf the momentum was interrupted if that energy level decline that wire Trump's rallies still so over the he's got one in Fort Myers like it's Fort Myers\nYeah for thousands of people already wind up Trump's got six rallies plan between now and election day you've got all the way up to the night before the election\nAnd he's pumping a series of themes and one of the themes is how great these past two years have been for the U.S economy reviving moribund industry is bringing back employment bringing back wage increases bringing back a economic confidence\nConsumer confidence in the economy\nUh he's talking about how all the things he wants to do to slow down the illegal immigration and buddy is having to deal with obstacles put on his way by both parties always\nMessages and he remains is upbeat and optimistic as anybody ever has in circumstances like this so whatever is out there in the daily news media is not affecting Trump doesn't affect his mood doesn't affect his uh attitude\nOr anything of the sorts I think a lot of it as wishful thinking I got a lot of this idea that all of this momentum that the Republicans had has been kinda stopped because the pipe bomb and the synagogue shooting\nThis is you know I I circled back to I really don't know what's going to happen on the lecture today and I don't believe anybody else does because we don't have fortune tellers\nAnd all we have is polling data and then yeah that's a toss up you want to believe in the ... not want to believe it is it is it accurate is showing these close races really close we don't know we never know until the aftermath\nHere's Trump tweeting out at Paul Ryan port ranch be focusing on holding the majority rather than giving his opinions on birthright citizenship something he knows nothing about our new Republican majority will work on this closing the immigration loopholes\nThis is about this is this a classic Trump comes out gets a conversation started on a lemon dating birthright citizenship and Paul Ryan is one of the first opponents to speak up\nCriticizing Trump saying why you can't do that that's unconstitutional but you know it's ... I'll tell you what's frustrating to me there is all kinds of great news in this country economic news all kinds of a rebirth and there's evidence up everywhere and the Republican Party itself is not even getting that message out\nI don't know about individual candidates an individual races but the national Republican Party apparatus\nIf it weren't for Trump and his tweets\nAnd his his rallies the American people wouldn't have anywhere near the idea of the decent good things going on out there because Trump's own party is not joining the PR parade on this\nThat's one of the reasons I'm never going to join this crowd and people thinks Trump should stop tweeting and Trump should stop all these ah incendiary things he says why let me ask you\nSome people it's horrible what Trump said about poor why\nIs that why is it that want to use it at\nA problem the Paul Ryan took the first chance he had to disagree with his own president about this and by the way all this this is a conversation starter right now\n\nIt's it's mandatory it's necessary that we have a conversation as we don't get a handle on this immigration problem you can say goodbye to America is you know it\nWhich is\nThe design that's one of the reasons why the supporters are what they are Mollie Hemingway it was a great\nPiece today [noise] speaking of Kevin ... it's just right on the money and let me ask you a question\nDuring the Kavanaugh hearings remember all the Democrats questioning Kevin I remember all of the allegations we had balls the Ford with her allegations of one of our capital I did that led to the fact that Kevin all the spiking punch with drugs to set women up for serial rape we had all of these women that were dragging forward\nClaiming they had evidence of it none of them ever present as any\nBut the media and the Democratic party were hell bent on convincing everybody that Kevin was such a rotten guy that his life and career deserve to be destroyed\nSo\nAfter Kavanaugh's named to the Supreme Court he is he passes it gets ... ... ... the confirmation vote and is in sworn in why did the media drop it\n\nIf Kavanaugh was such a rotten S. O. B.\nY. has the media stopped its investigation\nRemember all the Democrats are yeah yeah I would've Kavanaugh's confirmed we're going to a piece you were going to throw out of there we're going to get rid of those guys are represented serial rapist where is all that just it's gone is it not\n\nMollie Hemingway if the media and other Democrat leaders wanted to have any credibility of all that the post tearing release of multiple allegations was not a pure political ...\nFor which they were willing to destroy a man why they continue to fight for justice everyday wouldn't they they'd still be out there trying to nail Kavanaugh if all of that was legit\nIf if everything Kavanaugh was accused of being was actually true as they would not have stopped at him being confirmed on the Supreme Court they would still be out there right because of justice\n\nThey would be out there asking every democratic candidate whether he believes Ford and supported impeaching Kevin why are they doing that there is a big campaign going Kevin always will be rallying point Kevin always a reason to deny the Republicans continued leadership in the house\nSo why isn't the media asking every Democrat candidate running for office\nTheir opinion if Kavanaugh did you believe balls the Ford and if you did do you still support impeaching capital where are these questions\nThe reason those questions are being asked of the reason why the media isn't doing is just because it was all trumped up it was manufactured none of it was true it was a classic Democrat operation like every damn one of these is\nNone of what they were saying about Kevin always true it was manufactured they didn't bring balls the Ford up until the ...\nAnd as a Hail Mary if balls the Ford were actually telling the truth she would have been one of the first witnesses she would have been one of the primary ways the Democrats sought to get rid of capital but they had this little requests from her\nNot Jimmy made fun of laying eyes terrify the here and so they had a built in excuse not to use it that was convenient\nHis whole thing was manufactured the whole thing was made up\nYour Republicans running for office have you ever been debates left you need to start asking your Democrat opponents they still opposed Kevin all don't let them get away with dying they ask you ask them if they still support Kevin ... or oppose Kevin I asked them if they are going to demand that he'd be impeached if they win reelection or election\nIf this Kevin all thing is going to work it's going to have to be turned back on the Democrats the Republicans running for office are going to have to keep bringing this up either in campaign ads we've got a week it's not too late to include this in any ad campaign if if it's been decided to leave it out\nNot too late to cut some new ads and re inserted\nPeople need to be reminded\nLet's pretend that some of the momentum was lost all okay we've got plenty of time we got the E R B network got all kinds of ways to remind people what happened to Brett Kavanaugh who did it what its purpose was and the proof that it was a series of lies and made up charges\nAs evidenced by the fact that now there's not a single story about it\nBecause the media lost the Democrats lost in their effort to destroy Kevin ... they lost in their attempt to use Kavanaugh to hurt Democrat hurt Republicans in the in the mid term elections\nHere's another one is that Kevin confirmation circus we're about justice for his alleged victims the women\nInstead of about killing his nomination by any means we'd still be getting updates on the story Woodley I mean if it was really the purpose\nAbout getting justice if it was to make sure that these women\nThat were sold on the line and so abused in Seoul raped by Kevin ... is the point of all that wants to get justice for them then why is justice not being sought any longer\nBut you put your index finger on the digital crowned the knob of the

this is a Ella image great to have you here with us Hi\nThank you so much closer to my call I was a twelfth grade American history teacher for Twenty years and I finally had to\nLeave because ... ... was becoming mine and I handle I started writing my own cause course church because I couldn't handle how they had Wi Fi is American history so reason I called the ... topic on immigration\nIntegration in general the book probably gets about one paragraph\nBut most people don't understand is when ... million people came over\nTo Ellis Island we didn't just open our ... come on in a way to Democrats want it now these people were given a thorough examination by at the ship especially looking after I take a device him like open up\nThe upper eyelids and if you had a disease called trek karma you were automatically let go a mate you walk up and down steps to make sure that you are strong and we're not when that no one to ship doctor perform chance examination you were put on a ship\nAnd you were sent to Alice island where they gave you a ... examination doing that check call ... exam once again\nWalking up and down the steps\nAnd if you didn't make it you were sent back about two percent of the people were sent back and the reason why it was so low is because to ship doctor\nReally did have if you were sent back they ship had to pay for your passage back to Europe so they want to make sure we did not want any on that quite not work\nWhich are not healthy and watch not strong\nYou realize that you know what you're describing is factually correct there are people listening to you today who think my God America was cruel back then\nYou have I that's what people are thinking listening to retell the story\nI'm sure they probably are because they've never heard it and we were compassionate to those who couldn't work\nUm there was a saying that sat I heard in America they had streets then I heard the streets were paved with gold and then I found out I was kind of be the one page Street's\nBut we did not want people would be on welfare we did not want those people\nWe want it only strong healthy people\nThat's been totally left out of history books and I can't tell you how much it frustrates me\nTo listen to these Democrats talk about how wonderful it we all know how to fight not true I have a nine year old grandson and I just shudder to think about the kind of history he's going to be learning it's\nUm I don't get on giving him for Christmas one if you're ...\nOh wow I very was hurt\nBecause I think that where's he going to get it is not going to learn it probably was on ... all revised they can't even a paragraph to maybe Benjamin Franklin\nTry a paragraph Abraham Lincoln I John Silver Boston University at Boston University of way back in the nineties\nDid a survey and the most popular high school history textbook and found one paragraph in reference to Abraham Lincoln one paragraph there were pages devoted to Bill Clinton\nFor example in and American history\nThe name that you want to know is Howard Zinn Howard's in as a textbook writer as a as a as a as quite as I socialist Marxist and he somehow has been a gold\nThe vast majority of text books purchased for use in American public schools have been written by this guy but you know you remind me of so your story about Ellis Island I Need to tell this story again\nBecause immigration has been a subject for as long as I've been hosting the program so over Thirty years in one white thank you very much a Ella for the call I really I'm I'm Glad you got through to remind us about Alice Alice I not only by the way we're checking people's health\nThey were determining whether or not people actually wanted to be Americans it was a restrictive process\nWe were much newer and younger country them and we had an entirely different attitude about immigration and growth and it was required that immigrants assimilate and it was required that they be healthy we we're not going to open the borders to illness\nWe we're not going to expose the American people do things through accidents or or design but more importantly the immigrants who were\nAllowed in had to demonstrate that they wanted to be Americans they had to demonstrate that they love America\nThe young people in that in that room erupted into a pain standing ovation\nAnd I said to myself well it's all over the environmentalist wackos with this age group have one\nMore than any technical advanced what're achievement more than any cool aspect to movies gives most of the fact that there was a hundred percent recycled it just these kids have been told that climate change is destroying the habitat that there may not be\nAway for life to be sustained when they hit sixty five you'd be amazed at the number of young people who have been brainwashed and propagandize to believe that and so the fact of Apple's introduced a little bitty computer here and it's made a one hundred percent recycled aluminum was the big news of the day\n[noise] holy smokes now let's go to the audio soundbites vis vis folks\nI talked about this earlier here's the evidence first up Jake Tapper CNN with Erin Burnett last night\nThe president of the United states making a controversial visit to Pittsburgh today after the deadliest attack on Jews in American history\nPresident was greeted by hungry protesters singing this land is your land protesters with signs saying the president's not welcome until he saw what they perceived to be solved on immigration and refugee the protests are not surprising is\nOf course not after you protest or not support what what does\nImmigration refugees have to do with this event anyway why are these protesters there okay so here's Jake Tapper the protests are not surprising it's totally understandable nobody wanted Trump here Columbus hated Trump is reviled everybody wishes Trump was not a ... and then three did gum they wish they would just leave\nSo now we go to the University of Pittsburgh Medical center President Trump's first lady you Monica\nTrump Jared Kushner walking through the halls to visit people wounded in the

thank you Mr President we love you thank you can I shake your hand thanks so much thanks so much thank you so much thank you President Trump\n\nBut wait a minute Jake Tapper said the protest they're not surprised nobody wanted the president there and it's not just Jake Tapper everybody in a drive by Mr President your sham trip and I thought this was not to replace you know business going they don't want you to forty five thousand people signed a petition asking him not to\nCome oh wait we're not through we stay at the University of Pittsburgh Medical center\nAnd now I'm a lot of the first lady and if Monica Trump gets some love to\nThank you very rainy and came home I\nThink your grandmother had her name is good you have ...\nThat was a male employee looking at Jared questionnaire saying nobody ever heard of you laughing at his wife was a bigger star that's fine no problem eat everybody laughing about it from my point is you're not going to see this anywhere I mentioned it to you in the opening our of the program that this is what happened\nThere are thousands of people already in line in Fort Myers awaiting a Trump\nThere later tonight [noise] but nobody wants Donald Trump anywhere she everybody hates\nEverybody's spices drop everybody regrets that they voted for everybody can't wait to vote for Democrats sort of Trump can't do anything you know everybody wants to Democrats back in power so they can start investigating Trump and get rid of it that your drive by media\n\nThey don't show you the reaction of real people you will not see those videos you will not hear that audio anywhere\nUnder the ... one of your personality or modify Rush Limbaugh on the\nWide jaw ruled brutalized law enforcement officers gunned down\nThese are the victims of illegal

right\nThe leadership of President Trump's new\nPass Kevin McCarthy is built the wall and enforce the law act\n... [noise]\nYou have everybody in the world out there disagreeing with it but the purpose of it is to start the conversation Trump is done that that's what's conservatism was as a form of movement back in Nineteen sixty four [noise]\nUh and there are those examples where were you know that that somebody's gonna lose either at a local race or a presidential race but in mid term elections I can I can show you count was ... in two thousand ten\nWhen the Republicans picked up sixty three seats nobody forecast that the closest I remember to anybody forecasting a massive Republican takeover was none other\nThan the prince of darkness in himself Robert Novak back in Nineteen Ninety four predicted I think to within two seats the Republican takeover of a house in those elections I think we one fifty four seats are forty something out of he predicted was off by two\nBut nobody predicted the Republicans are gonna pick ups sixty three seats in two thousand ten\nI mean the media didn't want to think anything was even possible because of so much love and devotion respect for Obama and then when it happened you should've seen in if you remember the bottom fell out the window and it just totally came out of their sales in two thousand two\nEverybody thought\nEverybody did Democrats were going to walk away with the house of representatives 'cause everybody hated Bush\nBush was not duly elected Bush stole the election and the Florida recount with the help of a twisted Supreme Court and Democrats did the Wellstone memorial and that was going to galvanize Democrats all over the country to show up and vote and there was no way at what happened Republicans\nGained ... seats\nThe left was done that drive by media couldn't believe it so they're examples even when people are dams certain what's gonna happen\nThey ended up being surprised the brightest minds the greatest go rose the most heralded analysts\nAnd it's all about presenting an image of making it look like you know what you're talking about more than anybody else does I have here is from uh motives are real clear politics by one of the written down the\nWhole analyst and data and listeria Sean ... day I'm not going to read the whole thing it prints out the four pages bought the headline here on certain days in the womb as men terms and her final stretch\nNominate\nTell you what this long piece says I can do this long piece in three words we know nothing\n\nOn certain days alone as many germs that her final stretch\nThe twenty eight ten midterms are working their way toward a conclusion in a week we should find Leno who will control the house although at the outcomes close it could take weeks to finish counting ballots in California\nThe consensus view is that the Democrats are favored to take the house of representatives analyst disagree on just how large the majority they're going to win is\nAnd how likely that majority is if you split the real clear politics toss ups in half\nThat's much polls it results in Democrats gaining about twenty five seats\nFor a narrow two hundred and twenty two hundred and fifty and majority\nI tend to think says Mr trend day that the toss ups will break disproportionately toward Democrats and see something more on the order of up to twenty five to two hundred Ken Democratic majority\nBut this is hair splitting to a certain degree okay so here he says in the second paragraph it's all over and it's a Democrat's two hundred and twenty five states are Republicans with two hundred and ten next paragraph\nAt the same time this isn't the only way to read that data the Democrat pickups could be larger but they could also be smaller here are some things that shouldn't bother\nAny sober minded elections analyst in the final week of the election why we just concluded here and as the Democrats are gonna end up with two hundred and twenty five seats the Republicans two hundred and ten so why do we analyze any further because the truth is we don't know\nThose are my where it's not just ... days [noise]\nHis words resume here will there be a late break as we learned in two thousand sixteen and in a less dramatic fashion and two thousand fourteen a late breaking the races can altered the landscape substantially this year there are a lot of undecided voters remaining\nLook at the most recent house polling from the New York times Sienna in some races and get to the gym membership numbers\nThis adds up to a situation where a slight break in the undecideds toward one party or the other could be the difference between a healthy Democratic majority and I swam Republican but wait he's are these are predicted to twenty five to ... I'm not harping on Mr trend day here\nIs we don't know he's given you here's Beth gas but now he's giving you every reason\nIn the world is ... ... to ... to ... you can think of where it might turn out that way\nGiven the closeness of many races and the president's improving overall job approval it is also unclear how do evaluate all of this in the current cycle\nWell then how did you get to two twenty five to ten if it's really unclear how to evaluate all this [laughter] but that's just me into being smart alec\nUh in New York's twenty second congressional district Sienna college places the president's job approval at fifty three percent so Republican representative Claudia Tenney as possibly in better shape than her polling numbers suggests but what about the nineteenth\nRepresentative John Faso is up by appointment the president's job approval is at a forty six forty nine split\nThat suggest a very close race and there are likely a lot\nSo Trump's on the ballot or he isn't\nIs it going to matter what Trump's approval number is in some of these house races or is it not\n[noise] anybody who thinks Trump's not on the ballot here leads to reexamine things\n[noise] and then the next burgers how many votes are Democrats wasting one of the biggest news stories this cycle has been in the massive influx of money and to Democrats campaigns this initially showed up and marquee\nRaces like Beto O'Rourke challenge of Ted Cruz but it has since filtered down into more marginal races like Indiana's nines or California's first or a outer Mongolia of seven\nAnd all of this is relevant because Democrats right now have a roughly seven and a half point lead and the generic ballot\nWhich asks which party would you prefer to have control of Congress now normally this would be enough to flip the majority but if Democrats run up the score in districts that are unlikely to win suddenly that seven point margin translates into a closer than expected seats but then there's another consideration and that's how correlated army errors\nMeaning how 'bout liable aren't them they [laughter]\nAnd then the next ... are we're relying too much on one poster oh that's a pretty straightforward concern and then the next one is\nEarly voting telling us well the pet response is nothing but that's too simple early voting returns usually tell us something but unfortunately they can only be deciphered in retrospect meaning\nWe don't know the early voting is still it's over\nWe're not counting votes yet so all we know is party turnout but we don't know how these people have voted nobody does the only way you can determine early voting is after the election is over but yet we're still going to talk about it [noise] so the final paragraph what else\nIs lurking out there
