and I both agree we would never have seen a Twenty one percent corporate tax rate right ah and we were not never seen across the board\nBy the way this comes from two people who under the Republican tax plan promoted by Donald Trump\nPay more in taxes\n[laughter] yeah [laughter] [noise] you know it and you know the Trump said that they wanted to get a tax cut done during the lame duck session oh man God we don't know\nWe don't want another that Scott Eric and I don't want another tax cut yeah stop it with their\nTax [laughter] stop at a stop\nTo do right now talking to Republicans stomp with your tax cuts stupid taxes because lately when you do a tax cut Eric and I get a tax increase I don't know how that works and John Allen I resent now that I knew that get us one way or another dang it I knew they'd get us [laughter] after all these years have poured this is what I\nGuess [laughter] that's put trial\nNow but we still agree even though our taxes increased we ah agree overall with the with the the tax plan without question\nBut some of the economic things would disagree with the way that the president's promoted terrorists than we've had some ... not really much debate on it because we explain the economics of it and most of the response when we talked about earlier about some people even on the right not wanting to debate it's well oh he's a great businessman ... that doesn't justify that's about an opinion\nIt's not an opinion on on the at an actual economics\nSo really people don't want to do when we have a ... when we talk tariffs really nobody wishes to have a debate on that am I Am I correct right I don't know anybody that's really wished avid debate\nA closest we came last week when a guy called up and said but yeah but it's helped my business and and and

couldn't list like the president for some of the things he's done that's fine and dandy we can talk about that in the arena of ideas sure to ... ... the president and say he's worse than ISIS and that his followers are like the the followers of ISIS the members of ISIS\nThat will kill innocent men women and children is just as reprehensible and hate filled more than anything that I Know any Republican\nIn recent memory has ever said yes\nAnd and that is too because what again when we talk about the the ... what is it that you're trying to portray how is it that you're trying to label the president as a major and in this case immediate threat\n\nThat he is radicalized that it's not just him that he was radicalized a great number of people that are also a threat to you\n\nThat they would attack you the way that ISIS would attack you\n\nI I haven't seen\nCorrect me if I'm wrong maybe someone else has seen it I haven't seen a group of Trump supporters shouting people out of a restaurant or even have you people wearing making ah America the great again hats shouting people out of a\nRestaurant there there was some group that followed pillows\nOr that was a couple of weeks ago\nMm okay\nAnd and by the way immediately condemned by all by almost every Republican I'm there saying don't do that yeah don't do the tactics that they do don't do it yeah and I guess that's the only instance we sing yeah okay well you\nCertainly get well he wanted at at at the rallies but I mean where is where is the same kind of behavior I'm Talking about on the level that the left has behaved and in which the lenses behave well chasing them down at airports chasing them out of restaurants well the behaving like that and they'll send it to the\nThe thing that one of the things they've got that comes up every time\nOne of the major points it's brought up every single time and has for a while the Trump is creating instability by stadium you know by being part of the chant lock her up lock her up lock her up\nAs we've said before though that's not an uncivil comment that's a comment based on the fact is we have said before of many people believing that Hillary Clinton should legitimately be in jail\nWell it is based on the fact that she broke the law that is recognized I don't know who doesn't recognize that fat right she just wasn't prosecuted for breaking\nThe law hope the SP espionage law and the ... of trying to avoid the freedom of Information Act law by putting the server in her home\n\nAnd we have gone through this ... the actual law and even called me said well yeah yeah but no reasonable prosecutor would if because we've never fought an instance like this yeah because you'd never had a secretary of state that put a private server in their home\nTo avoid the freedom of Information Act and to allow foreign entities and she knows that she's smart enough former first lady former senator secretary of state to know that our enemies are looking for anything that's on secured mhm\nBut thinking and believing though that's okay we know what the intent was Ian ... everybody knows with the intent was\nWant to keep stuff private I don't want it to be documented by the government as is law to be archived by the government right now they're law Airforce subject to freedom of information that right\nThat's what like lock her up to about it's not about locking up because she ran against Trump son about locking her up because she's married to bill ...\nIt's not like in Iraq because they produce the offspring of Chelsea Clinton who now wants is is expressing interest in running for political office\nWell it's not no it's not based on rhetoric is based on a fat right that she broke the law and that she is not above the law\nNow you may disagree with their analysis but you cannot disagree with the fact that back up what they are saying\n\nAnd so they use it by the way they use that every single time and the like the last month where I've seen them saying well let's see what you're saying that the lock her up lock her up that's on civil that's a no it's not meant to be it's actually it's meant to promote civility but you locked up people that have committed crimes right but you believe in committed crimes right\nI mean\nThat's something that has provable by the way that fact that basis is not debatable right the actual facts in the case nobody has\nYou didn't know she hasn't gone to trial or she hasn't gone to ... you're right but nobody debate backs\nRight and nobody debates what the law states right it's simply call me who hated Trump they didn't want a prosecutor now\nWe know the whole story when we've been through it before we've gone through the law specifically we went through the first draft of as we know the first draft of analyzing Hillary Clinton what she did and how they changed the language of it because the language that they originally had was the exact context of the law that she broke\nRight that she was not prosecuted for she broke a lot this is the fact she broke the law but was not prosecuted more ...\n... and that's why they state lock her up it's not a hateful comments know you want to get in

the midterm elections we've talked about the strong and weak points for the Republicans a and the strongly points for the the Democrats one thing the Democrats brought up\nA now we think they may have had it too late but it still doesn't mean that people don't recognize that especially\nIf you know this is this was a time of the year when all of us I mean we here at at at our job\nAt a put in for you know benefits you're the last uh ten days or so a lot of other companies are doing it a Obamacare but you know premiums are are coming in now and we had said this back then that the Republicans left this thing wide open\nThat you know they did a horrible job\nOr a you know when it came to especially premiums that we're going to sky rocket\nAnd we said they got to come up with something as to what they're going to do and they really happened\nAnd Newt Gingrich wrote an article for Fox News and so the twenty Eighteen mid term elections were less than two weeks away there's just three days ago and many polls show there was a sizable block of independent voters were not yet made up their minds at the same time health care remains the number one issue for the American people\nThe best way for the Republicans to earn the boats are these undecided voters an honor commitments to the Republicans who are already support them urge to clearly articulate how they would fix the broken healthcare system\nAnd he goes through the whole thing that the should be Republican principles up for the for America as a Republican principles for America's health and health care system we believe that every American should have the opportunity to live a long and healthy life supported by a healthcare system but it's simple\nUse innovative and affordable we believe that every American should of his or her choice of the doctors and insurance that meets his or her specific needs we believe the healthcare system should be transparent about health care cost\nAnd quality of treatment options and that this information should be available to every American in a simple understandable wasteful patients can make better decisions about their own health we believe in protecting patients\nWith preexisting conditions so they can obtain affordable health insurance coverage we believe in the importance of American Medical innovation that leads the to the breakthroughs that dramatically improve\nHealth outcomes false significantly lowering costs we believe that a doctor patient relationship\nIs the center of ineffective healthcare system and it should not be disrupted by micro management from public and private bureaucracies we believe American seniors have ruined their health care benefits and that they their families and their doctors should make their own medical decisions not an elected government boards bureaucrats are private third party\nPayers are middle men we believe in a competitive healthcare market where private sector innovation works to strengthen public programs one size fits all government controlled healthcare\nInterferes with doctor patient relationship knee caps new medical breakthroughs provides less has access to treatment and leads to long wait times for critical care we believe that the current health care system\nIn America is far too expensive while it is very good at treating people when they become sick it is much less effective\nIn helping Americans remain healthy which is equally as important we believe the goal of health reform should be to build on what's working and fix what's not destroying what's good about our healthcare system in an attempt to fix what's bad is not acceptable step towards a better future and then he goes on to the\nRepublican accomplishments and they go to the accomplishments you know including eliminating the Obamacare individual mandate\nUh the uh uh six billion new to fight opioid epidemic in the past the right to try legislation passes stored VA mission\nOr the Trump Administration providing more affordable health care options for Americans through association health care plans in short term limited duration plans so they go through that there's ten different ones there then they say the Republican promises for additional improvements\nIf the American people reelect Republicans to a majority in the house and Senate we pledge to enact a series of practical and specific changes based on what works in the public and private sectors to build a better healthcare system the system will keep people healthy and provide effective treatments and economic security for those who get sick\nThese legislative changes will and they go to the pre existing condition which really goes back to the block grant right", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "year": "2018", "city":
