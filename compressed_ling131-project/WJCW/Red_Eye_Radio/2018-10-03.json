was recorded during the polygraph that you know they they ask\nFor that before the hearing they ask for that ah\nThe weekend before the ... the hearing a couple of weekends ago and her attorney basically said\nNo it's not relevant of course that's relevant because you said that she took and passed a polygraph test well we need to see the methodology and the polygraph test to see\nThat you know what questions were asked um and and again how the how the process on that level of work I think that's fair\nYou know the thing is when you make an allegation you have to be willing to provide all the evidence that you have used to cooperate yep you're allegation to begin which which is a lie detector test right if you don't and and nobody is above it I'm sure somebody has brought that up but\nThat has to be brought up because just like the fact that when you use and said these are the witnesses these people witness it and they say no and then you say I took a polygraph a test will have you ever helped anybody else take a polygraph test you know in in you know trying to beat is what they're trying to say no I never did well when you get a sworn witness dating\nNope I Know she I I you know I Know she did well then you want all relevant notes\nBecause she is using the she is using the polygraph as cooperation that there is credibility tour accusation therefore she should be

Harris Poll on Kavanaugh nomination and or other things ... and this post testimony\nOr after the testimony and murdered majority of voters eighty nine percent has watched or heard about the Kavanaugh hearings washed her her while right up right those two groups though\nAre the\nMajority of voters agreed with the Senate decision to lay the vote by a week and involved the FBI just search for cooperating evidence yet the FBI review finds no cooperating evidence sixty percent of voters support the confirmation of capital ...\nUh when it came to a ...\nThe the\n... uh Dianne Feinstein here was Seventy five percent of Americans ... disagreed with the fact that she kept the\nLetter yeah right she should have given it to the so they she's not winning that one at all\nNo not at all and you know because for Democrats are liberals they would see that as look you could have done something early on about this and it would have been a bigger story a potentially if you would have done something about\nThat and then in for a the conservatives or or Republicans and maybe even people in the middle she violated she violated essentially the process and the rules\n\nAnd and I think you you know then usually you can move on to the who leaked did about Ford because the Democrats claiming you know they wanted to help protect her but yet it's clear now that they're the ones who leaked it to the media in order to out her\n\nIn order to make the story public\nIs Seventy five percent of voters believe that Senator Dianne Feinstein should have immediately turned over the letter a from Christine forward to the Senate Judiciary committee in July ... when she received it which means Republicans have made their point there yep\nOn other issues are ... a Russian investigation ...\nAmericans want transparency when it comes to how and why the investigation was launched\nSixty five percent of Americans this polls just done by the way sixty five percent of Americans say it's important to turnover evidence from the FBI and the Justice Department to clear the air in how the investigation was started\nTwo thirds of American voters want an investigation into potential abuses at the FBI although voters are split and on whether or not biased played a role in launching the investigation fifty two percent said buys played a role\nForty eight percent say biased didn't play a role but two thirds of Americans believe\nAnd I would say that if you say forty eight percent said there was no bias or in the role in fifty two percent said there is bias the fact that you have sixty six percent\nAmerican voters favor an investigation that means many that believe biased didn't play a role believe it should be investigated anyway you're talking about again the independence there goes your independence and her saying okay I'm not sure maybe I don't think so but yeah I think an investigation should be done\nRight\nSo that sixty five percent of American of voters favor a that investigation where we are right now\nThe FBI report could be released only to the Senate will not be made public unless it's late uh yeah excuse me it won't be made public until it leaks\nAnd then liberals will be screaming for transparency the first time they screamed transparency ah regarding the FBI and oh I don't know roughly I'm just taking a gas the last couple of years or so\n\nOr you know it's interesting that seems like a after a two years Americans are paying attention to probably do the Russian investigation to sixty five percent of Americans mold\nOr a you know believe that the investigation or you know into the FBI and department of justice or to see how the investigation started ... a is a is warranted hey maybe there's a couple of Democrats and they're like we said that believe that Trump committed collusion", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "city": "Johnson City", "day": "03"}
