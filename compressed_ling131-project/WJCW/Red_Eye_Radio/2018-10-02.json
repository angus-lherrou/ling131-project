Republican senators have come to the White House the stress that they expect to complete investigation and the FBI reviews on vacations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh correspond until medically explains the process\nOf White House has to order it than the FBI goes does its interviews does this review\nMentions that information back to the White House the White House and then send that to the Senate all one hundred senators because it's the Supreme Court nomination will have access to that information but they'll have to read it in a private room that information cannot be released publically only very limited number of staffers will have access to that information\nSo that raises a key question that I've been telling me a lot of senators and top aides about how is the public or how are the center is going to be able to talk about what they find out what the FBI sent back\nResidents Trump is handling his revamped growth American trade agreement with Canada and Mexico\nPen set in his up a polling that ah concluded that independents are the ones that are most open to changing their view ... based on the the FBI findings and as we've subtle along we ... we get this all the time we talk about look if you get out there and you have a consistent message\nAt and and it's a it's a good message you will convince the independence and that's what we've always stayed and we've always receive are the response but you can't convince everybody we're not attempted to convince everybody that that's the wrong premise you're not attempting to convince everyone the poll found that even if\nUh he ... the the FBI comes out and finds no cooperation sixty percent of Democrats still don't want him confirmed ... will do\nIt can be it could be Mother Teresa alive [laughter] and and they\nWould still not want him to be a a confirmed the point is a ... is the evidence there to make her testimony credible and it absolutely is not and that's the message that you need to get about you know you need to get across\nTo be a consistent message there you go to social media and the questions are being asked\nAre just are just bizarre and if you look at the media and that's why we started off the show with us and when you look at what a a very example the the the uh uh a Yale\nI'm\nOf the the person who went to Yale with a glass having other classmates and you know when she came across instead of if you only get said this and then you look at his testimony well he did say that they're actually to the point now where the liberals this is how bad is you're asking will they ever get off the brink lower to the point\nWhere they're making an accusation he's line really yes he should've said this well he did see he's line no but you said if he said this wouldn't be line nobody's line but he said this I mean that's where we\nAre right in the media carries the exam media gives it life because here's here's the difference\nIf you look at the case of the New York times talking about the the ah the accusations made in the New Yorker piece\nThey this is what they wanted to do they want to do their their tactic on this story this claim was to go find an interview as many people as possible to see if they had first hand knowledge of this happening they couldn't find want\nNBC goes out and says well we couldn't find anybody to back it up but we're going to put her on any way the Gail classmate\nActually makes a statement that parallels what Kavanaugh said and said if you said this then I wouldn't have a problem\nBut still the media carries the story because what you're looking to do is it if I were writing that story if it were my work to put that story into print or put it on TV or anywhere else\nIt would be my approach to say\nUh this is going to be torn to shreds because what she said and I need to go back over to this is what I Would do I would get the transcript\nAnd I would read it and read it again because she's claiming the classmate is claiming he didn't say something when he did it's an all out lie but if you're in the media and you're taking that story to print a TV to whatever you're part of the lie\nBecause it took another media organization to tear it down and say well I'm actually he did say that or does it ever feel like that and and and this does not come from\nArrogance whatsoever because you know that we refer to ourselves as a two idiots overnight\nBut does anyone ever get the feeling and this is a doesn't include just you and me are but everybody listening right there does it ever get to the point where you just think to yourself dealing\nWith the Democrats right now the mainstream Democrats is like dealing with our children\nYes any excuses the children will give\nYeah and I'm not saying that are out of meanness I'm Talking about the arguments that they are making you know you and I said this uh last week said\nThe American people when you basically they understand due process\nAnd if you talk about the due process and what the Democrats are doing here or not you know the belief and you know that you're innocent until proven guilty the the the fact of what they used to claim they cared about ... you know that's what the liberals are to care about and the fact they don't and I said but if you keep pushing it the majority of Americans\nDo believe in that\nEven Democrats would say they won't vote for cabinet they still view this as a cheap shot against him\nYes they viewed as if\nYou if you get them alone and you ask them they'll tell you that oh by the way one of the uh people that I Know on social media that uh doesn't talk much used to talk more as a liberal and has been quiet over the last year\nCame out in favor of Kavanaugh\nWow and ended in a very subtle way and I was like wow but if you actually talk to Democrats run out they're not happy with the way that the ... the the this is actually going\nOr they won't come out publicly and criticize their party for what they're doing but they feel very uncomfortable and they understand there's no evidence here they understand and then they see this just rolling and ... and that's the whole point\nThat many Republicans look at this and go wow are you kidding me they are going down this path and now they're they're just taking anonymous sources and throwing it out I mean this is just so slimy and so dirty\nOr against Kavanaugh because there is no cooperating evidence there is no evidence\nAnd look people aren't stupid they'll sit there and say this really stinks\nWell and that's that's it because it does ... they'll look at the forward and say\nAll these go find me accounts another now of what\nA million or over a million dollars what are the world's going on here the lawyers were pro bono you're talking about an airplane flight ... why is all this money being a rate it looked\nDirty yes it all looks\nDirty and the American public and that's why when you bring it up about the cooperation and when people actually look into it and you when you said earlier to me uh uh off the air\nYou said this is really liked the experience that we have with Capra Nick but yeah we have no idea that cap regular it's about free speech or why aren't you watch the new well look I'm\nNot angry it's just I don't prefer to watch because of\nAnd you explain what he actually did and you explained the pig socks every single person that's supported Kaepernick had no that that I've talked to\nAnd it's in the hundreds over the last year ... had no idea about the cop pigs sucks right once you bring that up to go it's a good point they had no idea about Michael Bennett ... no idea that Michael Bennett who was the catalyst one of the catalysts last year and has become one of the leaders\nOf the movement who was also you know in the locker room yesterday for Philly mhm\nGot famous and became\nThe poster person\nLast year mhm to continue it because he lied about the Las Vegas police every single person that was supporting ... didn't know about that either\nAnd they went oh oh okay yeah that is bad\nAnd I'll leave it at that I won't judge them and but you can tell they know when you bring up things that are common sense to people when you bring up something like fairness\nAnd the\nPreponderance of evidence before finding somebody guilty that it has\nTo exist somewhere\nThere's a reason that NBC\nWouldn't run Mitchell's report why wouldn't they run it\nBecause they know\nThat even there are a few listeners there doesn't listeners viewers that that are left even if they're liberal would say\nYeah not good right and\nWhy do you do that to adults why don't you want adults to know the truth right why we don't hide anything on the show there's nothing I Would hide any news item I could care less I'll bring up anything that's going on out there why won't they right why will they hide things that are important to a story and even if\nThey disagree with it analyze it\nRight but they they as we talked about before we talked last week about lying through omission ... in a lot of stories out there now right but if you live through omission we just won't include\nParts of it and if and while they'll give an interview to somebody who's making claims that they as a news organization couldn't even corroborate right they will ignore a key piece to the actual an official piece of the actual procedure\nThe actual process in place they ignore it completely\nBut when you give Americans when you start telling Americans will look here's what's going on with this case and you lay it out to them that's why all of a sudden you go to you know\nSixty percent say oh\nOr fifty percent ... percent say oh we didn't know okay yeah that that's that's wrong if there is no corroboration well and if the FBI finds out there is no one sixty percent of Americans believe it that's\nMost all of independence and\nYeah and that's what you're looking for that's what you're looking for in any election and we always get this and we've talked about the administration and said look you could have more success is if you have a consistent solid message day in and day out because well you never convince the liberals that's not\nYour goal that'll not your goal and and you know it's like Jeff Flake saying you know saying when I went to Coons I I was just I was telling them this is tearing our country apart

allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh when the Kenyan has details\nSenate leaders went toe to toe in the Senate floor Monday over the length and scope of the FBI investigation it's supposed to last one week but Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell says he's pretty sure that won't be enough for the Democrats\nIt's the United states Canada and Mexico it's still North America so it's so uh\nThere has to be more North American which uh content which is going to raise the cost\nThen the the um a\nSolver requirements that he put on Mexico\nIn Mexico must you know raised it doesn't affect Mexico would actually affords General Motors and Ford remember the companies are talking about are all American companies and if you noticed none of the American automobile manufacturers are saying this is a great deal for them they don't like the deal\nThe deal will make it so Ford and General Motors cells fewer cars in North America and because you've raised the cost of automobiles in North America\nMore expensive to manufacture what the president said he wanted\nWhich was to send more vehicles to manufacture them in the United states and send them overseas is now going to be tougher to do because you've raised the cost of manufacturing\nOf cars in the United states in Mexico and Canada and you the consumer will pay for it and that is what the president viewed as the greatest victory in this and\nSo as I you know we only got one email on at the one guy said to you know you and I said well wait a minute to ... there's some parts of it we like but the big part of it the president promoted is wrong and as I and I you know invited him to argue more than debate\nMore than just the rhetoric of it makes America great\nTo what does it actually do when you raise prices but we limit it we live in a look we live in a day and age and I understand that we live in a day and age where nobody wants to talk about\n... when you look at these specific sub of what's going on with ... nobody wants to focus in and say okay what's the actual thing here but he's off into a different tangent the same on on on the economics and trade everybody picks their own little corner and they stick with it instead of saying okay what is the result when you raise prices overall\nAnd that's what the president has done in the free trade agreement and our trade negotiators have done he has made cars more expensive to buy in Mexico in the United states and in Canada were all in it together\nThe cost of buying a car in the United states Canada and Mexico will go up in price at a time as you mentioned yesterday Eric you mentioned it yesterday I don't know why I focused and said\nEric ... uh but as you said yesterday a ... and you and I've been doing some some uh uh reading and analysis on this is that her prices are going up people can't afford to buy cars they run out of ways to finance them and so what are people looking to do that looking to buy\nUsed vehicles yes and\nThat's driving by market right now which when there was a greater demand for that group of vehicles the used vehicles and the price goes up\nAnd so for some people out there they believe this is ... none of it's personal it's all economics how does it work I Can't tell you how the president and things because of president or even in this trade deal has done some good things and done some bad things and that's one of the bad things as automobile now it could've been a lot worse than what he was promoting before\nBut the fact is it didn't affect\nProbably Ninety eight percent of the free trade between the countries and that's a good thing as we said would happen we've had predicted look who's going to be all this high all the soup ... and what we're going to basically get\nIs the same kind of deal a little bit of nuances here or there they get a little victory on timber we get a little victory on dairy\nThe big problem with it is what the president and what the trade negotiators did on raising the cost of all cars manufactured in the United states in Canada and Mexico that you that consumers are going to have to pay and it means we are less likely to ship\nCars from the United states anywhere else\nAnd the president views that as a great victory for the United states but doesn't explain why it's a great victory\nRight yeah and I I think if\nYou look here's where the tell will be you'll see\nCertain industries that the reason the automobile industry is\nIs key to the economy is because you look at the the the\nHow often now people purchase vehicles right or more and more they're holding on to their cars so that hurts the premise because well they want the stuff off the assembly line to be so\nYou make that more expensive you start hurting it industry you start seeing layoffs as a result of that\nThen and then also make the used cars by default more expensive and you're going to see not just\nThe automobile industry but of course all the dealerships\nAnd all of the uh if if you look at the finance arms of those companies they're all going to suffer as a result of that because people will choose as they're doing now to hold onto their car for longer periods of time\nBecause that's the cost of government that's not the cost of anything else we're not talking about well whether it's steel and aluminum or the parts going into the car or electronics or anything else we're not saying that this stuff is scarce that it's hard to come by\nIt that a small group of people have decided to get together and determine\nHow expensive it's going to be for us that's the difference\nAnd we view it as a victory and as we've said nobody can explain to us why\nThat's a victory now as we said the other things when you look at the dairy you know again that's that's moving in and in some of the agriculture stop where we do have more free trade now because of it and we had in Canada was able to knock down some of the barriers that's fine but it's almost as if we make the victory over there and we've done we shoot ourselves in the foot\nOn automobiles now the other good thing is\nCanada will like this be was mentioned with the timber\nThat the president in all likelihood will be lifting the terror if they put on timber and now that has to go to a panel to decide whether\nA Canada is subsidizing it not the president to make the decision on his own which should sheep and construction in the United states because that timber will be coming over\nAnd that was a fear builders that housing prices were going to skyrocket another construction from the use of of would because of the Canadian timber and hopefully in the next year that will bring those prices down so there's wins and there was lost his across the board but but overall if the president is stating\nThat the threat of tariffs on Canada and the and and and Mexico and the steel tariffs and the looming terrorists made it worthwhile for this he's going to have to show me the numbers on it\nWell and that's that's again it's it's it's the second largest purchase that people make and if people are homeowners it's the first largest purchase on on vehicles\nAnd you start seeing that slide you start seeing the economy slide and that will be your tell\nThis is what the the Bush administration saw steel terrorists they saw companies leaving the country\nAnd they said this can't stand we cannot keep this going you can't we cannot do this\nBecause the the job loss will be well who knows what it would have been had they not ended those steel terrorists uh prematurely\nBut overall the vast majority of products unchanged right\nAnd so uh you know the president which was called a victory fine we just do the analysis on the reality of economic\nSlump he'd give me when he ... he's got my support if if we're going to stand strong against China\n\nThere's ... then ... and by the way political you can get away with that all day long to\nIt's going it is going to hurt but if they're not going to play by the world Trade Organization rules\nThen not only the U.S but all of our allies and other trade partners with trying to need to get in line and putting the pressure on them that's a very real strategy in it is going it it has to be effective because I don't know how you can put a cost on on China not playing by the rules and stealing intellectual property\nTime and time again and getting away with\nEight six six Ninety right I [noise]\nDon't vote for the Sixers red on red on radio [noise]\nBe a part of the

on what\nWe understand both on the way we understand let me speak let me respond okay what you are stadium then\nIs that in a republic the\nRepresentatives said get elected and the party that gets more representatives elected by the people they get to make the rules and regulations of that particular body you're dating since the Republicans won\nAnd could\nControl that body which means control

the rules\nMhm right well keep in mind though that position was nothing new\nOn the Senate for\nBack in the day the Democrats held the same position because it was just as much out of respect for Hillary Clinton as it was for Donald Trump remember\nThat scenario was that the new president should should pick their nominee right and I ... and that did not that was not there was not a given at that point that Trump was going to win well\nNo the the end but the point is that this was like dealing with the woman that was on CNN last week was the the guy makes a statement we say well this is what you're saying and it's exactly what he said and then he goes no that's not what I'm saying well of course that's what you're saying because why Harry Reid decided to change the rules of the Senate when he was\nThe head of the Senate when it came to federal nominations therefore when he did that uh you had Mitch McConnell come in and say okay you change those rules were going to change those ... these rules for the Supreme Court justice yeah\nThe people in power we get to ... these aren't laws were not changing laws were simply changing rules of the sun it that we have the ability to do constitutionally you may not like it but hey when elections as what Harry Reid said\nRight and Mitch McConnell came in and said the exact same thing that's the reality of it and what you're saying then it's okay to defame some buddies or what is it the same somebody's character\nBecause\nThat's the reality of highly Democratic Republic constitutional republic works\nUh and then you got

jak welcome you're on the radio walk into the show\nGood morning I Wonder if some sixteen year old son night posted something on Twitter or Instagram that will keep them from becoming a judge forty five years from now but my point is that I think Senator Flake man actually ... the Republican Party by calling ... you're a senator\nIn a a purple shall we say state or a state where your reelection is a tough one a year now and say hey look I was kind of go towards not voting for the man or I was leaning towards voting for him\nI wasn't sure I sat through the hearings and like so many Americans I couldn't make up my mind when we called them the FBI did a full investigation and any reasonable person would say that there is no real conclusion after that investigation I'm going to vote for him so I think that's that's the day she gives some cover to Republicans\nWho may have been afraid to alienate some of their female or voters and then gives them a little political cover to vote yes\nWell there there's only works if they if the polls since Thursday which will start rolling in over the next couple of days that by the week by the end of the week those polls show that the American people are not with them that the but more importantly those senators in those states especially where it's close\nOr are not getting the support of their voters and they're staged a and ultimately it only works if the vote\nIs to confirm Kavanaugh because it doesn't work for the Republicans if he does not get confirmed or it becomes still a very very much so an uphill battle\nOr even in November even though I Do believe that this whether he's confirmed or not will work for them politically I don't know too what effect in November at the mid term\nAnd I think the Democrats plan is it doesn't really matter what happens with Ford anymore it's let's get at whatever other allegations that we have to try to delaying that's yet they really want yeah\nYeah they want further delay they're going to want Ramirez to have a hearing or you know there will be a coal somewhere along the way when they know the voters inevitable and the Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell saying on Monday that there will be a vote this week and so we don't know when that's going to be I'm assuming\nSaturday there could be a vote on the floor but we don't know\nUm he said it's time for delays I haven't heard his ...
