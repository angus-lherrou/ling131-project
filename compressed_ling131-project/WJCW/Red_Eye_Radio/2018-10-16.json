advantage of this opportunity that we have I mean I I hear people tripping over the fact that Trump is\nSaying things on Twitter that's not appropriate or this or that or the other to me it strikes me is somebody that uh has lived his life financially making good decisions\nAnd uh\nHe doesn't need this job he could be doing anything else with his time and he is condescending to this country and taken on the responsibility of trying to uh right the ship\nAnd uh\nYou know ... ... what we need to realize is he he could be a this is what she can do when you kind of send to the presidency and you're not in the back pocket of multiple corporations or or whoever people say he's an outsider\nHe's not beholden to anybody so he can do these things and he can bypass the press\nAnd talk to us on Twitter and speak his mind directly to us and be a transparent president\nSomething that Obama promised to do and couldn't deliver and turns out was just more of the same\nA\nDemocratic crap that we've we've had for\nFor years and years\n\nAnd you know I hear I hear the emotion in your voice and I appreciate your call very much you're right he's he's beholden to no end to no one and uh\nHe says what he thinks that you may have heard me say this you get the whole package is he is just the cages the elite would like of course not one of the reasons they dislike him so much money is getting things done and as I said that you seem to share those sentiments\nHe he's doing a great job I I've been more than impressed with him and I'm thankful for every day is there and I don't know if you felt the way I did when he won\nAnd I watched his family are kind of come down and celebrate the victory from day one I was worried that someone would go after him in some way and I I think God

the a perspective of what's going on on the other side and it's it's just crazy it's crazy to me that\nYou they say that\nUm we don't believe that Democrats are people out in the last that we aren't believing in America we do very much believe in America um I think when its conception that Republican or far right\nIs that we want to open up all border wall we watch it just I mean it just apply there are things that we want to do that is not true and I think that Trump I Can't wrap my head around and and this is what I Want to ask you I Can't wrap my head on\nWhy people like him I get it you're going to stick to your Republican he's the Republican representative president he's for that party will do everything that this man does\nIs not right it's not correct and I and my one and I'm just wondering how\nSo many people\nUm and well you know those people who back him up at any cost at\nAny new now at any cost ... go ahead no no no\nNo I'm Sorry a first of all I I didn't say Democrats don't believe in America I'm very clear about seeing the left I don't believe believes\nIn America so obviously I Know Democrats love America ... there's no issue about that at all what you said we we backed Trump in in what things don't you like that or you know we'll least clarify differences I'm not going to argue with you but what you think he believes in or has done that you don't like so much\nOh got everything I mean I I really I Can't even believe it or not because of\nThe name or her name name I Know NO NAME on it all work okay\nLet me let me let me just tell you that's I think\nUm I I don't get and maybe you can answer me I don't know um if he had if he did something we're not going to find any proof direct credit that he had anything to do with the election like Trump himself um but there was um I mean voter fraud everything going on\nWhy would Hillary president at that but the\nTo say I'm just wondering what are some you know your your last me though I Want to answer your question there's often been voter fraud that that's you you can't blame that on President Trump the collusion with Russia there's been zero estimates that ... has been going on two years so there's been no zero evidence of that is that what\nThere for ... yeah so how how is it that every person here involved with and is going to jail\nOr going to hurt during ... so how are you where the ...\nYeah so it would no that wasn't the all the people that have gone to jail a lot of them are Russians when they mentioned this thirty six thirty nine some of these people Russians having nothing to do with President Trump but Michael Flynn a pleaded not not because he had anything to do with the Russians Paul Manafort they with some\nYou know business dealings he didn't report with Ukraine and so and none of these things had anything to do with President Trump\nOr Syria saying why all the people everybody knows first of all it's not every but it's just we're talking about some people but none of it was with President Trump colluding with Russia ...\nLet me ask you questions we and you really believe that he polluted with ... I mean we've had zero evidence of\nThat yes absolutely I absolutely do and I believe I Believe they'll have proof of that and if they don't it's like with a kid and then going back to that are going to go back to that but with Kevin ... it was it was a disgrace to say oh we we we believe Kevin a hundred percent but Ford\nOh we believe hurt too bad but um it just wasn't him and and that's\nThat's the way way way way way I'll get a chance that made me think I may even care you over\nBut the fact is that there was no cooperating evidence for anything she said would you like hey man huge wait let me finish would you like to have something and have no corroborating evidence and then maybe go to jail or not get the job you always wanted in this country you're innocent before proven guilty you gotta let me\nLet me let me tell you I yes in the wrong person because I was in\nAnd I this person dead and my family here with a family member if I were to say right now that this person and God Forbid he was he was up for this crime court justice but I'm In the airline I have absolutely no\nEvidence that with the tiles molested me I have no evidence I have to know what might happen\nI for how we got to go that heartbreak but you can't do it without evidence otherwise anybody could accuse anybody let me know what you're saying mark ... filling in on ...

I've seen and believe me believe me they don't believe me it's been taking off for you to he was a talk show years ago I Believe there was a David Letterman where he said in the smog arrogant way I'm very very intelligent so of course I'm an atheist or he's got a Christian or can\nWe use a cursing and you hold on I Want to just I'll give you a chance what you said something that hit me right away so the barbaric treatment of immigrant children first of all than not immigrant children they're illegal immigrant children\nOr let's call them the way it is and I don't know what's ... why it's barbaric to say that you have certain rules and laws and ways of getting in a country and if you don't come in that way\nThen we can't accept you what's barbaric maybe is the parents bringing the children here they're responsible for the families being separated and broken up so I don't think he's being barbaric you'd probably call me barbaric just 'cause I Want some rules and I want some uh procedures in terms of sovereignty why is that barbaric\nI don't care who the children belong to the handling was barbaric and if it was your child you'd be singing a different feeling you\nKnow I Would you know no no no you don't get to go on you don't run around you know so you don't get to go on if you don't give me a chance when you say something so absurd if it was my first I wouldn't

rules and procedures how we handle this\nGo your turn to\nExplain our federal judge a put a stop to it it is barbaric whether you want to say it is or not the way they handled it not necessarily joining it in the first place separating the show around here with that but if you want to go with the separation being warranted it's the way they they ... they say half bought\nHandled it let's just say for instance I'll be real quick I took my kid Chuck E. cheese recently I had a bracelet said one two three for example and my child at a price said one two three that way when I was able to leave
