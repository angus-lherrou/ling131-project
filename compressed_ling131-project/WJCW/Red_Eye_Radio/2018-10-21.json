she looked she died in the fight inside the sunny counseling in Turkey\nWhat's much more important is what your policies are so I think you're comparing apples to oranges there between Trump and Obama we didn't like him because of his policies not because of his race not because of the way he sounded but because of what he didn't\nYeah I'm not saying that Republicans are going to vote both Republicans the garlic of holding the president if you had a Democrat or Republican is going to vote Republican and Democrat\nDo is let me let me say what I think a clarified for you the base you're right about that both sides have a base that was never a million years Republican vote for Democrats nor Democrats voted for Republicans but I Know I have a couple of times voted for the Democratic or Republican\nBut uh as an example I couldn't stand Arnold Schwarzenegger so I didn't vote for him I figured out who he was what a phony he was and he was in it for himself\nSo there have been times that I have not voted\nFor the Republican candidate but you write in general that's what you choose your party 'cause you agree with them for the most part I don't blame people for that what I Do blame is for the incredible hatred for Donald Trump and the fact of tonight's topic which is you disown someone because you disagree with their politics\nThat doesn't make sense to me that's over the top\n... you're right because I Know it's not a bad job you get the Korea issue North Korea is the first time in history to them I act the act we got him to ...\nAnd ... the the climate rate is doing it really good job that go with the reason people don't like the way you speak if he was more ... it\nProbably was more a way but\nI think he is but I think he is becoming more presidents I got a question for you are you going to vote for next time\nI don't know it's so frustrated with politics like I said I didn't vote for him the first time I didn't I I Would I Would never going to vote for Hillary but I I I like what you're doing and let me tell you that I worked for the government so\nYou know I'm real happy at what he's doing you know I'm a government oh\nSo you're a good man Anthony I appreciate you and uh hang in there and I I just got to save your way to live longer and you say you've done good stuff and you ought to vote for him in a twenty twenty thanks for the call appreciate it very much and let's go to um\nYeah Teresa in fair play Missouri three so you're on with mark\nIt and get evening Margaret good morning and I wanted to say that and I was raised in a ...\nI mean my whole family with Democrat lot of them have family still it Democrat and most of my my dad kings parties and during the Reagan Era and kind of took all those kids with thing you know 'cause he had he had living very sisters [noise]\nAnd and\nRecently Leanne named Mike has gotten kind of the ... in Facebook and\nOne and then just completely everything was negative everything we made that Trump or you know everything you put up there and and and I would make snide remarks and bad you know he is and and then my other cousin came out and speak spoke with one night\nMy\nOne cousin came down and then apologized to me he goes family more important than politics\nAnd I thought that was really really big I mean I think so much more lean him coming out and we talk on you know on messenger for quite a long time now my other cousin I I had to delete him because everything he had was negative negative negative now\nEverything he put on faith up the click political that um\nI my question is is you know\nI Can't vote for something that I Am morally you know against the now whether it's Martian or you know all these people coming up here it's not the nominee against immigration that they be legal and I just can't\nI think a lot of the red great comes from the news because they are so negative I mean ... new agree with me 'cause I I I think it changed a lot of people's mind\nYou're absolutely right you make a great point thinking Theresa and the media has changed the name of the game it used to be that there there was a lot of honest journalism and you know you didn't even know where a lot of them stood now they've become advocates\nFor their point of view and that's maybe they learn than journalism school but that's not what they're supposed to do that just spoke to the present the news and what's going on and we get to make our own decision\nBut that's totally changed and they influenced people especially young people who don't listen to that much and and I'm not big on the young people that is true of older people too and I think of it you know they watch the nightly news or whatever they watch and they get a little glimpse of it and half the time they don't even know you know what's really happening\nSo I agree the media has a big play in this and it's a pretty discouraging to see what an influence they do have\nAnd you know if you go out and interview people you is very discouraging to see how little Leno right they can name the vice president\nThey have no idea about the three branches of government and of course the bigger point

did [noise] um you know what they did it was terrible book you know ... you know even if though to do something small that's all right but it's such a big the making such a big uproar about it on I mean you know I'm sure that they they have Saudi Arabia you know it doesn't have the cleanest record\nKing Solomon does for sure [noise] um and I mean generally we get involved in things abroad when it when it's in our interest you know when when we can prevent you know bigger a human rights you know you know crisis or [noise] or you know to expand our power abroad you know to protect us you know as you know offensive is different\nBut in this case I mean she wasn't a US citizen\nI'm here to green card\nOn you know if they did it in it isn't our best interest to just you know the big player in the middle east for us you know to protect us against Iran so like whoa you know the they help us out why um what's the big uproar but you know they've\nDone things like this in the past with known about you know just I guess it wasn't so publicly you know he I mean this king Solomon he's locked elect all ... you know the princes in a hotel for a few months to to make them pay ransom saying he's not he's not exactly a moderate you know it's not it's not your regular guys like\nI'm a stay you know it's trying to understand that\nWell let me see if I can add something to your thoughts about it\nLook into that it's always been a difficult a jigsaw puzzle out there in the middle east and write the Israel's our basic friend and we can count on them but the other players or you know like Saudi Arabia the war more anti Israel than they are now they both have the one side of interest in terms of Iran trying to stop Iran\nBut I got to tell you I just thought of it maybe it's a visceral reaction the idea that this guy goes in there and I'm not trying to say the great about him because\nHe was a supporter of the Muslim Brotherhood and you know ... they're just they're enemies of ours are as they weren't in Egypt or so I'm not a big fan of what he believes in in that sense what the going somewhere where be lured into an embassy which is you know he's supposed to have\nA special status when a country as an embassy in another country they there's in their territory their land\nYou lord in there and and then you chop them up and\nYou assassinate him and it just so revolting to people I I think that's what was going on in your right it's a complicated situation as we need their oil and we need them to fight Iran\nIt's very difficult situation for President Trump but just thought I I must have been it got to me too I I felt badly from even though I'm ... I think I wouldn't agree with them probably many as\n... ... yeah but that's you know you you know agree with him but he kept getting getting killed like that is horrible\nYou know but I mean so ... yeah ...\n... even though there should be you know definitely should be an uproar and they should be condemned for it but I mean though that they really want a large scale it seems like a large scale you know cutting off you know businesses and\nAnd ... and I mean I I don't know if it's in America's Best interest to do that like just you know for the even though it's it is a horrible incident but for this alone I don't think you know I'm In the bigger picture you know ... ...\nYeah well I I I cringe when you say cutting off business I that's bad and this and this story\nBut um you're right we we need that we need them badly and that's why I say President Trump is isn't a very difficult situation and there are people like Lindsey Graham who is terrific on in the Kavanaugh hearings now saying hey yeah I'm never going there again while in this guys and the princes in power and this and the Marco Rubio a ... there are people on our side saying\nWe we can't allow this to happen you ... you know which is crazy sounds you have to have some and civility in this crazy world right you don't want the president was assassinated you don't take out ... even if you can\nYou don't do stuff like that that's why the Kennedy thing John F.
