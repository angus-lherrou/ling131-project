and us since two thousand nine involved the limousine in a town about twenty miles west of Albany New York living twenty people dead discounts and bomb reports\nAnd and that's what the Supreme Court eventually you know had that you know it came out and said but that was her first attempt to get rid of freedom of speech we now know\nThat the left wishes to get rich rid of freedom of speech and wishes to use the power of the government to punish you and destroy your life to do that\nWe know that I mean no that's not even debatable anymore when we talked about the first amendment we can look at freedom of religion and the bakery and artistic expression and all that that's going on right now\nAnd the left is again that individual rights of I get to choose you know how I Wish to express of what I you know what I Believe so we've often talked about the fact that the left does not and this is the mainstream of the law does not believe\nIn the first amendment they don't believe in freedom of speech I don't believe in freedom of religion\nThe second amendment it's obvious they don't believe in the second amendment they believe it's antiquated they don't believe in due process or under the law you and I talked about this during\nAh during the uh uh during the whole uh uh\nFerguson case ... when you had a when you had a a Eric Holder and you had the president giving their opinion on it when they didn't know what happened right and we said you can't be doing that just shows you don't believe in due process under the law you can't be indicted unless you know\nYou've got to take each case individually if you're not\nThen you don't believe in due process well we've seen this year the mindset of due process because what you did have her was a political trial yes uh it wasn't a civil trial it was in day it wasn't a a a a criminal trial by\nMany aspects of a real trial where there you're under oath mhm and you can be you can go to jail it was a legal setting it was illegal it's it's a legal maybe a political legal setting might not be a criminal trial or civil trial but it was a trial\nWhere many of the enforcements of a trial a ... like when you testify if you commit perjury you can go to jail for that\nAnd they didn't believe in due process or under under the law they didn't believe in a presumption of innocence none of that mattered to them\nThen we got to Trump winning the presidency and they didn't believe in the electoral college anymore now this one when you have a tend to lean in and this is this is going to pick up now because the oh wow we forgot the Senate\nOr that are now that the the the Senate has and we told you this was coming if you can listen to show the last couple of years we told you the next thing they were going to try to get rid of was the Senate\nWell if you don't want the Senate\nIf you don't want the electoral college if you believe that the Supreme Court is the legislative branch and should be making up law when that was not their intent when you don't believe in the first amendment when you don't believe in the second amendment when you don't believe in due process under the law when you don't believe with a ... and the presumption\nOf innocence\nYou really don't believe in this country right you have no idea what the country's about and\nWe understand now on the show we believe that that the majority of our audience and the majority of conservatives understands the separation of powers we've talked about that a lot we've talked about how the majority of America though ... close to Seventy five percent does not\nBut if you understand the concept of the are by camera legislature you understand why we have a house of representatives you understand why we have a set it you understand why Great Britain as a house of lords of the house of commons\nYou understand that the founding fathers of the United states they wanted a separation of powers the thing that they were most\nScared of was that a ... group\nA particular group of ... a a person a small group of people a particular kind of a legislature or a court or presidency they were scared to death\nThat power could be concentrated in one of those areas and they they were trying to avoid that more than anything because they had looked at\nThe history of the world\nAnd seen how authoritarianism works and they didn't want it and the by camera legislature was a compromise made by the Congress and\nWhen you look at it the house of representatives or you have I think fifty three house members in California only one in Wyoming\nWhy bigger population and California\nFewer people in a ... in Wyoming\nBoth have two senators a that was done for a reason that was done sold the house\nWould more represent the United states by population\nAnd by region\nBut the Senate and on and and by the way the the reason that are you a are elected for two years so you're closer to the people more accountable to the people if they wanted they believe that the house of representatives would be closer to mob rule than a set of it [laughter]\n[laughter] and but so they they but they wanted it they wanted the the the\nCongress to be closer to the people small areas you know of the country where you represented you know that area of the country and you had more power of the state because if you had more population and a bigger state you had more representation in the house\nBut they also wanted in every state wanted the ability to have some kind of equal employed so the big states could not rule over the little states\nThat was the reason for it the reason the bill of rights exist the reason that we are and constitutional Republican not a direct democracy is why separation of powers\nAnd also protection of individual rights and protection of states' rights and that's why it was done and do things move slower yes\nFound him fathers were worried so much about legislation moving slowly through\nThey preferred that then mob rule the reason the electoral college exist today is so you can't have mob rule or you can have the big states not knowing what the future was going to be in this country where the big states would totally dominate in the executive branch ...\nIt was all it was all thought up not to have the separation of powers so power cannot congregate in one area and as we said when it comes to the bike camera legislature to give them to give the people one body which is the house and then the Senate\nWhich is to per state which is six years so they could be more long term looking at a country where they weren't voted in every single or every two years\nAnd the senators were more likely to look at what was best for the country and not just the region that the congressional membership\nOr represents I'm most\nRoom of I daresay that the vast majority of the left have no idea of\nI think most people I listen to our show do understand you know everything that I said but I don't believe that the left understands that at all or cares to understand no I don't think\nThey care about it because what they want is again a and as they often engage in and fantasy they create and there might a fantasy of what the nation should be\nI mean they create a in their mind a fantasy of what the what the government should be giving you every day so the makeup of that government needs to change to fit that fantasy most often they're okay with doing that\nThey don't understand the process they don't care to understand the process\nThey don't care\nWhy it was set up this way and you know it's interesting\nBecause you look at what happened after Trump was elected and you had people on the left you know than that at that point start talking about well we want our guns because not all but some on the line we want our guns because ah of the possibility of a tyrannical government\nHey welcome to the second amendment now they're excuse\nThe point that of course directly to this president but it was about the same idea basic idea of the second amendment\nAnd\nOften too little too late for the left they call for something something changes well we didn't know what was going to be that just one small example was Obamacare not that it was small but much smaller than of course\nDoing away with the Senate completely we didn't know we were going to happen but we thought someone else was going to pay for it\nYeah well less than ... you start coming in and you start changing the very foundation of the constitution and they do believe this is this is really been the game all of them all

great deal it was happening during the Trump rallies in twenty sixteen we know that there was a great organization and money to a certain extent going behind a that was behind and driving a lot of these protests are we know a the left is very good at that but\nThat's that's why you can't find for a lot of them you really can't it's hard to I identify with them and and for most Americans that is\nYou know again the idea of a peaceful protest and standing up for what you believe people are quick to you know speak out and that if there is a pollster that calls whether it's kneeling in the NFL or any other as you know I Believe people should you know have the right to be heard\nBut how many people actually do it are active in protests most people are not the overwhelming majority or not and in fact if you didn't have a you know a Soros organization or any or the organization or that I mean we can go back to Ferguson Ferguson thing authorities\nThey they told they were equipped to tell you look we've got people that aren't even from the state that have come here from a long ways away and that was clearly organized so when it comes down to it how many people are actually willing to get out there to the extent that are driven\nAnd motivated to the extent that they would get out there if not part of some kind of organization\nI'm well we're we're the Facebook crowd a pollster calls oh yeah yeah we'll answer the poll a Facebook there\nWon't click to like buy and we share it we might read tweeted\nBut the fact of the matter is is what is it I guess the question is what is it that really drives most Americans it's the everyday things in our lives and when we go back to the point that you brought up earlier and we we talked about last week\nThat the majority of Americans it was somewhere around sixty percent that said well if there was nothing to corroborate claims from this additional background check on cabinet we that sixty percent saying he should be confirmed\nWell that's a big deal now it's not eighty percent not Ninety percent with sixty percent will win you a fuel elections and the point being is that we stepped back from the insanity in the display the show that's being put on by the left here\nAnd the behavior by the left I mean I'm not saying it's not real I'm not saying people aren't going to react to it\nUh you know cirrhosis can can back whatever he wants to and people can act the way they want to and even on the Senate Judiciary committee they can say the most insane things if they believe what's going to get them political points well it just might in your state of Hawaii or California\nBut if you believe it's going to win the argument with the people of America you're flat out wrong\nAnd and that's why I think and and again this is a not a ... analysis of facts like this is just my my gut feeling from\nWhat I what I've seen what I've heard the personal response that I just generally talk to people over the last uh a couple of weeks were more independent or a non political who have paid attention to this and even though they do sympathize\nAnd because this is one of the things would just really ticked off a ton of people including a ton of women that I Know and that are that are more ... a more conservative was\nIf you didn't believe her\nThen you're for rape ...\nIf you don't believe in the rape if you don't believe in the rape allegation alone without cooperating evidence if you don't absolutely believe the allegation\nBen you're as much a rapist yourself because you're enabling rape in our society right well that kicked off a ton of women that I Know who just went wait a minute and I and I gave you the example two of my my buddy independent Bob\nWho said what what is this something that you will always believe the woman you don't believe anything but evidence\nAnd to me that's where the Democrats jump the shark\nIs\nMost of most Americans which is why you see the sixty percent and I bet you that sixty percent I bet you that other forty percent that so we don't want to confirm Kavanaugh had nothing to do was just the fact that they'd rather have a more liberal judge or Trump pick somebody they don't want him\nBut I guarantee you that the majority of Americans looked at that process and said no you don't always believed the woman\nYou have to have evidence you don't believe always believe the man you don't always believe a woman you don't always believe anybody gets the evidence that you make the judgment on and yeah these senators are accusing him of being a rapist without the evidence without the evidence and in fact they're ... and being a gang rape is\nWithout the evidence of of being there they say believe all woman when we do all women don't tell the truth but it's a majority doesn't matter that's why we judge every case individually because that's the only way that you can do it in America and I do believe that ... Americans\nUnderstand that they understand basic fairness and when they see I'm not just the radicals\nBut the mainstream of the Democratic party the mainstream of the party that are arguably has more people supporting it mhm\nNot by much but maybe more people supporting it then the Republicans mhm just looking at the last election on the popular vote out the electoral college vote\nOr when they see that they say I don't really wish to be a part of that that's just that's crossing the line that that's no type of and and and when you find out that you know that the fact is they're the ones that burned Dr Ford it was\nA Dianne Feinstein she burn the victim Chinese the one that wouldn't keep the anonymity of the victim right it was the Democrat who leaked it\nIt was the Democrats right it was either find of Feinstein's office or one of her staffers or it was the the the congresswoman ...\nWas it was it or or her staff that's it it had to be one of those two right\nAnd so when you look at it you all you see is from the Democrats is manipulation across the board character assassination across the board not the no belief and the presumption of innocence the stereotyping\nThe bigotry all women all need to be believed all white men white men or ... white men can't and people look at that stage and it's\nJust like stomp it well I think you two we have to keep in mind the and this isn't a this is recent history we don't have to go back into the Democrats in the sixties recent history you have in it because again\nThe same side that said we're going to stand up for women called the women who voted for Trump self massage them as they in fact the candidate\nHerself after she lost said well the problem is is that women listen to their husbands the husbands tell them how to vote [laughter] stupid\nBecause your husband has to tell you how to vote your son even your boss tells you how to vote your stupid and can't make a decision for yourself well which has it Democrats\nThere to be believed or not if they vote with their hearts and minds and the twenty sixteen election against Hillary no theirself massage ... which first they will tell you for whatever reason they hate women\nLiterally just re headlines right here uh San Francisco chronicle activists blame white women after Susan Collins says she'll vote for cat All right ah [laughter]\nAh critics blame white women the rap after Susan Collins of a ... a cabin up a speech\nYeah because ... was women women or were the oppress women were the victims in general\nUntil they lost and now it's that women of color are the victims\nThey blame white women well I don't know Dr forged genetic makeup or her her ethnicity\nBackground but she appears to be\nAnd a white woman and and what it comes across as is you just will do anything to get a win right you won't show compassion to a victim\nYou will slander people you will ... people you will say that the presumption of innocence should not be part of the the the the process you say at one point that all women should be believed than you demonize other women\nAre there is no consistency to the mindset except we will do anything to get a win and I do believe that's why you had the reaction of many independents who say\nSo I decided to do something about it\nI'm Simon out of the un I invented quit\nThe modern electric toothbrush to help you have fresh breath\nPristine teeth and excellence oral hygiene\nAs a product designer I care about how your toothbrush looks feels and the quality of every bristle\nQuip has a lightweight and sleep design with simple time pipe rations and guiding pulses for ... two minute clean\nAnd unlike other high into that she toothbrushes quit stop that just twenty five dollars\nBuzzfeed cools off the iPhone of toothbrushes at time magazine named is one of the best inventions of the yeah\nStock brushing better with quip\nGo to get ... dot com slash benefits right now and get your first revealed tax free with a quick electric toothbrush that's your first regional tax free at ... dot com slash benefit spelled G.

conduct The Revenge a inquisition\nOr you know don't don't try to impeach it's not going to it's not going to work out for you if you attempt to do that and he said probably unconstitutional to try to impeach him for something that he did when he was not an office right\nYou know that he did as a teenager that is that the point you're going to try to bring you know bring up I mean there is no I mean they're going to try that you're going to try to make the perjury claim but again with there's no evidence of perjury or you know whatsoever and uh and and so uh it's like really you're going to bring that up and he had suggested they do not\nAnd he made it known he said look I don't want to Brett Kavanaugh on them mhm 'cause I don't want it goes but if the Democrats want to pick a Supreme

the air last week\nLook to play would be look OK Kavanaugh seated but we can't let this happen again we can't have a third justice seeded by the current president I mean that would be the argument from the left or I guess the a proposition or concern issue to the rank and file\n'em but the left doesn't operate that way the failure with all due respect that Mr Dershowitz in his appeal to the left\nI'm really is to is to not recognize what the left is all about they don't care about the process they don't care about whether or not there's a case there or not they don't care about anything else just keeps screaming whining crying\nOr you know foul and that's what they'll do now that's what we want them to do\nBecause it's working it's actually working right now because the rest of

heard it because it was the same thing if you get one K.\n[noise] and that person has no\nA ration you simply have that one case in your judging that one case I Won a second one comes out and the third one comes out and it mirrors exactly\nWhat the other cases which is\nI selectively remember yes there is no cooperating witness now the stories maybe a little bit different but that's what you got with all three cases well you're done\nYou're done in the corner popular opinion because it does it so yeah I did the ... case make the forward did did remarry case heard it and then the ... case heard it even more\nYes but it all starts with the fact that the first case was not credible yes\nSo if for marriage would have come out first that might have been the first one and then ... would have been viewed as not credible because\nShe couldn't remember the majority of the incident from that night except that was one hundred percent Brett Kavanaugh\nWell and and I think that's you you look at that uh like the the and again it and the court of public opinion when when we're forming opinions but it is often foreign through information that as a given to us by the media and and the people that represent anyone making the claims but if you look at the winds team cases\nRight mhm what do we we started everything started to be corroborated through through uh the well not just the number of people coming forward\nAnd others who said that they were aware of this kind of activity but ultimately his own from that essentially had to pay schedule find schedule based on this kind of behavior if he were to be caught and and so\nThere were things where again if if if Ford made the claims and couldn't get anything to substantiate those planes that were nothing there and then Ramirez came forward and their war\nAnd then a third accuser came forward and she had things to back up her claim that case would have been hard for the president or Kavanaugh to deny those cases collectively as one big situation that Kavanaugh would have been face\nBut that didn't happen\n... and ... were we and the only one that the only reason the Ford came out just because it was leaked yes ... and so that that it would not it was an all likelihood would have never come out if it had gone through the proper a judiciary a of\nWay if ... if I Would have taken it immediately and taken a tug rationally than they would have gone to the FBI to do a background check but everything would have been anonymous\nAnd what and what the what you just heard too was the failure to recognize how Ford's story changed\nYou know and and they talk about how the ... story change how the sweat story changed but look at how the Ford story changed but but their point was on the political picture of being bold leave all the scenario that was that was their\nStarted with a he said or she said he said\nWell then are we developing a pattern with the second and third no they fell apart and then we look back at the first one and realized it also changed and was falling apart what they what they were trying to point out here was\nShe could have been the victim the one person to centrally if she were to give them a Dr Ford were to have given her testimony and nothing else happened\nShe could have been the one and it could have been at least plate or spend with out the evidence to back it up in a way that might have influenced votes but because of the behavior and they mention\n... making the or the you know talking about having these role in her speech\nBut it that happened all of that happened because of what because of the left and made it happen because of the people sitting on this panel helped make it happen\nTo you and you think about it too because of the narrative that every woman must be believed mhm and after Ford and again her story was like ... the story itself is incredible yet right being told that was your major talking point you've got to believe\nThat the the alleged victim the alleged victim if it's a woman alleged victim must be believe we've seen the science we know it\nMust be ... and then you get a second and third\nThat also are not credible then you start destroying that narrative at that point right I Believe that's what they're probably saying even though they're the ones that plane you need to believe all the women all the time and they help even that you know they're they're yeah they're ... you know even Chuck Todd is making the point well that really isn't true\nYeah well this is the this is the version of a right after the twenty sixteen election or we need to go to the heartland and listen to their voices huh yeah that's basically what you see except for the fact that it had greater substance en route and relevance\nTo it I mean they ... they were right by the way uh in in in November twenty sixteen when they said that but there was no expectation they were going to do just that in this case they're looking back on it and and recognizing and again they were part of carrying that narrative\nHelping to form those narratives along the way and then saying yeah well we shouldn't have played it that way it shouldn't have been played that way you when when you look at well I have an eddy stormy Daniels' case and no one\nAbsolutely no one is shocked that a playboy billionaire had an affair\nNo and again\nNot shocked not surprised and also not politically motivated either way by it but the let creates these narratives they give out in the the the ability to introduce the credibility if you will from their perspective not ours to introduce the sweating to claim\nIt must be because he's got a legitimate claim and legal claim against Trump now there must be something that he's got was sweating it must be legit\nIt's if it's against Trump Trump so it would have to come out because yes there must be some legitimacy to it even if there's not but I guess the the only other point that I'd like to make is because this is what I Wonder and again this is a completely totally unfounded allegation without anything to back it up whatsoever but everybody will understand my point\nWhat is Joe Manchin have on Schumer [laughter] I'm fine dining and what does he have a Democrat leadership nobody's calling for a primary challenger to him in the next\nElection nobody is criticizing Joe mansion from the left at All right he's a Democrat wired their screams that he should be kicked out of the party where is that\nRight exactly how come all the Republicans are taking the flack from the ... the left but the one Democrat who voted for Kavanaugh not same nothing nothing like to go back to\nWest Virginia just good yeah I mean because because the reality of it I mean you know they they I I saw somebody liberals on on a social media late or well as late friday and also into you know Saturday continue on college\nWe need to find somebody who as Susan Rice spoke up who will challenge her next elections Susan tallies rile LA's runs isn't right so it's a woman who\nGot on TV and lie on a ... attack American please that's kind of credibility that Democrats made and\nAnd then and then I thought to myself well wait a minute how many of these liberals on social media would vote for Susan Collins had she voted no on Kavanaugh zero\nYou know it's this disingenuous well now we're going to challenge her like you weren't anyway right\nNow we're going to vote in an election that's right now we're gonna have to find someone to challenge her eight six six Ninety red eye\nAddition to being required by law pre and
