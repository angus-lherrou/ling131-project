Saudis say\nTrump going up Margaret caravan that's no sweat estimated five thousand people a disgrace to the Democratic party Mexico's president elect is suggesting that the U.S Canada and Mexico jointly technical migration\nI don't know of a mid term election we're a political party that has been in power that wouldn't normally loose seats that has been so well prepared\nWith the not only the issues by their side but the motion\nBy their side because the emotion of the Republicans is extremely recent it's not the hatred of Trump that's summer for the last two and a half years and that's been there for two and a half years this is stuff that is fresh\nIn people's minds I don't know what's going to happen in the election it looks like right now that they're going to ah keep hold of the Senate ... uh the house I just I just don't know and uh I don't think\nWhen you look back at Ninety four and Ninety four nobody really got a good read at that nobody saw that\nWave coming in the house nobody saw it coming right and and so I don't know about the house is it a possibility that Republicans could hold onto it yeah uh I don't know how in the mid term like this you can determine\nOr a\nExtrapolate what the turnout\nIs going to be all I can tell you is I understand that in a in a midterm election the party not empower normally gain seats\nAnd the excitement level is normally with them\nNot saying that there isn't didn't excite voted voter excitement level and the Democrats I just see an unprecedented in\nA mid term at least in recent times where there has been so much motivation from the party in power which is the Republicans not to lose it I thought of the interview that was that was done with\nA a a bait or work\nRobert Francis ... over the weekend said if you truly are a rock star and I looked at you and I said I heard that over the weekend and I thought well no and you and I hate that term to begin with for politicians do what is the main way we don't like to practice in political I dollar tree but since that has been made I looked through and I said look look at what Trump is doing\nSome still out there filling huge arenas two years later and he's doing stop now Obama didn't do the same thing I don't think Obama could have done that two years later\n... well that would not at the same excitement\nWell because ... and we warned in fact if you look at what happened in two thousand eight a than your for you that was there after that ah the inauguration and two thousand nine\nAnd then you saw what\nThe Tea Party the birth of the the modern day Tea Party or or the game I guess in terms of the the momentum of that Tea Party in ... uh in early about two thousand nine and ... and it kind of carried over\nBut ultimately the rock star thing was over and we warn between election day two thousand eight and a nod to ration day two thousand nine for Obama we said okay for people that wanted the rock star keep in mind he's going to have to do things that are presidential\nAnd those things are not going to work for you by the way that was so [noise] so and years ago because [laughter] ... off the charts now\nOr to the fact that you know to the point that in fact or Beethoven does not need the former presidents of campaigning in Texas um but but\nThe that that didn't carry over the ...\nThe Trump momentum is built on a number of things and real things it's not rock stardom but if you want to talk about a political rockstar and that would be somebody in my opinion that that that performs gets things done on his agenda\nNot not that Obama didn't get things done on his agenda they got Obama carry through you know they had to lie about it but they got it through\nA this president got affected things done on the economy this president got in and\nCreated more jobs is president got in and work with Republicans to bring taxes down\nAnd I don't think we've had this conversation we don't think he could have that anyone else could have done that Republicans are alone could have gotten it down on the corporate rate to Twenty one percent\nBut if you look at those accomplishments\nThat's where the following that's where the ... it's ... that's where it's built and then as you mentioned the Kavanaugh saying something new to him what to do it woke up conservatives it woke up the\nMaybe some of the rhinos who had a band in too many conservative principles\nAnd had them read look\nI guess we are examined the threat to democracy the constitution and everything our entire system and process in place during that Kavanaugh debacle that\nWhole thing so that threat became real this is not some kind of rock stardom oh we think looks great or we think he's cool or we like the way he tweets\nIt's based on real things there's a big difference\nBetween skateboarding throw water burger parking lot and getting the corporate tax rate down to Twenty one percent\nWhile you know you and I were talking about this said that if there is a\nIs there and we had mentioned you know the ... or work here in uh in in Texas that that is viewed as the rock star mhm\nWell uh Bud Kennedy of the star telegram weeded out the other day and I just read the article that he wrote based on that tweet yeah there's a place called the originally theater molds like three to five hundred people that's it couldn't fill it couldn't felt\n\nThat it was three quarters cornered Bud Kennedy who's three ... you know three quarters full and did an article is ... burn out already here so when you talk about it ever existed I ordered the I've ever really right did did it ever really exist or was it hype just what was it was it hype and the rank and file or hide it in the media right where it\nIs you know is it is the point so if you look at the excitement factor\nA and again I don't look at crowds just going to visit a candidate a you know see a candidate as the the be all end all as as to whether people will go out and vote or not all I Know is this that on the issues right now on the economy it's a plus for the Republicans\nOn on\nExposing what the Democrats really really want\nAnd and what they really believe when it comes to this country\nThat do they even believe in the constitution do they believe in free speech that they believe in Second Amendment do they believe in due process under the law and we're finding out no they don't actually don't believe in the tenets of this country right right and those are pretty simple things to understand\nMaybe the separation of powers you don't understand maybe exactly what the role of Supreme Court you don't understand but you do understand due process\nYeah and and you do understand the second amendment\nAnd most people do understand free speech and\nMaybe not everything that's in the first amendment\nBut they do understand the free speech everything that the Democrats now do not believe in and are bragging that they don't believe in in those particular things and then you have a caravan of illegal immigrants that are promoting it and the media's giving them as much publicity as possible they are going to show up Trump they're\nComing to the border to crash the border has the mid term elections are just Fifteen days away and it would take them I read one thing that to go what is it the eight hundred miles right I've heard you would take them five hundred and forty seven hours\nWhich means okay so should they should be closing in on the border come election day ... probably not something the Democrats want to be promoting as much as they're promoting it right or the media is promoting as much as they are going to promote it because until I think Kavanaugh\nIllegal immigration was still the number one issue of concern for Americans and as you said\nIf there's a conspiracy out there in our priest show meeting and from it in order to get them build the wall right Trump is fun to this whole thing\nBecause if I got a lot of conspiracy theory that just because boom it worked for him if there's if there's anything that that could get get it back on track in terms of the funding for for the wall that he wants\nThe motivation right now go ahead keep promoting the care of and right up to election day\nDo it and let's see what happens let's see what happens on election day because\nEven if the Republicans took the house what kind of solid victory is that I'm In long lines ever to ... I I mean Democrats took the house and you know by by just you know what ten Fifteen margin\nRight two or three margin yes ability so even if they did that what kind of long lasting ...\n... if if you

Ninety right either go to Rick in Virginia Rick Hi you're on right everybody I Walk into the show I read I\nThink how you doing I'm\nI was just thinking this is not totally relevant to the topic but I was thinking that all things being the same except let's say that Brett Kavanaugh was a liberal a\nJudge and he was appointed by a liberal a precedent um do you think that those in the media who are on the left and those in the media on the right and the\nThe liberal and conservative politicians would have taken the exact same position had everything been reversed except but everything else has to say just wondering what what\nWell I I I I Know this that Republicans I mean you had you had people like us that criticized soda my your ... and and criticized Elena Kagan but it was on the specifics of how she would rule as a judge\nBut they got Republican votes they weren't demonized the way the Kavanaugh was demonized\nRight it did I mean so I I Will say no it it would not be it would not be exactly the same based on the history of what happened to them they were criticized and they were severely criticized by construction is like us to believe that you should follow the rule of law\nBack and looked at showed him I your just sort of Myra ... who who who talked about\nUh the fact that uh oh sorry I'm not supposed to really talk about the fact that we legislate from the bench right right uh we had to lay in a cake and when she couldn't answer the question about uh which was she was asked by a senator whether the government should be able to tell you what food\nYou know you have to you have to buy and she didn't answer the question because it got down to what she believes the Supreme Court\nIs actually you know a a a about how you're supposed to rule as a judge\nBut uh no I I don't think it would have been if it would have been a ... number one it wouldn't have happened you're not going to have a liberal justice\nUh then again with Trump to never know but you're good at you could've early\nFor you but I guess in that point from the color if it was a a liberal president who appointed a liberal justice and there was an accused you're like a you had a doctor for it but if you but then will fully reverse it be it being Dr Ford had a right leaning\nAffiliation as opposed to left leaning affiliations I'm no that wouldn't have\nThat ... it wouldn't have played out the same way because the media wouldn't have done the same thing that they did here I mean the behavior would be different yeah I mean it would be quite the opposite\nOr use you see it all you you see it already whether it's you know senator brown of Ohio mhm they're not pounding him for stating that the unfounded allegation against a ... him as a political hit job or not covering him not covering up the same way and I won't\nNo no no no\nNo no I don't believe it would be the same no color\nAnd and I think we've seen is like you said we've seen that demonstrated I don't know how many times now\nAlong the way um\nI don't know that that I don't know that anybody would expect it to be the same any especially any critical thinkers that's watching the entire process play out in any given scenario would expect that to be the same but now if that was ... all of those items were reverse what you saw from\nKavanaugh was the first there's nothing to cry or that\nYou know that's right that's right great point there's no there's no way to you know that was a precedent that was set by the lab and by the way that's the new normal for them this is kind of behavior [noise]\n\n\nThe sous

I if you're a Trump supporter\nOn trade what he was talking about when he ran for office and what he actually got were two totally different ballgames completely yeah and what he was talking about in the campaign compared to what he was what he actually got and promoted the good at what he got was completely different than when he was running for his campaign as we've said\nIf his most loyal if the always Trump hers want to support it and go with that we're fine with that because all we care about\nIs the actual substance what did you actually get and does it promote more free trade to promote a more more good things but the ultimate thing that he promoted which actually negative it raises the cost of cars in the United states Canada and Mexico and that's a bad thing mhm and now\nI think the average person who understands economics who was caught up in the political I dollar tree will admit that's a bad part of the deal the always Trump\nOr just ignore it ignored as if it doesn't exist were not just going to go there he got the deal he said he was going to redo NAFTA he did after what was in NAFTA I don't care don't want to know and that's fine that's part of a demographic that's going to vote for every president that exists sure but that's not the only demographic that voted for Trump we broke it down to eight different demographics\nAbout six months after the election\nAnd there's a ton of people that in that age demographics is more now more United and you can even add an ninth and there which are the never Trump ers which have now come aboard mhm so Trump\nFor all of the good in the bad has United with the help of Kavanaugh and the help of the Democrats and then speaking bluntly about what they want this country to become\nA have United around Trump and they do look at Trump he is that I think your head that isn't\nThem right and and I think you look at the end and you said this earlier if you want to look at the ... the the real rock star look at the terms in terms of performance in terms of getting things done Trump over ... come on and I'm close because\nOne thing that that is going to always resonate with American people is a good economy\nIt's going to be a man I'm doing okay everybody in my family seems to be doing okay a job status doing OK and or getting better\nYou look at the unemployment numbers in and it's getting to where the liberal media can't argue any of those points anymore they can't break it down because you you just simply can't numbers now\nThey can be manipulated but in breaking them down in terms of the performance as as long as we've used the same standard standard with the same standard of approach basically on those numbers\nYou cannot have a debate about the unemployment or the GDP or anything else because the last president was judged by the same exact standards\nAll of this basically wraps up into one thing\nWhat is it that the other side wants to do and is that a threat to this\nExisting ... you know economy right now in other words a you know I'm really I'm I Am doing a little bit better you know my jobs doing better or making a little more whatever it might be I'm I'm checking home a little more taxes are lower [noise]\nNot only that but I remember you know we said this\nAnd I don't know if anybody's ever used the exact same words that we used and I think we used to probably uh I think this was early in the primaries and we continue to say it all the way through the election\nAnd we and and the media has completely missed is totally ... but it's not just that the analysis that I was telling you that I read yesterday the Trump is the average ... an average person the average person looks at them as the average person what does that entail the average person\nIf you cause that to me doesn't describe the the the substance at just that's labeling people I use an average person therefore he likes Trump's because Trump relates to the average person because they believe he's like the average person what does that mean\nAnd you and I actually use the L Word back\nWay back in the in in the campaign I Believe that and and I believe this too but I Believe the Trump loves America ... and I believe\nHe loves Americans and he loves Americans first\nUm\nBut he loves Americans and I think the people that support him I think part of the political I dollar tree which is different than Obama's political I dollar tree\nRight is that they look at him and they say here's a guy that truly loves America and he loves me he cares about me yeah he is rude and yeah he screwed but when it gets down with a law that comes from the anger that we believe that he shares with us that these other people don't love America\n... and we love America and how do we love it and now the left only meat ... would get insulted we love America no you don't you don't believe in due process\nYeah both Cuomo America's never been great right ... ... exactly mhm\nYou you really you really don't you don't really believe in the first amendment you don't really believe in the second amendment you don't now believe and due process you don't believe in a presumption of innocence what do you really love about America you and I had brought this up\nFor over ten years when we've gone through certain issues and said women if you don't care about this and you don't care about the constitution 'cause what makes us Americans do we live in the same geographical place no no\nIt's we share\nAn idea and what is that idea the ideas the constitution and the United state us and when you have a group of people are political party were checked that\nThis is a bum\nOh because that's what the Democrats tried\nOh it's just a bunch of basalt there oh Trump loves America we love America or\nWhat do you mean I Love America to actually if you don't believe in the constitution you don't love America you may loved the concept of what you as a group all think America should be\nBut you don't love America the way that it exists under the current constitution\nAnd the rules and regulations that we have you and I've talked about it when you talk about the fact now they're talking about well the president needs to remember the president's seat\nIs no longer effective or that needs to go yeah the the the electoral college needs to go to the Senate needs to go and what they don't understand that those are key words that you don't believe in individual liberty\n\nLately it seems like everything we use every day is getting an upgrade when the bed we sleep in to the

be like ... like scratch your way and it will be playing or shove it like\nI didn't understand who who will go on our side will be going home local orderly\nNobody knows who service or you're if you're talking about the behavior of the the uh the uh interrupted though disruptive kind of and we're getting some interference when your calls will let you go\nUm if you're talking about the disruptive type of behavior or the after the the committee vote on Kavanaugh Kamala Harris and and uh and others walking out that kind of behavior who on the right would do that\nI don't know of anybody that would do that our point was that it would have been a different scenario based on the media treatment of\nA set individual and everything but that's really more about the media treat\n'em and what we do and we did go back in and talked about the breaking down of the um uh you know how they have acted or behaved\nAs a judge during the confirmation process for sort of my or or for land a Kagan and what they might do in a in a certain scenario but that was based on\nTheir behavior as a judge you still had Republicans vote for them and you still hot and that was their treatment of them was based on again how they would behave as a judge that was part of a what Lindsey Graham and say\nYou know he voted for Elena Kagan and sort of my ...\nAnd so it was the behavior be you know\nI'm a a\nA ... well a Lindsey Graham getting up and walking out likely not no because I think what you saw and Lindsey Graham and uh his uh emotional or the you know statement\nThat day during that hearing when Kavanaugh was there was based on the ... the behavior of those on the left and how they were treating this and essentially a shredding the process\nAnd and I think that's what that's what that was if it had\nYou know a liberal president and it was a a liberal justice or liberal judge\nA that had been appointed and during this process there was a conservative leaning or a you know a woman who accused him of doing something with the behavior be different by the media would have been treated the same likely not no\nBut it was kind of a\nYou know with all due respect of well the answer I think we all know that any critical thinkers does I don't expect they Lindsey Graham or or another conservative on the committee or or Republican on the committed to get up and do what ... you know after the committee will get up and storm out\nThat was ...\nYou know but I'll Wait wait a minute and again you can't make the case he was trying to make the case that was the same and I'm like no it was unprecedented what happened right mhm and you you can look at Justice Thomas you know that goes back you know twenty five\nOr ... that goes back twenty five years ago and and uh you know he those hearings were held and then but then but then he was he was you know confirmed that I Believe some Democrats even cross the line and voted for him yes they did I Believe that yes they did well I Believe that was a Democrat Senate at the time\nYeah ah so yeah so you know they they ... but this was unprecedented\nNothing nothing we have ever seen a it in our lifetime or in modern times has has been like this so to even question that\nTo me uh shows ignorance and that doesn't mean stupidity it means a lack of knowledge ah on on history and that's why we brought up and said that didn't happen with sort of money earned that didn't happen with Kagan there were people that disagree with that because we we believe\nThat sort of my or and Kagan many times not all the time\nOn the\nCell tower right to cell tower case of the cell tower that they agreed with Gorsuch should they you know that ah they used the in their writings they used um\nPrior judgment or by opinion written by ... majority opinion written by Scalia is exactly that was the press and the right to use\nBut in many of their many of their answers and many of their their decisions we believe they legislate\nUh we're all raced conservative or moderate Democrats but he's taking it helped pass show I mean it's you know just to back it [laughter] I don't know it just amazes me it's like a waste it\nThirty three years in the air [laughter]\nCountry that didn't even know that the constitution I mean you have a right to get\nOn ya yeah I understand yeah I understand there's always been the it on yeah there's always been thank you for your service uh there there's always been the ... have been flows I mean if you if you were walking around the Nineteen thirties as an adult in this country you would have seen\nOr you know the socialist mindset that really really really really existed at times or the anarchist movement that ah in in the first part of the twentieth century or that that existed in this country could get a just as wild at at times\nOne of the things is that the factors do do as many people still hold his radical views\nAs you see maybe a little more right now I don't know how many Democrat rank and file actually hold the views of not believing and due process as the mainstream of the Democrat leadership now does right we would rain I seem to see where is there a big just right now now we we\nKnow that on many of the issues the ... if you if you actually pulled Democrats on all the major issues out there as to what they would want you would see as we saw back in and we noted back in a twenty twelve especially when on the issues the majority of the public agreed with\nA Romney Ryan yeah on the issues they aren't read with ... and if you take a ton of the issues that rank and file Democrats believe\nThey disagree with what the people they vote for a does and I think to a much greater extent than any Republican voting for a Republican president ... yeah\nYeah because you think about this if you think about the conservative never Trump spurs\nThe vast majority of the issues that they disagree with Trump on is his tone yes\nWhich is it similar to what they are a lot of the left criticizes him for his words in his town\nAnd it's not so much the job that he's done you know they may pick apart you know whatever it is in the tariff babies [laughter] by the way we are the original ... babies um but but but they may become part these things or this or that but ultimately if you got down and you were to ask the never Trump or is a conservative never Trump has\nA well okay the corporate tax rate Twenty one percent did you think that was going to happen or do you apply that do agree with that um the unemployment rate the GDP where we are right now uh do you think we're moving in a good direction and the president's done a good job on a number of items\nI don't know how you would you look at even as a never trying and I\nI Believe the president should fight more when it comes to the debt he's taking little victories which I'm cutting the federal government this much but it's doing nothing to solve the budget problem he ... he throws those he throws out but the fact is\nHe knows he's not the legislative branch and yes he knows he the one power yeah this isn't this isn't the president alone\nThat has you know created this deficit spending\nThese other Republicans in Congress including a significant portion of conservative or formerly conservative [laughter] drink right also who wants to identify conservative Republican congressional members that are also wanting to spend eight eight eight a ton of money well how did\nThey get taxed on Roy Moore last yeah and I realized oh my gosh we got to get things done a because we may lose the Senate at some point we've got the slim you know victory here are slim margin now and it they didn't the Republicans in the Senate\nDidn't get it done until after that lost the president had been working toward that but again this answer tight if they're not going to do anything right\nI think the president should still work harder and still talk about more which he does not ... you probably and and I I'm thinking the probably the White House says look we can't win this ... because our own party\nDoesn't care any more about the debt well you know what's what's really disappointing I guess the downside of the capital of the thing or what it may have motivated a lot of people or whether it's a never Trump or his or or the the moderate Republicans a who now are standing up and for conservative principles again\nIt could be too little too late not not in the Senate but in the house and the president and the Republicans if\nThe just imagine that that the Republicans maintain power in the house and the Senate the motivation to get things left now work on getting things done right that's very real but it can happen if the house isn't there\nIf you lose the house is going to be limited

about our top secret so I read this a man when I was on vacation I Can't remember who wrote it but it just popped into my head down as you were talking about it that talked about Hillary Clinton you know while she removed herself ... uh you know from having top secret clearance\nShe she removed herself and the point was made well she should have been removed a long time ago right\nIf if putting a server in your house if being so ... uh with\nAt the minimum careless and then the maximum absolutely premeditated ah a mindset of breaking espionage law ... by allowing the top secrets of the country to go through your private server\nWhich now we're told foreign enemies were able to access it that doesn't get you to lose your security clearance what in the hell well right\nThere are no top secret if somebody can be so careless\nAnd not lose their top secret clearance because what is it especially the written mean if yeah and and I read that I said oh go that's the point that came out of this is not\nWell she voted to really do to the mood was taken away from her that still pointed should have been taken away from our right\nWhere's the oversight\n\nBut from the judge or I Want to read part of the transcript\nOr from a U.S district court judge Royce Lamberth the transparency group judicial watch initially sued the department of or the state department and twenty fourteen seeking information about the response to the big guys the attack\nAfter the government did not respond to a freedom of Information Act request other parallel lawsuits by judicial watch are probing issues like Clinton server\nWhose existence was revealed during the the course of the litigation\nThe state department head in a minute lever a moved to dismiss judicial watch his first lawsuit on the motion for some re judgments sane and an affidavit that it it conducted a search of all potentially relevant emails in the possession and provided them the affidavit noted\nThat some more documents and emails could be forthcoming but Lambert denied the request to dismiss the lawsuit at the time and on friday he said he was happy he did charging the state department officials had intentionally misled him because other key documents including those on Clinton's email server\nAnd in fact not Ben produced it was clear to me\nThat at the time that I wrote initially that false statements were made to me by career State Department officials and it became more clear through discovery that the information that I was provided\nWas clearly falls regarding the added the adequate see of the search and this is\nWhat we now know turned out to be the secretaries email system Lambert said on friday he continued I don't know the details of what kind of IGA inquiry a there was into why these career officials at the state department would have filed false affidavits with me by the way that's perjury\nYes when you do that yes you're telling the court something when you know to be something else I don't know the details of why the Justice Department lawyers did not know false affidavits were being filed with me but I was very relieved that I did not accept them and that I allowed limited discovery\nInto what had happened during a tense exchange with Justice Department lawyer Robert Prince Lambert pressing issue accusing prince of using double speak and playing the same word games but Clinton plane\n\nThat was not true that is a quote the judge said referring to the state department's assurances in sworn declarations that it had searched all relevant documents quote it was a lie\nAnd I thought about this the culture because we talked about the culture of the Obama administration the culture that existed in the IRS\nWhereas we know they purposely we're trying to hold up\nThe ah the tax documents what do you call it again the tax um of all I got my blank here are the ...\nWhen I go to ... ... no no no the ... though they were trying to hold up these groups that wanted to get a a a tax exempt taxes yet right ... again status because they held them up by the way you want to know why I'm against the income tax I'm against the income tax for that reason right there\nI'm against the income tax because the government should never have to review any group as to their intentions as the federal government was able to do that's why I Believe there should be a sales tax ... that's why I'm against an income tax write because the government has using income tax to get involved\nAnd to censor people and to do things that they have no business being involved in your life in right\nNow and\nThen by the way you're touching on something I referred to earlier you know that that whole process of and well it was a couple of rogue agents remember that yeah it was a couple of rogue agents yeah no it wasn't no it wasn't and we're not seeing if it was a direct order from the White House down\nWhat we're saying was there was a tone a clear tone that was set\nWe know we know to be the behavior the pattern of behavior\nDuring that administration on many levels the question is how far did that go and was the tone and the department of justice or at the state department just that look will do anything we want to we don't we don't have to tell the truth even to the courts\nWell and and when I when I look at when we look at the situation with the IRS which you'll look at all the rest of this seems the Irish might be minor [laughter] compared compared to everything else when you when you when you look at for example here the department of of\nOf a state where the judge is saying you lied to me yes you absolutely lied to meet you committed perjury\nYou let an affidavit says his accusation right or you know it to a ... to them you look at what went on so that we're looking at the FBI and the department of justice you're looking at after when the pies an application\nWas declassified on the other documents declassified but the president didn't release it but send it to the inspector general\nOf the department of justice who looks at what\nLooks at corruption you look at how they were so willing the state department to lie on Benghazi yeah and and this is why the whole thing or with the\nUm\nOh I just I got my ... like you're in but on the air for a while [laughter] we're on vacation I Do [laughter] with cars show ... ...\nWith the ... the debt murder of of ah of Mr a jump off a cause show ... over in Turkey or wherever it happened where we've sold on all the information because nobody has been able to independently verify\nWere turkey has said I'm sure somebody in the CIA may know but the average person doesn't know and this is why the Democrats have no business on talking anything about this administration\nAnd how they've handled it so far especially when there's a lack of clarity as to what actually happened in this particular case should be investigated absolutely should there be repercussions\nIf what we believe might have happened happened ... absolutely there should've been but the Democrats have no business of talk after all the Democrats and the media backed up Hillary Clinton's line about a terrorist attack that got Americans killed and they lied about it\nAnd she knew about it and I believe the White House and President Obama knew that they were lying about it why there was an election coming up so they lied about it a terrorist attack on that killed American citizens and an American ambassador and they lied about it\nAnd one we discovered that the evidence existed that Hillary lied about it

us here today in Texas I don't know when it starts across the nation for other ah states but just Fifteen days away from election day in so much to talk about as we've been doing throughout the morning back you we go let's talk to Mike in Washington state Mike Hi you're on the radio I might\nThank you this whole meal or the thing is just like it's just so frustrating for the voters because it drags on and on he's coming up with nothing it's false accusations and it's I think we're going to win the house because of it because people are sick and tired of it\n... it's interesting because there there was a report that was out last week my dad said uh they expect mall or a ... to issue here is the core of his report\nAfter the midterm and I'm Wondering why after the midterm and and what's going on a wide is the media\nThey just a band in this story and I mean they've banned in this story completely there's really nothing going on like what you saw up until a I don't know what a couple of months ago maybe\nAnd then we're going to win the house I well I I don't know that we will but it's interesting Mike\nThere what I don't believe was is this uh like the FiveThirtyEight\nThing saying that you know they an eighty five percent chance that the Democrats will take the house\nBecause you have to get into all the different polls in all these districts and I mean there's a ton of but then we can break it down much easier into those thirty one talks of seats right that that right now according to our she'd be there are thirty one tossup seats there are things like ah Texas thirty two\nUh Pete Sessions and his Democratic challenger is someone who was in the last poll which was twenty eight days ago today\nA was within a point now we know because we live\nHere in in this area we know that that district is a north of Dallas County uh and so there has been a ... a demographic shift that's been going on that shift has been happening really\nOver the last uh probably a three to five years but really over the last few years especially because so much growth in this area brings individuals and for jobs right so there's a the the demographics change so that could be an accurate ... we don't know my question is why are we seeing those big pollsters in these\nA tossup districts and why aren't we seeing these new polls come out especially a couple of weeks out\nBecause if you're looking at the house you would think that there was some interest there by the media in order to hire these pollsters these major pollsters are to do a more in depth polls we maybe we'll see some starting this morning and into next week or an over the next couple of weeks as election day is one week from tomorrow\nBut my question is\nReally not if five thirty eight or any of them are wrong\nOr because um who was at that uh had the basically the the it was like a fifty fifty on the house was that NPR a couple of weeks ago the Saturdays ago yeah\nYeah so and and it came out to eat yesterday\nThat in what is it likely a vote or ... or the Republicans are moving closer right okay that that came out just yesterday I think I have writers somewhere yeah the the the story here but\nIt's so much tougher to tell on those house seats I just I I Wonder if that if we're going to gain\nIn the in the in the Senate mhm and so that's you know that's looking at a populations across the state and right here or that\nYou know I just wonder how they extrapolate it out to so many of these races where if they're using the public polls out there there are so few of them\nSo few and far between those now if you're going to the internal polling polling which I'm sure is being done by the campaigns run you would have the better you know a better guess at that right yeah it it gets here\nIt is a a a Dems midterm advantage narrows among registered voters yeah my new national poll a few weeks before the midterm election shows the chances of a blue wave are far from a slam dunk for the Democrats the NBC Wall Street Journal poll released a Sunday shows forty eight percent of registered voters\nWould prefer having Democrats in control of Congress compared to forty one percent supporting the G O P these seven point gap is narrowing from a ... point gap the Democrats had in September I don't know if that tells you anything though\nWell and and again I mean registered voters ... we've got to talk about likely voters and then again what the motivation is on election day and it's we've been talking about this it has changed since the Kavanaugh's confirmation\nLeading up to and since I don't know to what extent I Can't tell you it's motivated the left or the right more we do know\nThere's no doubt the right is motivated Republicans are motivated right now are they more motivated than Democrats I Can't tell you that\nNow I I watch it on the Mike called before we started talking about you know the the whole Russian collusion at the top of the hour and I say that because", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "city": "Johnson City", "day": "22"}
