in Iran very poorly by the Democrats right now\nAnd that may be a motivation or its point of view um I also want to make the point that I think they're upset with the fact that\nI'm like you said he's

and why\nA ... raising the cost of goods and services irrespective of the slogan to do it as irrespective of the slogan that is used to justify to do it ... economics doesn't care about his slogan\nNo ... in it or you look at the dynamics of of that situation where you have producers here in the U.S\nOr that have their cost their their raw materials costs going up a PG for example but then of course the cells that are lost in the exports\nAre from the retaliatory tariffs from the other side\nAnd and then the dynamics of the pricing\nSo you want the the product from wherever it is outside the u._s. and you pay your going to pay because of the tariff right and then the producer at the domestic producer of a similar product because part of it is protectionism\nThen\nGoing to raise their prices because you know they're being hurt so they're justified in raising their prime because they can and because they can and all they have to be as a penny cheaper than the foreign product\nTo be competitive tell me tell me why that's a positive\n\nAh we have stated that are all along and I do think that again the uncertainty because still today Congress completely silent mhm uh on the uh trade deal formerly known as NAFTA mhm a steel tariffs\nAluminum tariffs which added to the base cost of how many thousands tens of thousands of products out there which as we have seen in a and I don't know I haven't seen an update on it we know that in the first half of the year steel was forty percent\nA we know that the trade agreement\nFormerly known as NAFTA does not cover steel and aluminum and until there is a deal\nThe tears from what I Know unless they have made exceptions to the ruins and some of those cases still remain\nWith Canada and\nMexico so we said that when we looked at the you know when when we looked at the the trade deal formerly known as NAFTA but the most part they're really much isn't much of a difference\nUh we you know the I saw especially on social media Trump promised to rewrite NAFTA yeah he did a little bit\nBut he didn't do anything that he planned that he\nSaid he was going to do which was I'm going to reduce one hundred and fifty billion dollar trade deficit\nRight\nThat this that this isn't going to do it there were a little winds here or there\nThe problem with the the new trade\nDeal as we said that will be a long term problem is\nAnd the\nPresident views it as a victory is raising the cost or to buy a car in Mexico the United states and Canada making it more expensive to produce the car\nTherefore making it more expensive to buy a car\nAnd making it less likely that the president one of the president's number one goal which is to be able to produce products here and sell them overseas has just been flushed down the toilet because\nIt's going to be more expensive to manufacture vehicles here which is exactly the opposite if you wish to sell them overseas right\nIt's the one thing they're ... they're a couple of things but it's really the one major thing where I have no idea where the president's stance on it as we know he has changed his mind on he'll change his mind on on trade in a week they'll go from as he did one for me in a complete protection is just sounded like a total free trader I've no idea where he really stands\nI Do know though that in this in the the\nUh trade deal formerly known as NAFTA\nThat he viewed what he did to raise the price of buying a car and producing a car in North America\nHe put that as as his number one victory mhm which we have said that is what drives us crazy that's why we're tariffs babies [laughter] the original or if they were the original Tara babies as the president said now you know something we you know we laughed at it I Wonder how many\nFarmers were laughing at that comment though well because the ... you know he talks about protecting the farmers in\nThe move on ethanol which was not a mandate and likely will have little\nIf any impact because the the the the the fuel producers don't don't want it they don't want the higher blend the it it may sound like a good deal to be able to uh sell the Fifteen in the summer first of all here comes a lawsuit here comes a lawsuit here comes a lawsuit um but\nIt will but even because at the refinery level you don't have to do the special summer blend\nBut when there's no market for it then there would be a ... a glut of the product\nAnd for the consumer that temporarily money might be a good thing but the point is we're not going to get to a Fifteen with out a mandate and he knows politically outside of the corn belt you can't get that done it too so but\nAppeasing farmers and and using that politically on on the uh on the tariffs\nAnd then they came back and said well we're going to give you billions of dollars to help you which you just admitted it's hurting them to that extent and they came back and said that's a tiny number compared to what we're what we're losing and the fact\nThat we're losing the ability to be in that supply chain in once we lose that and we're not dependable in that world supply chains are going to go somewhere else so it's not just well the tariffs hurt us until they were lifted it's the fact that we may never get back in those markets again because these countries don't know when you'll use\nNational emergency or trade deal you know or\nOr the the the fact of of ah the we need to get a you know a new trade deal or whatever to to uh\nTo\nTo terrified you're not an double anymore you're not a consistent supply chain exactly and that is a problem that the you have but ah you know we noticed that you know it was obvious that President used the greatest victory and that's the weird thing on trade to begin with countries always talk about their trade victories\nAnd their trade victories were always when their citizens have to pay more money for goods and services right we don't know how that's a victory\nRight we can figure that one out here's one thing or to media asked that question mhm\nYeah I mean bands at when when you look at it and you know you you talk about the supply chain Canada saying you know or Mexico saying they're going to go to Canada and work out a deal you know for poor\nOr as we call it Canadian Bacon and the\nWhen they set up that supply chain if they're happy with that agreement why did they go back to us for\nWhat would they are with any of those products from a domestic producer if you believe that the government is going to step in and disrupt that process then you're going to make another long term deal elsewhere with someone else\nBut we said this during the you know the um during the permit tore him after the uh when when the Gulf spill happened\nThe BP thing that\nThat whole thing where you had companies are producers from uh the U.S saying well we can you know go somewhere else if we're going to do offshore drilling and you're not going to give us a permit back you know we can go somewhere else you don't just make that decision\nShort term right\nAnd so you're you're gonna have to make long term plans because you can't deal with you know the the shift in policy\nUh you know on a ...\nAt the staff of finger and and frankly\nThe ethanol thing it's become you know the for the ethanol farmers that's one thing but you look at the entire farming community and I'm Talking to political support if they're hurt going into and and this is what we haven't been able to gauge\nYou go to Iowa I mean and\nFor those people that the New York times that are listening when you go to Iowa let me describe before Iowa is is the state in the middle of the country\nWhen you go there it is\nConnected to farming just like Texas' oil directly or indirectly\nI mean that is the driver there when you go to the to the the farm belt\nThat's everything what's the impact right now of terrorists politically votes\nFor Republicans and in twenty twenty ... at the mid term this year and in twenty twenty for the president and his reelection because keep in mind they may support Republicans who are on board for terrorists\nTime and twenty Eighteen at the midterms are they going to support the president who owns a completely if it's still ongoing in twenty twenty\nNot surprised by what happened the last couple of days you know you and I've talked about that\nAnd we said look the big terrorists were hit on September twenty eight mhm so I'm not surprised that when you look at you know steel and aluminum and how they have skyrocketed since the beginning of the year right and we said look eventually it's gonna be a point where the market's going to say look you're raising prices too uh too much and when the terrorists went into effect on

than\nThirteen hundred a ... points so there you go yeah I'm\nTaking a look at the uh overnight or markets and a globally a and it looks like a against being down too as well around the around the world how long lived\nIs that it is the president's a trip as he announced on a Thursday morning it was going to try and go into China mhm right\nSo how long is a I guess this going to to last that the market\nYou what you're looking at his earnings reports ... ten percent drop was based on what happened to them and the third quarter and that situation has not changed at this point or because they they talked about three dynamics there and that's raw materials a freight\nUh and and the and oil costs um\nIf the president gets to China they get a deal done on tariffs\nI was just a it was just\nReading something it at Business Insider talking about the uh what is going on right now with a\nYou know with trying to their exports to the U.S continue for the most part even with the terrorists in place they say they're still moderately strong\nWell it doesn't change the the uh trade deficit\nRight a scenario is is not likely to change it wasn't going to\nIn with the new NAFTA you know so that that thing is kind of off the table\nBut with China you have a couple of concerns the the very valid concern is the intellectual property concerned mhm that's the real thing that the president has to address I mean the terror thing is going to have to be remedied but\nIt's going to they're going to have to there's going to have to be and it's not just pressure from the U.S when the ... when the president announced that he was going to or it was announced that the president would be going to China to sit down with a she in China well\nThat's we need everybody at that table on our side of the table the rest of the world needs to be in China's face saying this can't happen anymore you got to play by the rules\nThe\nBecause of the ... if you look at the the steel and aluminum tariffs if those are in place long term you're going to see\nYou're going to see an adjustment on the stock market the stock market is the least of your concerns\nThe reason it's adjusting as because things are becoming more expensive like you mentioned uh the fed with interest rates are the the you know I agree or disagree the sanctions on Iran is is causing a lot of the global uh oil prices to to go up or\nThe Saudis have some play in that too yes and we'll see if they ramp up production and and and aren't able and change that and it is an incentive uh uh again\nBecause it makes it more profitable for American producer yes and and were eventually going to get to that point I Believe I well\nIt depends on who's in Washington but I Believe we will get to the point of self sufficiency where you know we can produce for the United states and export at the same time which is a which will be a great point a to a to get to we're not there yet but as we ... really one of the most underreported stories\nOf the entire year\nIs that the United states is now\nAnd it happened about three weeks ago became the number one producer of oil in the world mhm\nYeah um and and this is it I mean you if you put in place all the things of that will make an economy great again [laughter] um and they did by the way I think\nThat's the number one reason or ... supporting a or the or the president his tax bill ... way way down\n[laughter] but um the you know the [laughter]\nThat'd be enough for me [laughter] it's not the case for me though mine went up a but but the line to get right\nSo the but but you put in place\nAll of those dynamics for a great economy and all it's working up until what the ... three numbers we talked about the GDP numbers from the second quarter and said hey this is great\nBut what is the third quarter fourth quarter and then first quarter of next year look like if the cost of raw materials\nIs still high and increasing still going up that is a

Medicare for all ... well then you're going to destroy the system for old people oh sure yeah I went whoa\nI mean that was a ... that was a great political responds all the ... from our product from

for them\nOr not for not not for the rest of America it was set up specifically for them you do it you heard old people walk that as well and I thought that was a great political\nAge I think it's a great response I remember when when they were talking about slowing\nThe rate of growth this was Paul Ryan slowing the rate of growth of Medicare they were uh they depicted him and ads as wanting to kill old people\nBut\nWhich site is it that says\nOh people should go home and die\nWe're not gonna you know afford all the technology and medications were going to send you home so you can die that was Robert Reich ... almost verbatim what he told Berkeley years ago and the former president Brock Obama again saying the same thing\nThey don't care about the fact that\nElderly people will suffer if you if you give Medicare for all first of all you can't pay for it but I imagine you could pay for even part\nOr half of it\nAgain pure fantasy\nBut what would happen ultimately because you can't afford it it is going to affect the benefits of the ...\nAnd\nThere's ... there's no way to debate that the question is does elect care about the old\n\nWell Brock Obama and and Robert Reich ... one of his advisors a and a labor secretary for Clinton know old people should go home and die\n\nThat's the way they saw it so maybe they don't care I don't think they do but a Schumer needs to say\nWe

reporter the un report serves as a stark reminder of President Trump status as a global outlier in terms of climate change\nTrump has rejected the twenty Fifteen Paris Agreement signed by a hundred

piece of the New York post ... who is the political party who is the country and who under what President\n\nHas reduced greenhouse gas emissions but most when it comes to the substance who has actually reduced greenhouse gas emissions who is number one was if Canada nope no nope Germany nope Australia nope France no\n\nThe one country that pulled out of the phony Paris climate accord reduced as carbon emissions by half a percent the most of all major countries in the world\nSo the rest of the ah the rest of the countries are joining groups are United States has not we're not going

... that are in the middle undecided basically just yet it doesn't show the polls are neck and neck\nAnd does and did you see some of the amounts of the undecided your\nTalking ten eleven ... percent and that's a big deal it is and and\nThe pollsters um aren't as active in the house seats as as they are for the Senate ... ... um they will start seeing that but we haven't seen any polls post cabinet\nWell we don't make predictions but if you if you if you look at the number of toss ups as they call them on on our cp that's thirty two uh the the polls in those areas or you know it in those thirty two districts\nAre really going to start juggling things are showing something here probably by the time you and I get back a week from ...\nAh when when I start thinking about somebody who was undecided today and again in a congressional race who knows but all I'm thinking is that if you got ten to twelve percent that are undecided it means they're not driven by Trump hatred or Trump was\nNot either of that that's driving them so what is it that is what is it that is driving\nYou know that you know that independent in that particular district and we're never going to get the specific poll polling on that lets pull the independence and this congressional district to find out why they are undecided and what would change their vote\nRight would it be in\nTheir local congressman came out and said everything is free but by this time they've already seen a ton of political commercials so what is it that would push them over the edge devoted a certain way especially if they're likely voters\nWhich means in all likelihood they're going to vote but they're still undecided at this moment what is it it's got to be an issue that's huge right yup and watch the huge ... issue over the lead the biggest issue over the last couple of weeks we'll be Kavanaugh I don't know if there will be a bigger issue\nThat that will come out in the in in the next few weeks in popular

and it's going to make the people that love when he'd ... when he does that still love him but it's not going to change what's it think about it who gets to this day and age how can tend to twelve percent possibly be undecided and ... and and most definitely be\nGoing to the polls in November\nYeah it's really it's only when you think about that here's something else interesting looking at the end and it's just\nOne small indicator it's a small movement but I find it interesting looking at our sleepy and the map\nFor the house race or the house races\nSo Republicans took one from the

some some semblance of due process\nAnd the court of public opinion is going to have to be arraigned in some and I think that the Republican direction yeah\nThat's a great country by now yeah\nNo I think it's a great point is that you say that you know the the the court of public opinion or isn't the final determination of of uh of of anything and and the court of public opinion we're talking about on the left side of of of a public opinion and it has to be\nIt has to be due process that's a very that's a you know that that that's a great point that comes from the capital here it's yeah I I think it is and and people apply it uh\nBased on their their own life you know our our audience a and a ... and new sounds and and and people who do we do we're we're in the thick of it we're always immersed in it\nBut most people the average American is not but if they're still politically active in terms of voting\nThey look at it and say okay\nThis this is you know insanity the fact that it went this way they don't\nUh applied the ... believes that they apply their feelings directly to their feelings sleep that is the case for some\nBut most Americans look at it practically speaking and going you know this is a big deal to vote to be able to vote is a big deal and if there are to the point where they are you know in that likely voter category this is why those polls start to shape up the way they do\nThat's why likely voter gives you a better read but they look at that and go you know it's a big deal on election day to get up and go cast my vote\nKnow I Know people show up and they're driven by you know a slogan they're driven by whatever imagery\nBut we can't forget the people that take it varies years they consider things they may not be immersed in it every day like we are for whatever reason\nBut they will show up and they make an informed decision and often it is a reaction Chuck Todd on a with a bottle\nAnd and Chuck Todd who's saying well a lot of people get it wrong and and say twenty sixteen was a referendum on Trump but it really was a referendum on Hillary\nThat was a small part of it what what Chuck Todd us for getting here because they are discussing the polls in the mid term is is about you know the house and Senate and not a presidential election and his point what he was implying that Hillary's not here to be the the bad guy right\nWell what\nChuck is forgetting is the real facts of how the Republicans in districts all over America outperformed Trump and that it wasn't a referendum on Hillary it was a referendum on the left ...\nYou know that that's a great point of the other point brought by the color of their ... and I think you can't underestimate this is that\nAmericans may not know the three branches of government right\nUh you know and and that's what the polls show Seventy five percent of Americans roughly could not tell you all three branches of government they might know one or two or they do zero but they couldn't tell you all three as you said you need to know all three to understand how the government actually works they may not be able to tell you the freedoms and the first amendment\nBut think about when it comes to due process\nI think about since Perry Mason let's go through all the lawyer shows that have been that had been on TV and Donald solved [laughter] well a lot of well I'll Try I'll drop Perry Mason I'll throw up Matt like I'll throw out\nAlmost Thirty years of law and order on the television and\nEverybody understands a presumption of innocence everybody even a significant portion that we're trying to tell you that the allegation is enough if you actually ask\nThem off the record if they believe that they would tell you know why that is bad is just think about that in not just in the courtroom if you've ever been in a jury but it is they're completely in our popular culture shock for me ... ... and it's\nGreat point because you don't have to get into the details of how legislation works for no the three branches of government no but in pop culture we got we got those and yes they are simple lessons for the simple lesson can be enough to recognize when the process is

S. P. S. it has not publicly disclosed Amazon declined to comment on the price hikes and the postal service declined to answer questions\nAny potential impact on the company the increase was for partial select were steeper than in previous previous years us the best of the new rates\nOur results of a regular review process and are set to take effect on January twenty seven subject to approval from the postal Regulatory Commission\nAlright\nA Trump has repeatedly allege that Amazon is to blame for the postal services financial woes and accuses the e commerce giant ripping off the agency and treating it like a delivery boy the president created a special task force in April to examine\nThe postal services business model sparking speculation that he would use it to raise shipping rates on Amazon ...\nA Trump equates Amazon with the Washington Post which is owned by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and as a target of Trump's anger about media coverage\nSo there you go that far from this is from political fuck just ah [noise] then again they have a long term deal with them they are not affected by it right if that if that\nYou know the pricing deal is in place and and look at what these us has done not\nAh I mean just in general if you talk about his a supply chain his delivery each a chain a\nFrom a to B a to Z I guess it was clear that that when he\nStarted making large purchases on his freight company that he was going to be doing more of his own delivery and so while he can't do it all because you have I don't know\nI don't know what the even what the numbers in terms of overall numbers of sellers on Amazon\nThe point being is that there are things coming from all over the world that are sold on Amazon and so it would be impossible for although these those has done other things [laughter] that people didn't see coming uh I don't think any time soon he will have he will control completely his own his own ...\nUh but he is doing that more and more and that was to shut out more and more of the the the um FedEx and UPS\nDelivery that was costing him more and more the costing the consumer more and more and he said this is not about shutting out the little guy if in fact is about creating more opportunity for the little guy and now they they you can go out and get your own local delivery\nUh buy your own local delivery a set up for a for Amazon and by the vans and everything else\nAnd be a part of that and and there's opportunity there it was about creating\nA ah basically\nThe the ability or more and more to control pricing said keep prices low on Amazon according to ... he the U.
