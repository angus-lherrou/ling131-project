effective uh [laughter] I guess they can't actually have clear\nSaying I'm not one of those crazy Democrats [noise]\nBecause that has to be said because this guy that has to be said by somebody else what well she couldn't say that her ... the\nThing is is this isn't pac money this isn't something this this here is\nThe sort of campaign this was her ad yes it's her she you do hear her voice yet saying I approve this message right so I'm not one of those crazy Democrat one of those dating\nRight I'm not one of those crazy Democrats well now I ... it's it's I think it's horrible in what it's trying to do you know what I'm saying I it's not effective in what they're trying to get done\nFrom the ad because it's well it's it's just bizarre it's contrived\nThe only thing that that I can think of is that there are internal polling is showing that independence or leaning hall he's way and one of the reasons is because remember she uses these specific word crazy Democrats\nWell they didn't write or some kind of ... and there's a reason that you there's a reason that you do that there's ... and and the reason that you do that is because there is a segment of those undecided voters that you're going after\nThat in your internal polling you have found out they believe and and I don't know why because I didn't do I I was in ... to the polling could be Kavanaugh could be\nA you know everything that has gone on it it'd be you know the the going into restaurants disturbing\nYeah Republicans whatever but in order to use that term and words are very important especially words that will alienate your own party\nIn a political ad means OK I'm Still safe from the base\nThe base Democrats or I don't have to worry about them I Need to get those independence and they're leaning haul these way we believe and one of the reasons is they believe that the Democrat Party and a significant portion of those that represent the Democratic party in Congress\nAre crazy that can be the only reason you don't do that in an ad I mean could you imagine remembered this isn't even a you\nCan't even say well this is just a house race in a particular area this is the state of Missouri and this is a Senate race mhm\n\nSo inside her campaign which means not just in her campaign but other campaigns across the country this is something that Democrats which ...\nWho wish to promote themselves and pretend to be moderate what they're facing is a significant portion of independents who believe that the Democratic party and members of the Democratic party\nAre crazy well I mean which shows that everything that has happened in the cabinet thing in going into restaurants is having an effect on independence otherwise they would run the ad\nI think there's I I still think there's an end someone must have and and the research the the voters or whoever was you know being a the part of the I I guess group that was being polled must have used those words specifically otherwise it's horrible writing because\nI think a an ad by a Claire McCaskill a could could or for Claire McCaskill could do the same again we're just talking the politics of it\nBy saying you know look we know that there are there are extremes on both sides in right now that I'm not proud of some of the things that are going on in my ... with within my own party and people that are clearly supporting my own party\n... I Want you to know that I Am not that person I'm a great\nDoes it but that that's the point and that's a great point\nRight there yeah it was specifically using the term crazy Democrats someone who had a reviews that any Democrat some someone had to have used that in some kind of feedback that they were getting that feedback that it was crazy Democrats\nNot extreme right I'm not part of the extreme\nOf my partying because he used that why did why the term crazy Democrats because that's the feedback you been getting back right in your own internal polling\nBecause extreme means that you've gone full on one side and in one direction and and to\nA further extent well no that's not what's going on it it is crazy and and that's the perception what you're trying to you're trying to target with those words the very perception as someone who has given that feedback to you with those words\nThat's the only way that happens that's the only way those words ended up in an ad like that\n\nThey because someone must have made that that's that's where the the word crazy must have appeared in feedback and unlikely multiple times and they're\nIn their internal on and you know you're you're talking about tens of millions of dollars to run a Senate race ... which means they're doing every type of of polling an analytical research you can get in front of you get down to this point here and you see the desperation of using that in an ad\nThat means you are trying to fight the perception\nOf crazy Democrats in your election in Missouri and\nIt is the one thing that is killing your chances of winning yeah it is the one thing because it is if you think about the build up to you know if you listen to that there's a bill to\nThat word is is is one of those hot button words that you don't expect to hear but it was placed in the ads strategically at a certain place right as you are listening to something and all of a sudden boom she's not one of those crazy Democrats because and there's another thing too\nIt's a poor attempt I think\nAt recreating a conversation that people are you know having out there but it's not that's not the conversation they're actually having the conversation they're having is if it were really I think accurate and and and portraying what's going on with some of the Democrats or independents interstate it would be two guys going man\nThose Democrats are crazy I don't know but I can vote for Democrats anymore including McCaskill\nThat's the actual conversation so you have to have you have to counter it with this contrived and and again I think it's a it's a it's a poor attempt but that's the only thing you can do you're not going to get Claire McCaskill coming out going hey I'm not one of those crazy Democrats\nOr the other thing I thought was interesting you know and and I'm not you know very familiar with Josh Hawley who's running against the attorney general against\nClaire McCaskill I'm I'm a I'm I'm not you know we live in we live in Texas and that's one of the top things is\nIt's it's tough for anybody ... and and I mean it's tough for anybody on the national stage to really have a key understanding of what's going on for example in ... in Missouri race in many congressional races it's it's really tough because\nA lot of times it can be local and if you're not living there you don't see the stories that are pounded that you\nAre at each and every day but you and I both looked at each other we haven't discussed us but we looked at each other the part where well and it's claimed that\nHolly as attorney general made wine runs and went to the gym ... during work hours\nWhich with\nAll the heated rhetoric yeah and ... the only thing they can make up your own and that was that's what you use and put an ad of desperation well\nHere's the thing is people are thinking oh wait a minute I Wonder if you could pick me up some wine next time he goes because people go to the gym during the day\nAll the time well what's what's the people people run errands all the time just assume okay just assume right that it's it's it's on company time and it's it's well the the the the state time in this case\nAnd it's um it's being done outside of his lunch hour if not on his time\nThat's the worst she got well I'm assuming most attorney general's don't work eight to five\nI'm guessing you hours I'm assuming there's meetings there's speeches there's everything else that goes wind meetings as to why aren't they going to be a part of a job [laughter] but I I again I don't know the specifics behind it but I just went ... and ... and that's\nBut from an outsider you heard that and you went that's pretty weak well for an out of desperation that's pretty weak ... ... ...

gotten an email sided may rise we addressed it to start the the the the show a off with but a National Review and it's been picked up by you know I'm a social media of of the some different a conservative website said\nHave picked it up and this was were National Review a wrote the article that said the pipe bomb or and powder delivered to CNN were harmless this is an article that came out\nA at nine o nine PM from jak crow at National Review and the reference that he gives is the Associated Press story right link to that right they link is right so we linked to the story\nAnd said okay because we didn't see that anywhere else and we said what does the Associated Press story says you know what what does it say and it's funny 'cause during our pre show meeting when I read it I said oh it's saying it then I read it a second time I said well no it's not saying it\nBecause what it says is a law enforcement official such tests of determine that a powder found inside an envelope delivered to CNN along with a pipe bomb was harmless right\nNow you're harmless referring to the powder though that it that's the indication as the it refers to the powder not a pipe bomb now there is no indication as we've stayed to start to show off\nThe FBI has not we have not seen the words these raw active lied bombs that could have gone off and we have seen what but the potentially quote potentially destructive devices and we've asked the question what is potentially destructive devices mean\nWe have seen suspicious packages I'm looking at the last time I checked Fox News about twenty minutes ago they still had the headline suspicious packages\nUh we talked about the the Wall Street journal though actually are calling them mail bombs but not having a quote you know from the FBI stating that they were mail bombs these little things and and again we're just two idiots overnight\nBut these are the the little things that are picked up in different websites are not picking it up just quoting the national review story and not linked him to the Associated Press story\nThat you know that the that you know that the a package sent\nA to CNN was harmless we don't know whether it was or not\nWe don't know if the the uh the the suspicious package separate from the powder in the envelope was harmless there's like there's nothing in the a P story according to their source that says that\nRight and that's what National Review has referenced and their headline pipe bomb in powder delivered to CNN were harmless and other websites are picking that up we don't know outside that Associated Press story that doesn't say that right if you read the sand yeah that's that's the point\nIs that right the the the story that they are referencing doesn't actually say that they it could turn out to be the case and maybe National Review has sources of their own but they're not sourcing they're not using those sort of separate from the Eighteen right\nYou know so it it's just because the\nProblem is is with with if you're going to you know that if that are\nIn the echo chamber of social media especially if that false information misleading information is going to be out there than it is you know it it starts to become or build a narrative in the wrong direction if you start on the wrong premise everything that follows a may sound logical but it still is built on that false premise so\nYou know we just ... and we have a great deal of respect for the people over at National Review yeah they don't sweat it or just an oversight here in my opinion because that's not what the associated\nPress story all I can understand it because when I read it the first time mhm that's what I said do you write I said oh there's there's I'm reading here says the ... and then I read it again I went oh that's not what the scent\nWhat Washington Post on there headline had it right there headline had that the powder that was sent along with the ... you know a along with the\nSuspicious package was harmless and and so the the point being is that that\nThe narrative is going to grow obviously politically it's going to grow and and build and and still continue up until election day if not pass that\nAnd\nYou don't you don't do any good by you know repeating false information now people are going by their trust of National Review you know based on the headline\nWhich which National Review to me is extremely credible look at the time I I don't know maybe it's too late by mistake whatever or like I said when I first read it and that's what I told you as an earth they're saying the

series of explosive devices mailed to several high profile Democrats as domestic terrorism Steve Townsend bum report\nIt happened while puppy Harlow and Jim shoot over angering the news from it said at the CNN New York bureau and talking about the explosive devices tend to Iraq Obama and Hillary Clinton\nIf it was not built or set to go off than it was to send you know a terror threat or political message or both a the a P story that they use as the source there at National Review um\nThe line the effective line from that a ... story\nIs a law enforcement official\nSays tests have determined that a powder found inside a non ... delivered to CNN along with a pipe bomb was harmless the powder was harmless now not the powder and the pipe bomb right right\nAnd so that's what they're that's what they're talking about again here in in that story but it's gone viral because the the uh National Review again unless National Review knows something that we don't but they don't state that understory they're sourcing\nStrictly here the peace story but the reason that it's important is because as you see something like this go viral with that information is is incorrect or any information is incorrect\nAnd the discussions are surrounding this event\nClearly look there's the political aspect of this can't be ignored but the discussion is important because\nYou can't discuss anything without knowing the complete facts you can't discuss much without knowing the complete facts we've discussed the reaction by the media by uh the the Democrats and and what that has been we know very little about this\n... and that's why we had a set to uh a mystery soccer over at the CNN or a whether it was close to your Schumer and their their comments\nOr you know going after and you know and in essence blaming the president's first provocative statements claiming that they're against divisiveness it's interesting that the people that claim that we need to stop divisiveness are the ones that have accused somebody of responsibility of an incident where nobody has any idea no one\nHas any idea who the person might be who would have done this we don't know whether the bombs were lie bombs and would have gone off or not there is so much we don't know yet they are assessing blame that the ones who claimed that they are against divisiveness are committing the the\nOne of the biggest sins of divisiveness and that is what blaming somebody\nWhen you don't have the facts behind you right\nRight\nAnd so as we've said we've discussed is a little bit and and gone through the different questions as others have yesterday and and we we've asked a question that if it was it if they are life ... if they were alive bombs\nAnd and they would have gone off a then you have to look at that in a different way that if\nClearly none of them were alive bombs mhm that it would it be there'd been an attempt to scare or an attempt a possibility of an attempt to ah\nYou know look at major figures in the Democratic party that are not like well by members of the right in this country\nAnd you know try to you know give the tried to send the message that they're out to get them\n... or that you know ... if if it was you know if it was it was a real bombing that's but if it was a big bomb it would be wasn't sent by somebody on the left to try to blame the right there's a whole bunch of different scenarios and questions you would ask is an investigator based on whether\nThe bombs were actually live or whether they were fake bombs right\nYeah and we can only ... will only know that if and when they find the person who or persons who are response\nRight and that could be never\nSo at the you can bet right now they have a number of great leads especially with the fact the nature of of how males sorted or by the secret service\nUh in in terms of the the Clintons when you look at and and the Obamas when you look at that situation um that I think you have to take into consideration what they already know about the patterns of behavior by people who do such a thing\nAnd and their resources uh they're probably on to some pretty solid leads right now then add to that of course cameras being everywhere\nSo you will you know as soon as we get information we can start having that discussion but we want to point that out that you're seeing that story from National Review go viral it's important to have the discussion based on facts based on what we know right and there is a difference and we may learn\nThat uh the authorities and and authorities will tell us or might tell us at some point that those devices were effectively harmless because they weren't set to go off but that is not what you're seeing here and there's a P report that was the source of the national review article\nWhich again just looking at social media overnight is gone it has gone viral that she there wasn't we don't know that yet\nI Associated Press story does not state that and it's important that\nYou know facts were brought up I was reading the daily while your story where they they talked about the\nA reporter for CNN and that looked at Martha ... who was interviewing one of a one of the bomb experts right and this bomb expert gave out all the possibilities who said look could be somebody from the right and he said it could be a you know it could be but you know a foreign state\nThat is trying to destroy the you know this trying to disrupt the election or as you said it could be a false flag from somebody on the left mhm\nSo what the CNN reporter put out was only the response from this expert of\nThat it was somebody on the left and left out when this expert said it can be somebody from the right ... it could be a foreign actor or it could be a false flag from somebody on the left because the election is just two weeks away when I brought up all the possibilities and investigator would bring out\nAnd what did the CNN reporter to weed out just the port the report that apparently media matters poured out which is a leftist leaning a or you know media organization media\nA truth organization where they only put out just his opinion\nYou know on the
