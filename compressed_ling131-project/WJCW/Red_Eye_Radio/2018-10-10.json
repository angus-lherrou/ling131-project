okay Michael's roaring down on the Florida Panhandle forecast to be a category ... storm when it makes landfall sometime late Wednesday right now the storm is packing wins in excess of one hundred twenty five miles per hour you know we're all just Tom said her landfall\nShould be between three and six PM right now the track and the national Hurricane Center habit of land fall as the three but it is possible still apple we can't worry about three or four because it's bringing with it a major hurricane status that is going to move by quickly this is not going to be like Harvey is not going to be like Florence and drive a lot of rainfall\nAs you mentioned John truck coming up a little bit later on this hour we will chat with him a ... a last hour when we talk to Tom hale he was talking about the incredible storm surge are going to see anywhere you know when you talk about uh uh ... anywhere in that area where it's going to hit you know near\nPanama City Florida\nYou know probably going dozens of miles each way right you're talking anywhere between eight and fourteen foot storm surge yes which is extremely extremely dangerous and now being a a category for a they expected to drop a you know right in the the Florida area up to a a you know a foot\nOf uh of rain and and even as you get inland because it right now it's going north and it's really interesting to watch this because it's going straight north and at some point it's going to start\nA it's going to start heading east because it does take I mean if you if you look at it uh it does almost take a forty five degree angle if you're looking at the cone and that Cohn ... you think about it the cone of ...\nCertainly as they call it has been extremely consistent over the last couple of days it has noticed that it really hasn't moved that ... ... it's almost as if they know whatever that that front is at you know keeping it down you know to the southeastern part part of the uh United States must be pretty strong because that hasn't changed at all and the track\nIs still the same word cuts right through a you know the the middle of a of a of Georgia and hits the southeastern part\nOf a of Alabama then cuts right through a Georgia and then South Carolina in the north Carolina and then out to uh to the uh the ocean it will move pretty fast because it will be by by friday morning it will be really it'll be off shore\nOf the of of uh of North Carolina actually a little bit north east of North Carolina but you know they've been just pounded with the rain and\nAh as a a Tom told us last hour they could expect three inches five inches who really knows you don't know I mean it's so unpredictable you know we ... I I think about yesterday where they said okay we're going to be a little bit of rain and it just poured here so yeah we\nHad in fact we had to some some flooding just based on on rain\nRight I'm In our area so you think you think of when it's when it's a hurricane and then through that then you know downgrades to a tropical storm but who really knows in what areas how much rain\nOr you're you're going to get but an extremely extremely a dangerous storm now the update here at uh one am central uh two am eastern time a hurricane Michael now a category for yeah stream Lee dangerous\nA hurricane now headed a really the bulls eye right now and I don't believe that has changed at all we'll find out a little bit here when we talk to me the meteorologist John trout but right\nYou know heading towards Panama City yeah when you when you when you look back on the I guess the history of\nA major hurricanes ah there will be names that that that the rise to the top there is no doubt that based on what we know about Michael already that in the years to come they will look back on on Michael as one of those again historic storms are based on the size of it and and the amount of damage it's caused\nA so we'll be following this and we'll talk to meteorologist John trout are later this hour a day and get his take on this and and the latest information that he has\nAnd of course we multitask here on the show on a consistent basis and and one of the things now just a\nLittle less than four weeks before election day is\nAfter the Kavanaugh hearings you know one of the polls doing and you and I really looking forward to what we're going to see a over the next to a couple of days by the time we get to you know this Friday and we start seeing a polls from the actual\nConfirmation a vote and Collins speech and and how does that affect certain races out there uh we do have a a a few new polls out there\nAre ... and again\nIt just it we don't we don't believe that there are any absolutes when it comes to polling\nBut it does can give you an idea or at least a snapshot as to what's going on up looking at the Nevada Senate race right a Jacky Rosen the Democrat against a Dean Heller of the ... Republican where a\nAnd a half of all the previous polls that were done in September\nA Rosen was up a early ah one poll done in in the early September a she was up by one the grabbed his poll a mid September she was up by two or by the time the CNN poll came and these are all likely voter polls are\nFrom nine twenty five to nine twenty nine she was up for ... well the latest NBC News ... poll done nine thirty ten three\nSo you're really through all the hearings at that point a again five hundred and Seventy four likely voters\nA however is no up by two now all of these really are in the margin of error even when she was in the lead mhm so it's all in the margin of error but if you wish to look at it from one poll to another and again they're sampling can be different\nBut you know what you see is a a six point swing in that particular race still in the margin of error\nBut still we ... what we're looking for is any type of momentum or any type of uh I I think a a change in the polls movement in the polls which could be perceived to be based on the excitement level\nOf people wanting to go out and vote right where a likely voter in these polls\nWould say you know a likely voter who said yeah I'm I'm a likely voter and and I'm fifty percent sure that I'm going to go out and vote this time words I'm going out and I'm voting sure and somehow that that ends up changing the the polls are moving it\nOr in another direction so uh that one in Nevada you know you and I were looking at other polls of ah other polls\nAre out there um\nAnd it was what what's interesting is looking I was looking at the Florida Senate race between Bill Nelson and Rick Scott and if you look at that right now you have a you you've got a couple of the polls at the ... the average showing\nA Nelson up a a to point for\nBut it really has been a if you look at it a just a really a tie because it's well within the margin of error\nA on a number of polls with the exception of one a Quinnipiac poll that had Nelson up plus seven but you look at a other polls here\nA Mason Dixon poll or from nine twenty four to nine twenty seven and Nelson up by one a W seat TV poll\nThat was taken nine Seventeen to nine thirty which would have included a few days after the uh the the the Senate hearing\nUm they would that has Nelson up by one\nAll within the margin of boom way in the margin of error because of an air bubbles poses is three and a half away\nAnd so it it it really is a it really is a dead heat there in Florida and I think you I think it'll be interesting to watch uh where where the where that\nGoes um I I just think that the\nThe polls between over the next few weeks everything from Kavanaugh the Capitol hearing\nAnd the vote is going to settle in and we don't know which side it motivates more doesn't motivate the Democrats to get out more due to try and hold the line on the on the Senate race and and ah in in in order to make an attempt to block Trump\nOr down the road for a possible third\nA nominee\nFor ... and so we have uh the the latest uh in the Indiana Senate brown versus a Donnelly a Donnelly not vote for a Kavanaugh\nAnd ... he was up by a by three at the end of August the Fox news poll nine twenty nine to ten to has Donnelly up by two well within the margin of error three point to a five percent\nOr and now they have there are three of a different candidates\nAre in this race including the libertarian\nYeah so uh but right now it's forty three forty one or a ... you know Donnelly with the lead but uh again excuse me yes Donnelly with the the lead the Democrat\nIn there but then again that really you look at that that is another a dead heat that exist out there and then we go to Missouri and uh the uh latest Fox News poll nine twenty nine to tend to and that is a dead tied now that is before the actual vote took place\nAnd before colon speech and everything else so that's the kind of thing that we're looking for the polls coming out uh maybe here in the next couple of days or early next week and as we get closer to see the effect that that that has had there there are a ton of these races that are\nA statistical tie with even in the statistical tie Democrats maybe\nA point or two and a and so this is something that I'm sure as being very carefully watched and again when you go into and we're not pollsters you know we're not pollsters we can read them but I mean the methodology of of each and every poll has different nuances and it it\nAll depends on you know what the sample is do they interview more Democrats than actually are in a you know that normally vote in a particular race or not or did they over sample Republicans right and and so you look at it but overall when you look at at the the generalized holes or a ton of the Senate races\nThink than in the short time it takes to listen to this message a small plane can turn into a big fire\nSeveral minutes more poisonous snakes may have fills your lungs

was just a useless conversation about defining the word my garden and and all that but but it does get to the uh you know the whole thing of not being several you know Rand Paul calling Cory Booker machine get up in the face of Congress people and\nRand Paul and his wife you remember last week\nA a running a letter and an end state or an op ed piece in state in you know she sleeps with a gun that remember Rand Paul was attacked yup I'm actually in his in his yard by by a neighbor and what they're saying what you know and it's coming out and saying look\nYou know what you're what you're doing you're ratcheting up the rhetoric now\nOf of complete and total instability in the end the beautiful part is ... you don't just are are we a month\nPast the the uh of a funeral John McCain right number when they were talking about stability in you and I know this isn't gonna last Hillary decided to get involved in it you're ready for this All right ... Hillary by the way let us know announced Hillary is back\nThere cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough\nTo win back the house and or the Senate that's when civility can start again\nLet me ask you this because we we know that the left right now we we we know that ... whether it's Ted Cruz being in a restaurant ... whether it's Mitch McConnell being at an at an airport the mob mentality that exist now let's get a mob and to intimidate people mhm\nDo they believe that's going to be effective yes they believe it's working that's my I guess that would be my point to ... to begin with\nThat they believe and now Hillary of course when it's well established that the instability in mob mentality now exists then she jumps on board oh yeah yeah I'm going to join I only know how many months later right yeah uh and\nShe's no Maxie modest but [laughter] so uh so this this this again\n[laughter] is where we we talk about that they believe that that they believe it's going to be effective either they believe there's one or two things either they believe it's going to be effective or they're just\nSo so enraged they have nothing less nothing left of substance to offer the people are so they just that's the natural I guess outlet is range and getting people's face wherever\nThey are in their own private time whatever in what they believe that's going to intimidate Republicans or conservatives and he didn't really believe that you really believe are if you're on the left you honestly believe oh if we do this then there'll be scared of no back off right do you really believe that\nThey do they believe that it's going to change the supporters of a Ted Cruz\nNo oh wait wait wait wait it is it's going to further motivate them it's going to take people who might have decided or maybe just to have been sitting on the fence maybe haven't been enthusiastic about getting out and voting\nI mean\nConservatives or Republicans it is going to absolutely motivate them I was actually a on line and and I was seeing a number of people that we're talking about early voting you know here's where to find out where early where the when the early voting starts in your area\nThat means they're chomping at the bit now we don't make production but we know right now both sides are motivated the question is which site is motivated more and historically where is that greater turn up the did you see the NBC\nReporter who went to the college in California ... and there was like thirty people waiting for a bus at a college all young people ... and all of them sitting right there and he said is anybody voting in the mid term not one person raised their hand right finally they found eventually they found one person ... are they found to people they said yeah we're going to vote well what's your\nConcern well you know college and costs to college\nOr what about the rational things on the Russian busted or we don't even know what's going on we don't know the answer to that stuff that out I mean it was it was ... it was really really interesting but\nI I guess the point I think about this now because Hillary now coming aboard\nAs we said with with everything that went on the insanity from the mainstream of the Democratic party now that the mainstream the Democratic party\nThinks it's okay to say due process doesn't matter that Hillary can jump aboard and say a civility now it's gone too we take over ... not to be civil will get any civility when we get our way right right we're not we're not we're not going to be civil and and think about what it's about now you're not civil because you believe in what\nDue process and\nThis really is the calm before the storm I just did a check on the wind speed at Tallahassee, Florida and we're only looking at about Seventeen miles an hour but from here on out throughout the day today\nWe will see those wind speeds increase we could see landfall as a category for we're kinda splitting hairs though I mean we will see wins in excess of one hundred miles an hour we're talking almost a sustained a tornado here folks from the mid west can appreciate the tornadoes and we're talking about not only a torn addict event but\nA rain event as well and possibly tornadoes spawn from this system over the next say thirty six hours or so\nWhat is the threat of storm surge and where we're will those areas the highest threat be\n[noise] we're looking for the highest be a threat to Mexico Beach Florida to ah Keaton beach nine to Thirteen\nFeet now that's just that wall of water that this wind pushes in couple that with high tide and we know are tides and those areas can range from between three and six feet depending upon where you are on the coast this water will also push a\nInland Eric and Gary up through rivers and streams and those sloppy areas so we'll see smaller towns inundated we could even see some major highways guy ten affected not only from the flooding but\nThe wind event is going to cause no doubt some power lines down power outages uh we've got the ... on roadways from a roofs ripped off of homes were talking about a very potentially catastrophic event here what\nTime do you see it coming onshore right now\nUh right now we're still looking at the early morning hours today around eight nine AM and uh that's the actual landfall of they say I but until then from now until then anyone\nListening to me in that region or you've got to take precautions you've got to save your life and family and heed the warnings from what the officials have been mentioning for the past twenty four hours to get out of the way this thing is a potential killer\nA meteorologist John trout and I guess we're expecting another uh updates are here and just a little over two hours from the national Hurricane Center\n[noise] yeah we'll get another one and by then we'll know whether it should arrive as a cat three or cat for but I don't want people to split hairs on bat when we categorize tornadoes we're only talking about the wind speed\nWe saw from Hurricane Florence or a couple of weeks ago and we saw last year from Hurricane Harvey that the category does not\nMatter as much when we're talking about flooding because\nOnly the wind speeds or part of the categories one of the things I dislike about this effort Simpson scale the real killer here is never the wind it's always the flooding people think they can get through the roadways they can they can ride it out but ah [noise] those floodwaters are very destructive very dangerous and very unpredictable\nCertainly a meteorologist a gun or a drought we'll be following the story of course and and the storm\nA in a throughout the day and then ah it has its path continues inland and by the way what should we expect are we still on target or to see a few inches of rain for those areas in the Carolinas affected by Florence\nA little less than we talked about yesterday I had mentioned or possibly a foot of rain that's been scaled back by a couple inches but Ah yes those areas locally or could see uh some uh\nFoot rainfall total amounts into Georgia into the Carolinas North Carolina and again don't forget the potential for tornadoes spawn from the system\nAll right Dr John trout medical John time we appreciate it will actually asked work and uh so he'll be following this information uh of course a throughout the day but as John mentioned that you need to heed the warnings\nAnd any of the direct has given by local officials and just keep in mind that the other ... going to be a number of things that keep first responders from getting to you and so that's the point a and also uh at at some point you could lose power\nOr may not be safe to drink water or from the tap and so there are a number of things that could become extremely problematic and of course uh the officials and all of us want you to be safe and and to be able to survive this that things can be replaced that people get up and it was just\nA fifty five minutes ago that the uh the new advisory came out from the national hurricane service on hurricane or a center excuse me on hurricane a Michael the wanting um central time advisory that it was up to a strength for hurricane and ... a maximum sustained winds now\nA hundred and thirty miles an hour or so it is a\nStrength for hurricane yeah which is extremely dangerous and will be on on modern records the the biggest hurricane ever to hit if it stays at all or I even believe it's a three and maybe the the the biggest ever to hit or the strongest to ever write yeah the pan handle\nMore than ... in terms of the wind in and John brings up a great point about those a spin off tornadoes in those areas which can also be destructive as well will follow the story and coming up next our in fact we'll talk with meteorologist Tom hale get an update from him [noise]\n\n\n... radio on Westwood

just John Trump has an update\nThe system is now a category for hurricane data from air force reserve and know a hurricane hunter aircraft\nIndicate maximum sustained winds of increased to one hundred thirty miles an hour with higher gusts the winds will be destructive when the system makes landfall later today the rainfall will produce massive amounts of flooding there could be tornadoes spawned as a result as well a meteorologist John traveling now that\nSystem is about one hundred Seventy miles southwest of apple electrical or Florida\nOr the president is looking for a new U.S ambassador to the un after Nikki Haley announced she's stepping down at the end of the year news blindsided some key us allies and many congressional Republicans involved in foreign policy matters White House has narrowed down the short list of five people to replace Haley including former White House advisor Dina Powell\nA Hurricane Florence but also their coastline could also be affected as are also tropical storm a a a warnings ah especially long the the Georgia and South Carolina ... online actually tropical storm warnings there and watches a for a north\nSo we are right now that quite often you'll see tornadoes uh that that that spin off from storms like this and they can become destructive and they are the ... and they happened very quickly\nUh to knowing and and growing up in tornado alley uh you understand that that they are that that often there's little to no warning for those\nThe tornadoes and they become of course a separate a destructive force of their own so certainly all the folks in the path of hurricane Michael or over the next twenty four to forty eight hours\nHeed the warnings or keep your radios on a keep batteries charged\nAnd to stay alert or coming up here in less than thirty minutes after the bottom of the hour we'll talk with meteorologist Tom hale who did a great job\nAnd covering Hurricane Florence for us or we talk to him earlier he also covered a Hurricane Irma in Florida for us\nUh on red eye radio so we'll talk to him about this a new report the update from the national Hurricane Center which came across at two AM eastern\nAnd what changed here and and again what all of this means in terms of the energy behind hurricane Michael\nAre getting back to what we're talking about a last hour and when we played the audio cut from Hillary Clinton sane civility is impossible until the\nUh Democrats take power again so that was her call for civility and the interesting thing about that is an and we've talked about you know whether it's Ted Cruz or you know in the restaurant that made a a big news\nOf a uh a couple of weeks ago or Mitch McConnell\nAre at the uh the the airport or a a Jeff Flake in the the the elevator uh what's you know what's going on right now the the call number from Maxine Waters remember when Maxine Waters and she might have been really excited that that political flame of\nOf actually Democrats to like the office that when I was calling it\nA you know and and so we saw what happened this past weekend we saw what happened to Ted Cruz saw what happened to Mitch McConnell saw what happened to Jeff Flake\nOr the conversation on CNN yesterday it's not a mob it's just a people expressing their their uh their their their viewpoints and it's like well most of America looks at it and when they see people screaming and yelling and going into into a private place not an organized protest organize protests Americans are fine with\nYou go out and you protest and you're with tens of thousands of other people and it's a peaceful protest and that's fine Americans don't want riots Americans don't want mob rule they don't want you go they they don't uh most Americans don't approve\nOf the fact that you're going into a place that is not your property trespassing just to the point of harassing right or you know a ... some you know somebody else has happened in Ted Cruz's place but that call to harass people are ... anywhere uh\nYesterday a Rand Paul again and you know Rand Paul's wife\nOr has been on this year for the last uh a couple of weeks talking about the instability\nKentucky Senator Rand Paul on Tuesday took aim but the rhetoric employed by senator Cory Booker and others accusing them of ratcheting up the conversation\nOr to the point where unstable people could commit violence said Paul to Kentucky radio host I fear there is going to be an assassination why I really worry that someone is going to be killed and that those who are in a war ratcheting up conversations those who are saying get in their face\nThere have to realize that they bear some responsibility at this this elevates the violence these are people that are unstable Paul says we don't want to encourage them we have to somehow ratcheted down and say we're not encouraging them the violence\nAnd violence is never okay or there's never a reason uh to resolve things that weigh directly calling on Booker who last July told activists to get up in the face of some congresspeople Paul referenced his own uh salt of the hands of a neighbor\nAs well as last year's a baseball field shooting which Representative Steve ... was wounded to show that unstable people can easily take things are too far and then we talk about the fact that Hillary\nTalked about you know no civility right share her call so you've mainstream did completely now with Hillary comes out you can't get more mainstream Democrat over the last Twenty years so Hillary now calling for ... you know instability number one we talked about the fact\nThat they actually think this is an effective way to go\nTo the actually think that politicians you know calling for it now to the point of Hillary Clinton saying can help civility which is the call for instability ... which is the calls to harass people in their private life\nAnd that was the first thing that hit me was was they think this is going to be effective but then you get to the point of Hillary now bringing it up\nWork she feels comfortable saying it looks Hillary's a follower she'll be asked you and not take an opinion on anything if she believes\nThat it is perceived as radical at all to anybody in or base ... we've seen it before remember when she was up in Canada yeah and she was asked\nAbout the pipeline right I'm not going to comment on that because other people right now are making a decision look you're running for president if\nThis is still a a an issue we need to know what your thoughts on it are and she didn't want to take a side right and so now here's Hillary Clinton calling for instability\nAnd and and you think think about this\nSo now it's becoming mainstream in the end and what it why instability over what what is the issue\nYou're calling for due process\nYou're calling for presumption of innocence\nYou're calling for preponderance of evidence you're saying where's the evidence you're coming out 'cause this is and we talked about this yesterday we came out of this whole thing or you know from from Democrats is if you believe in due process than you are enabling rapists and therefore you deserve no civility because of it\nWhich is of course that's their\nDefinition it's not the definition of people to believe and due process under the law people to believe in due process under the law obviously are not advocating rape or sexual assault now any other crime right\n\nAnd that's the point and so I think about it that it's very important to get to the actual issue what is the point that they view that is so radical that the writers taking were instability must lead and it's that simple point the belief in due process\nAnd evidence in any case\nTo show the guilt to anybody and not just an allegation that is what has set off\nEven the mainstream now of the Democratic party to call for in civility this is\nHow far how low\nWe always wonder we always ask the question how long will they go you know calling somebody and not see you know and and and saying that that's been for a long time but you get to the point now where they're calling for\nInstability based\nOn people's opinion on the other side that evidence is how you judge somebody's guilt right due process should apply and all of these cases which means you look for the evidence to find somebody who's skilled you don't believe anybody because\nOf their demographic because of their gender because of their race\nBecause of their age you believe people because the evidence backs what they what they say now you can believe them you can sit there and why I think it sounded credible that doesn't mean that that person that you look at them and called them a rapist\nBecause that's what they were doing they were calling him arenas and again rapists yes I Believe her which means they believe you did it yes\nThey believe Kavanaugh did it the evidence isn't there\nRight never been there right yet that's what they're saying and because you don't agree with them because you say no I Believe in the preponderance of evidence I Believe in the presumption of of uh of of innocence I don't believe anybody just because they say if I Need evidence and when somebody stories change I'm suspicious those are all rational\nCritical thinking commonsense arguments and the Democrats if you believe that way are now calling for instability to harass you everywhere even invade your privacy where ever you are\nAnd it's not just the uh the old guard and Maxine Waters or he'll help button is Cory Booker people that are called the future of the party\nAs a voter ... it's now Hillary yes well and and you know you can easily just miss a Maxine Waters in the Hillary as the old guard\nBut the future of the party is this so if if Hillary jumping out well by the way Hillary jumping on board as you mentioned because everybody else's because all she sees this as the future of the part\nThat's F.

thing\nA simple example in Panama City beach [noise] ah there are six possibly now seven shelters that are open so if you've decided to stay along um the beach front um and and not move inland\nMaybe

for storm I Want to put this in perspective and and and and not a slow moving storm like we saw was ... it was a category for storm that hit Puerto Rico last year called Irma\nAnd we've all seen the pictures and the devastation now devastation is relative to what it hits so if it's a rotted tree it it could take a breeze to take that thing out um\nIf the homes are not built to handle hurricanes or they haven't had hurricanes in a long time and the building standards and become lax\nGuess what the same story get greater amounts of devastation [noise] um here this is something that they have not seen along this coastline historically period um along the ...\nOf the Panama City beach to Tallahassee Pensacola Beach simply put the panhandle and then the Big Bend area that's the area that swoops around and and and swings down to cedar key uh\nThere hasn't been a category for storm hit and so that's in itself something that nobody can relate to and when you can't relate to something\nYou relate to what your cat and what you can or if somebody's been around since Nineteen eighty five [noise] that would be caked and and and and Kate\nWas quite a devastating storm a and at

[noise]\nOr again danger replacing Haley I'm only at Francis hurricane Michael has intensified to a category ... storm forecasters say the system is expected to produce life threatening storm surge of up to Thirteen feet what makes landfall later today you know we're all just bedroom drove\nA harrowing already seeing the outer bands of Michael push a store right now so strong thunderstorms report it around panorama city will begin to see some of those tropical storm force winds with this as well and then of course going in for nine eventually it's a new and eventually for three PM then we talk about hurricane force winds in that category for force when\nOf North Carolina and then by seven pm friday we'll be way out\nInto the Atlantic I mean it really starts moving as it starts crossing the you know the the land right after it hits and then when it seems to uh get over water again is just and and that will be colder water it looks like it'll dissipate out there in the north Atlantic somewhere right\nHurricanes often spawn tornadoes just be aware of\nThat situation is very real and those tornadoes uh you have often little to no warning uh so again or if you are in the path of Michael and you are not going to get out of the way that path then make sure that you have all of the central including batteries\nAh for a portable radio or devise a and make sure that everything is charged or so that you can stay up with it and be able to hear any warnings that come across four or something like a tornado or as it was being described by Tom hale are meteorologist on this story and will again talk with him here and just a bit\nI'm Talking with him about the storm surge and the way it is a you know as he described it it's like filling up a bathtub so it is not something again or if you are not familiar with this with a a storm surge and very few people are\nBased on the the ... diction models for the highest storm surge from this storm very few people on the planet has ever experience that and again we just have to repeat that that is a deadly deadly\nA danger to uh to to individuals well that may not be familiar with it and not a understand fully or what the impact is\nAnd I never lived in in Panama City but at the looks familiar the the downtown city area and with with a lot of residences right next to the water on the bay right and\nIt reminds me of a lot of like Fort Walton Beach when when I Lived outside of Fort Walton Beach where I live actually lived in in Fort Walton Beach were very short time but mostly in Nevada or Florida which is between Pensacola and in Fort Walton Beach and and that's in my head trying to figure out what it would be like\nYou know when I remember sitting there right in residential the in in the city there and you could see the bay and I'm thinking if and that would have been in Fort Walton Beach I talked to hatch you may if if that came up\nYou know fourteen feet what that would be like him that's what I'm trying to imagine in my head ... estimates and on and look at Pensacola or looked at the uh\nPanama City in and say you're going to have a lot of flooding\nAnd and again uh we we talked about it the the houses on the beaches that are on stilts they're roughly or the four of those houses and the deck roughly at ten feet\nSo if you're talking about a Thirteen or fourteen foot surge that means that inside those above the skills inside those homes you're still talking about three to four feet of water a and that becomes the you know I think that puts it in perspective for anyone who's even seen\nOne of those homes and I stayed in one over the summer I Can't imagine water getting that high there's a reason that they built on stilts and that the average is roughly ten feet it's because it's thought to be above the ah average storm surge\nIn in the path of a storm a you know in the average again storm\nBut Michael hurricane Michael is no average storm\nWe'll be talking to meteorologists Tom hale coming up at the bottom of the hour trying to get in all the other stories that are out there and they're actually a quite a few stories the the one that caught my attention yesterday because\nUh you we really have got no response from the White House on this especially with the president coming out really uh yesterday in and stating and Monday that a Rod Rosenstein is going to stay mhm uh you know he's she's going to be there they had the talk and everything is great then the story comes out the two senior FBI officials told\nThe bureau's top lawyer they believe the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein was serious when he discussed secretly recording Donald Trump\nAnd invoking the twenty Fifth Amendment to remove him from office last year according to sources close to a congressional investigation and an account that conflicts with the claims from Rosenstein and others the comments were either inaccurate reported or made in jest\nOr this is again former FBI general counsel a James Baker more information coming out about his testimony a toll congressional investigators behind a closed door deposition last week that then FBI acting director Andrew McCabe an FBI lawyer Lisa Page came to Baker after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey\nAnd may have twenty Seventeen Baker said page and McCabe relate details of the meeting where Rosenstein made the comments\nThough he wasn't personally in that meeting Baker told congressional investigators he took ... pages word a seriously the sources said further Baker told congressional investigators\nHe suspected that Rosenstein was cooperating with two people in the administration to vote the twenty Fifth Amendment a source said wow the testimony would appear at odds with other accounts of those discussions Baker who's testimony was described\nAs deliberate and sober added he had not done a legal analysis and was not on sure whether it was\nUnethical or illegal the source at it\n[noise] [noise]\nYeah I'm really just does the story that we have talked about the one that is\nHas been completely buried where there's been a really items that somebody may have written it out there but I haven't I haven't even seen at National Review mhm\nAndrew McCarthy I haven't seen write about it the Kimberley Process all and and this is about ... analyzing the the fact that the president with the Pfizer warrant application that he said let's to classify it\nAnd then came out and said well we're going to give it to the inspector general to look at and he will expedited quickly and we went for what\nFor what you're you're if you're afraid that uh some things should stay ... you know redacted\nWell then you don't go to the inspector general you\nGo to you or a secretary of state former CIA director\nBecause what you're claiming as some of the allies don't want somebody information out so you go to him or you go to the director of national intelligence you go to the director of the CIA the last person to go to is the inspector general because the inspector general looks at\nWhat corruption\nOh oh they declassified it next thing you know what's going to the inspector general corruption why is does it seem to be that nobody in the media is covering that story every day I wake up and I said ... what am I missing\nWell because if you look at it there is there's nothing to gain the president's not going to\nGet any kind of I guess\nPolitical feedback or direction from the inspector general no that's not first of all it's not who Horowitz says\nBut it's not the role of that off instead of that position to be an advisor to the president that's not the point the point of the ... office is to investigate misdeeds\nAnd wrong doings and possible criminal activity by people within the department of justice\nIf you look at how that played out and nobody talked about it except for the fact that nobody talked about it\nAnd I'm not talking about the Kimberley straw souls or you know any anybody that has been covering this ah ... even a Sarah a quarter who's been covering an a number of things and and those are really good job at it I'm Talking about the liberal media who's been screaming\nRussian collusion Russian collusion Russia inclusion Russia inclusion since before the president took office\nSo it was about that time that they
