I think and and then of course the political discussions and that information I think is also key without her from a number of\nPeople over the years that have talked about how you know they\nThey've listened and ah they have become\nI guess more thoughtful in their in their political views and I think that's a good thing that's oh yeah that that's that's the left starts moving toward violence and and shouting and and what was it that Eric Holder said if you know if they go oh you're in a low will you know kick them yeah right and and\nYou know when they when that happens again I don't know what it at at what point\nThey come back if they ever do to a civil discussion Hillary saying recently that it's the other days well when we when will return to a civil discussion that's basically what her message and her statement\nI I think those with the debate with the the skills to debate and the knowledge of the ideas on which this country was founded are always going to win\nWhen they go low we kick them you know when you were talking about it though but I wouldn't want to you know what things that might interest you and uh this though when you talked about you know radio and I knew this when I was\nI don't know seven eight years old I knew I wanted to be on the radio I ... that was dominant nothing else really entered my mind\nA bit like I said for years it's what I wanted to do I never thought I'd end up doing talk radio mhm thank God I did because I\nI couldn't sit and\nTalk about a star is born\nAnd Lady Gaga is wonderful performance every day and and ... by the way I haven't seen the movie so I've no idea what this wonderful or not I'm just I'm I'm assuming that if I'm working for music station I Would have to do that ... what a wonderful performance in the music was just wonderful not that look talking entertainment and we'll talk about entertainment once in awhile but to do that every single day\nAnd have have to be positive about what comes out of Bollywood and do that every single day would everybody knows it would kill me to be able to do this and articulate ideas and and uh\nThere's there's two things first off the people to call you and say thanks so much because I've learned a lot that's that's a wonderful thing to have wonderful thing the other wonderful thing and\nPeople are saying might think well you can't really mean that I Do is when people call you with extreme passion of how they disagree with you\nBecause I'm always amazed wow\nThey really care what I think [laughter] yeah [laughter] I'm really I I always get that really ... somebody's really ticked off for something I said\nYou're getting really wow that's that's interesting and so I said to me that and I know what's gonna happen but you know when we talk about the Democrats and the whole instability thing I Will tell you this\nWhen I'm dirt during the campaign\nBecause of the way that you and I you know we've always done shows we don't\nCare whether you're a Republican or a Democrat no and you know we're we're conservative you know slashed libertarian I have a lot of liberal friends right and and and I don't know if they called me friend any more of a well we but we don't we don't care the the politicians that we analyze we don't care what your label is if we're agree with you we will if we don't we don't\nA lot of people are bothered by that means even on the Republican side had been bothered over the years and not starting with Trump when we disagreed with him\nWe respectfully disagreed with uh uh when I first got to talk radio George Herbert Walker Bush ...\nRead my lips no new taxes [laughter] so it goes all the way back there with a with W we disagreed with a lot and and uh I'm with a a Trump a few things not ... you know and but the things that we just grew with Trump I Will say our core to our belief\nAs as conservative and free market or you know a a people when it comes to economic things and uh and so we may be passionate about it but the vast majority of what Trump does you know I ... what he actually does substance wise and the legislation that he puts forward and the executive orders that that he puts forward\nWhen you actually read into it and his foreign policy uh I've been one hundred percent uh agreement with but uh you know to be able to do that to be able to go on and just to have you know the freedom and creativity oh I Know the porno mode to make\nThat as it seems that everything is getting on civil law out there mhm and things are going crazy I don't know what it is but it's like and I know would you agree that we we've never had this discussion seems like I'm getting less flak\nYeah because I'm not really getting there is no I mean I there was more ... anger a year ago or two years ago or ten years ago or you know from the response that we you know the ... that I Would get for the things that I Would say ... very few and far between now\nWell and and I think the uh while the tactics clearly have changed and when the tactics change and they go the direct route as they call it they became they become a ... it's it's beyond a protester\nIt's someone who's going to be in your face\nAnd when that happens they don't have because why do they go there because they don't have a debate anymore\nThey don't want to have a debate I'm not saying this is the case where everyone on the left in fact I think there are plenty plenty of Democrats out there\nRight now that can't stand what's going on on the left and I can't stand a first of all had no need for Hillary Clinton or or if they did and they look at what she said just a couple of days ago\nHighly disagree with that kind of tactic and won't use it but the problem is is that that's squeaky cry baby whining wheel is always going to get the grease\nAnd that's where the cameras are that's where the social media is\nI I look at it and I think to myself that the reason and being in talk radio twenty nine years and I believe right now\nFor is insane as it seems\nTo be out there I Know the flack that I get is extremely light I think probably people who've taken it to social media but I really believe that the point is is not that are that are\nArguments had changed any or had become stronger we may ... and I think it should be called talk show host you learn how to debate batter and put your points are for better I think it's the fact that the opposition is completely and totally insane\nI mean right now they're just insane\nAnd so people you know they look and they say okay you know what's what's Mac or saying today okay I disagree with it but ah\nNot insane like they are over there I really think it's worth a when were you you know you it you're you're comparing and you're say okay what about ... what do I compare you too and when you see that the opposition\nAnd isn't articulating anything in any type of common sense or critical thinking fashion\nThat I think more people are just open then to or an agreement just agreement to a an opinion that they might not even agree with one hundred percent but they see that there's a rational thought and critical thinking to it\nGo to get by US DOT com

saying about the system throughout the past couple of days has been true and then some you know the system arrived in Georgia overnight\nAs a category three hurricane or a storm has not hit a Georgia this strong since Eighteen Ninety eight and those types of things just just downed you with us when you begin looking at you know the\nUh fourth strongest on record\nTo ever hit the U.S about just under a cat category five at a hundred and fifty seven miles an hour\nWhile a ... in terms of what we're looking at in the coming days here for\nA not just Georgia but uh the Carolinas what is the threat still from Michael\n[noise] well we're going to see continued rainfall in areas where they don't need any more rainfall that's for sure we'll see the system move through southern Georgia or most of South Carolina and the low country of North Carolina where the ground\nIt's already saturated the trees are sitting in mud any amount of wind is going to topple those trees and we could see some additional flooding in those areas I mentioned also tornadoes if you picture a a hurricane coming onshore at a hundred and fifty miles an hour when it hits the land\nIt begins to slow down a little bit because it encounters homes and trees and the ground friction slows the surface movement\nOf the hurricane but as you go aloft a thousand two thousand feet up the system is still advancing pretty rapidly well that sets up a window gradient and when we get a win gradient we get rotation and a potential tornadoes are spawned as a result\n... and of course when you look at the the flooding are often the most deadly part of a storm or that's something that as you mentioned on the ground saturated in the Carolinas but but certainly even in Georgia or with this kind of rainfall flash flooding is is the big threat correct\n[noise] it is a flash flooding and the result of flash flooding I'm aware of one possibly two deaths at this hour we're not going to believe our\nEyes when the

an update on now\nTropical storm Michael as we turn to meteorologist Tom hello good morning Tom good morning All right so where are we with ah with Michael and what is the the storm in terms of the power of this storm still look like\nWell the power of the storm is still there at about five thousand feet we've got when that are blowing at about eighty miles an hour that they haven't diminished all that much and with thunderstorms those thunderstorm wins the downdraft\nTranslate some of that wind so we have higher gosh and so for that reason alone at windows still an issue especially when it gets across into North Carolina\nBecause uh we talked about this\nFor four days in advance as Florence was coming in that they had already had some saturation from a remnant\nA of a tropical storm that pushed its way through and and of course when obviously Florence came through the low lying areas that are run up through a Fayetteville and a south of Raleigh that entire area is still very saturate\nJohn trout touched on it and he said trees are sitting in mud and that's exactly what it is we had ... that's the event that we had in the Carolinas with a very slow moving Florence\nAnd as this storm moves up through there I think there'll be a lot more ... and also there's going to be obviously a good deal more flooding now\nYes they're likely to get about two inches of rain in that area but it doesn't take much for a little bit of flooding to to reef re and develop and it's west of there where the heavy flooding is actually going to be taking place\nUp toward Raleigh and then back up a a up into\nVirginia ah Lynchburg, Virginia Roanoke, Virginia everything on the eastern side\nOf the mountains there are up to Charlotte and or Norfolk\nThat entire area um is gonna see anywhere from a three to as much as eight inches of rain as it gets further on up [noise] um and\nThere's a you know why not to include here are the folks over Allen the outer banks from okra coke island which is down towards the south end up to duck or they're under a storm surge watch in effect ...\nAnd ... and how I I guess what is the potential there in terms of that storm surge uh and and what the the height might be\nA four feet okay to them or the or yeah or you know it'll inundate some neighborhoods some some areas where it'll come out of the banks um but um it's when you think about it it it just goes to the power of this now tropical storm\nAnd its Winfield yeah right yeah and so that's\nJust amazing I mean if you look at the the power of Michael as it came\nAshore a a Wednesday afternoon and something that we've touched on yesterday during our program and that is the the because of that power because of that energy behind the storm and grew after of course\nUh we got off the air or the ... it intensified that that means it's a longer lasting a storm so you're expecting Michael to still be a tropical storm\nA strength in terms of a ... when it goes back out over the water\nAnd reaches Ireland yeah yeah [laughter] so [laughter] yeah well\nAh to our friends in Europe or you know um you can have ... we hope you does it does that does that ... the water is warm enough that far north in the Atlantic to keep it going then yes okay\nYeah wow yeah I did I just assumed by the time we got lucked ... probably be cool down so I was surprised to hear that but there are still warming up yeah L and\nAnd and that's why we're having these storms and the you know the the normal hurricane season ends at the beginning of November right and so at this point there's a reason to that extent this is the fourth\nMajor hurricane\nThat we've had in the month of October period and so yeah that's and that's simply a and it was unusual to have a major hurricane to begin with in October when you consider that there's been four of them total ...\nAnd and so and the last nine something that just sticks in my mind was and I can't remember which one of you said it well is it going to kind of lose some power as it comes into shore and\nAnd I and my immediate reaction was no no [laughter] yeah\nAnd if you're not fueling at a TA Petra location today while

they've been kind of you know non\nUh a regimented they haven't been there hasn't been a real strong pattern too\nTo that I\nI don't know how much I put on the fed right now for this eight hundred and thirty two point drop yesterday a you know there are smarter people than than I can look at it but as you mentioned\nYou look at the reaction to something like that and it was not the the meltdown of years prior because percentage wise it's still\nNot as big as you've seen in the past right and so it it\nA lot of things are going on right now especially in the tech sector I think there's a lot of a concern about regulation that's going to cost the tech sector or at least a slow them down in terms of growth and what they're able to earn because that regulation I Believe it's coming and I think there's a lot of concern for the tech sector there\nUm but the economy is chugging along pretty well and when you get a correction like you saw yesterday a it is expected it is not surprising at all to those investors on the\nFloor I you know I I think it said they're just there comes a day when you just\nI I think that many investors just say okay a ... today everything combined\nMakes it so I think I'm going to pull out of this and put it into a this because not only was the tech sector hit but caterpillar ah companies that are involved in international trade in the United states were hit yesterday there's a reason for that\nThere's a reason and the reason is still the possibility of trade wars when you look at it you know so the president said okay we have NAFTA agreement\nAre okay but everything hasn't been solved here Congress has been awfully quiet\nA on it or their negotiations going on does Congress\nWant look that does this Congress want NAFTA we're the new NAFTA whatever it's called the Canada whatever United States and Mexico instead of NAFTA the nations formerly known as NAFTA the nation's yeah the ... the nation's formerly known as North America north ... ah\nYou know ...\nI Wonder if there's pressure inside Congress I guess it's just pure speculation\nBut inside St look if you're going to do an after we got to get the steel and aluminum done we're not going to do and we're going to do it let's get everything done and that's putting pressure on the on on the White House or the fact is yeah you know having ... going to at least stabilize the market with some good and bad\nAs we have gone through and we have gone through a a nap to because we do believe that if if the new NAFTA passes\n[laughter] it'd be trade agreement formerly known as NAFTA if it passes it's gonna hurt the auto industry and it's not going to help the auto industry is going to make cars more expensive that's not a good thing now initially when you say it it's something that may not hit the market at that particular point\nYou know at at but when you take everything together the worries about regulation in the tech sector or all of a sudden the the you know the the fed or raising rates are the fact that the bond yields are going up again it's taken us taking us more interest money\nOr to to service the the the the debt\nAnd the possibility of\nThe trade war with China where there there isn't doesn't seem to be any type of conclusion and still a great uncertainty about a steel and aluminum tariffs and still and uncertainty whether you know Congress really hasn't there's been no indication from Congress or the leadership in Congress about\nThe trade agreement formally known as NAFTA\n... well you mentioned now or the the terrorists and PG taking a ten percent hit yesterday a and you know this is a very old company but talking about raw materials and the cost of raw materials and and so as you know there\nAre essentially they're manufacture a and and distributor of of uh of of coding and special material specialty materials but that is also part of the auto industry\nSo the the the car sales a the automobile sales have or seemed to stalled out for now or what's behind that [noise] uh certainly you know that the cost of automobiles is going up and that is directly related to tariffs\nThen there's a greater demand for used cars at when there's a greater demand for any group in terms of products that cost goes up so it it is it's a number of things that hit start to hit all at once\nAnd you go back to All right well how much of this is controlled\nBy either the fed or the federal government\nAnd how much of this this cost of government and right now you can look at ... and I think you can look well at interest rates Iran and you see those two right now sticking out but everything that we just said here is related to what government regulation\nEverything that we just and I didn't even think about that until you just said\nThere until you I'm a wow everything is government regulation right is so you can actually make the argument that hurt it irrespective whether it's trade agreement government regulation the fed rate you know ah on on interest rates are the the debt that with the debt that we haven't servicing our our debt all of it goes back to\n[laughter] in in some way a\nGovernment a regulation and when we talk about the tech industry and what are they worried about government regulation so it all gets back to that\nWe said this before and you look when we we've gotten into great debates and disagreements with the administration about ah you know their their policy on tariffs therefore or new label turf babies\nAre that the president came up with a but the look in the real world you raise prices it hurts when the economy and the story right\nYou can sit there and go rah rah rah usa usa you can have all the chance you want but if you raise the cost of goods and services it always hurts an economy and hurts workers\nAnd just because you wish to chant or you know just say America First doesn't mean America is necessarily first\nBy the policy that you put in because you love the slogan slogans main nothing ... economics is related to how people respond to incentive\nIf you make the cost of goods more expensive it's going to hurt the economy not my opinion it's the reality of economics and the story\nWell and and again it is something that can be controlled through policy it as something that can be a temper it in and why do we want ... why do we want to step in front of the progress that's been made that terms of you know ... what do we what's been done\nBy the administration has done so much good that when they do bad that's going to we believe hurt them because I don't believe that\nA Republican in the United states can handle a bad economy as bad as a ... a Republican president can not handle bad economic news as well as a Democrat I Can't tell you why but it's just the reality\nAlthough I got ... Obama got elected for his second term there was nothing moving in the economy right\nI don't believe Republicans can survive a bad economy especially if you look good economy and then it goes down over the next two years and what is it what it was the first couple of years I think at that point almost all Republicans in this day and age are much more vulnerable because Democrats\nCell that better than Republicans do\nYeah uh you know you see that the interest rates rising and the you know any kind of slow down in in major sectors\nThen you you put those together ... the housing sector at the at the toward the end of of or I guess getting close to the actual fall out of the subprime mess the fed was raising rates so you had these\nThese loans out there that were set to balloon and mature and as they were the rates were going up which meant\nGo to get fired dot com and switched to the one hundred percent fiber optic network\nHundred percent phenomena\nAre lined with Dr Sanjay

are hardly eight six six Ninety red eye\nWell it's now tropical storm Michael but still a very dangerous storm as a now we turn to a meteorologist Tom hale who joined us good morning Tom\nGood morning don't let that fool you right\nYeah because uh you you you look at the footprint of of a tropical storm Michael now a which has been wreaking havoc on on a Georgia and headed for the\nCarolinas and it's it's the satellite photos or just a amazing or just startling and and this this storm again still has plenty of energy or what are we looking at a I Know we're a scheduled to get an update or within twenty five minutes or so\nBut the last update has it at sustained winds right now at roughly sixty miles an hour I'm guessing we can expect in the next report that to decrease\nI Would think so it should drop to probably fifty if that\nUm it may still maintain itself but I think a ten mile an hour drop as reasonable\nAlthough it at looking at it and radar and just kinda clocking it I I\nI don't think it'll drive more than ten miles it might pick up a mile and forward speed gone to the north east it may be Twenty one miles an hour\nAnd I said earlier predicted it would exit the United states at about twenty three to twenty five miles an hour [noise] uh but that's not going to be until it gets up into Virginia ... before it exits outta here yeah um\nYeah it's a um it it it's an incredible storm it let me give you a little kind of a broad overview\nOkay along the coast and the outer banks they're going to see storm surge from the storm and the Carolinas of two to four feet that's water inundation rice and then you can at high tide\nIn waves which could cause some problems it's not the biggest one there then we'll be another one or not the biggest one it will be feeder band soon we'll be talking about the potential for tornadoes\nNow these tornadoes and the feeder bans the feeder bans are coming in from the east and moving off to the west so that kind of curbing from southeastern northwest and the bans have individual storms in 'em and they're moving out of\nAbout forty miles an hour now those individuals storms are capable of brief\nSpin up tornadoes in the individual little super cells and as we get into the afternoon those storms will be heating up\nIn the afternoon maximum heat and that's going to happen primarily over the Carol North Carolina's where you're going to see that the greatest potential for tornado activity but it's a wind\nAnd so whether it's a to an addict wind or it's a sustained tropical force winds to forty to forty five miles an hour\nIt's gonna do damage and a lot of that damage is going to be treated damage\nAnd it's got to be in North Carolina because what's going on in North Carolina or what has gone on as Florence and so it's saturated soils and so these trees that we've noticed that most of them because of the wind has been\nToppled over we've seen a lot of root ball photos right on on television mhm so\nBoom overcome the trees now what are the trees hit\nThe power lines bingo\nSo we got the trees hitting power lines and we currently have seven hundred and thirty five thousand customers now that's they count customers is homes right\nOkay multiply that by two assuming there's only two people affected by every home and we know that numbers low and and you're already a one and a half million people already without power\nAnd that number is going to grow\nAs it gets into the Carolinas and I think the next big numbers for power outages are going to be in the Carolinas during Florence\nBetween the Carolinas they had over seven hundred and fifty thousand power outages and I think this is capable of of if not repeating it at least bringing in another four to five hundred thousand customers\nYeah and so we're going to get a will get over the two million mark on on people affected without any kind of power and then you have the question they were staging people for power\nIn Pensacola and just
