lot of great points and we need to protect our country you're absolutely right and I I as I said thanks for calling your doctor you too\nAnd let's go to AJ in Chicago EJ you're on with mark\nHey what's up man I'm I just want to say that actually the last caller had a lot of great on um the I think the biggest problem that he had was that\nA lot of illegal immigrants coming to the United states uh believing that they have the right just or landing on ah this country\nUm I think that you know it's a lot more than just be your it's more of contributing\nIf you don't contribute your community the lowest son or you don't you're not valuable in that sense so if you don't contribute to your country I think that's the highest sense which is what our military\nAnd most of our people who serve this country at the highest level since say that they do\nUm it's nothing then immigration King County um so I Would say that I as a ... you should feel that um you come into this country to contribute to the absolute most\n... you don't think you can do that and I don't know what your contribution to this country is I'm\nJust being here it's not a not know what I mean\nYeah I Do in fact I think you're ... something many of them come here and they wind up with an entitlement mentality right\nThey're entitled to serve as the hospitals schools whatever you want to say and and that you know what here's another great point what you give away for free I called a great point 'cause my what'd you give away for free is usually not value\nWhat you know you give free schools and they don't value the school you get free medical care in the ... people think it's coming to them so we even hurting them the the illegals because we're not making them value what we're giving them\nRight right so I I I think I have one final point in my mind the owner that\nUh if if you take away a or given for free and what do you ... you know and if you come here with nothing and they expect the most\nUm you really can you with the things that you should take at least a ... in my in my expectations of what I can give and what I can take it always has to do with what my contributions our economy and I give\nThe least then I Will be doing the worst if I come here and give most I Will be doing the best\nThere or are you planning to\nAnything whether it's a job\nWhether it's a service position whether it's anything at all or giving your your hunger percent or what should\nShould dictate in the hundred percent a tape that if you gave your absolutely zero percent you're not going to get anything out of you know what I mean so\nI Do in Europe you reminded me of ... ... yeah ... you remind me of a story if I could share with you\nWhen I was teaching younger kids in elementary school when I first started out now I teach adults you know what the kids would do with the free lunch you have any idea what they would do that they would throw in and they would take the ... they would take the green peas and toss them all over the cafeteria because they got it for free and they place no value on it\nSo in many since ... in a funny sense\nEven with the illegals they may not only is an entitlement mentality but we're not even helping them because they didn't earn anything is we're just giving it away for nothing and then we're surprised when they don't even value being in America and they don't share you think in the community and give it a values in fact\nWe've made it so easy that there are now communities where people don't even learn to speak English because everything's done for them in Spanish and I love Hispanic people yeah they're they're mostly in my classes that's not the issue so we've actually in a funny way\nDone harm to them and the other gentleman the other caller said we you know we should not abandoned the fight yeah but you do need someone to express it in a way that the American people it is a winning issue and that's what he said\nThat the American people can sign onto it we're not even helping the illegals yeah you say in the short run they're getting free benefits and stuff not in the long run\nNot in the long run do they value what's so special\nAbout being

don't mean to be picky there but uh that's what Kennedy's and that's when ... were on the ... noir and South America\nAs part of a greater America\nI don't I don't know I don't see that one I don't buy from you I I think to the I Love the term America America the beautiful is a great song um and so that's all but of course you're absolutely right\nTeam together as a people of states and we didn't want a strong federal government and the founders were very much opposed to that and that's what made us part of the reason we're so special you were very articulate you a very good so\nI don't want you on that you know I'm actually my first time but I I was I really I\nI really think that age and I really think that if we understood more of the concept of looking at is at us as a union therefore republic as opposed to a democracy a ... as a union instead of the country with a single government is single mentality\nThat it would help us to further explain to people some of the concepts that we as conservatives as as constitutional is again whatever label you wanna use are trying to get people to understand them further\nThat no absolutely I agree with everything you're saying and you did it very well but\nYou're gonna have to be better the second time\nWell darn it mark I tell you when the moral site [laughter]\nAre you in a you know I think ...\nI Love the show for

that food we're you know\nAnd uh I I ... my personal feeling on that says that there's a certain amount of fraud involved in this whole process\nThat's only my own opinion I don't want to preach it or anything else but it's just my own opinion of\nA ... ...\n... you know what Tom on your next the check it's going to say surcharge for illegals coming from Honduras you're going to pay for it\nOne way

Gurley Margot Adler\nMark back with you again taking your calls let's go to Sylvia in San Diego Sylvia around with mark\nHi Hi I'm a kind of late for me but I just ah someone to call it a while you were trying to heal while ago is talking about a century city in century state\nAnd about the people voting for them and I just wanted to say that I I live here where we vote on that certainly not Governor Brown name and the whole state of sanctuary state which I don't I don't know how many of the city's pay attention to him I Know some of them have actually\nVoted against a following his directions but I don't recall ever hearing any load about sanctuary city that here\nAnd I you know the ones that I think as we know it wasn't so they were on it it's just that the Democrats in office a very liberal extremely leftist a Democrat as an office and he just decided that's a good idea does it and I from what I understand San Francisco's kind of a dump now partly what it is\nI was there a few months ago and I'm using it was amazing when he was walking the streets with my kids are so many other just now look at this hand this hand as a weapon and then another\nSomething ... someone says something about a knife that doesn't count how dirty it is now I didn't see this but they were needles all over certain sections I think they said market street and of course the problem with the trash and the and the homelessness is a problem but that's true yes you know everywhere in California right\nYes uh-huh but I think uh I I miss San Francisco in a long time I don't really go up there that much I mean it's quite far from San Diego and I've I've just never been into their way of thinking so um yeah it's\nIt's it's it's the only thing we voted on and I like to ask you one other thing I didn't mention is to follow that spoke at first but\nBut you have you heard the thing about the the um um birth tourism it it was on our throat gets\nYeah mentioned this just a few people and they have not heard of it and it actually was on television some some time ago on twenty twenty or dateline or one of those where they fly on these Chinese women that are pregnant uh-huh and they have this place all set up and they go there and they have the babies get their little American citizenship for the baby and leave\nAnd then leave yeah no I actually I did hear that pregnant women going into hospitals yep they've got to figure it out and look people take advantage of the weaknesses in anything right especially your in laws source we of course we call that anchor babies right to so they come here and they have a baby and then\nThere are they have all the right that is wrong and of course is wrong and an awful\nLot of people have not heard about that because I've I've told that you either keep politicians here and they well they are people that work for them and they hadn't heard of that so I'm I'm Glad to get to say it on national radio so people can know what's going on it's we're very close to the border here so if I mean people come over here and dumped the baby's all the time I say dumping I mean they have them\nAnd I and I just I don't think it's right I don't think a lot of the country and the other countries in the world\nDo that ... somebody had a baby in Italy I said to the baby had citizenship and they said no because he was born in an air force us air force base so I don't know why we're handing out citizenship like if I can do it you know it's it's it's a paradigm\nThey're actually yeah glad\nThe actual do Sylvia there was a reason for it which is a there with with the slavery issue we want to make sure that they weren't taking advantage of it any way but of course if you pass a law every every law by the way there's a phrase I've heard was a one time a solution every problem was the one time a solution to something else\nSo you you mean well and you pass something and then people figure out how to take advantage oh I Would do the same thing I Lived in say in Asia and I think I could get my kids have American citizenship if they just born here well I'm going to time my trip so that I have the baby yeah of course that could go wrong with the

gotten better than ... another call previously said to me what do you think of the Republicans keep the house and increase their numbers in the Senate and they have the presidency what's the reaction

know I'm no expert on this\nBut you know look I'll ... I'll tell you a quick story I'm Out walking around my house in my kids' friends best friends or one of her best friend's father\nI thought it was just going to say let them he runs after me I'm just taking my walk\nAnd he says I saw you on radio and you you guys are crazy and even I thought the kind of going to hit me one point I'm just trying to do my walk and he never done this before but it the anger was so strong\nAh yeah I Know you're you know what you you and the Fox and the rest of those people thinking on their you know you're a radio guy and all this kind of he was so angry at me yet we ... civil discussions you know at the end of the parties that he put on his house or whatever and the kids were best friends\nYou know it was amazing it was I I really thought he was going to get violent\nIt it's it's gotten really bad so I I don't look forward to seeing you saying asking them to be civil I we've pass those days we've really pass it was a\nPretty pretty discouraging aim we I'll speak for myself I Know people who think like I said on my side we think they're misguided that they got the wrong ideas and they think revival one of the other things I threw out\nWas they have such hatred for President Trump and they have no idea that a lot of us hated President Obama at the same way but there was no resistance we just waited patiently until his term was up I wanted them to become the first time I thought he was a disaster maybe the worst president in our history\nWhile we wait until it happened and we did everything politically we could and they picked on a ... a Senator McConnell said Mitch McConnell said you know you want to do and we can to get rid of my forget how we phrased it that's about the most we said\nBut these guys this whole are saying you know I don't agree with Michelle Obama when they go low we we kick him or whatever they he said I Can't remember the other on your rights saying we're not going to be civil until we get back in power\nWell that makes sense on her case because you can never take not being in power right there for sale anyway ... fun this this is not good\nA man hang in there the okay I have a gym you live in Portland I'm just looking at it again your mayor doesn't even want to police the do anything right\n... ... yeah I did I recall that real close but that's my understanding it or or if he would uh I I thought I heard one anecdote most of my news I I don't read the newspaper so much I get it on the radio and word of mouth and it's like a he thought the uh the uh\n... recording antifa one word of mouth straight they were the victims and a lot a lot of people trying to do their daily lives you know I'm thinking what's what hit you know I mean it's a it's it's appalling it you know to frankly I'm a little ashamed of I'm not having the guts\nTo uh uh you know a\n... not having the guts to a ... a ... have everybody obey the same laws\nNo it isn't it that you're such a nice guy I don't want to disagree but it's not a matter of cuts that's what he believes he's a leftist he believes are probably supports in ... and that's it's not 'cause he doesn't have occurred that's who he is probably
