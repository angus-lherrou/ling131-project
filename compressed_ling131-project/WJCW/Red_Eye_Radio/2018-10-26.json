I don't think so what is it specifically\nSaying that how might Hillary Clinton harmed again when campaigned anything\nBad ... bad credit people trust her trust her I think reality is I I voted for her [noise] um I supported her\nBut she does things that um\nShe kept fell for herself and she makes a big mistakes eloquent there you go [laughter]\nSo what you're saying is she believe shouldn't run\nIn twenty [laughter] forget about Gillum we're clear on that what about twenty\nTwenty you know because the ears and saying you know the bubble that the Clintons have always lived in but many people live in inside the beltway or inside of the chapel club beltway um the\n... they they when they when they go on the you know a speech to or or you know um if they if they go out and just do some rallies right\nOr it is the case for any of them right or left that those rallies are filled with Friendly's for the most part I mean except for outside on the sidewalk they're filled with friendly in other words the the Clintons have been surrounded by people who have been telling them they're the greatest for a long long time\nWhen you step outside that you step away from it a bit I think Hillary got some of this even when she was running in twenty sixteen remember the reporters that approached her during the campaign season and started asking questions about bill\nThen they had to pretty much at that point Debbie Wasserman Schultz was hiding Hillary [laughter]\nWhere's Hillary was the question and you ... the ... they had to create that well they had to build a wall around Hillary so that they you know she was not approachable so she's been told by a lot of people oh you should run again you should run again you should run again\nBut it really will be their own and terminals that will tell them you know our millennials on board\nNow that's a very different question as to whether or not she should go on and endorse or she could she helped Dylan more any other candidate right now in the left\nIt is a very different question in terms of what she run or or should she run or would you vote for her and twenty twenty many of those same people that just criticized for maybe a few of them might vote for her\nBut I don't know that for sure because by the time we get to twenty twenty I don't know that you're millennials going to look at that and go yeah she's just not the proud and we need somebody you knew in fresh or gentleman besides her\nJust you know because I was actually watching the the the video over here so you didn't have access you weren't looking at the video but the woman who said\nThat she should be there just for fundraising and she was older I'm gonna get she yeah she was fifty plus I'm guessing she was the same woman a who said we don't trust her right that she's not trustworthy and that's interesting because that somebody who's experience Hillary Clinton\nThe other two were younger there they were probably in their thirties so they probably don't go all the way back to\nAs many of us do Hillary Clinton and Hillary care way back when\nWhen uh you know she was in charge of of putting together a you know some type of single payer health care system in America in the early nineties\nUh so I thought that was really interesting you actually can raise money but then we don't want to hear from or we don't want to emerge around we don't want her people don't people don't trust her and what she means as Democrats don't trust her she didn't trust her\nRight and I when I found that just to be I I found that\nTo be really really really interesting one other point that I Want to make her because we hear this all the time and we've addressed it before but it came up again the media this week is at Trump's rallies when they talk about Hillary in lock her up\nThat that is it that's it you know instability that that is\nLook you're talking about a political rally and you're also talking about you know why why are they saying lock her up you have to go back to you know what's it about just because she exist\nAnd she'll post you lock her up no that goes back to what that goes back to the whole email scandal where people can identify what the crime was you can look at the law and say this is a crime that she broke and many other people who did this anybody else who did this\nAny normal person who allowed top secrets you know to be so accessible and broke the law and she did would end up in jail that's what that's based on not just based on the on what the left is attempting to portray as just\nPure incivility that don't like her so they want to put her in jail no it's based\nOn her behavior what she did and the fact that Republicans have looked at it and said ... and many have looked at it even not just Republicans conservatives without a libertarian since they are actually broke the law right she put the server and her house that's breaking the law she knew\nThat people were going to have you know at that at that level as secretary of state that every foreign government is every ah\nUnfriendly and probably friendly foreign government is looking to tap into anything they possibly can to find out what you're doing as secretary of state by you doing that\nOn Friendly's where we were able to get into some of our top secret you knew it and you did it so you could hide emails from the freedom of Information Act that's a crime yup there's two crimes they're the Espionage Act and trying to avoid the freedom of Information Act that's what it's about now you might say\nWell but she never went to court it doesn't take away the fact that nobody disagrees with what the law is or what she actually did well it's\nDifferent than the chant by Rosie O'Donnell on the white or in front of the White House you know that is based on\nNothing it's based on false which you know saying that this the current president is an agent of the of of Russia a and that and you know again implying or that and saying in some cases that he got there or to the White House illegally\nIn the ... in the case of lock her up it's based on a crime but nobody debates was broken by her\n... that was a law that was broken by her a crime that was committed we know we can point to it now again it is rhetoric but it's it's the people what they're what the point that they're making is she should be in jail she's not above the law\nRight and it's also the fact that the system you know lock her up is also an attack of the system and the up yeah and the department of justice at that time for not following the law right\nSo that isn't that isn't a a again\nThe same as in any way justifying\nViolence ... and ...\nThat's what is being portrayed I just want to hit that 'cause we hit that before when when uh uh the you know they were being criticized the rallies were saying that and when you would read the articles that would say it was horrible they they didn't even understand what the point was that even a why the people were saying right they didn't even address that particular point\nSo if you just you're lock her up lock her up and you have no clue as the majority of Americans don't understand the constitution if you have no clue what happened in twenty sixteen and its millennial said we don't even care about that right anymore well then you look at it and so yeah it's unfair what they're saying about what's not unfair\nCalled to one eighty seven creek animal hospital is going to make your pet healthy and happy\nLook into any great business whether it's a manufacturers or a hotel a

wanted to address something\nThat you that you had said during the bottom of the hour and it was you know when we were talking a ... from an earlier conversation and talking about that you know the heated rhetoric of you know calling\nA Trump Hitler that you know and and going back because we brought this up months and months and months ago I I don't even know it might have been after the school shooting much I'm not really sure but when we talked about what heated rhetoric out there and what it means you know what you're communicating now we've never been one that have drawn the heated rhetoric\nAnd blamed the people have heated rhetoric for somebody who's not kill somebody we didn't blame Bernie Sanders or anybody else no when ... after the ... shooting we didn't we didn't do that but uh we brought up you know just\nHow inflammatory that kind of rhetoric is because what you're saying as Trump is the same as a guy who committed a genocide of\nSix million Jews ... which of course is just the most bizarre statement you could ever make and the only reason you do that is to inflame\nA rage in people that's why you do it mhm because you believe that they'll actually by that and they'll be in theory aided ... with it and then you've got you've completed the brainwashing by doing that you and I remember that during the Obama administration you brought this up uh uh to me just now when\nHe was being called the dictator right we had to get on the air and say guy stopped that right went on the issues is not a dictator he won he want he was voted in by the people the United states conservatives and Republicans might have fought to distasteful but he's not a dictator\nAnd they were talking about the you know they want the the idea of right the idea of\nA him acting uh you know again using the executive Penn instead of going to Congress every president has that power we don't agree with that method right but every president has that power um and and you know it was about you know cap and trade and things\nThat that he was essentially implemented implementing a through uh the EPA every president has that power didn't have the power for a recess appointments and lead civil court stopped\n... he lost and right I I think you can find every president eventually you know when they served their their terms have been rejected by the courts in some executive order that they have yeah up you know a pulled out do they try to stretch the power that they have yeah you have to make 'em dictators no no a dictator would be somebody who was not elected\nAnd was duly elected and and the other part of that as we need to remind you that that's how people vote\nWhether it's two thousand eight two thousand twelve this is how the people voted uh you don't look the Democrats want you to believe that it's not how the people who voted um or there or we shouldn't have the ... like they've met every excuse in the book it was the Russians\nNow we've got to get rid of the electoral college that's the problem um the uh the the majority of the people didn't vote for him well this is what it comes down to this is the process we have in place we have it for a reason and we respect the constitution and that process but I think it's very important as we talked about before for\nA ... and we we spent quite a bit of time on this this week is for us not to be that don't argue like them right\nRight they have lost because of the way that they have argued ... so even though it may satisfy your primal urge or instinct to re jotted somebody like they're doing to you and you get a moment of satisfaction out of it\nIt's one of the reasons that they're losing but you and I said this\nMany times all we need is true mhm and when you look at the\nThings that we believe they work\nMhm that's why we promote them that's why we do the kind of show that we do we spend a lot of time talking about this yesterday that's why we break down everything that's why we get down to the issues that had and we get pushback from people on the right when we do that by the way mhm there are some not all but there are some of the right\nThat want to believe the rhetoric they want to believe the hype\nYou know you and I and and that's why we you talked about dictator remember when uh we'd we'd sit here Obama as a Muslim and we said where's the evidence right\nWhile his father now where's the evidence that that's what he believes if you look at what he believes what does he believe he believes more in the church of Jeremiah Wright mhm\nWhich wasn't preaching Islam but was preaching hay and not Christianity but was preaching a radical hate him or hate America or a\nMessage message and thank you very much and uh [laughter] to friday or hate America message ... as we said come on\nIf you look at Obama certainly not religious when you think\nThat somebody like Obama worships anybody else other than really really think that you really think he's a devoted that there is I got up there that tells him what to do and please and so we had some fun with it but we said no the evidence doesn't show that at all evidence matters across the board and we've been

hundred feet\nFormer inspector general of the United States Department of transportation\nOkay the O T I G I G D O G\nDon't know which go first so there you have it you have somebody who um\nIs well versed in investigating that type of investigation that was the first question almost as if it were a possibility the entertaining of the uh you know all the different ideas\nThe fact is that we don't know the motive of the person or persons responsible is completely on known the whole false flag thing\nOkay one possibility that's one possibility also possible that\nIt is somebody who just flat out hates Democrats and is is a wants to make a a wants to send a message and make a point about all of the people who hate Trump\nWe have no idea yet and won't know that until that person is known if ever\nRight and and and both sides are involved in my narrative just you know my narrative is what\nJustifies the conclusion we saw it on social media yesterday you and I talked about that in our pre show meeting mhm that you see well Trump aides were apologize because we know it's somebody that you know who supports him who did this and then we saw the false flag it's the falls flight thing you saw the means out they're Democrats are now sending bombs to themselves and everything else on social media\nAnd nobody knows but this is a nation that we live in and and that's part of the discussion that we had last hour we've had a significant discussion on it the ... this week we want to believe the narrative before we even know what the truth was you and I dealt with this\nBecause we talk of other instances of last hour that we dealt with this we dealt with the dough with Trayvon Martin\n... to this day I have no idea what happened now because you have that you have that time span of I forgot the exact time was between two and four minutes where nobody knows what happened right we don't know what happened nobody and people were taking sides on that we criticize former President Obama\nFor taking sides remember the beer summit he had no idea the ... the former president when it came to police officers are involved in suspects shootings always took the side of the alleged victim not knowing whether the alleged victim was actually a victim or not that's wrong to do so\nWe said it and ... and it was wrong for the president and the former attorney general Eric Holder to take sides in that and they took sides early on\nAnd then hold his own Justice Department found out that the whole hands up don't shoot was ally when the FBI did the investigation or are there and they talked about the conspiracy in the neighborhood to keep the truth from coming out\nHands up don't shoot is still used today mhm\nWhen either side does that it's wrong\nWe should be basing our opinions on facts not speculation but we don't do that there is something I don't know what it is maybe it's social media where people believe that okay I have an audience now\nAnd so just like the media there's this third that I'm going to be first and then if I guess the rights conspiracy theory if I can guess what happened before the facts comes out somehow that gives me some type of journalistic legitimacy\nYeah it's um you know it it because it would be one thing if you had sources right and you were putting together a puzzle but then that's not what this is the speculation\nPure speculation pure speculation based on zero evidence based on nothing\nYou know if a Catherine heritage\nOr says look ... ... it's possible based on the leaks that are coming out or that it is but that's somebody who would put pieces of a puzzle together a I think she's done some stellar work I'm a number of stories or over the years but what are you doing you're going to people\nThat have something for you and then ultimately you see if that peace bits into the puzzle or how the narrative starts to build out or how the how the truth I guess starts to come together\nThat's all that is it's called journalists for those under sixty journalism was very important years to go to our nation and its rarely practice true journalism today\nBecause what you have is people wanting to 'em and they believe they're right in doing so\nHaving a Kenyan and have their work justify their opinion\nOr their behavior their words they believe that they're right we talked about this earlier this week about how the the biased media you know operates\nBecause they believe they're right they don't believe that they're biased they believe it's the right thing to do activism in place of journalism\nIs what we see today more often than not and\nYou when you look at a story especially one like this that still unfolding in in the public we don't we simply\nDon't know all we know as one has been found that's it\nThey have no idea and we're supposed to hide it and what the mode and we're still not sure what has been found and we're still not sure what the nature of what's been found\nLet's how do you go to George in New York George welcome you're on run I radio walking with the show I George\nHey how's it going guys good show um yeah I was calling about um [noise]\nIt seems like there's a lot of uh that are are going around about um [noise] the damage sweeping in terms of the last I heard with Newt Gingrich I think it was a report I charge report I've got where\nIt gets on a panel some network I don't know which [noise] saying that the Democrats had two or three chance of\nWinning the house in terms I'm just wondering if [noise] poses a buildup to scale way independent voters no maybe not as serious gambling but his heart and and they were just say well you know it's a law so why bother\nI you're saying that's why I Do it using that is why Newt Gingrich did that\nFor sure I'm not sure about him specifically 'cause you know but in general I I think she was first\nOf all why or how do you know that that would scare independence from voting if independence right now are leaning more conservative as the polls sense that they do that would actually encourage independents who leave conservative to me to actually go out and vote\nMaybe well that can be at a point to maybe that was\nAs you point 'cause he I look I when when you're talking about political operatives who you know you'd have to ask them what their motivation was and they probably will be more willing to tell you after election you know why\nWhy why they did what they what they did ... and again we have looked at some of the polls out there and we have a question you don't need silver for example we still question\nYou know how how legitimate you know how you can look at all these house races and make these determinations we still have a ton\nOf up questions but when you look at it overall I think the consensus is more that the republic or the Democrats have a chance of taking back the house and a greater chance than Republicans keeping it but in the Senate\nI think you almost have universal agreement that the Senate is going to stay with with Republican\nYeah in fact I saw something today uh that that basically just had you know that everyone all but it was it was the headline was directed more at the Republican candidates in those races or republic Republicans in in general believing that they were going to keep the Senate\nOr where the houses going I think that's still up in the air because there are some things that we can't misery even through pools but if you do it strictly by the polls right now than there is a better than decent chance that the Democrats would take the house that would not be shocking\nA when you talk about a first term president uh often that first midterm is is something where the that shift to power happens that happened with a rock Obama in two thousand ...\nRight and so you could look at at at history that dictates has now do we look at all anomalies that didn't exist before yeah trend in that area yeah Trump yeah cabinet and that's\nWhat I was saying about the polls have you go by the polls in history than than you can look out and go okay by Democrats take the house and and the Republicans keep the Senate\nAnd then you look in Nineteen Ninety four I did that happen\nWas only a talk show host for a couple of years I still remember it how shocked everybody was and said whoa really except for his albino ... nobody really got that one did they ...\nAnd it really came out of nowhere how did the Republicans take so many seats well there was this underlying you know a underline passion that existed and voting excitement from Republicans to go out that somehow nobody saw now with the technology today\nAnd with the way that we do polling today have we improved it I don't know well and we'll know a little over a little under two weeks from now call\nOuts is the only way you're going to get an answer for I'm a Republican or conservative in many cases you're not going to see them at protests you're not going to see them at at you might see them at a presidential or the ... the president's rallies\nBut you're not going to see them doing these grassroots

G.\nAnd ... women everything else is like from the ... what would stop this because it would be if we think it's ... just assume that it is beneficial to the president potentially\nThat would be a good ... let me backtrack that many things have leaked from the White House and say every so many things\nWhen you look at the nature of something that if if the White House believed it was going to help for\nIt wouldn't be the position of the chief of staff and advisors to the president that look\nHand this over to the guy gee\nAllow him to do what he does and don't\nSay well the everybody's speculating and the media ... mhm\nUh about the bombs and then what the motivation is neither speculating\n... nobody's even nobody speculating nobody's analyzing nobody's saying what I haven't seen one story\nAnywhere maybe one existed I haven't seen I Would love to see mhm where somebody has made the same points that we have oh wow why did you give it to the inspector general there's only ... the whole thing was frame the story was initially framed that\nUh we had foreign allies that didn't want us to release this information or we heard one story said it was the British Government because of Christopher Steele ... and we said well wait a minute why would you pay attention to them they don't know what the top secret information is I don't know what the president now I don't know what you have they don't know what's in the Pfizer borne so why would you pay attention to them\nAnd if you were going to not release it because things were top secret you would have gone to probably your secretary of state who would be dealing with those governments and and there's\nAlso an ex director of the CIA and you'd be going to Dan Coats your own director of national intelligence you wouldn't be given it to the inspector general who only looks for one thing and that's corruption and therefore once it was declassified\nAnd people saw what was declassified in the White House they looked in said there are probably possible crimes here\nAnd before we released is we need to first given to the inspector general of the United states to go after the corruption that we see how come nobody has written that story right and\nIf somebody has I haven't seen it I've not seen any major publication\nAnd nothing on the story right\nBecause if you didn't believe if if the president looked at that and didn't\nBelieve there was some kind of wrongdoing\nThan there would be no reason to contact or would it would be only if you believe if you saw it and said wow this looks like there's a possible wrongdoing within the department of justice\nThat's up to a horror which to write the report was handed over because that's what the inspector general Dutch\nAnd by the way we'd be bringing this up but thanks to many of our listeners\nWho I get a few a week ... people running me emails saying\nWhat's going on right which would you guys live round thing you hear anything I mean we haven't seen any stories on it either of what's going on I mean that should be one of the biggest stories right now and and who should be reporting this biggest story who should be encouraging it Republicans are they no\nNo no no\nAnd I would think that that the media would be curious I Would think that uh\nCatherine heritage or or someone else like that would be curious you know anyone that that is a not in the mainstream media but ... but you know someone who has done some really great work in ...\nI Would think Katherine heritage Fox News would be on a consistently I Would think the wall Street Journal would be on it consistently I Would think the Daily Caller would bionic consistently ...\nOut of the things that are I Would think\nThat Andrew McCarthy that's one of the you know ... cars running other articles I really ... and we've been paying attention to it I really haven't seen him right any type of in depth article on that at all and he's been covering it in a separate cars there are a Carter right and and I just wonder why is everybody quiet on it\n\nAnd you're telling me there's no leaks on this one at all zero\n\nWhen everything else it seems like in the world has been leaked on how many how many important\nItems politically would be ... well it and so there's there's a I guess a couple of possibilities they looked at it and said well\nThere's a a chance that what was done here was illegal was ah was someone that I acted outside of their their uh their legal bounds\nWithin the department of justice in this process but we're not sure handed to Horowitz so in that case you don't leak it because the poor which comes back and says no wrongdoing was found then you look bad by leaking that information and you hook burned you know your connection to me\nI\nI don't sense because of the nature of what you know how it happened and and frankly how quickly that kind of happened\nAnd the fact that it went that direction\nTo begin with tells me they see that and say there's there's a great chance here that that this is wrongdoing and that's exactly\n... and ... and Democrats were completely quiet yes and the other part is that the violence from the Democrats when it went to the inspector general there was really nothing\nThe other side of that of handing it over to Horwitz has that horror which doesn't have to ask anyone for documents at the department of justice through an investigation\nBut ... the ... office can walk in and can obtain those documents and no one can stop them why\nHas doing why hasn't the conservative media\nFrom the very beginning talk

Ninety road I one of the things we love talking about the most is the uh the economy\nOr the show you know are going back in different incarnations all the way back to Nineteen sixty nine uh and and our dealings with the transportation industry as always uh had that particular issue bent on economics\nAnd so when I saw this today I said okay this is something that we have to bring up so people can understand\nAbout the economy at large was the wall Street Journal's analysis of Commerce Department statistics out on why we're doing better what is driving the increase\nIn the gross in the GDP in the increase in economic growth what is you know what is driving it and their analysis is almost half of the increase\nFrom April of twenty Seventeen from last year until this year now new numbers are coming out this morning but based on the numbers that are that came out from last month's almost half of the increase in our economy is due to increased government spending\nAnd they looked at you know really from the majority of the Obama administration where the uh economic uh growth was the average GDP was to point two percent\nAnd compared it to the two point nine percent economic growth that we've had since April of twenty Seventeen just under three percent\nWhich is as you know we know is it is a good thing a defense spending has increased drastically that's one of the major reasons and increased government spending that has helped the the GDP a\nDefense\nSpending was contracted at an annual rate get this Eric a to point one percent from two thousand nine to twenty Seventy ...\nAnd they really go back to you know the president's real you know the really the first budget when he had no influence on his when looking at right uh to growing at a two point nine percent rate since April twenty Seventeen\nSo there's a huge difference in defense spending that turnaround added a point to one percentage points to the ... on average to the nation's overall economic growth rate according to the Commerce Department\nWhen a including faster spending on non defense items and spending at state and local levels increase government spending accounted for a point three four percentage point a to point seven percent point increase in the growth rate since April twenty Seventeen\nWhich means\nUh the economy has grown a two point nine percent\nUh since April of twenty Seventeen the last quarter was what for for one was a ... right was it was a very good courtroom or almost half of that has been because of government spending\nIf\nNow it has also increased other factors are at play fast her business investment due in part to energy investing contributed point contributed point three percentage points to the growth rate faster consumer spending accounts for about a third of the pick up a slowdown in home building has some attracted\nTwo percentage points from that growth rate\nThe concern is as we said before is wants to government spending moderate than that increase goes away and\nAs we said before the true growth\nAnd if you listen to the show you know we've been consistent\nUh irrespective of whether it's been a Republican president or a Democrat president or the GDP is not the most accurate way\nIt's the way that we use and it's become the accepted way\nIt's never been the most uh uh accurate way we believe to truly a show the indication of economic growth\nBecause money being transferred back and forth or government spending is viewed the exact same way as private sector profits and sales and we believe that that distorts\nThe actual growth rate of any economy but it's been consistent from democratic presidents to a Republican presidents well it's important to monitor the true expansion of well\nYes and that's and that is the that is the increase in goods and services produced by the private sector not that we don't support an increase in defense spending no we're ... we're just talking about how we analyze how it applies to the economy is doing so without the increased in government spending\nOr you would have had a a\n... a growth rate of of two point five six percent up from the two point two percent from the Obama administration the point is how critical it is because you see the increase you see the increase in a huge increase why because of fossil fuels\nWhich drives the majority of the private sector increase in GDP that's still what's driving the majority increase in GDP in the private sector it's still not as much as government spending", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "year": "2018", "city":
