I Would love to ask left is a well they wouldn't listen but liberals at least is this what you want\nThat someone accused the use of something I mean even though he doesn't seem quite fair a concede Tucker Carson Carlson saying on Fox News that he's been accused of something I don't know what that was when he was totally innocent that could be a lot of people like that\nWhat's your life is ruin your member of the players at at Duke lacrosse players they wound up being innocent remember toward a Brawley a New York city or a with Al Sharpton who never had to apologize for all of that stuff [noise]\nThis is what you want\nWhere you can just destroy someone's life and and their family because of an accusation that's not corroborated and people are believed just because you make an accusation and and and and the me too movement\nWe understand women having been treated fairly and in many years in our country but the idea that that's that's enough\nAs a what's the Hawaiian ... senators name that that's you know mentioned just shut up and go away\nAnd that's where we've come to I've set for years now give me nine conservative odd black women on the U.S Supreme Court and I'd be happy camper what do I care about their race\nOr their gender I just want people with good values and of course I Want them to share my views what went on and I hear him getting into a while to get into it later\nWhen we went on a week or so ago is just outrageous but then it brings me to my bigger picture which I talked about the first hour that we have a civil war the less believes that they have truth on their side and anything they do is justified so much so you can't speak on college campuses\nYou can't even go to a restaurant and peace not right\nAnd they'll do anything and everything to get rid of President Trump and Hillary say this week\nSomething about we will not be civil again and we don't have to be civil as long as he's president of the United states whoa we we've gotten to that point of view I remember that Ronald Reagan we'd have drinks with all these things you can have drinks with Tip O'Neill at night\nAnd he said to him for the regular season and say you battling me in the daytime and Tip O'Neill the Democrat the speaker of the house from Massachusetts will say well that was in the daytime we fight there but here we are friendly that that's not the case anymore\nYou saw what Senator Graham said that he wouldn't put up with with this nonsense and you want power so badly you'll do\nAnything to destroy people yeah that's where we've come now we've come to the point where it sounds like a second\nCivil war to me and you see the anti for the protests in the street uh Portland I mentioned that last hour what took place between the prayer group and their group and bloody and bare knuckles\nAnd the bear spray and all all kinds of stuff it's it's getting violent out there and of course we have the situation of these police\nAre almost being murdered by a guy who you know shot up the congressmen playing baseball\nThat's all we've come to I I really worry about this country is really crucial and if you\nDon't vote come or what is it about four weeks from now I don't even know what it is in early November and the Democrats take back the house and that's the prediction of a lot of so called polls now and of course the polls wrong before so we're hoping for a bigger turn it on our side\nYou will you won't believe what's going to take place they'll have hearings half the hearings they'll subpoena people it won't be safe to work for the Trump Administration anymore they'll catch on something and they'll get you on everything\nSo this can't pay this can't be what you want to happen in America even good liberals on the other side I Wish you'd call me\nAt eight six six Ninety red eye that's eight six six nine o seven thirty three thirty nine you can't walk this because just like the reason we now only need fifty votes to elect the Supreme Court justice or fifty one and the vice president votes in case of the pie is because Harry Reid started that\nYou ... the Democrats the left and liberals can't want this 'cause it's kind of come back to haunt them the next time they win and in American history\nIt goes back and forth between Democrats and Republicans and one side on the other side you you can't want that's the problem is you're you're not seeing you open up a new can of worms where you are guilty\nJust because of an accusation you open up a new can of worms if you will do anything to get rid of the president United States because you disagree their views and Trump's case even worse you know like who he is a you personally saw\nPosed him you can't believe this ... this bump came this fool this guy is\nNot an elite is like the rest of you that he ever could have one and by the way\nHe's going to win again I really believe that the election was held to the end of two years long time he'd win reelection\nSo uh we're we're we're in for a battle and we've got to make sure that the the house is not taken over by the Democrats I'm pretty sure we're going to keep the Senate were probably\nWhen a few more seats in the Senate but in the house of representatives the a lot of people I I did a show a week or so ago and I had some experts on the third our including off the air they said to me it looks bad Laos represents\nThe guy that I Know well in orange county part of California data ...\nI think he's been at twenty or Thirty years he's in trouble they're spending millions and millions of dollars to defeat it didn't and then they are so passionate about this the other side they are so angry about this election this past election that President Trump is in office to get what he's done\nAnd remember the courts were so significant because if they couldn't win elections the other side would make sure judges ruled right like the Muslim ban that President Trump because of what he said some federal judges and decided it was a Muslim ban doesn't matter for the president has a right to do that\nSo they love the idea that the judges could make laws that's partially what this battle was about also\n[noise] so ... this is and that's not what the first hour was and I want you to react to it I think we're going to another civil war going on I'm just hoping that it\nDoesn't get violent that we can get through this thing and I'd already there is some votes magic you can't go to a restaurant that would have been unheard of\nTen twenty Thirty years ago going to a restaurant with your family and having people chant around you to make sure you can eat there or having a waiter or waitress is not serving police or not serving people on the other side what what are we coming to does the other side I really want that\n... I I Want to know what you're thinking that you know it's it's pretty sad what's gonna happen if you don't do something the next few weeks I mean get everybody can devote\nWe're we're going to lose this this was going to be a real battle worse than what you saw a with justice cow and all of the week or so ago eight six six Ninety red eye eight six six nine o seven three three three nine more guys they're filling in on red Iranian\nTips from Jean J.

a little observation uh myself I'm I'm pretty politically neutral um but you know I must have been in as young as I Am I I watch a lot of uh you know media\nAnd and are getting on the social media and just the way that they're portraying the current president Mr Trump is just\nA little ... it seems a little unfair and the way that they're doing it it it seems like they're just uh they want to actually get into the political side they want to just pinpoint you know a lot of like more scandalous things like that stuff but he says the stuff that the ...\nAnd the way that they're pushing the edge just purely for conquer and it seems like it seems like a lot of these uh these are that are\nUm showing this stuff or they just want to do it for the money and I think that's just kind of a dangerous thing to do because if you're um you know pushing the fact that we need to get all these young people out there and and vote and then you want to only\nReally show one side of the story it just seems like it's almost an agenda and and I just think that's kind of a dangerous thing like especially you know like I said if you're going to have all these people excited about voting and not really know exactly what they're voting for 'em I just seems that that that could be dangerous situation\nYou're pretty perceptive how old are you a twenty five\n... pretty young and uh it seems to me that you you reflect what I think a lot of people are feeling after the hearings especially which is the way they treated the the judge pretty badly they're treating President Trump pretty badly now some of it um honesty I support him big time but he does bring it on himself with some of the tweets and so on\nBut the personal vendetta the hatred they have for him as a way out of bounds\nI I did not like President Obama I didn't like I'm not sure I agree with him and the more than one thing on his policies\nI certainly wants to know harm to come to him and I certainly didn't wasn't part of any resistance I I just knew you had to get rid of him the next term and I lost that one too you didn't see people on the streets you didn't he see people are threatening the ... I guess they didn't want it to the ... I'm like that\nBut but in general the anger towards this president I Know that you may not remember this you're pretty young towards George W. Bush was pretty angry but this this is even surpassed that they we actually had a coup in this country trying to get rid of him even though he won the electoral college\nAny ... fairly elected president United States we had people in the FBI and the Justice Department\nWorking in collusion that was where the Clinton was to try to get rid of him to undo and election that it's not supposed to happen in the United states of America I don't know I mean the first hour and a banana republic where that happens a you're pretty good and how about your friends do they agree with you or you're by yourself\nI yeah I Know a lot of the the people that you know I surround myself they they do think pretty much the same way again uh like I said I'm pretty politically neutral myself and a lot of my friends are but they do understand what\nThe media is trying to get people to see and the way that they're presenting it and it it's definitely outright like I said I I don't really put myself in the middle of all that but I I definitely don't want to see people\nThat are expecting one thing and then they go vote and they don't realize what they voted for kids you know growing up everybody's always like okay you're voters get account but it doesn't really count if you're not voting for something you don't really understand so\nThat's really all I Want it to me or now just to make sure everybody know liberate it be before you\nGo in and sounds like you to go but I I'll say that everybody else out there the fact is I'm not one of those people that wants to make it easier for people to vote\nI think if you don't know enough about what's going on and you don't care enough to go out of your way the vote I have a feeling you're not one of my voters that you're going to do it based on emotions and feelings which is what the other side is anyway to begin with\nAs opposed to as our caller just said\nA knowing the facts and knowing the issues and that's okay you don't have to agree with me\nBut at least go in there don't do it based on emotion you you hate President Trump so much or he he's a man and you know we don't want to listen to ... and so you're the woman that I remember

filed for bankruptcy protection to cast and bum report\nThis was not at all unexpected you're holding company was supposed to make one hundred and thirty four million dollar debt payment today many Wall Street analysts believe that the company wouldn't be able to meet its obligation in recent weeks several vendors reported that Sears had missed payments to them\nAnd it doesn't matter who they destroy there's no negotiating with these people it is their way or the highway\nI had trouble watching it a couple of weeks ago the Kavanaugh hearings on we'll go to tie the some of the civil war now even though it's my job as a talk show host to watch that circus they didn't really care about that woman\nNot really she was used as pawns senator Booker because those on your side would have ignored a conservative woman with the same charges against a left this man and you were accomplices and the media would barely cover it\nNeed I mentioned hub Kathleen Willie ...\nOwns Anita Broderick and more some new hope remember some of these names and these women weren't on the left so it doesn't matter they accuse President Clinton if you don't know of all kinds of a sexual assault\nThere just these women are just road kill on their way to power the absolute hypocrisy of people like Cory Booker talking about sexual molestation\nI'm surprised we didn't have another Spartacus moment didn't he admitted in an op paid or something sexual misbehavior or the self righteousness of Kamala Harris or the other phone is on the panel\nThey talk about taking the moral high ground these hypocrites have actually reach new lows let alone the moral high ground every time I think they can go no lower he break new ground that's the kind of works a kick out of new ground\nTell me how you're able to contain herself I I had trouble containing myself during those weeks that week whatever ... more than a week actually with the delay eight six six Ninety red eye eight six six nine seven three thirty three thirty nine\nThese people disgust me I Can't watch or listen to them Kavanaugh was not even my first choice to get the nomination but it wouldn't have mattered\nThey could have picked for example the pope\nAnd he's a leftist but they would have been against him if President Trump had appointed him\nWhy in heck did they even need hearings or further FBI investigations when they announced how they were going to be voted with the very few exceptions answer to soccer and people like Jeff Flake\nTalking about I'm sure people says I'm not the only one to talk about being named correctly by the way\nHe said he would vote for cabinet are having a he was all set to but it did you see this as a woman confronted him in the elevator and he admitted that was part of the reason he was for an additional FBI investigation Jeff Flake is a fool\nThis delay did not unite the country as he suggested or placate the Democrats it further divided us this was all a show to delay the process so they can get in power Lindsey Graham had it just right\nThis is all about power\nAnd I could take it more easily if they just said what they felt hey we just wanted to let you guys because we want to get in power and then you can't have the Supreme Court judge one I Wish they would it be honest about that\nBut there are a bunch of phony Hippocratic\nHypocritical leftists they discussed me\nTell me what you think an eight six six Ninety red eye but it's worse than that because we have now taken away one of our most basic rights the presumption of innocence you can charge anyone I said this before with any crime you want and you don't even need to have ... evidence it doesn't matter if they're innocent you\nCan still ruin their lives and there are no consequences for the ...\nBecause you have to prove they did it with mouse if they didn't intentionally do it then they get away with this do you remember I don't know if you remember this Reagan sector labor I think it was secretary Donovan that's the name that comes to me\nHe was asked after it was found innocent after he was accused of I don't even remember what it was they said something like what are you going to do next\nAnd he said something like\nWhere do I go to get my reputation back\nAnd some like Feinstein senator funds have the nerve to question Kevin O's belligerence and demeanor at the hearings what was he supposed to do some in Feinstein after you've helped destroy his life act ever so serene as you ruined his life I wouldn't have to let them it\nWears his bank account for all the good work he's done for all these years later\nHow did Bill Clinton stay as president after what he did with the complicity of use Senator Feinstein and others in the Senate those hearings were not a good week for America and I wanted to know what you think because it relates to my whole point about civil war\nI Want to know what you think eight six six Ninety read I matched with Christine for I'm getting a chance you guys hear me I was on another show a few weeks ago so I'm getting this off my chest the second time I'm very fortunate I Do I think she was attacked\nYes she appears credible in that regard did judge Kavanaugh commit that attack I doubt very much\nEspecially since no one could corroborate her story I when I say I think she was attacked I don't know exactly what happened and whether some of this could have been in her imagination because there are a lot of inconsistencies\nIn her story she doesn't actually got there how she got home when it was exactly why she didn't tell others at the party or anyone else for decades after that\nSo now as I said have we reached the stage where all you need are allegations\nSo what's to prevent hundreds of people from now on making accusations and stalling every nomination they don't want and ruining everybody's reputation in the process\nNow there's going to be no way to get off this merry go round just accused of cues and accused\nIt's a new Democrats strategy that has not worked thanks to Senator Flake and Murkowski flick at least voted for it\n[noise] but Murkowski didn't I think she I think there's some movement to recall her and she needs to be recalled\nThe rest of bills fools who allow this process to take place looked by the way that sleazy lawyer what his client claimed about Kevin our same can be yours would the flick of your cell phone do the Democrats as I said last hour understand where all of this is going\nTo remember Harry Reid starting the nuclear option with the judges and now we can just do a fifty fifty one\nAnd yet the reaction did you hear the reaction of the righteous\nSenator Feinstein as a quote it showed him to be aggressive in bowling is with Joe Biden said he witnessed a degree of invective blind rage and Bruce partisanship that threatens not only the Senate and the Supreme Court it threatens the basic faith and fairness and justice that binds the country together\nAnd see kidding that's a Democrat play book and Mitt Romney or another genius I mean I was a delegate for them by the way I've got to make and full disclosure he announced the support the decision to wait a week another example of why he lost he doesn't know how to fight these people and that's a point do you have to know how to fight them\nWas going to ask you your least favorite person that you watch during that week and perhaps senator Mazie her on her own or however you surname my top your list the specially after comments that men should just shut up\nShe and she by the way a week or so ago she was asked if she was confident Democrats didn't strategically leak Christine forms accusations against capita just days before a committee vote\nI think it was here's a quote are you confident the Democrats didn't leak that letter and how to respond to senator Graham's charge that it was inappropriate for the Democrats to refer to a doctor for a referred to a lawyer hosts George Stephanopoulos asked her own on ABC's This week\nAnd what a chance of she spelled spotted all of these things called do not focus on what we should be focusing which has the credibility of judge Kavanaugh she responded before calling Kevin O's claim some political conspiracy against them bizarre\nShe didn't answer and stuff like that to me and her and she goes on and by the way even as all of these accusations about this being politically motivated being tossed around everyone acknowledges including judge Kavanaugh that Dr Ford is not being politically motivated\nBy the way she her own has suggested Kevin did not deserve did you catch this he did not deserve due process because of his outcomes driven conservative legal philosophy that is very clear again if you're on the right\nYou don't want to serve the process of being a a a proven guilty just the accusation is not\nSo she may not have been politically motivated for what you used her you and your masters in deception used her\nThis is all just crazy and I I Love what Graham said he's going to get to the bottom of its suggesting that someone then find science officer wanna Ford's attorney\nMay have been responsible for strategically delaying the leak deploying to link the harm Kavanaugh's chances\nAre it's just amazing as he said those actually Senator Hatch so this the goalpost moving never stops\nAnd here's my summation and then we'll take your calls the only force is the way you and your cronies conducted the circus\nAnd maybe the ... to cross the ACLU the American civil liberties union yeah right they chimed in because they to her left this group before they our civil liberties group and so they came out against this nomination and I quote\nThe ACLU is board of directors deeply concerned by the allegations raised in recent weeks has made a rare exception to his longstanding policy and voted to oppose the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh they passed a resolution stating they oppose the confirmation of judge Kevin of the Supreme Court there aren't credible allegations\nLook into any great business whether it's a manufacturer or a hotel a store\nLook into each and every one of them and you'll find the same thing\nGrown

I'm really afraid of that happening there's not like we're the poll showed that you know that the Trump was gonna win any one it's so it's it's possible but that's why I'm saying time a little bit of a lot of people going out\nAnd then they don't expect to go out because the Democrats are motivated but they hate President Trump they hated Kevin all they want no part of this\nAh ... the coming out

Bush and you know they thought Al Gore had one in Florida which when they did the results I I think in the newspaper editorial boards or whoever did it and only one even came out for Gore and even that was assuming the absolute best scenario for him\nThese people just say if it's possible they Donald Trump that much more\nAnd that's why you have the resistance that's why you had a soft coup in the U.S Justice Department and with the FBI\nAt the top echelons where these guys were a lady and that page and so on and they were text each other when they set up a Carter Page\nA two for the you know that he was if you watch him that he was a spy with the Russians and he was in on the Trump campaign trying to you know uh make sure that the Hillary last I mean all incredible what these people are up to\nThey literally were acting like a banana republic\nAnd try to take the election away from President Trump\nThese people angry but if you get out there and you vote there's this gives me a lot of hope and it should give you to Charlie in Nashville drunk with a more\nYeah a good show are you\nComparing it to the civil war and that was just saying if you if you don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it\nAnd I think\nAt least waves where I went to school but they don't teach the real division of the country in the civil war or one side won a slave outside didn't and Lincoln's he wrote you know you get into the real civil war there's a lot of the Beijing a lot of different issues that were divided the nation\nAnd we're at that point now\nAnd ...\nJust saying that but there's a way the Republicans can win and if you look at the map if the Republicans can get eight nine percent of the black vote the country will be\nTotally read for for the rest of this country's existence\nI mean if you look at Florida if you look at those key states where there where the black vote really swings to the Democratic side that's all we have to do is get that and the Democrats play they they go after the black vote\nBy offering you know public housing\nAll kinda entitlements and\nAnybody can see that it would be better to make eight hundred a week then to get eight hundred a month assistance and that's that's what we that's what Republicans need to preach in poor neighborhoods and that's my comment and I'll listen to your results of their ...\nWell you said a very Well Charlie I appreciate it two things come to mind one that's why the Democrats so anxious with illegal immigration 'cause they win usually in that category are in fact that always bothered me when Karl Rove and\nGeorge W. Bush the seven oh you know they'll get forty percent they can get up to forty percent of the Hispanic vote and I thought oh forty percent you still lose every time but you're on to something really significant which is the black vote and President Trump they said Romney got six percent I think Trump got eight percent\nOr if we start to get more of the black vote on the Republican side the Democrats are in huge trouble because they've counted on that Ninety percent Ninety three Ninety five sometimes you know what I buy my God I think it was way up there they count on that\nIf ever they lose an interesting percentage and that even in the Jewish population they they started to go the other way they are Republicans now started I think at twenty five thirty percent [noise]\nThey're in trouble ... big trouble as you suggest that\nIf they can't count on of those votes and they shouldn't shouldn't get those votes the Democrats have controlled every city just about every major city every major school district and think about the last thirty forty years how the schools have\nA function of how well they've been doing I'm saying in a in the opposite direction they're not doing well or how well our cities are doing\nAnd you come to the conclusion one of the Democrats done and the people living in the inner city and that's a real issue if ever the Democrats lose that vote there in huge trouble and Donald Trump as many\nYou choke I and I was and then just right away I knew right away this last year so far I mean she just from outer space honestly she she enemy right away as like you know fifty seven\nYou know you get to all people and it's like I mean she was so full of you know what I just can't believe anybody could have believed ... to ...\n\nWell a lot of people thought she was credible 'cause you you know she had that child like voice and she's seen sympathetic and I can I be sure that none of this happened I'm I'm not even talking my camera I Know\nWhat I'm saying can I be sure that she was an attack by someone could chief fantasize that all that stuff maybe [noise]\nUm yeah it's suspicious but a lot of people don't want to talk about it for many years to come so\nIt's just unclear I who you know I I Can't be sure that you make of that stuff up\nMore well you know you you saw a picture of her ... year book and she\nLooked I looked like a ... a nice kid like an awesome young child young girl and you think of something or and a half and you think she would have been\nOn it like you know like the next day that night she would have probably told somebody [noise] um so I think it's just about to me I mean just seem right away a bunch of nonsense\nYeah but you know it's hard to read someone's motivation and many people say been through that that you don't want to say anything to embarrass you feel guilty whatever I just try to be fair on this thing ah someone got me on the on the national show that I was on and said mark look at you saying she was credible well [noise]\nI don't know I I just trying to think of what the average person\nSex funded to seven nine six four or five that's F.

don't know if I ever said this to you guys so I Love taking calls because I was a talk show host and sorry talk show listener before I was a talk show host\nSo I Know what it's like and in fact I never told this I Would think I call the talk show host uh once and I was nervous that was tough in our two and a till you get on you to know when you were going to be on to that is doing very well let's go to Mike in milk Peters California Mike you're on with mark\nThanks for taking the call yeah thank you for taking the call you know I'm driving home and I just got home and what I'm thinking is you know I'm not a lawyer but\nI think most people understand the statement I'm sure you do there is a letter of the law\nAnd then there's the spirit of the law and in both ... and what you have is what the law says and what's practice commonly in the course we all know and what the law is supposed to create\nAds you know the way we look at the overall picture of any type of legal potential legal situation and what we basically it seems to me pretty simple you got to minors a\nFresh from what I read said she was sixteen and he was Seventeen every time my buddy growing up\nGot in trouble or my those relatives thank God I just kept me in line didn't get too much trouble but you know they look at what miners do and they are still the record or they they they they do what they call its budget they raise the bottom line is that\nA lot of that is the sitter\nOr by the judges or games out there with players ... ... this was this it on and then what did they end up doing with their lives so as soon as they're Eighteen they're record of it she never claimed right there's no physical evidence and so there's no physical ...\nIt was processed it brings in the law even as a minor so there was nothing committed as a lighter that record\nAnd he's a minor but yet they race things minors to deter serious you know they they race what liners do in the area a burglary robbery grand theft auto type things\nAnd she explained anything you know other than what she said but to me there isn't it and it's clear they're both miners liquid he went on to do and accomplished in which al hard he worked in his life\nAnd he he always show class he never got his friends or anybody to bring up her past\nSo you know maybe she's got a spotted Jagger that maybe she does it but he never talked about bringing anybody on board it talked about how she ate in high school or machine hung out with\nA stake you know it it's very obvious what's happening which ... and you know that's that's my comment there minors\nThere's not enough to anywhere in this ah they're minors deal with everybody else does and the court system and the county all later the federal courts when it's minors involved what ... what do you do with what they do all the wreck and by the way he had no record so that's like that's what I call it\n... el ...\nSure Mike ... that's ... ... ... you brought up a lot of great points look\nThere's a new program that Obama certainly encourage the law was passed where the Florida a shooter murder or a man a program where they didn't want it to go on high school kids on the records of high school students even if they got in trouble which is one of the I think there was thirty five thirty six incidents I don't even remember\nWhere they would have found that he had a problem but there is a program to make sure that people can live their lives and not let you know ... or something here or something they're getting the way of them being successful\nHe had nothing even this I suggested in who knows what really happened even if he was part of it in some way these high school kids as you were talking about these were minors and what about us thirty some odd years where he is he's a bank account of all the good stuff he did well\nIt wasn't a now that if you just look as you said about the spirit of the law of the letter in law\nHe really wasn't guilty of anything but it didn't matter what the Democrats were up to they were just trying to stall has to make sure he didn't get on the Supreme Court they have this feeling that maybe if they won the Senate which they're not going to do more uh you know they could make some difference in who the nominee was and I don't think that's going to happen", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "city":
