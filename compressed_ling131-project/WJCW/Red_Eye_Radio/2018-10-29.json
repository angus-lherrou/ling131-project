other other social media he was posting just horrendous stuff about Jews in particular there was one group highest see a Hebrew immigrant aid society that does resettle immigrants Jews and people of all of them all countries all religions\nBe that's not the debate anymore it has been\nThe debate even up to you know ten Fifteen Twenty years ago but the debate has changed as you've just brought up right before the top of the hour the political divide now is we don't believe in America yes we don't believe in the first amendment to the constitution\nAnd\nThis goes to the point of how you sell taking away people's rights we talked about McCain Feingold that really started in the late Nineteen nineties which was we need to get money out of politics which was always the dumbest thing in the world Democrats aren't talking about that are they especially with better when Texas\nNow they're in fact applauding better do forgetting you know tens of millions of dollars raised right\nTaking the money out was dumped ... was was a concept that wasn't going to happen to begin with but\nIt got to the point is we know McCain Feingold we need to limit speech of groups groups shouldn't be advertising because it might be able to influence an election where they're supposed to be\nThat's where we got to the point of the dumbest ... the slogan ever from the left corporations are people nobody said they were\n\nOf course corporations aren't people corporation is a set of laws set up by government to regulate business if you're a citizen or a group of citizens that gets involved in that you don't lose your free speech rights and the story that's when I looked at it and said wow it's\nThat's an easy sell because you had McCain that agreed with it and then you had George W. Bush signing you and I both have the same opinion back then what are you doing\nYou don't get to dictate who was free speech and who doesn't oh you are defending the corporations I'm not defending anybody I'm defending free speech either we have it or we don't\nThat to me going back to and that's why I say roughly Twenty years ago that to me was the beginning of the push to say that the constitution had it wrong\nWell we've seen our free speech as a as has gone to right we we've seen the beginnings of\nNew York city human ah New York city human rights council\nA you don't use the right gender pronoun or will find you out of business California well yeah OK jailed times in the law or you're not going to actually put him and I'm sure they don't let it wasn't going to put it in the law and it's going to put it in in in in the law and so we talked about you know that we've talked about the first time we've talked about free speech\nThe left does not believe in free speech they don't believe in freedom of religion we've talked about the different you know a Baker cases floors cases\nAre out there\nAnd as most people in America believe look what you want to do behind closed doors but I don't care what you want to do with your life don't force me to believe it now the left wants you wants to force you to do it remember when Obama became\nPresident oh no no no come on I mean Obama Care now this is going to be find no we're not going to force or anybody who is religious to do anything against what they wish to what to do oh contraception contraceptives yeah we're going to force you to do this we knew it all along\nSo you look at freedom of the first amendment they don't believe in that anymore they don't believe in freedom of speech I don't believe in freedom of religion Second Amendment they want gone\nThey believe is antiquated and as we as seen now\nAnd this comes from the identity\nPolitics ... created and nurtured by the Democrat Party are there to the point now of as we saw during Cavanaugh a woman is always to be believed\nDue process doesn't matter when a woman makes the allegation everybody knows that's total garbage every case is on the evidence if you came out and said you believe now there should be a presumption of innocence and we should have due process\nYou were called every name in the book you were called a gang rape enabler ... that's where the political divide\nIs in this country then we'd go even further with the election of Trump and the election and and what happened with cabinet that now the left is promoting and we're seeing the beginning of this\nAnd it's and it's spreading now go to social media and see how many people on the left are picking it up well you know yeah the electro college was wrong and now so is the Senate the Senate is wrong we shouldn't have it set it anymore and we shouldn't have the electro college which again\nTo me there is no compromise on those issues why\nBecause I understand why they were created they were created to protect individual rights that the left used to care about\nWe've often talked about the ignorance of the people in this country especially on the left when it comes to understanding the constitution which they don't even want to seemed to understand what\nSo ever but we live in a constitutional republic not a direct democracy and there was a reason for it\nIt was sold the majority could not rule over the minority it was so individual rights could be protected but the majority could not rural your constitutional rights invalid that's why we live in a constitutional republic\nThey don't care and so now the political divide is not how much a government should provide to every body or how much the transfer of wealth should\nBe\nNow the left has moved into the political divide is Ben we don't believe\nIn the United states we don't believe in individual rights we don't believe in the first amendment we don't believe in the second amendment we don't believe in due process under the law\nWe only care about what we want and however we obtain it including tearing down the constitution of the United states if we had the power to\nDo so where's the compromise if you sit in our seats where's the compromise on that well there isn't any there isn't any so there's going to be a political divide and it's going to be fierce and it's going to be passionate\nWell and that's always going to be the case and and right now the reason that it is a the the debate is so fears is because of the importance of those items\nThis is why you seen the Republican Party has been jailed especially since the Kavanaugh thing but I think the the Kavanaugh thing was was not just about the cabinet process or the lack of respect for the process\nI think it was an eye opener for a lot of those that were in the middle I think it was an eye opener for Lindsey Graham\nBecause\nYou and I had a one time during a pre show meeting during all of that after it happened we were like I said wow\nWho knew Lindsey Graham huh but you had Lindsey Graham actually say during that are passionate speech talk about the process during sort of my or and Elana Kagan's confirmation\nThan what the discussion was about\nBut I think for a lot of them they live inside the bubble they don't see it as we see it every single day they followed the rhetoric but they don't follow it like we do certainly they they fear things and they see things but now they were ... people were getting in their face\nNow it had come to their table right there on the committee\nThat they saw it with a Senate majority leader basically being chased down in an airport they saw it with what Ted Cruz and it wasn't just protester groups\nThat kind of behavior had reached the Senate chambers\nI think it was an eye opener for them to put it on perspective and say well yeah of course it was bound to reach\nOur table it was bound to get here ultimately and it has and that was the real threat because forget about the the the the protesters and and and all of those who are shouting at the faces of people\nYou've had the endorsement of that behavior since Maxine Waters and even before that of others saying it's okay uh Don Lemon saying oh it's it's comes with the territory you should expect this\nBut then they go further you know we need more of this Michael Moore just the

so just having a discussion on the political divide from\nOur point of view and and wide exist today and and it's just it's a reality of what we what we live with a we're not the first ones\nTo live the political divide in this country and we won't be the last the only difference in the political divide now is it's not a political divide anymore as I can see it\nBased on the fact that we as a nation need to provide more to the people with a bigger federal government under the constitution but now it's a belief on the left\nThat the laws and the constitution that we have to protect individual rights and the minority\nDon't matter anymore and so you know we we talked about capping off the caravan also brings not just illegal immigration or into the forefront but it brings in the concept of sanctuary cities mhm and I still believe that the Republicans have failed miserably to capitalize on this\nBecause yeah science or you think about sanctuary cities just the belief\nThat in a legal immigrant criminal\nAnd their freedom is more important than the\nThe rights and security of American citizens\nThat's the point that isn't brought up enough what you hear is sanctuary cities well we need to protect these people ... what are you doing you're not protecting just illegal immigrant you're protecting the illegal immigrant criminal\nThat's ... ... by the way that's actually why it's news\n\nYeah it's it is not you know this is the ... you I think the the situation in California where you had a city's come out and and go after the state for sanctuary state\nPolicy and the\nThe concerns that were issued at those all those events surrounding that and it's still going on it'll be ... that will be an interesting legal battle by the way uh to watch in the coming years um\nBut that threat is is very real when you talk about your cities' leaders are you're counting or your state leaders saying we're not here to protect you\nI mean that goes beyond think about the empty political but the political promise the promises over the years\nWe're going to be tough on crime we're really going to work to improve things that some people actually were able to get it done\n\nBut those empty political promises people usually scoff at this is quite the opposite\nIt's not just a political promise it's an in your face action by the government that says we are not\nHere to serve you and your safety interests were here to serve the safety interests of someone who doesn't belong here who was not a citizen\n\nAnd so I think it's important where the political debate has because many people are falling into the political debate has become the back and forth on social media every tweet let's analyze it back and forth who had the worst insult who made\nWho who who made a the the social media statement that could be perceived as a little bit more violent than the other person even though it really wasn't violent and even if they were getting around and we're like let's talk about what really the political divide in this country is really about\nWhat is the substance of the political divide\nRight and I believe from my point of view that's that's what I fear\n\nI fear a loss of liberty I fear a loss of the protection of the uh minorities\nIn this and and and I mean across the board I'm Talking about constitutionally speaking ... the the reason we live in a constitutional Republican not a direct democracy\nAnd that's why the call to get rid of the Senate and the call to get rid of of of ah the electoral college even if it's not going anywhere it shows the intent of where the left wishes to do when\nYou see sanctuary cities when you see open borders when you see their leaders promoting lawlessness\n\nPromoting it yeah that's when

analyzing it what it is let's head right back you would go to ray a in Birmingham, Alabama should me Randy Randy Hi you're on the Radio Welcome to the show Hi Randy\nThank you sir I my my opinion is is that the last is trying to take us to take the United states to the point of failure and I believe that the United states falls that you know where's the rest of the world going to stay in\nWhere the where the savior of the world ... if if we're not there page a problem happens in the world we are there what happens\nKnow you you make a a you make a great point and uh I remember when I first started running for president people wonder if you'd be an isolationist mhm he wants to back off he doesn't want to get involved he's been president noted states now he probably has projected us power\nWithout you know any type of major war better than any president I've known yeah in\nIn in my lifetime ... you know projecting it I guess maybe you can make a case for Reagan because of the the the the Cold War or a different thing Reagan ... post Cold War say let's go post okay for sure but if it's I don't think it's unfair because I was totally different situation when you look at the Cold War that exist there but post Cold War\nUh I I think he's actually he hasn't been an isolationist I think he understands that even though we don't want to get involved in everybody's business you've got to project American Pie\nAnd I believe that he has why they want to do it is an interesting case I Do think that you have\nFor example you have left us professors that are sitting there in their think tanks and talking about how we need to be you know global citizens and how the United states needs to you know needs to go away and to become part of a Europe or whatever but I think when it comes to comes down to the average person it's not that complicated\nI think they're not getting into theoretical political discussion leftist discussions\nI think it's about the fact that they get into the tunnel vision and say oh we didn't ... Kavanaugh's in we can't have Kavanaugh get rid of the Senate\nWell uh it's probably time Trump trust president probably get rid of the presidency um get rid of the electoral college at the we get rid of the electoral college we can't have a ... if we lose the electoral vote and win the popular vote we can't have that\nAnd and and it is pretty much the solution to everything from the white oh that didn't go away we'll get rid of that\nSo I don't I don't know if I don't believe that the average liberal running around who was outside of university\nOr liberal think tank is going through that process of saying we wish to all be global citizens I Know that's promoted\nBut you see the most will do those kinds of comments mostly come from university\nAh type people I think it's the average liberal politician out there since er and says I Want to win the election next election what can get it for me open borders well I really don't want to open borders but I Want as many illegal immigrants to come in because if we claim that if we claim that we care about them than if they can get citizenship will get their vote\nWell and that's it it it's you know if we can it if we can uh pose as people as the side that cares the fact of the matter is is they only care about again their side the things that they want they want to completely do away\nWith the foundation of the nation they want to\nDo away with this with the with anybody who disagrees with oh we want free speech but only free speech\nFor the things we agree with her I [noise]\nWell that's not what free speech is about\nFree speech is about the stuff you don't typically\n[noise]\n\nIs Cesar ... radio on Westwood One [noise]\nBe a part of the conversation by calling the shell row tell a hotline at eight six six nine zero seven three three three nine red eye radio and shell row tell us what matters is inside\nAttention owner operators you tired and chasing empty promises RSVP is looking for you to join the routine offering a dollar Seventy five per mile for drivers or two dollars per mile for teams\nAre asked me Pete he's all miles that had him back home or not in their vocabulary they're nuts Raymond rentals needed some secrets are I think the today aimed at eight RSVP three six five that's a A R asked me Pete three six five four apply online ...

view he has to be\nTo hear how we ... started the black ... yeah [laughter]\nAh you had the the group of a of a black Trump supporters last week hundreds of the meat ...\nNow I don't know I don't know whether he's got it you know whether the in the midterms you'll get a couple more percentage of blacks black still overwhelmingly vote for Democrats we all know that but the fact is imagery\nThe imagery and it's growing each and every day\nWhether it's Kanye West coming out or or some of the biggest conservatives supporters right now and Trump supporters in this country are blacks\nIt may not be a world wouldn't have change at the moment\nBut the fact is getting media coverage\nAnd the more that comes out more the more blacks to stand up and say I like Trump and I don't believe he is a racist they can't have that on the left that is not permissible\n\nYou and I've always said on um you know Trump or racist how many years has anybody ever have an allegation of him being a racist\nAnd business ever know\nAnybody who's ever worked for ... you know you saw a number of people that were in fact he was at a resort when he was\nCampaigning twenty sixteen and you had people that stood up you know from all ethnic backgrounds and said he's crate boss to work for\nYou know they\nIn in in Chile started working you know for things\nHow many how many and see a A N double ACP awards did he went right\nNow he was praised across the board the liberal left love Donald Trump up until the time he decided to run for president and promote things like tightening the borders lowering taxes\nYeah no they loved him\nHe was well it still is on most everything that he's done is well within the mainstream of American politics as you pointed out many times but that doesn't that doesn't matter no he's an extremist and we must label them as such\nThis will be the tactic for you know it hasn't been the tactic by the left or for many years on presidential candidates but it's going to be the ... it's the tactic by the left on on pretty much everything now\nAnd we address this last week I don't like a lot of Trump's rhetoric and I don't think it's needed I don't think it's needed to win but I Know it's part of his personality\nI hate to say it but as ... as the great conservative political pundit Shashi said\nRemember during the campaign or was it after the campaign and it was after the campaign loves messing with people's heads yeah we're from queens we messed with people right now I don't like it because I think that on so many issues he has the when\n\nAnd he doesn't have to get personal well and ... in ... in in a lot of the rhetoric right order in order to get to when we talked about this in great depth last week got some complaints on it that's fine\n[laughter] welcome to talk radio but it's not needed\nThe instant satisfaction of somebody on their side was mean so you can be mean back and you get that instant enjoyment stop but we don't need\nEspecially with the wins that this president is getting that the other Republicans haven't been able to get or weren't willing to take on in years right\nLet the wins do the talk\nBut I understand but I've come to realization of\nOf who he is although I did see some ... or somebody in social media are posted well you can't no longer look at them and said the rhetoric is acceptable because he has good policy\nWon't know\nActually you can and you can also say for all of his rhetoric um\n[noise] look at the opposition mhm look with the choice was what was the choice mhm the angel Hillary yeah\nAngel death ... was it like I said it's [laughter] about stop that rhetoric [laughter]\nExcept grim reaper [laughter]\nBy the way she said she would like to be president but she isn't going to run in two years on I saw that headline over the week yeah mainly because she knows that the the left is going to call her outlook they're done with her they're done with the establishment left or whatever you want to call it\nNo no no how much else it won't be long before possibly but it won't be long before they're done with a Casio Cortez and O'Rourke\nWithout work it's gonna be November seventh button [laughter] another said might be a little bit longer but it's but this is they did this in Georgia sex remember\nYou know the the race there oh he's the next he's the face of the party okay for any of your Democrats without Googling it tell me who he\nWas\nThey don't because that's that's they move on they're done with you a tomorrow because you're going to be the oppressor tomorrow\n[noise] well I got to be what's wrong with high the nation to I did hear and he's a I heard him say no but I did hear he was asked that question even when he loses taxes will you run for president right in twenty twenty so overworked may still be around for a little bit yeah we'll see\nYou know run for president ... who else who else is there did did\nA warrant kill her chances yeah she's done by the way I what is it one of the DNA places\nI don't know whether they did this after\nThat whole controversy but I keep seeing people\nWho say I you know went to you know what's my DNA dot com whatever in a Senate my sampled got it back and I'm Nineteen percent Native American mhm there's two different commercials I've seen where they're Native American I'm thinking to myself it's just a coincidence\nYeah\nJust a total coincidence or do they make the ads after Elizabeth Warren\nUh my wife and I both did ours and mine came back a dude you're middle aged white guy of European descent did you really need to spend the Seventy bucks on this now have you done it yeah\nSee I I have no I have no interest I just don't care yeah I Do I think it's a fascinating thing but it didn't tell me anything I didn't already know are already done my homework before that I Know a lot about my family tree where are you part Native American negative okay\nI mean we have some and the lineage but it is oh I had asked a question literally is down to like one or two a people that I've been able to find in the history you know moving to to what became America One out of one thousand twenty four\nProbably not even that yeah no no\nIt's basically a white European guy that is what actually sat white European do so the euro centric theme of the show tomorrow will be well\nIt's you know here's the thing is that um I I think that ultimately the the left is\nGoing to ask her you know whatever happens a week from tomorrow\n[noise] uh they ... let's say they win the house a week from tomorrow okay we've got the

I really need the rhetoric willing and well you didn't you Willie ... we've\nHad crazy people in our society deranged an evil people in our society for quite some time\nThat's not sure it will do so saying that it's getting to this point and that's the cause of\nAnd then Pittsburgh that's the cause of the person mailing the the devices through\nYour email you just said we're becoming hyper partisan you're against it and you become hyper partisan\n[noise] I don't mean to be hyper partisan and I don't mean to viola I'm saying is LA we're we're not all ... I Want to less than ... very reads about what were your brother I Want to your nails\nAll right I Want to address one thing that you said that nobody wants to open borders I Would disagree with that tell me one Democrat\nWhat their policy is in ... in any of that\nIllegal immigration plan to secure the border tell me any of them that have said\nThat this is our plan and we need to have border enforcement and we need a because you'll hear a lot of we need comprehensive immigration reform but they'll never get into the specifics of what should be included in that comprehensive immigration reform when it comes to border control\nWhat you have you on you you ... what you have a right now you think about this ... as being blamed for the caravan\nLook you can play it in ...\nThe ... being blamed for the Asia is being blamed that he doesn't care and the and the and the point is because he said we're going to stop and that the border and Democrats are saying no they all should be able to get through because they're only looking for the American dream and that's what's fair\nWell then at that point it was nice rare but if you believe that as the mainstream now the Democrat Party believes you may be a liberal and you may say you disagree with it but it's what your party now endorses\nThey may not you know they may not use the term open border but that's what they mean go ahead I'm Sorry go ahead\nIt is it is unfortunate that that\nPerception of the Democratic party has now collaborated but I I Would I Would venture to tell you that no president in the past three or four administrations has deported more illegal immigrants ...\nHe deported more immigrants than any President Trump Bush Clinton Reagan none of them\nOkay and look I I don't know why I Love to know what I hear leaning Democrat okay launch open borders okay one day here's here's your line here or there if we want safety here here's a point I Want\nI mean we we can debate the numbers some other time but let's say that's absolutely true and nobody ... deported more than President Obama then why is Trump being demonized for believing the same thing that Iraq Obama believed\n\nIt things are hyperbole ... has\nA little bit less than ... than Obama did when it comes to his language\n... and the way he talks about the way he talks about it not ... not what he wants to do nothing subtle evil art against what he wants to do that where you're trying to say\nOh I'm trying to say is that it seems to me\nOr as someone who is your brother is your fellow American citizen and I love you and I have a ton of conservative friends Republican friends we're all brothers we're all brothers what I'm saying is that\nIt seems to me that Trump and the way he characterizes people who are\nNeed and if you

we'll get ... more people saying this because they do every time both sides are responsible for creating the type of rhetoric that causes these shootings I Would disagree with that but are they what happens after we had the shooting\nAnd and I go back to O. wild when I first became a talk show host in the nineties there were a lot of the shootings at that happened I I Will say this that\nThe ... from my experience sitting in my chair and I'm not going to say it's a dumb argument to get in well both sides do it well you know you'll be able to find both sides who do it you're going to ... when you have tens of millions of people in each political party yeah somebody from both sides are going to try to make political hay out of something\nBut what does the media what does the mainstream media and when you get to more official politicians off of social media what happens when there's a shooting almost immediately the left comes out and starts talking about gun control\nIt happens I mean it's it's right away they don't even ... it's ... not one day or two days it's the same it's at press conferences from local officials\nBefore we even know what happened in any incident it is immediately\nPoliticized\n[noise] uh\nAnd then you will have from what I normally seen that could be exceptions to the rule but what I normally seen afterwards is then when the right gets involved and starts talking about the second amendment ... and then that debate goes on\nAh to sit and discuss what rhetoric may dry but\nA mass\nShooter to do what they want it's I guess on your part it would be a guest on my part none of us know\nYou don't know what sets off people and so to say we need to tamp that we need to temper the rhetoric across the board a ... I think we\nBut uh as conservatives because I think we can win every issue without doing so I understand why the left and I understand why some people on the right do it I disagree with that but I understand why they do it the leftist nothing else to go on\nThe last caller I like I said it was really interesting he was talking about how you need to get rid of the hyper partisanship and then he went into hyper partisanship\nWell and and and saying that he doesn't know anybody that's for open borders I don't know anybody that well the fact of the matter is is that there are\nPeople out there that are calling for open borders I think we sort of convince ... and here's the thing I I Would ask you to ask those that you cited with\nAnd I mean the people running for office or that are holding office right now\nAsk them\nWhat level of enforcement on the border\nDo they believe it it's a very simple question uh\nBut we live in a nation with free speech we're not going to get rid of free speech the second amendment isn't going away free speech is going to stay\nA there is a party that was just to get rid of it ours is not that party\nWell and they're very they're working very hard right now to to do that and and if you think to the last caller if I don't think that doesn't exist then go to talk to the people of California by the way you're using the wrong pronoun there is a penalty of up to a year in jail and that law for a reason\nWhen I say ours I mean conservative I said party I meant conservative because Republicans as you remember McCain was a Republican assigned McCain or that or a sponsor McCain fined gold and Bush signed saying that he knew parts of it were unconstitutional but hold up the courts deal with it and you and I were furious when he did that so so there\nYou know if you if you think that you know you're the the colored in describing well where your brothers were you know we we tried to paint every one is as someone who thinks is him\nOn the left that's not the case\nTell me it's not extreme in New York when they say if you use the wrong pronoun we can find you up to the point that it would shut your business down\nIn California [noise]\nIt's in the law [noise] they can put you in jail for using the wrong prone now [noise]\nNow tell me that's not extreme [noise]\n\nAs soon as ... radio on Westwood One [noise]\nMister show listen anywhere at any time on demand to catch up on Eric and Gary's topics of the day visit read I radio show dot com and click on demand that's red eye radio show dot com\nIf you're farming today you know all about taking well here's one risk you don't have to take any more the risk of ID I be a maternal diesel injected deposits because now cynics ruby field messed are bringing in diesel fuel has an advanced injections stabilize or to prevent id ID so you don't have to risk injector failure\nCloud filters and downtime in more cynics ruby field masters even back when the ten year ten thousand our warranty or even less risk peace of mind powerless synergism ran to see age\n... electronics is rather than for the fight against breast cancer by partnering with bright pink and traveled centers of America and Petro stopping center to bring you the twenty nine LCD bright pink CB radio this limited edition right did CB\nRadio is helping to save lives for breast and ovarian cancer by empowering women to liberal activists for every radios old man who was making a donation device thinking the fight against cancer the breaks into the radio is available for a limited time ... travel centers of America and Petro shopping centers\nAttention owner operators you tired of chasing empty promises RSVP is looking for you to join the routine offering a dollar Seventy\nFive per mile for cello drivers or two dollars per mile for teams\nAre asked me Pete he's all miles that hadn't back home or not in their vocabulary they're no treatment rentals needed a male hidden secret how our I think the today an eighty eight RSVP three six five that's eight eight RSVP three six five four apply online an RSP P.

I Wonder how the air [laughter] you know I live in a very liberal county are not very liberal county but it's a liberal county\nIt's a blue county and the town is less blue but that's it's still you know it's it more and more is becoming and so you you just wonder I Wonder who that person is I Wonder what they think I almost want to stand out there with a microphone and and talk to them\nYou know or just do just to just know Mike flag nothing just so what are you thinking on election day\nYou know because it ... I'm always curious as to the people who do participate especially an early voting it's not just you know conservatives um it's liberals but even in our state you know it's a red state but\nYou see that participation on both sides so you wonder what they are thinking and and if I could have a conversation\nOh with a number of them just just a roundtable you have you have my mindset yesterday was such a nice day yeah I mean this is uh to me this is this is not work today\nIn the middle of a three day vacation and I just happened to be doing this today ... because it's supposed to be in the\nLike eighty today in eighty tomorrow and then it's gone so I'm pretending this is like a long weekend and I just happened to come in here and want to chat with you mhm I wanted to bring in some alcohol to pretend I was staying out real late in the morning and mhm right so I took a long bike ride yesterday Fifteen mile bike ride\nAnd I did it all throughout my huge subdivision that I live in ...\nAnd as I was driving around or we're driving us I'm riding around I'm looking for one crew sign\nOne because I told you the other day I didn't think I saw once why specifically when Fifteen miles around I live in a subdivision that probably has about three thousand thirty five hundred homes I think it is relatively new\nUh south south the ... of south west to Dallas a twenty five miles southwest of Dallas or right\nBefore you get to farmlands where I live you know there's like subdivision farmland mhm but the big subdivision\nOr probably about two or three every block I Would go down every street two or three ... didn't see one crew sign and Fifteen miles driving through my subdivision and you and I asked the question is that even an effective way to spend your campaign dollars\nMhm [noise] yeah I see a number of them are in my neighborhood\nUh there's there's a few but there's just as many Ted Cruz science right now and yards and my ...\nYeah ... totally couldn't couldn't find one yeah and and but I'm driving it I'm\nGoing down I Would love to talk to these people ...\nLike if they were sitting out there and drive wages pay how you doing pull up my bike oh yeah riding the bike and then look at it uh even ... even even if I had to not to be honest intel [laughter] well and as it is and not just a volunteer information just go oh see a vote\nFor better why over Cruz no that's that's exactly the way I Would like to approach it especially at the polls just have like the ... just a roundtable discussion of people that are voting or just cast their vote a okay what do you think as you just cast your vote\nSo it would be you'd say what are you thinking not yeah so you're exactly okay what do you like\nWhat is it that is you know because it it it's different in every locale it's it's different in every precinct uh it's different you know state to state or we do have you know Democrats\nThat that when I mean Beto has won his district I mean and and can if he wants to serve in the house he can he can stay in that district I think for a long long time if he wants to\n[noise] um but there are you know again as you as you kind of wide now through the state\nI'm just curious as to what the the average every day person\nIs thinking because clearly they're active voters so there's there's that um is it a routine kind of thing it almost is routine for me but I take it very seriously and it is a very thoughtful process because I Do take it seriously\nYeah but routine there's nothing wrong with routine of means his party ... is part of the culture that you grew up right All right but I Wonder if there\nAre there's somebody will that that have a routine and it's just based on you know this is the ideology and and this is it and it's not or not even a ideology there's just no way I can vote for the other side I mean there's a number of questions that I Would have and I would sit it would probably take hours\nTo sit around just a just a regular\nYou know think of Frank lunch and the stuff that he's done you know Fox News and other years I like Frank but I always think\nHe asked the wrong questions you know why he doesn't ask the questions I Would ask\n[laughter] and and and I think in that setting too I mean these are these are people that I I Know just voted these are\nPeople that are active especially if you were to do it like in an early voting setting mhm you know it that that are active early and it's going to I Know it's going to be on both sides\nUm I Would love to see what is it that's driving you and we'll we'll see some of that I think you know after a while a week from Wednesday we'll we'll learn what some of that was\nHere's a question I Would ask in Texas nobody has even talked about the governor's race\nYeah there's really not a race they can talk about [laughter] because Greg Abbott has a roughly ... point lead over loop evolved as the Democrats a former former sheriff of ... ... and that's not even close you you don't hear\nAbout that so here's a question that I Would ask this is very interesting question you have probably a couple of hundred thousand people maybe even more that are
