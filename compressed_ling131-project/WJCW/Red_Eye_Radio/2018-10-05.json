will confront you on the elevator will anywhere and everywhere\nAs directed or I guess they encourage further encouraged by Maxine Waters\nAnywhere and everywhere it doesn't matter where you are\nWell

and someone just ran up to you and started screaming in your face\nYou wouldn't know what they're doing and you wouldn't know you don't you don't know what the threat level as the ... and and and certainly it's it's different when you were Jeff Flake and you're confronted and the way he was in you you you know why they're in your face\nBut you can't assess the threat level in public you can't you just cannot you don't know what the person is capable of doing if they're the you know they're physically harm you\nUm it's it's impossible to assess that\nSo that such security has been ramped

[noise]\nI mean China president is confident I'm only a princess speech vice president Mike Pence accused China of meddling in the U.S elections Pence also voice displeasure about a recent military into that between the two countries responded well roughly ...\nDressing a close call and the south China Sea over the weekend you're the disputed spradley islands where the USS Decatur was conducting a freedom of navigation patrol and was confronted by a Chinese warship which came within forty five yards of the American vessel\nThat is reckless harassment according to vice president saying that the U.S will not be intimidated in the south China Sea or anywhere\nThis of course there are reports the U.S is considering a global show of force which has got to be approved by the Pentagon which would send a clear message that the U.S is certainly not backing down with China on the trade issue but also on the military issue as well we'll Ripley Hong\nOf them just like a Susan Collins a Murkowski and mansion went into a room and had a meeting we don't know what was discussed but\n\nSo\nIf you've got every Republican\nOn board assuming that Jeff Flake is a yes\nThen that gets you to fifty two if Jeff Flake is a no you're still on the soft headcount you're still it's if you want with mansion with match if for some reason Manchin pulls out or Murkowski\nOr it doesn't appear that Collins will if Collins had a concern she would have issued that concern about the report saying I'm not sure we got everything at the very least she would have questions something praising the report tells me you can count on that vote\nSo right now you're looking at I mean I think at the very least fifty with vice president ...\nAt fifty one or the word from and and there was another story in the in the wall Street Journal that the you know the GOP right now is a is really upbeat about the confirmation process they you know they it's a if you look at it that the the talk right now\nIs that they're confident\nUh so you get through a\nA culture which will happen sometime during the day on friday as you mentioned Gary the process will start mid morning um but then the actual vote may not happen until later in the afternoon\nWhen by the time to get through the procedure one with the actual vote take place and then there was a third in the early hours at the clock starts starts at that point yet up\nAnd they can take 'em to thirty hours it may not take thirty hours they could end the debate before thirty hours but assuming they'll use the entire\nThirty hours and they might ah especially on a Saturday the media might give them the the news media cable news might give them\nYou know all the time of the world are so you look at the the so called hopefuls for twenty twenty your usual suspects or a warrant and all of them looking to get cameras time or the debate might you know go on the full thirty\nJust assume that it will they'll that's that's why you've got the rule assume that it will so that\nPuts it late into Saturday Night as you mentioned earlier Gary depending on where they land on the the the clock lands on the culture wrote maybe into early Sunday Morning\nBut that gives them there's the I guess the wiggle room or the enough room for senator Danes to get you know home from the wedding I guess or or back to work for\nThe wedding and uh as daughter's wedding and we wish your daughter and her\nSoon to be husband all the best uh but though he'll get back he's saying he'll get back in time for the vote so that tells us it's probably going to be a late Saturday Night but\nYou know I I I think about all the ... I'm just sitting here just contemplating and thinking of all the\nAll the protests the violence the civil disobedience when certain things you know uh when Trump was elected to you know the the women's march show all all of these things that go on\nAnd if you look over the last eight\nYears and the number of protest remember Occupy Wall street you\nKnow all all that that that the that went on all the the\nThe occupying of city properties and everything else that went on what you're seeing now\nAnd you have a party that constantly does that\nYou'll have another party that really doesn't do that at All right you see now the getting into the faces of people which can be quite intimidating but here's the question is it effective\nFor them right has it been effective in and you go all the way back like I said we go let's go back to the Obama administration I mean you can look at you can look at the uh you can look at the uh\nThe Tea Party but the Tea Party was completely and totally non non violent did not know know riots no tear gas nothing like that and\nSo you look at it and you get into the Occupy Wall Street right right where you're actually trespassing and you know taking over and wanting to camp out and you know there were riots in certain cities that that happened when the police tried to push them off\nBut at this is almost the exclusive domain\nOf the left and therefore the Democrats sure yeah and you think about the run that they have had since all of this you know really I'll I'll look at Occupy Wall street as just the beginning of of this portion of it has it been effective\nFor them when it comes to the vote do people actually respond to it or do they believe that the intimidation\nTactics will actually work and change for example they're not you know you you you could see if they might be a you know threatening\nA just a a you know the the senators that are on you know a lot of you know on the edge right now right okay on the margins but they're not they're going after everybody mhm I don't care whether it's Grassley doesn't care whether McConnell what do they really think that that's affected\nOr is it the fact that when you are just so full of rage\nBecause that's what it is it's just insane range that they're filled with right yeah just anger and and and rage\nIs it just a desperation tactic or do they actually believe that it is effective I just I I really wonder and [laughter] and I was thinking to myself here before I started talking about this I'd love to sit down and talk with them all that wouldn't be possible [laughter]\nSo I'm never going to find out because I'm not going to be able to sit down and say you don't tell us what's your strategy is that right well\nI I think after the like a thing I think they feel empowered to some extent they feel that it is effective to some extent\nBut I think it's probably a lot of I was gonna say little of both I think there's a lot of both\nActually that they believe after confronting mansion and after you know the\nBehavior in restaurants and everything else and shaming people out of restaurants I mean think about that Gary\nThat youre\nNot protesters in a restaurant you work there it's your job and you refuse in one case to do it for because Sarah Huckabee Sanders\nIs eating the food you're going to prepare and serve\nCan you imagine that can you imagine being in that ... know\nIf I worked in a restaurant\nI don't care what I was doing in that restaurant\nAnd bar rock Obama and his family came in the last thing that I Would do is refused to do my job\nMe not doing my job is not going to change his politics or change anything that I disagreed with that he did\nAnd that's the mentality but that's where they that's where they live we go back to the one restaurant where you had a man happened to be African American wearing a make America great again hat and the staff\nWas shaming him at a stable to the point that his companion I don't know if it was his girlfriend or his wife was in tears\nAnd they kept it up they kept it up they kept it up I Can't imagine I cannot imagine\nI wouldn't be able to face my friends and family if I did something so despicable just shameful just shameful if you want to talk about getting a picket going out on the steps the SCOTUS\nAs long as you're not trespassing are breaking the law I encourage that I don't care what you believe I don't care what you're promoting are protesting for or against and I remember it\nYou know we've talked about it before it's probably about seven years ago when um and and you know the person that I'm Talking about and and it was really it you know somebody who I considered it a casual friend ... you know ... do the more professionally and and and uh\nThey were in a conversation and it was a ... a black man who was a huge fan of my show now I sort of knew her politics were more of the liberal bent but she went absolutely insane we know we haven't talked since that point and she completely rejected me as a friend\nBecause in a conversation a black man said he loved our show right\nThink about that and that was really my first taste of that type of sanity\nBecause that person you refer to as you described it before I went\nFrom zero to you know basically right or just just a small talk would you have good to see a a thanks for stopping by that

run for that house seat\nUm and I have friends there that say oh man he's got his hands and everything you know so um yeah uh that's different though when you broadened it out to the rest of

the current Governor Greg Abbott um that's you know again\nHe's he's very well in the lead but well when you broaden it out to the state right level you've got to go well you got to realize that you you have to pretend you're in the middle\nWell then and that's a bit of Russia's trying to do is try and do you try to picture himself and he's not in the middle on anything no but he he realizes that

somebody done an arrest McConnell\nYeah because uh uh uh from what I understand the story Merkley had had gone to the courts before this and what do you hope what are you trying to do is get this that's why they've scheduled a hearing on Wednesday\nBuddy that was I think a move where they filed either last week or early earlier this week\nAnd then when it looked inevitable and they did of course it was inevitable on on as a Wednesday afternoon a that there was going to be a vote this week and that's when Merkley said well no no no no no because we haven't had you know our our day in court with\nThe Trump Administration the Trump Administration the executive branch does not set when the Senate is going to vote this is really weak I mean is this is the Hail Mary I mean that this is well just do but here's the thing\nYou're not going to want to miss work tomorrow [laughter]\nWell well I mean unless you put it this way [laughter] it's friday you might want to miss a little sleep during the day or at least when you get up turn every device that you own on and make sure it's connected because\nIt's only going to ramp up between now and the final vote on Saturday or early Sunday when whenever it happens\nThis is ... because you're right a couple of things here again\nThe legislative branch doesn't have the power to stop I I'm Sorry the judicial branch doesn't have the power to stop the legislative branch process right they don't get to say you know what their schedule is now if they go through\nAnd again enact a law signed a law a bill into a a ... the president signs it into law\nThey can come in and then challenged the effect of the process\nBut then outside of that as you point out dairy it's two separate branches that are working here yours suit your lawsuit should be against the Senate it's not it's against the executive branch who has no say so over the timeline of the vote on the Senate\nWell I bought buddies job but he wouldn't have there he knows there is no chance that he could go to the court and said let's stop the process because I disagree with the majority right because that that's not going to go anywhere so what he's trying to make is that there's a debate going on between the executive branch and the Senate mhm\nAnd because and the executive branch's interfering with the Senate where you can't make that point because the Senate which is the leadership of the Senate which is the Republicans have said we've got everything we want from the run and get a branch in the FBI we're moving forward and he's trying to say that the executive branch\nIs holding things up and not giving them the information well you don't get to make that call it's a minority member you don't get to go to the courts to try to override the majority in the Senate\nI really don't this is like this is like if it's like I decided to get it in the ring with a an event or Holyfield right\nAnd realize quickly that I'm greatly overpowered so I call in Mike Tyson to do my fight for me I mean this is the uh this this is like because it's basically you have a Democrat who's not getting his way\nAnd his only claim is that they're not getting documents the Senate's not getting the documents the Judiciary Committee chairman\nIs the one who rules that part of it in any vetting process and you know that this is the process but since you're not getting your way\nYou're trying to call mommy and daddy in to stop me no Trump or the amino Republicans because you disagree with it it's not going to change your vote it's going to delay the process\nBut it it won't even do that no it it well because it's it's it's not going to happen yeah uh but but I ... and I first saw it I had was anybody who understands separation of powers\nAre women that's very few people are very few people understand the separation of powers yeah\nNever mind yeah or if you want to get him we do have a line open we'd love to hear for you or from you the cloture vote
