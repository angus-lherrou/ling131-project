Facebook friends who do that all the time we never ever got into a political conversation ever on Facebook\nRight ah but I did see that you could tell that the you know that that it was in there it was in there somewhere but that's that's fine 'cause people have their political opinions and I'm fine with that we've all got our family members and friends that disagree with some politics all the time\nAgain I haven't seen ... what since we were teenagers so I I you know I don't know but like I said\nUm\nI always thought that he wrote with class this is completely classless article a it's a hit job it's unwarranted\nA it is not up at all\nTo the sport journalistic standards that I knew from Arab Brady\nWhen\nHe started writing as a local writer and then went with USA Today probably for the first you know for for the last you know Thirty years this was just an absolute hippies and and what gets me angry about this ... you know you and I've done talk radio for a long long time and sometimes we may get a little bit of overheated whatever but\nWe never really get it we've never really gotten ourselves in any trouble where we've had to apologize for anything that we sat on the air you know we're management comes in you must apologized because the sponsors are all Bailey and\nThat's because number one we don't think I you and I don't think in a kind of radical ways to begin with\nWe're not hateful people we don't hate anybody\nBut I've always said if somebody says on the radio and loses that for a little bit to me that's a little bit more understanding even if you tweet it out\nAnd it's just a sentence but right here what he did he wrote an article this was absolutely premeditated it was a premeditated hit job apparently because of the range that he feels of anything that's relating to Trump\nWell and this is you know indicative of the ... the mentality to get on the left this is just one more in a long line of people that are now just throwing everything at the cabinet nominations because they have room to do\nAnd you know how you know he's wrong and now he knows he's wrong\nBecause the editors or somebody got involved and said this goes to the opinion section you got to take out these sentences because these aren't fact based at all because he called it a credible accusation ... that's a political statement that is not a statement of fact\nNo\nAnd the the the fact of the u._s._a. today how to delete the tweet oh and then he deleted his Facebook page completely he deleted for a reason\nBecause he knew the blowback that was coming why because once he wrote was an absolute it piece on a man where there is zero evidence except for the allegation that he's ever done anything\nWrong well again they you know for them now the claim is reality\n\nAnd so this goes to not just a hippies but a hit piece on his family\n\nNot he's not capable of making unbiased decisions not we're against him because he might overturn roe v Wade\nNot anything else it\nWas a hit job directed toward his children\n\nIt involves the activities of his children ... imagine had somebody done this with Brock Obama and his daughter oh that person will be unemployed by now\nThat person would be done if they were especially if they were working for a major news organization like USA Today\nThat ... that would have been over\n\nAnd and but this is what the left sees as when this is what they see is acceptable tactics and it will continue now thanks to Jeff Place and it's not acceptable and ... knows\nWriter Erik ... doesn't care if I make sure Eric Brady knows it just so somebody says to him to the conversation they don't think I'm referring to you\nAnd they don't care they don't care it's that it's unacceptable because it's acceptable to them because anything to stop Trump and anything to stop this nomination process\n\nJust reprehensible what he did in USA Today and they wonder and then the gas that Kavanaugh was passionately defending

talked about a Lindsey Graham ... earlier and someone said you know tell me you guys are you surprised\nAnd and we said no one of the reason I wasn't surprised as when you know when you would find finds a Dianne Feinstein did mhm that she did not follow the protocol of the Judiciary Committee\nAnd she kept it secret I mean that is so against the protocol of what you do on the Senate Judiciary committee that he was livid\nAnd the fact that there is a great belief that was the Democrats that actually kept her name secret and then but trade her trust\nAnd leak the name in order to delay\nThe ... the the cabinet nominees the cabinet nomination are not nomination but the you know the the the camera being confirmed the new Kevin confirmation and then when you had the\nSenator from a a Hawaii on the Sunday Morning news show for example and this week being asked are you confident the uh this is Renault the are you confident the Democrats didn't leak the letter a she didn't answer the question right\nSo you know you don't have confidence from the Democrats that was stepping up all she wasn't on the left who was state in the other day stating oh come on I mean we all know they did it was on\nCNN it was or was it the I think a ... Jake Tapper asking the panel yeah uh that at you know the saying ... ... it's clear now that the Democrats somebody or in that party leaked right and the end to end the response was somewhat right\nAnd\nSo you you know they did it and so Lindsey Graham being on the Judiciary Committee me to then that's in\nMurray aiding because it's something that I Know Lindsey Graham has never done ... and there's a certain protocol that you're supposed to do understanding what's your role as a senator is Lindsey Graham may be at times\nA part of what was used to be ... be called the swamp ... but as we know the swamp as involved in Washington D. C. uh especially when Republicans look at it are Trump supporters look at it or even Trump looks at you know what the swamp is and\nThat's I think what are the other reasons that Lindsey Graham wishes so infuriated and why he led off at that at that point is that you know you you think about it remember first it was an immediate knowing he should be disqualified he's not qualified for this whatsoever secondly\nThey hit ... an allegation an extremely serious allegation\nFrom the Senate Judiciary committee she got word of it\nShe's the ranking member mhm\nShe's supposed to bring it to the Senate Judiciary committee or tell the woman look or I can bring the says to the Judiciary Committee but your name's events you gonna become known we keep it secret for a while but I Need to bring it to the ... committee and then we'll have the FBI do we keep your name out of it until then but at some point if you wish to continue\nThen you know we can keep it anonymous in the in the FBI in Korea but after that if you wish to continue than your name will become well known she didn't do that you know\nAnd so everything along the line of [laughter] who paid for the the ... you know a ... lie detector or the the suggestion of a law firm and everything that has gone and then you get to the point where they leak or name\nAnd\nYou know they they they link her name the people that were supposed to protect her and that's it has to drive somebody like Lindsey Graham just out of his mind as it as it did he feels he has been completely betrayed our point is you're just learning that\nNow when I was like Jeff Flake you know I I'm I'm guessing he thought at some point he was going to make friends with a lot of people on the left remember he was doing the whole to buy a thing when he announced he wasn't going to run\nYou know this isn't this isn't a the way it should be uh the politics has gotten so ugly but on friday he was being cold out and even after he decided to go to the White House basically and asked the administration request demand really\nBut he was not going to vote on the floor you would in committee but not on the floor for the confirmation\nThen as soon as that came out there were others basically on the left coming out and calling them out still\nBecause they if they believe in this to my approach it is never about working with the other side or coming together the two sides coming together it's Republicans coming\nOver to the left they don't hail Joe Manchin is somebody who is bipartisan\nHey drivers this is Gary ... burn a long road

amount of automobiles that we can allow that South Korea will law when\nBefore the terror started hitting and that's a great victory accept the fact is\nWe don't even sell ten thousand vehicles and South Korea apparently it was what six thousand ... we asked him if we hadn't even got to just to sixty percent of the original limit a that was terror free and so\nThat's what you've seen a lot of these free trade agreements you make these you make these deals you up the cap even if you're not near the cap and you claim it as a a victory\nMost of what happens in Canada and the United states will still remain free trade\nYeah with very small tears\nAre between it in the long run and we're not going to ... you're not going to change a much as we've seen you and I went over the trade deficit over the last five years last couple of years especially looking at a month to month and the trade deficit during the Trump Administration is actually higher than the average of the last five years\nIf you take the average of it now it's not a full or a you know turn the other for years to be fair but over the last ... the um if you look at it and we looked at the autographs hurts a little bit higher\nA and again that that that could change because there's always fluctuations but July was the highest in five months in earlier this year I forgot what month was January February was huge a but one of the problems is a a civilian aircraft\nUh in in July and uh also the uh uh soybeans soybeans was huge and we're not going to be able to make that up with Europe and\nAs we know the terrorists went into effect a and you have many financial publication St ... OK here comes because the Chinese tariffs have gone into effect the president knew that he had the administration knew they had until midnight ...\nIn order to get the deal possibly past\nUh you know for example in Mexico you know before the the the president the president of Mexico leaves would they believe that would be no chance after that and the other point was they had to get Canada aboard because there was no chance it was going to pass\nIf it was only between Mexico and the United states so there was pressure on both sides uh Canada's been very quiet and was reading a few articles in the Canadian media over the last couple of weeks that was stating that was on purpose they said Trump can rail all he wants we're not going to say anything anymore we're done\nWe'll negotiate where we need to negotiate but we're not going to get in the back and forth with them because they believed that fuels it ... it feels his passion and then support for what he is doing in the states so they said if he's just screaming and we're not responding\nIt brings all the rhetoric down and they said Jared Kushner was the one who helped the deal really you know get through on on what the actual deal is we don't know but we don't see any major changes in the free trade deals steel and aluminum or not included don't know why on that one\nYeah and and nothing is done until it's done and the signed agreement\nWill be the agreement or yeah because it would they haven't even worked out everything at just the ... a lot like Mexico and I and I do think that one of the things is they they said look we got we have to announce when we have to announce that we've come to an agreement to get the clock ticking on this and we can work things out over the next\nCouple of months ago right that takes it off the political table and gets behind the the number\nOne it's one of the problems as we've always said it is with the president we have no idea since he was covered every single opinion on on trade we don't know where he stands we don't know what's acceptable or what's not acceptable he's gone from a complete protectionist\nA and a much of a rhetorical\nProtectionist during the campaign\nAnd then ah he had the ability about two months ago to be on Monday a complete free trader and by the end of the week was being protectionist again and so when you hold every opinion on free trade it's tough to figure where the president stands and what this eventual free trade agreement will look like\nTax fund to seven nine six four or five that's F.
