fact that nobody is talking about the fact that Kanye West is from Chicago which is a one of the places that in ran a very orderly by the Democrats right now\nAnd that may be a motivation or its point of view um I also want to make the point that I think they're upset with the fact that\nLike you said he's a relative figure in today's society when the younger crowd yeah especially those\nIn the range that they cannot reach which are those people that are right at the age\nOf being able to vote but don't care enough to pay attention to the politics the manager I was really like that right

of African American people who have grown up with a mentality that Democrats are good and Republicans are bad and um myself I like to take things from whatever point of view I see as right I Know the difference between right and wrong it for me that's also\nThe way to go and I think that it's the same thing with Kenya west have these things that are right it's these things that are wrong\nAnd he's able to articulate and ways that people who are not listening are going to pay attention to this is socialist who are on social media constantly are gonna pay attention to this so uh the leftist just upset because Trump is when\nAh you know thanks so much I think you bring up some really great points yeah you're talking about a ... one of the things that is terrifying to the the Democrats and

Trump [noise]\nThey would have shredded her [noise]\nOh yeah and so that's you know that's what this if if if you say the other side there is something mentally wrong with you if you said Democrats

S. new pay you're going to pay because of the tariff right and then the producer at the domestic producer of a similar product because part of it is protectionism then they're going to raise the\nBecause you know they're being hurt so they're justified in raising their ... and because they can and because they can and all they have to be as a penny cheaper than the foreign product\nTo be competitive\nAnd tell me tell me why that's a positive\nAh we have stated that to all along and I do think that again the uncertainty because still today Congress completely silent ...\nAh on the uh\nTrade deal formerly known as NAFTA mhm a steel tariffs aluminum\nTariffs which adds to the base cost of how many thousands tens of thousands of products out there which as we have seen and ah and I don't know I haven't seen an update on it we know that in the first half of the year steel was forty\nPercent a we know that the trade agreement formerly known as NAFTA does not cover steel and aluminum and until there is a deal\nThe tears from what I Know unless they have made exceptions to the ruins and some of those cases still remain with Canada and Mexico\nSo you know we stayed at when we looked at the you know when when we looked at the the trade deal formerly known as NAFTA but the most part they're really much isn't much of a difference\nA you know the I saw especially on social media Trump promised to rewrite NAFTA yeah he did a little bit\nBut he didn't do anything that he planned that he said he was going to do which was I'm going to reduce them one hundred and fifty billion dollar trade deficit\nRight that this that this isn't going to do it there were little winds here or there the problem with the the new trade deal as we said that will be a long term problem is\nAnd the president views it as a victory is raising the cost or to buy a car in Mexico the United states and Canada making it more expensive to produce the car\nTherefore making it more expensive to buy a car and making it less likely\nThat the president one of the president's number one goal which is to be able to produce products here and sell them overseas has just been flushed down the toilet because it's going to be more expensive to manufacture vehicles here which is exactly the opposite if you wish to sell them overseas right\nIt's the one thing there are ... ... ... there were a couple of things but it's really the one major thing where I've no idea where the president's stance on it as we know he's changed his mind on he'll change his mind on\nOn trade in a week they'll go from as he did one for me and a complete protection is just sounded like a total free trader I've no idea where he really stands I Do know though that\nIn this in the the uh trade deal formerly known as NAFTA that he viewed what he did to raise the price of buying a car and producing a car in North America\nHe put that as as his number one victory mhm which we have said that's what drives us crazy that's why we're tariffs babies [laughter]\nThe original ... the original Tara babies as the president said now you know something we you know we laughed at it I Wonder how many farmers\nWere laughing at that comment so well because the ... you know he talks about protecting the farmers in the\nMove on ethanol which was not a mandate and likely will have little if any impact because the the the the the fuel producers\nDon't ... don't want it they don't want the higher blend the it it may sound like a good deal to be able to uh sell the Fifteen in the summer first of all here comes the lawsuit here comes a lawsuit here comes a lawsuit um but it will the but even because at the refinery level you don't have to do the special summer blend\nBut when there's no market for it than there would be a ... a glut of the product\nAnd for the consumer that temporarily my might be a good thing but the point is we're not going to get to eat Fifteen with out a mandate and he knows politically outside of the corn belt you can't get that done it too so but\nAppeasing farmers and and using that politically on on the ah on the tariffs\nAnd then they came back and said well we're going to give you billions of dollars to help you which you just admitted it's hurting them to that extent and they came back and said that's a tiny number compared to\nWhat we're ... we're losing and the fact that we're losing the ability to be in that supply chain and once we lose that and we're not dependable in that world supply chains are going to go somewhere else so it's not just the tariffs hurt us until they're lifted it's the fact that we may never get back in those markets again because these countries don't know when you'll use\nNational emergency or trade deal\nYou know or or the the the fact of of ah the we need to get a you know a new trade deal or whatever\nTo to uh to\nTo terrify so you're not there I N double anymore you're not a consistent supply chain exactly and that is a problem that the you have but uh you know we noticed that you know it was obvious that President used the greatest victory and that's the weird thing on trade to begin with countries always talk about their trade victories\nAnd their trade victories were always when their citizens have to pay more money for goods and services right we don't know how that's a victory\nRight we can't figure that one out here's one thing or to media asked that question mhm yeah I mean as an when\nWhen you look at it and you know you you talk about the supply chain Canada saying you know or Mexico saying they're going to go to Canada and work out a deal you know for poor whereas we call it Canadian Bacon\nAnd the\nWhen they set up that supply chain if they're happy without agreement why does it go back to us for\nWhat would they are with any of those products from a domestic producer if you believe that the government is going to step in and disrupt that process then you're going to make another long term deal elsewhere with someone else are we said this\nDuring the you know the um during the permit tore him after the ah when when the Gulf spill happened\nThe BP thing that\nThat whole thing where you had companies are producers from uh the U.S saying well we can go somewhere else if we're going to do offshore drilling and you're not going to give us a permit back you know we can go somewhere else you don't just make that decision short term right\nAnd so you're you're going to have to make long term plans because you can't deal with you know the the shift in policy\nOr you know on a ...\nAt the snap of finger and and frankly the ethanol thing has become you know ... for the ethanol farmers that's one thing but you look at the entire farming community and I'm Talking the political you know support if they're hurt\nGoing into and and this is what we haven't been able to gauge\nYou go to Iowa\nI mean and for those people that the New York times of listening when you go to Iowa let me describe before Iowa is is the state in the middle of the country\n\nWhen you go there it is all connected to farming just like Texas has oil directly or indirectly\nI mean that is the driver there when you go to the to the the farm belt\nThat's everything what's the impact right now of terrorists politically vote for Republicans and in twenty twenty ... at the mid term this year and in twenty twenty for the president and his reelection because keep in mind\nThey may support Republicans who aren't on board for terrorists this time and twenty Eighteen at the midterms are they going to support the press\nThen who owns that completely if it's still ongoing in\nTwenty twenty not surprised by what happened the last couple of days you know you and I talked about it but\nAnd we said look the big terrorists were hit on September ... ... so I'm not surprised that when you look at you know steel and aluminum and how they have skyrocketed since the beginning of the year right and we said look eventually it's going to be a point where the market's going to say look you're raising prices too uh too much and when the terrorists went into effect on September twenty eight\nIs reducing the

S. continue for the most part even with the terrorists in place they say they're still moderately strong\nWell it doesn't change the the uh trade deficit\nRight a scenario is is not likely to change it wasn't going to change with the new NAFTA you know so that\nThing is kind of off the table but with China you have a couple of concerns the the very valid concern is the intellectual property concerned mhm that's the real thing that the president has to address I mean the terrorist thing is going to have to be remedied but\nIt's going to they're going to have to there's going to have to be and it's not just pressure from the U.S when the ... when the president announced that he was going to or it was announced that the president would be going to try to sit down with a she in China well\nThat's we need everybody at that table on our side of the table the rest of the world needs to be in China's face saying this can't happen anymore you got to play by the rules\nThe\nBecause of the ... if you look at the the steel and aluminum tariffs if those are in place long term you're going to see\nYou're going to see an adjustment on the stock market the stock market is the least of your concerns\nThe reason it's adjusting as because things are becoming more expensive like you mentioned uh the fed with interest rates are the the you know I agree or disagree the sanctions on Iran is is causing a lot of the global uh oil prices to go up\nOr the Saudis have some play in that to us and we'll see if they ramp up production and and and and able and it has changed and it is an incentive a a again\nBecause it makes it more profitable for American producer yes and and were eventually going to get to that point I Believe I well\nIt depends on who's in Washington but I Believe we will get to the point of self sufficiency where you know we can produce for the United states and export at the same time which is a which will be a great point a to a to get to we're not there yet but as we\n... really one of the most underreported stories of the entire year ... is that the United states is now and it happened about three weeks ago became\nThe number one producer of oil in the world mhm yeah um and and this is it I mean you if you put in place all the things of that that will make an economy great again [laughter]\nUm and they did by the way I think that's\nThe number one reason or ... supporting a or the uh the the president his tax bill ... way way down\n[laughter] but um the you know the [laughter]\nThat'd be enough for me [laughter] it's not the case for me though mine went up a but but the line to you that right\nSo the but but you put in place all of those dynamics for a great economy and all it's working up until what the\n... three numbers we talked about

Medicare for all mhm well then you're going to destroy the system for old people oh sure yeah I went whoa\nI mean that was a group that was a great political response all the ... from our product from the president and I went whoa mhm my Medicare for all that you killed that than you are destroying Medicare for old people because we can't pay its you're going to be taken from them and it was set up for them or not ... not not for the rest of America it was set up\nSpecifically for them you do it you heard all people open war that was well and I thought that was a great political age I think it's a\nGreat response remember when when they were talking about slowing the rate of growth this was Paul Ryan slowing the rate of growth of Medicare they were uh they depicted him and ads as wanting to kill old people\nBut which site is it that says old people should go home and die\nWe're not gonna you know afford all the technology and medications were going to send you home so you can die that was Robert Reich ... almost verbatim what he told Berkeley years ago and the former president Barack Obama again saying the same thing\nThey don't care about the fact that elderly\nPeople will suffer if you if you give Medicare for all first of all you can't pay for it but I imagine you could pay for even part or half of it\nAgain pure fantasy but\nWhat would happen ultimately because you can't afford it it is going to affect the benefits of the ...\nAnd\nThere's ... there's no way to debate that the question is does elect care about field\n\nWell Brock Obama and and Robert Reich ... one of his advisors a and a labor secretary for Clinton\nKnow old people should go home and die\n\nThat's the way they saw so maybe they don't care I don't think they do but ah Schumer needs\nTo say wait we found out so that civility is something that\nThe mainstream now the Democratic party has rejected ... did you have to ... from Eric Holder yesterday on Twitter right well obviously that's not what I meant oh he just got blasted then why did you say why did why did you put it that why did you say kick\nWhat's the difference between kick and ... you don't use the language if you don't mean it all it was I'm telling you it was just beautiful we found that out the other thing we found out this week what did we\nLearn from the left we're doomed from the un we're doomed because of climate change we're due told you some of the response this from the Daily Caller\nDoes University of St Thomas thermal science professor John Abraham actually believe Florida Panhandle residents deserve to get hit by the catastrophic hurricane for electing climate deniers\nVictims of hurricane Michael voter per climate deniers read the headline an article by Abraham published in the guardian on Thursday elections have consequences denying sciences consequences we're reaping what we so sudden had re reads\nAll right so we've heard that we've heard because you've elected Republicans and you've reluctant Trump that these hurricanes are happening in\nUh\nLos Angeles times wrote this quote\nThe report of the un report serves as a stark reminder of President Trump status as a global outlier in terms of climate change\nTrump is rejected the twenty Fifteen Paris Agreement signed by a hundred and Ninety five nations to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions exposing skepticism about human caused climate change and vowed to increase coal burning ... but\nAs the more rights in an op ed piece of the New York post who is the political party who is the country and who under what President\n\nHas reduced greenhouse gas emissions but most when it comes to the substance who has actually reduce greenhouse gas emissions who is number one\nWas it Canada nope no nope Germany nope Australia nope France no the one\nCountry that pulled out of the phony Paris climate accord reduced its carbon emissions by half a percent the most of all major countries in the world\n\nSo the rest of the ah the rest of the countries are joining groups United States is not we're not gonna joined the group because they're signing a thing that they are because there's got to there's they're signing things were actually doing things and why what's the major reason why the United states has done it\nFracking racking\nBracken fracking fracking fracking fracking fracking fracking\nSo the people that actually voted in a way to get\nThe substance of how we go after our energy that actually voted for the policies that made it so we can produce energy\nWith lower greenhouse gas emissions which has nothing to do was signing the international agreement but everybody is cheating on and not getting to the levels that they say they're going to get to in fact the United states blows them away\nThe people that\nAre viewed as the people that are destroying the world where all the scientific evidence shows you that they are not\n\nThat's where we're at today\nBy the way the number two nation in the world and not a a big nation\nBut the number two nation in terms of reducing uh they're they're a greenhouse gases and ah and such Venezuela\n[laughter]\n[laughter] so there you go and\nUm it's a it is but but that really is the insanity here's here's what I Wonder\n\nAre they are they getting through to the generations beyond this we know that the loudest of the left the the far left and the in your face left\nUh the um the protest or the go direct\nApproach by the left we know that they're you know not only buying the hype helping create the hype but I mean on on all these issues that the left has been trying to sell like\nGlobal warming the generation behind them\nOr do you see sometimes indications that they're greater critical thinkers\nAnecdotally ... my my granddaughter's\nUm and and I I Try and step back and take my bias away you know and look at the facts you know in that situation as I assessed their generation the oldest of which is a is Thirteen\nAh and then there I have to twelve year olds as well so you know those those early teens that's when you start forming right opinions but you are very curious about how the world works and all of that\nAnd and so I I ask them questions about their friends you know it just about behavior okay so\nYou know I like social media is not is very different for them Twitter and Facebook not even on the radar not even but\nAlso how things are presented to them you don't want one of my granddaughters a few years ago it was\nA it was ... they were they were showing a video on nine eleven\nAnd they had put sad music to it\nShe asked me that following week and when she was at the house but what do you think of that and I said well I don't know she goes to have you ever heard the song and she named the song they were\nUsing and I said yeah yeah yeah she said\nI said she goes I don't know why they did that I said well why do you think they did that she goes to manipulate my feelings\nAnd something that was already said\nThat just one observation again forget the fact that it's my granddaughter ... it was a ... fickle thinking but it was critical thinking\nAbout manipulation and and the left has been all about manipulation and politically both sides are but\nIs that next generation we've seen we've seen their studies that show well the the generation basically behind the the college age or college graduates

read I you know we're on vacation next week when we come back what two weeks yeah yeah we're down to\nA uh we'll be right at the two week mark which means uh early voting will be starting in places and yeah you know you ... and by the way a our friend wrecked Roberts will be here all week next week to uh have great conversations with you\nAnd then we'll be back a week from Monday but the\nThe polls if you start looking at the polls\nA and you know that the numbers in the house I mean I'm I'm ... it's it\nReally really really really I mean you know going up over you know\nHundreds of polls there are some\nThat are going to be blue with no doubt a there are some that are going to be read the thirty to our sci fi has thirty to essentially a you know a ... that are\nIn the middle undecided basically just yet it doesn't show the polls are neck and neck\nAnd does end did you see some of the amounts of the undecided you're talking ten eleven ... percent and that's a big deal it is and and the pollsters\nUm aren't\nAs active in the house seats as as they are for the Senate\nUm they will start seeing that but we haven't seen any polls host capital ... we\nDon't make predictions but if you if you if you look at the number of toss ups as they call them on on our cp that's thirty two\nUh the\nPolls in those areas or you know it in those thirty two districts are really going to start juggling things are showing something here probably by the time you and I get back a week from ...\nAh when when I started thinking about somebody who was undecided today and again in a congressional race who knows but all I'm thinking is that if you got ten to twelve percent that are undecided it means they're not driven by Trump hatred or Trump bluff right\nIt's not either of that that's driving them so what is it that is what is it that is driving\nThe you know that you know that independent in that particular district and we're never going to get the specific poll polling on that lets pull the independence this congressional district to find out why they are undecided and what would change their vote\nRight would it be in\nTheir local congressman came out and said everything is free but by this time they've already seen a ton of political commercials so what is it that would push them over the edge to build a certain way especially if they're likely voters\nWhich means in all likelihood they're going to vote but they're still undecided at this moment what is it it's got to be an issue that's huge right yup and watch the ... just as an issue over the ... the biggest issue over the last couple of weeks we'll be cabinet I don't know if there will be a bigger issue\nThat that will come out in the in in the next few weeks in popular culture that will reach everybody Kanye West I [laughter] I'm Sorry just throw that out\nI I I just I don't know in the the the president the president tweeting and the president coming out with outrageous comments to me doesn't drive anything anymore\nI don't I don't think it it I don't think it\nIn flames anybody knew or pleases anybody new\nIt's going to win playing the same people and it's going to make the people that love when he'd ... when he does that still love him\nBut it's not going to change what's it think about it who can in this day and age how can tend to twelve percent possibly be undecided and ... and and most definitely be going to the polls in November\nYeah it's really it's only when you think about that here's something else interesting looking at the end and it's just\nOne small indicators of small movement but I find it interesting looking at our sleepy and the map for the house race or the house races\nSo Republicans took one from the Democrats I haven't figured out which one it is but it was at two o five Democrats in other words likely very likely Democrats\nAnd one Ninety eight for Republicans it's now too old for for Democrats one Ninety nine for Republicans and the center of the toss up district still remains at thirty to thirty two years\nBy would love to see what your district that was that that that that shifted and I and again not from toss up\nBut from the Democrats so I'll go back and look at it I I have no idea um but it is interesting so you but you do look at those thirty to keep in mind to Eighteen is the number the magic number a for a majority right so right now\nOnly Nineteen those thirty to need to go for uh the Republicans but even fewer uh fourteen only need to go for the Democrats\nAttention all authors page publishing is looking for authors

going what I go to the wedding where would I go to vote\nIs going to be the restoration of some show some some semblance of due process and the court of public opinion is going to have to be arraigned in ... and I think that the Republican direction yeah\nThat's a great history by now yeah\nNo I think it's a great point is that you say that you know the the the court of public opinion or isn't the final determination of of uh of of anything and and a quarter of a public opinion we're talking about on the left side of of of a public opinion and it has to be it has to be due process that's a very that's a\nYou know that that that's a great point that comes from the Kavanaugh hearings\nYeah I I think it is and and people apply\nIt uh it\nBased on their their own life you know our our audience a and a ... and new towns and and and people who do we do we're we're in the thick of it and we're always immersed in it\nBut most people the average American is not but if they're still politically active in terms of boating\nThey look at it and say okay\nThis this is you know insanity the fact that it went this way they don't\nUh applied the left believes that they apply their feelings directly to their feelings lead that is the case for some\nBut most Americans look at it practically speaking and going you know this is a big deal to vote to be able to vote is a big deal\nAnd if there to the point where they are you know in that likely voter category this is why those polls start to shape the way they do and that's why a likely voter gives you a better read but they look at that and go you know it's a big deal on election day to get up and go cast my vote\nYou know I Know people show up and they're driven by you know a slogan are driven by whatever imagery\nBut we can't forget the people that take it very serious they consider things they may not be immersed in it every day like we are for whatever reason\nBut they will show up and they make an informed decision and often it is a reaction Chuck Todd on uh with ...\nAnd and Chuck Todd who say well why do people get it wrong and and say twenty sixteen was a referendum on Trump but it really was a referendum on Hillary\nThat was a small part of it what what Chuck Todd as we're getting here because they are discussing the polls in the mid term is is about you know the house in the Senate and not a presidential election and his point what he was implying is that Hillary is not here to be the the bad guy right well\nWhat Chuck is forgetting is the real facts of how the Republicans in districts all over America outperformed Trump and that it wasn't a referendum on Hillary it was a referendum on the left\nAs a you know that that's a great point of the other point brought by the color of their ... and I think you can't underestimate this is that Americans may not know the three branches of government right\nUh you know and and that's what the poll shows Seventy five percent of Americans roughly could not tell you all three branches of government they might know one or two or are they doing zero but they couldn't tell you all three as you said you need to know all three to understand how the government actually works they may not be able to tell you the freedoms and the first amendment\nBut think about when it comes to due process\nThink about since Perry Mason let's go through all the lawyer shows that have been that had been on TV and battle salt [laughter] well I uh well I'll Try I'll drop Perry Mason officer all matlock I'll throw out\nAlmost Thirty years of law and order on the television and everybody understands the presumption of innocence everybody even a significant portion that we're trying to tell you that the allegation is enough\nIf you actually ask them off the record if they believe that they would tell you know why that is that is just think about that in not just in the courtroom if you've ever been in a jury but it is they're completely in our popular culture shots from the greater Ohio's on ... and it's\nA great point because you don't have to get into the details of how legislation worked for no the three branches of government help but in pop culture we got
