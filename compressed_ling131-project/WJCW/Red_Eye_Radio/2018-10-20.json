immigrants that are coming over to the u._s. um might want to be\nA little bit smarter and think about other places to possibly go that may be easier to get into 'em if they have farming skills I'm In South Africa or they're kicking people out of there and taking their farm so\nAh maybe but put together a band of you and some of your uh guys that are I think you have the\nThe gall to go over there and maybe protect some of those people get paid some money or or use your farming skills and go over and help out South Africa 'cause uh they're digging themselves into over right now so\nI hear your sarcasm delusion seizures then yeah I I Do hear by the way you bring up a new story I don't know if it a lot of people know about South Africa's expert breeding the land of a lot of the citizens right and that's going to be a real struggle and I had a lot of them are going to resist right with the force\nAbsolutely absolutely yeah\nYeah we was was you know when it takes me call when we meddle in other countries I don't mean coming to their aid in defense but like we did so after you got to be careful what you get\nI mean all this talk of makes me think Egypt right we we helped them over and throw a what's his name Mubarak and I asked of the time I was doing national radio and I said wait a second the what they called the springs something what was the term anybody out there I can tell me I've forgotten or for a second I'm\n... now and Brian was helping me and not their spring there was some something when spring but anyway a defect as we got worse you got to ask that question what's what's after this so you got rid of Mubarak and you got the Brotherhood Muslim Brotherhood which was to radical and certainly not on our side\nAnd then eventually ... took it over there we were saying maybe it was the Arab Spring I may you may be right Brian I think you are now that I think of it um producer Brian so you know I'm mentioning\nThe fact is that you you can't just do the spine when we did that in South Africa right you overthrow which you have and then you don't ask what's next is going to be attorney right oh but the best example might be Iran\nWe were so thrilled with Jimmy Carter to overthrow the shock yeah but they didn't ask what was next are you happy looking back and seeing what you've gotten ... instead of the shah\nI ... the biggest enemy maybe or at least our enemy that you might say Russia or China but certainly the biggest immediate threat in terms of what they're doing to our citizens\nSo it's very important that you not just act\nI'm thinking it Gadhafi in Libya right Hillary was for that Obama was for that what is your place Libya with weren't didn't they killed Americans right\nIn Benghazi is you you just can't operate let me get myself in trouble with somebody now\nIn Saudi Arabia we got a real problem there what they did was horrendous in my opinion the stone assassinate people like that and go inside chopped them up and some people picked on me for that is that it's none of our business\nBut the other side and President Trump's got a huge problem now is they're our biggest supporters in ... you know besides Israel in trying to work against Iran cause Iran's than a threat to\nThis world is very complicated and their offer no easy solutions or maybe you don't notice historically we had a war there was a war or not we between Iran and Iraq\nAnd you know you got to choose sides sometimes they may both be terrible we work with the Soviet Union during the more I think about this we work with the Soviet Union during World War two because we had a bigger enemy and Hitler\nSo a lot of left us and liberal say well you work with these people what how do you respond to that well life is not easy you're faced with difficult

job\nYou know than the regular host so I'm just filling in and trying to hold do my share of there but I I have a story on Hillary now I Want to get to that a little while and the Democrats really fear that she's going to run again that yeah that's why the more I thought about the more thought and that's my number one choice\nThat the others that you you know I'd love to see how they are not a guy's crazy loon Tucker Carlson phrase for him is not that bad or write a sleazy porn lawyer but\nUh let me know what you think Andy in New York City you're on with mark Hi Andy\nYeah Hi thanks for taking my call [noise]\n[noise] um I you address was you know interested in why there's such a big on such big talk about Saudi Arabia and what they did [noise] um you know what they did was terrible but you know ... you know even if there was something small that's all right but it's such a big they're making such a big uproar about it\nOn I mean you know I'm sure that they they have Saudi Arabia you know it doesn't have the cleanest record\nKing Solomon does me for sure [noise] um and I mean generally get involved in things abroad when it when it's in our interest you know when when we can prevent you know bigger or human rights you know you know crisis or [noise] or you know to expand our power abroad you know to protect us you know as you know offensive is defense\nBut in this case I mean she wasn't a US citizen\nUm give it a green card\nUm you know if they did it in it isn't a best interest to just you know there are big player in the middle east for us you know to protect us against Iran so like whoa you know they they help us out why um what's the big uproar but you know\nThey've done things like this in the past that we've known about you know just I guess it wasn't so publicly you know he I mean this king Solomon he's locked elect all ... you know the princes in a hotel for a few months\nThey said that make them pay ransom saying he's not he's not exactly a moderate you know isn't that is not your regular guys like that's the you know it's trying to understand that\nLet me see if I can add something to your thoughts about it\nLook it's a ... it's always been a difficult a jigsaw puzzle out there in the middle east right the Israel's our basic friend and we can count on them but the other players or you know like Saudi Arabia were more anti Israel than they are now they both have the one side of interest in terms of Iran trying to stop Iran\nBut I gotta tell ya just the thought of it maybe it's a visceral reaction the idea that this guy goes in there and I'm not trying to say the great about him because he was a supporter of the Muslim Brotherhood and you know the their their enemies of ours are as they weren't in Egypt\nOr so I'm not a big fan of what he believes in in that sense but to go when someone or be lord into an ...\nSee which is you know he's supposed to have a special status when a country has an embassy in another country they there's in their territory their land you lord in there and and then you chop them up and\nYou assassinate him and it just so revolting to people I I think that's what's what's going on and you're right it's a complicated situation as we need their oil and we need them to find Iran\nIt's very difficult situation for President Trump but just the thought I I must have been kept me too I I felt badly from even though I'm ... I think I wouldn't agree with him probably many as\n... yeah but that's you know agree with and the ... getting getting killed like that is horrible\nYou know I mean so ... yeah\n... ... even ... it should be you know definitely should be an uproar and they should be condemned for it but I mean though that they really want a large scale it seems like a large scale you know cutting off you know businesses and\nAnd ... and I mean I I don't know if it's in America's Best interest to do that like just you know for this even though it's it is a horrible incident but for this alone I don't think you know\nI'm In the bigger picture you know ... ...\nYeah I I I I cringe when you said cutting off business and that's bad in this in this story\nBut um you're right we we need that we need them badly and that's why I say President Trump is isn't a very difficult situation and there are people like Lindsey Graham who is terrific on in the cabinet hearings now saying hey you know I'm never going there again while in this guys and the princes in power and this and then Marco Rubio a there are people on our side saying\nWe we can't allow this to happen you ... you know as as crazy as it sounds you have to have some civility in this crazy world right you don't want the president was assassinated you don't take out food and even if you can\nYou don't do stuff like that that's why the the Kennedy thing John F. Kennedy thing was was so outrageous it to this day I'm One of the few talk show host I should say now\nThat does think there was a conspiracy I a little kid but uh I I've followed this stuff and um I you just don't do that you just you know what I'm saying I don't know if the Russians were involved the mafia was involved I don't know for sure I I'm not seeing Lee Harvey Oswald wasn't involved\nBut you know there's there's something about you don't take out people and that's why by the way he ... he was so outrageous by Obama\nA because he was becoming our friend a difficult yeah so you you get it and it was right he didn't he writes for the Washington Post and stuff\nYou know I don't want all the different countries and assassinating them go ahead\nI Know I I I Do feel I mean my my impression is that let's say Russia you know they just recently had a story you know in in England with the ...\nI'm I'm sure you know it's probably no you know in Washington is probably like you know known that a lot of many countries you know Russia I'm sure shooting takes out you know he has people going down his political opponents you know here and there it's not it's not really um [noise] it's not uncommon\nYou know so it's just interesting the reaction I guess because it just became like ... it's a very public public no you know the story\nAnd he ... he goes he yeah he goes in there and it wasn't his girlfriend waiting outside and he said you know if I don't come out and you know here's what you do\nAnd and he just disappeared and they made it worse no we always say that the the it's the not even the crime itself but the cover up and they said something they were never in you know they weren't involved and they came up the story that it was\nA wad of interrogation that ah got got went badly yeah uh that that that's that's a little crazy right well yeah no I'm sure they're\nPretty sure they're pretty ... [laughter] if\nYou ... yeah this wasn't a by the way it was mentioned my produced last night this wasn't a job interview going in for that that would that would be a job interview that went badly you know the credible home I think people even on our side are reacting viscerally and I I don't blame him because I felt the same way you drop 'em up and when they brought didn't they bring suitcases\nIt's reported it and you know how do they think it's funny I mean so I don't want to be gross that way on the air but\nI I think all of that stuff you may be right just the fact that we knew about there's always espionage there's always dirty stuff going on but this one way played out was not good\nYeah\nThank you Andy I appreciate your call very much by the way how old are you I'm a\nTwenty two\nI thought you sound young who is your choice on the Democrats' side who would you like to see run against president I'm\nI'll tell you what for the fun of it I Would love for Pocahontas or on I think I think that would just be you know those are just be a lot of fun to watch [noise]\n... yeah well I think she shot herself on the phone right now that was a\nShame that they do it and then John related I bet you aren't related to George Washington in some way what are you saying rations we're all we're all related to everybody if you go all the way back right\nNow she's got the Indian heritage I I think she made me take can get I think she's done you're not going to get your wish recall anything so much yeah thank you and I got\nTo do I do find for [noise]\nI just find from Austin compose music deserves to be hiring\nPerform for all of a stagehand you\nMake sure I never missed a cue\nThere flying for high school choir director who taught me to breathe and the guy in ten\nSpeech your main theater using the performing arts teach valuable life lessons that typically aren't taught in the classroom they help high school students learn leadership skills that prepare them to enjoy more satisfying productive lives\nWinds and this is happening in my high school debate coverage who would become more confident than having trains passing\nThis message presented by the Tennessee secondary school athletic association and the high school in your community [noise]\nI think she's children's research hospital we're fighting against childhood cancer every day at the heart of this battle\nOur our donors most of us want to make some difference in the lives of other St she's dead miraculous or\nThe fact that no one has to pay it's a place where everyone is treated as any\nEverybody is welcome here and it doesn't matter the religion or what part of the world you're from all that is taken away it just gives you some hope [noise]\nIt's just a nice feeling to put your energy into something that really does genuine we make a difference in\nThere's just no ...\nIf we have the ability to how\nAnd when you have a responsibility now\nFinding cures saving\nChildren the children's research off they don't find out how you can help it seemed to dot org line\nRight now at the ... center is so wonderfully strong and soft wonder Jill purple extreme C Cushing is on sale for only sixty four Ninety seven\nWhat does it mean to the corner office well received by the wheel of a new\nFree ... and the prestige of the corner office takes on all new meaning to sleep designed to be ergonomics dash large LCD display controls at your fingertips\nFall to create a more comfortable functional workspace that set you up for success to take a virtual tour of your next office space visit Friedlander dot com slash corner office that's free minor dot com slash corner office free liner runs smart\nBaby driving right now and you'd like to read the informative an entertaining content found in the current September October issue of road teen magazine or if you'd like to listen that's right I said listen\nAs a voice easier on the years in mind reads the stories to you will listen up for starters the print edition preferred by Ninety percent of votes your drivers is now available for free as an F.

with him in as his vice president running mate and it'd be hard for anybody ... recognition the incumbency being president is very difficult to defeat in rarely happens he he would likely run and pick a vice presidential nominee to go with him\nIf it is and you send a crack house that you know the\nHouse has to go ahead I'll get in a second so people know US Senate correctly the house in ... and the president but then the Senate has to try\nUm the president and and they decide whether he gets thrown out of office so Bill Clinton was impeached a lot of people don't know this he was impeached

with mark\nHi Hi I'm a kind of late for me but I just ah someone to call it a while you were talking to a while ago is talking about a century city in century state and about the people voting for them\nAnd I just wanted to say that I I live here where we can vote on that\nCertainly not governor brand name and the whole state of sanctuary state which I don't I don't know how many of the city's pay attention to him I Know some of them have actually voted against a following his directions but I don't recall ever hearing any vote about sanctuary cities out here\nAnd I are the ones that I think as we know it wasn't so they were loaded on it it's just a dead end Democrats an officer very liberal extremely leftist a Democrat is in office and he just decided that's a good idea does it end I from what I understand San Francisco's kind of a dumped now just partly\nWhat is that\nWhile I was there a few months ago and I'm using it was amazing when I was walking the streets with\nMy kids or somebody else that is now look at this hand this hand as a weapon\nAnd then another time something ... someone says something about a knife that doesn't count how dirty it is now I didn't see this but they were needles all over certain sections I think there's a market street and of course the problem with the trash and the and the homelessness is a problem but that's true yes you know everywhere in California right\nYes uh-huh but I think uh\nI I haven't been to San Francisco in a long time I don't really go up there that much I mean it's quite far from San Diego and I've I've just never been into their way of thinking so um yeah it's\nIt's it's ... it's the only thing we vote on and I wanted to ask you one other thing I didn't mention is to the fella I spoke with first but but you have you heard the thing about the the um a birth tourism\n... it was on earth I mentioned this just mentioned this to a few people and they had not heard of it and it actually was on television some some time ago on twenty twenty or dateline or one of those where\nThey fly on these Chinese women that are pregnant uh-huh and they they have a place all set up and they go there and they have the babies get their little American citizenship for the baby and leave\nAnd then leave yeah no I actually I did hear that pregnant women going into hospitals yep they've got to figure it out and look people take advantage of the weaknesses in anything right especially your loss source we of course we call that anchor babies right to so they come here and they have a baby and then there are they have all\nThe rights wrong and of course it's wrong at an awful\nLot of people have not heard about that because I've I've told that you either the politicians here\nAnd they well I mean there are people that work for them and they haven't heard of that so I'm I'm Glad to get to say it on on national radio so people can know what's going on it's got we're very close to the border here so it's I mean people come over here and dumped the baby's all the time I say dumped them I mean they have them and I and I just I don't think it's right I don't think a lot of the country and the other countries in the world\nDo that ... somebody had a baby in Italy I said to the baby a\nDual citizenship and they said no because he was born in an air force us air force base so I don't know why were handed out citizenship like like candy you know it's it's it's a ...\nYeah go ahead and\nThe actual do Sylvia there was a reason for it which is a there are with the with the slavery issue we want to make sure that they weren't taking advantage of it any way but of course if you pass a law every every law by the way there's a phrase I've heard was a one time a solution every problem was the one time a solution to something else\nSo you you mean well and you pass something and then people figure out how to take advantage oh I Would do the same thing when I Lived in Asia and I think I could get my kids have American citizenship if they're just born here well I'm going to time my trip so that I have the baby yeah of course they could go wrong with the babies late I guess very late\nWhat did they figure out how to take advantage of you are dumb laws\nThat that happens a lot let's go to a\nJeremiah Wright speaking of fraud Jeremiah in Nashville a jury my daughter's mark\nYes there are a um
