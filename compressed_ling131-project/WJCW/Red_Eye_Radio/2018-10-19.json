announced via Twitter that he's pulling out of the future investment initiatives summit in Saudi Arabia now whether government official is expected to attend the summit and then you can play\nIn the ministry and wait for the investigation they slid\nUn officials are calling the disappearance of shooting a heinous attack against human dignity\nWith Obama yeah he was a great speaker but I ask\nWhat kind of job is he doing when you start in say seven days before your election that you're going to fundamentally transform in my opinion the greatest country in the history of the world\nYou know I'm not going to have much use for you I don't care that you speak well that's not what's important to me\nWhat's much more important is what your policies are so I think you're comparing apples to oranges there between Trump and Obama we didn't like him because of his policies not because of his race not because of the way he sounded but because of what he did\nYeah I'm not saying that Republicans are going to vote both Republicans ... of ... and the president if you had a Democrat Republican is going to vote Republican and Democrat\nOh let me let me say what I think ah clarified for you\nThe base you're right about that both sides have a base that would never in a million years or Republican vote for Democrats nor a Democrat voted for Republican but I Know I have\nA couple of times voted for the Democratic or Republican are so bad or as an example I couldn't stand Arnold Schwarzenegger so I didn't vote for him I figured out who he was what a phony he was and he was in it for himself\nSo there have been times that I have not voted for the Republican candidate but you're right in general that's why you choose your party 'cause you agree with them for the most part I don't blame people for that what I Do blame is for the incredible hatred for Donald Trump and the fact of tonight's topic which is you disown someone because you disagree with their politics\nThat doesn't make sense to me that's over the type\nThat you write because like I said it Donald Trump is not a bad job you get the Korea issue North Korea is the first time in history to the my act the act we got him debate and um the the climate rate is doing a really good job of\nWhat the reason people don't like them at the way you speak if he was more for their ... probably what's going on his way but\nI think he is but I think he is becoming more presidential I get a question for you are you going to vote for him next time\nI don't know I was so frustrated with politics like I said I didn't vote for him the first time I was I was never going to vote for Hillary but I I\nI like what you're doing and let me tell you that I worked for the government so you know I'm real happy at what he's doing you know I'm a government or ... or ...\nSo you're a good man Anthony I appreciate you and I'm hanging in there and I I just got to save your way to live longer and you say you've done good stuff and you ought to vote for him in a twenty twenty thanks for the call appreciate it very much and let's go to um\nYeah Teresa in fair play Missouri three so you're on with mark\nIt intimidating martyr good morning and I wanted to say that\nI was raised their crap I mean my whole family with Democrat bottom family still a Democrat and most of my my dad changed parties and during the Reagan Era and kind of took all those kids with thing you know 'cause he had he had let anybody that sisters [noise]\nAnd and\nRecently Leanne me and my cousin has gotten kind of the ... in Facebook and\nOne and then just completely everything within Haiti everything with a negative that Trump or you know everything you put up there and and it and I would make snide remarks and that you know on his and and then my other cousin came out and speak spoke with one night\nMy\nOne cousin came down and and apologized to me he goes family more important than politics [noise] and I thought that was really really big I mean I think so much more lean him coming out and we talk\nOn you know on messenger for quite a long time now my other cousin I I had to delete hand because everything he had was this negative negative negative now\nEverything he put it on faith up the Blake political that am\nI my question is is you know I Can't\nVote for something that I Am morally you know against the now whether it's in Martian or you know all these people coming up here it's not the nominee against immigration that they need the legal and and\nI just can't I think a lot of the red Greg comes from the news because they are so negative I mean\n... ... agrees with me 'cause I I I think it changes a lot of people's mind\nYou're absolutely right you make a great point thinking Theresa ... the media has changed the name of the game it used to be that there there was a lot of honest journalism and you know you didn't even know where a lot of them stood now they've become advocates\nFor their point of view and that's maybe they learn that journalism school but that's not what they're supposed to do that just spoke to present the news and what's going on and we get to make our own decision\nBut that's totally changed and they influenced people especially young people who don't listen to that much and and I'm not big on the young people that's true of older people too and I think of it you know watch the nightly news or whatever they watch and they get a little glimpse of it and half the time they don't even know you know what's really happening\nSo I agree the media has a big play in this and it's a pretty discouraging to see what an influence they do have\nAnd you know if you go out and interview people you is very discouraging to see how little Leno right they can name vice

because she's going through a bout with cancer\nAnd then or a ... and in fact they were at the doctor's office at that time and her husband is for me she said that unless Irene now Donald Trump\nAnd with no longer speak to me and one thing they were outraged about was that I guess Donald Trump said that this Don Lemon character I never even seen him a is ignorant and uh she said they said that's very insulting to call a black person or\nAre people I Know are white and you know most black people are ignorant in fact this Don ... anyway\nI have two other lifelong friends they're very liberal\nOr over the years they've always known that I lean to the right I'm a former marine and they kind of expect it out of me but they're like family will we don't discuss politics much but I really love getting in touch with them or you know they live in different cities all these people but anyway [laughter]\nI thought well maybe if I could get my two friends ... we'll talk radio maybe they kind of get rich just it you know but\nI wasn't really hurt but I just kind of amazed\nWell for everything I'm hearing none of it surprises me you know what you ought to do you want to make a

everybody's having problems with their family members and nobody can figure out why people are going crazy you know you bring up Trump or whatever and it's just like it's like a trick word that a a\nMind programming like they did the old shows they had back in the seventies whatever you know they so they call somebody on the phone and say a special worded they will go kill somebody to I'm not advocating anything like that but I'm saying is when\nAbout six seven years ago my daughter wanted me to go with her to the Huntington center which is a big arena and said Ohio and it was about to interview for a job now but new dance club that was opening up in Toledo and so I took her and they'll\nPretty much still two thirds the arena where filled up with families kids and parents editor front was a panel of um people probably six people they each have their little ... to talk about this new dance club that was coming into the going all around the country opened it up these clubs\nAnd the thing that struck by interests first of all was the kids didn't get paid by the hour they got paid by how many other kids they brought in\nNow there are five hundred families where this arena there was no way a little club is going to hire all these people but what they were doing was trying to bring the kids in it as I listen to this feel I\nSaid told on their cells by saying\nThey'll be music playing and food and then at throughout the night there'll be certain times when the musical stop it will have announcements\nAnd it was or political announcements so these people in your family especially you know what you're thinking about Twenty years old twenty two year olds watch why these people and people and and people that are out there in the streets blocking streets these kids have been a doctrine ate it almost gives you a cult and\nYou know if there was a ... who's got the money to rent the Huntington Center for this club now I tried to get in there to find out more about it I told him I play drums which I Do and uh I like to get in and sometimes the kids like the answer to the extra beat too is a plus years ago they had that and\nSo I could get inside the walls to find out exactly what was happening but I never heard back from them but this these people that your family members do\nEven though you see that have come out in the heart do hate that it's not their fault I mean if you had a family member that was ... or ... and they're not only programs that's basically what it is I mean if I like blue and you like read we can discuss it and there's not a problem or whatever it gets into the area of\nControl ... of the population\nThen you see the anger come out that because I I really believe there are programs by son is thirty one right now\nBut she was a Jew in junior high back was a Gore and and Bush was bad was down in Florida he said dad who you're voting for and back then I just you know I didn't care about politics I almost I didn't vote for nobody 'cause they're all crooks\nHe was a well we had a mock election at school and Gore won by a landslide them thinking wow I don't know a whole lot but pretty sure that guy's really it so\nI started listen to AM radio and I don't know what a Democrat is or conservative or a Democrat or anything I mean I don't know anything\nAbout anything so I mean you have everything an open mind as it didn't take me long to figure out that I was a conservative and even back then the hatred was prominent in the discussion on the talk shows that were more of a liberal\nI'm democratic side and what I what I've just seen\nAs just as I feel sorry my heart goes out to everybody you know I was driving a truck with my brother years ago and started talking politics and he you know I bring up points of
