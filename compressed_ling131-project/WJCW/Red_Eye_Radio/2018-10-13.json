four forty six sixty one and Seventy the mega ball seven the mega millions jackpot has been growing since it was last one on July twenty fourth\nYou know what I Believe so we've often talked about the fact that the left\nDoes not and this is the mainstream of the law does not believe\nIn the first amendment they don't believe in freedom of speech I don't believe in freedom of religion the second amendment it's obvious they don't believe in the second amendment they believe it's antiquated they don't believe in due process or under the law you and I've talked about this during\nUh during the uh uh uh during the whole uh uh\nFerguson case ... when you had a when you had a a Eric Holder and you had the president giving their opinion on it when they didn't know what happened right and we said you can't be doing that just shows you don't believe in due process under the law you can't be indicted unless you know\nYou've got to take each case individually if you're not\nThen you don't believe in due process well we've seen this year the mindset of due process because what you did have her was a political trial yes uh it wasn't a civil trial wasn't day it wasn't a a\nI'm a criminal trial by\nMany aspects of a real trial where there you're under oath mhm and you can be you can go to jail it was a legal setting it was illegal it's it's a legal maybe a political legal setting might not be a criminal trial or civil trial but it was a trial where many of the enforcements of a trial\nA ... like when you testify if you commit perjury you can go to jail for that\nAnd they didn't believe in due process or under under the law they didn't believe in a presumption of innocence none of that matter to them\nThen we got to trumpeting the presidency and they didn't believe in the electoral college anymore now this one when you have a ... and this is this is going to pick up now because the oh wow we forgot the Senate\nOr that are now that the the the Senate has and we told you this was coming if you've been listening to show the last couple of years we told you the next thing they were going to try to get rid of was the Senate\nWell if you don't want the Senate\nIf you don't want the electoral college if you believe that the Supreme Court is the legislative branch mhm and should be making up law when that was not their intent when you don't believe in the first amendment\nWhen you don't believe in the second amendment when you don't believe in due process under the law when you don't believe in the ... and the presumption of innocence\nYou really don't believe in this country right you have no idea what the country's about\nAnd we understand now on the show we believe that that\nThe majority of our audience and the majority of conservatives understands the separation of powers we've talked about that a lot we've talked about how the majority of America though ... close to Seventy five percent does not\nBut if you understand the concept of the are by camera legislature you understand why we have a house of representatives you understand why we have a set it you understand why Great Britain as a house of lords in the house of commons\nYou understand that the founding fathers of the United states they wanted a separation of powers the thing that they were most scared of\nWas that a ... group\nA particular group of ... a a person a small group of people a particular kind of a legislature or a court\nOr presidency they were scared to death that power could be concentrated in one of those areas and they they were trying to avoid that more than anything because they had looked at the history of the world\nAnd seen how authoritarianism works and they didn't want it\nAnd the by camera legislature was a compromise made by the Congress and when you look at it the house of representatives and you have I think fifty three house members in California only one in Wyoming\nWhy bigger population and California fewer people in a ... in Wyoming both of two senators\nA that was done for a reason that was done sold the house would more represent the United states by population\nAnd by region but the Senate and on and\nAnd by the way the the reason that are you a are elected for two years so you're closer to the people more accountable to the people if they wanted they believe that the house of representatives would be closer to mob rule than a Senate [laughter]\n[laughter] and but so they they but they wanted they wanted the the the\nCongress to be closer to the people small areas you know of the country where you represented you know that area of the country and you had more power or the state because if you had more population and a bigger state you were more representation in\nThe house but they also wanted in every state wanted the ability to have some kind of equal employed so the big states could not rule over the little state\nThat was the reason for it the reason the bill of rights exist the reason that we are unconstitutional Republican not a direct democracy is why separation of powers and also protection of individual rights and protection of states' rights\nAnd that's why it was done and do things move slower yes\nBut bounding fathers were worried so much about legislation moving slowly through\nThey preferred that then mob rule\nThe reason the electoral college that exist today is so you can't have Marlboro or you can have the big states not knowing what the future was going to be in this country where the big states would totally dominate in the executive branch ...\nIt was all it was all thought up not to have the separation of powers so power cannot congregate in one area and as we said when it comes to the by camera legislature to give them to give the people one body which is the house and then the Senate which is to per state\nWhich is six years so they could be more long term looking at a country where they weren't voted in every single or every two years and the senators were more likely to look at what was best for the country and not just the region that the congressional membership\nOr represents a most ... I Would dare say that the vast majority of the left have no idea I think most people I listen to our show do understand you know everything that I said but I don't believe that the left understands that at all or cares to understand\nI don't think they care about it because what they want is again a and as they often engage in and fantasy they create and there might have fantasy of what the nation should be\nI mean they create a in their mind a fantasy of what the what the government should be giving you every day so the makeup of that government needs to change to fit that fantasy most often they're okay with doing that they don't understand the process they don't care to understand the process\nThey don't care why it was set up this way and\nYou know it's interesting because you look at what happened after Trump was elected and you had people on the left you know then it at that point start talking about well we want our guns because not all but some on the left we want our guns because ah of the possibility of a tyrannical government\nHey welcome to the second amendment now they're excuse appointed of course directly to this president\nBut it was about the same idea basic idea of the second amendment and it's often\nToo little too late for the left they call for something something changes well we didn't know it was going to be that just one small example was Obamacare not that it was small but much smaller than of course change through your way with the Senate completely we didn't know we were going to happen but we thought and someone else was going to pay for it\nYeah well lessened weren't you start coming in and you start changing the very foundation of the constitution and they do believe this is this has really been the game all along\nYou know the the the whole um changing of the first amendment\nIsn't just about protecting their free speech because of the things they wanted to say and doing away with yours and we've talked about that battle but it's also doing away with the freedom of religion because your religion is bigoted\n\nIt needs to go away completely because we disagree with it freedom of speech while we protect that when\nIt's a it's\nOur group talk we don't want you to be able to talk you don't have freedom of speech example California used the wrong pronouns the penalty mechanism in the law includes up to one year in jail\nThe YMCA dot net slash more\n[noise] any given moment telling leaving America maybe taking a very\nAcademic mental milestone for too many of the beast first came to mind and they are these are the parents\nBabies who were born prematurely or we start [noise] it's a crisis affecting more than half a million billion each year you can help to any volunteers like\nIn my baby\nBaby overcoming challenges premature\nI think strong\nWho do I do find for [noise]\nI Do find from Austin compose music deserves to be hiring\nPerform for all of a stagehand you\nMake sure I never missed a Q\n... heightened will choir director who taught me to breathe and the guy saying I'm going\nA speech main theater using the performing arts teaching valuable life lessons that typically aren't taught in the classroom they held high school students learn leadership skills that prepare them to enjoy more satisfying productive lives\nPoints and this is happening in my high school debate parents who would become more confident than ever dreamed passing\nThis message presented by the Tennessee secondary school athletic association and the high school in your community [noise]\nKnow Mr show listen anywhere at any time on demand to catch up on Eric and Gary's topics of the day visit red eye radio show dot com and click on demand that red eye radio show dot com boom\nI'm here with a unit royal truck tires engineer to talk about the unit royal LD ...

Bush ... to push for a Trump\nNominee mhm for for the Supreme Court decision not at everybody and I think one of the reasons that you not everybody is look\nWe dealt with Trump for the last two years the people in the Republican Party that just can't stand up\nAnd all of a sudden the last three weeks I woke up and went loops easy is really not our enemy\nIs really not our political enemy there maybe some things that we don't like we don't like his tone we don't like this we don't like it'd be exaggerates we don't like when he doesn't tell the truth at times but\nHe's a lot better than these insane people on the other side I Believe that that's what a lot of ... maybe not all but I think it's well it's just that everybody except Bill Kristol\n[laughter] well [laughter] if the interest [laughter] and that's not going to happen\nAnd possibly George with 'em but [laughter]\nBut the the the the the idea if you look at it and I I find it\nKind of a interesting that the George W. Bush the same president who said well signing campaign finance law I Know parts of this are unconstitutional but I'll let the courts work it out [noise] called Collins to make sure that the court gets it right\nUm but but [laughter] that I just sat on the way it right by the way great observation I miss yeah well I I just uh you know but but certainly anyone from the Bush family doing anything to support a a Trump nominee is is definitely notable\nBut it also goes beyond what we are ... well it goes right to what we're setting goes beyond the the political aspect of this and removes it from the current White House because\nIt is about the long term makeup of the court and George W. Bush of course recognizing that I'm certain um as many of us do and it is also recognizing a indirectly and while we haven't and I would love to hear from the former president on this or asking the question\nUh if if it is the case with him we pointed out it is the work that the president does now we can go back and forth on the comments made a the and the communication errors and and things even on the issues that we disagree with a wheel the we are the original ... babies [laughter]\nAnd then have those discussions but we said from the beginning it is the reason that\nYou from the beginning so you know ultimately with your vote that it becomes well as it always is that buying their decision and then along the way we guard was of whether or not and I saw somebody in my neighborhood with for Ted Cruz signs in their yard\nI thought you know not one not too but a total\nOf four they're really really voting for groups and so or time or time I'm ... and and I thought I thought to myself you know okay that's that's a that kind of enthusiasm\nUm even if we were to show that uh we don't do and we don't do endorsements because again as we mentioned earlier I don't believe they really do anything it tells it it might tell your audience which way you're going but there are the the point is is that we have the discussion\nOn the ideas and we believe that our audience and the rest of the country is smart enough to make their own decisions they may be willfully ignorant not our listeners but\nOthers may be willfully ignorant along the way they can make their decision a you know or are there still capable of finding the information whether they choose to or not but ultimately it is about\nAh when that person is elected if I\nIf I'm campaigning for them if I'm doing a volunteer work for them if I donate to their campaign I'm skills from day one going to watch them on on the issues on their work you judge them on the work and then of course the head of that work\nYou are back them in order to you know uh to to\nHave them do that work to keep them in place to do that work and you see a George W.

go back to the poll that you brought up earlier we we talked about last week\nThat the majority of Americans it was somewhere around sixty percent that said well if there was nothing to corroborate claims from this additional background check on cabinet we that sixty percent saying he should be confirmed\nWell that's a big deal now it's not eighty percent not Ninety percent what sixty percent will win you a fuel elections and the point being is that we stepped back from the insanity and the display the show that's being put on by the left here\nAnd the behavior by the left I mean I'm not saying it's not real I'm not saying people aren't going to react to it\nUh you know cirrhosis can can back whatever he wants to and people can act the way they want to and even on the Senate Judiciary committee they can say the most insane things if they believe it's going to get them political points well it just might in your state of Hawaii or California\nBut if you believe it's going to win the argument with the people of America you're flat out wrong\nAnd and that's why I think ... and and again this is a not a ... analysis of facts ... this is just\nMy my gut feeling from\nWhat I what I've seen what I've heard the personal response that I just generally talk to people over the last uh a couple of weeks were more independent or non political who have paid attention to this and even though they do sympathize\nAnd because this is one of the things would just really ticked off a ton of people including a ton of women that I Know and that are that are of more ... a more conservative was\nIf you didn't believe her\nThan your for rape ...\nIf you don't believe in the ... if you don't believe in the rape allegation alone without cooperating evidence if you don't absolutely believe the allegation\nThen you're as much a rapist yourself because you're enabling raping our society right well that kicked off a ton of women that I Know who just went wait a minute and I and I gave you the example two of my my buddy independent Bob\nWho said what what's the thing that you always believed the woman you don't believe anything what evidence and to me that's where the Democrats jump the shark\nIs\nMost of most Americans which is why you see the sixty percent and I bet you that sixty percent I bet you that other forty percent that so we don't want to confirm Kavanaugh had nothing to do was just the fact that they'd rather have a more liberal judge or if Trump pick somebody they don't want him\nBut I guarantee you that the majority of Americans looked at that process and said no you don't always believed the woman\nYou have to have evidence you don't believe always believe the man you don't always believe a woman you don't always believe anybody gets the evidence that you make the judgment on\nAnd yeah the senators are accusing him of being a rape is with all the evidence without the Evan it'd be in fact they're ... and being a gang rape is\nWithout the evidence of of being there they say believe all women or men or women don't tell the truth but it's a majority doesn't matter that's why we judge every case individually because that's the only way that you can do it in America and I do believe that ... Americans\nUnderstand that they understand basic fairness\nAnd when they see I'm not just the radicals but the mainstream of the Democrat Party the mainstream of the party that are arguably has more people supporting it mhm\nNot by much but maybe more people supporting it then the Republicans mhm\nJust looking at the last election on the popular vote out the electoral college vote or when they see that they say I don't really wished to be a part of that that's just that's crossing the line that that's no type of and and and when you find out that you know the\nThe fact is they're the ones that burned Dr Ford it was a Dianne Feinstein sheep burn the victim Chinese though one that wouldn't keep the anonymity of the victim right it was the Democrat who leaked it\nIt was the Democrats right it was either find of Feinstein's office or one of her staffers or it was the the the congresswoman\nRight was it was that or her staff that said it had to be one of those do right\nAnd so when you look at it you ... all you see is from the Democrats is manipulation across the board character assassination across the board not the no belief and the presumption of innocence the stereotyping the bigotry\nAll women all need to be believed all white men white men or ... white men can't and people look at that stage and it's just like stop it well\nI think you two we have to keep in mind the and this isn't a this was recent history we don't have to go back to the Democrats in the sixties recent history you have in it because again the same side that said we're going to stand\nUp for women called the women who voted for Trump self massaging as\nThey in fact the candidate herself after she lost said well the problem is is that women listen to their husbands the husbands tell them how to vote [laughter] here and she was stupid\nBecause your husband has to tell you how to vote your son even your boss tells you how to vote your stupid and can't make a decision for yourself which has Democrats\nThere to be believed or not if they vote with their hearts and minds and the twenty sixteen election against Hillary no theirself massage Ernest which first they will tell you for whatever reason they hate women\nPolitical history headlines right here or San Francisco chronicle activists blame white women after Susan Collins says she'll vote for Kavanaugh right ah [laughter] ah critics blame white women the rap after Susan Collins a a a cabin up of a speech\nYeah because ... was women women were were the oppress women were the victims in general until they lost and now it's that women of color are the victims they blame white women well I don't know\nDr forged genetic makeup or her her ethnicity background but she appears to be and a white\nAnd and what it comes across as is you just will do anything to get a win right you won't show compassion to of victim\nYou will slander people you will defame people you will say that the presumption of innocence should not be part of the the the the process you say at one point that all women should be believed than you demonize other women\nAre there is no consistency to the mindset except we will do anything to get a win and I do believe that's why you had the reaction of many independents who say there's a complete total lack of any type of fairness\nAny type of ... it's the Democrats were screaming for civility like McCain and as you and I said after the McCain's funeral we said by the way this will be gone Monday\n... this will be gone as soon as a hearing this was all completely gone and you've seen them taking it up to a level where there was a possibility if McCain was alive today and he and Lindsey Graham would have stood side by side\nYes I could see a ... a John McCain after the behavior of the left in this process making the same type of comments that Lindsey Graham\nEight six six Ninety right I [noise]\nReally bug with more red are ready to do with a record eerie McNamara [noise]\nThat seat she's

make you happier bring it up because it appears the cabinet confirmation is not going to end up by a democratic congressman Jared ... a New York who would if the Democrats take the house but come the house judiciary chairman has already talked about launching an investigation\nAnd then to alleged misconduct by Capitol Nancy Pelosi says she wants to see the FBI interviews in the second background check it doesn't sound like this is going to ask well if a while now and November at that makes sense I Hope everybody running for the house in these purple districts\nWill ask that will be asked a question do sport in teaching judge Kavanaugh based on five allegations none of which could be cooperative and he won an outcome so badly that you would basically turned the law upside down a all I can say is that this is going to the streets at the ballot box\nOr I'm gonna I'm never campaign against her colleague in my life\nThat's about to change I'm going to go throughout this country\nAnd let people in these ... you know purple states a red states where Trump won know what I saw you know what I think about this process now we were talking before we came on they are and I said that you have a list\nOf ... the all the people that the president has that are on the less for potential nominees math what's your point\nFor here's my point this is a list of compiling November but he actually put it out or during the campaign they're twenty something people on this list I'm asking Chuck Schumer name five nine three name one that would be okay with the\nThreat of a novel is a mainstream judge our to chosen at five and ... a Bush supporter then everybody running for president on our side believed that Brett Kavanaugh and ... or sick or outstanding conservative jurists the other side wants to cancel the election so Chuck\nYou want somebody new look at this list and see if there's anybody a great too but what you want to do the Senator Schumer is overturned the election you pick the judges were not going to let you pick the jak 'cause if you want to paint judges then you need to win the White House\nWhen a a bottle of wine I voted for two judges that have pit so Chuck Schumer name one person on this list she thinks acceptable\nThere is a tough pollen in the New York times today than that attacks you I Want to put some about Frank Bruni writes\nI Can't think of another Republican whose journey from anti Trump outraged pro Trump ... was quite so illogical or half a sad end he suggests that you are auditioning\nFor a play is Jeff Sessions as attorney general your response or a Frank you don't know what you're talking about in your world Frank is a noble cause to destroy judicial candidates whose conservative\nOr the the Thomas lido more now Cavanaugh I'm bipartisan when it makes sense\nAh I've tried to having good disposition costs like my job but don't mistake that I don't care about the conservative cause\nSo if I made you upset because I Would not generalize McCarthyism thing good and I think I can survive in South Carolina well\nYou know the thing is is that uh I think Lindsey Graham needs to get off the [laughter] that was what he really thinks first of all I think it is going to be a positive if he's campaigning I'm a second of all I think the momentum from the from uh the uh the outrage\nThat he delivered a there on Capitol Hill that day I think will I I think\nThat is that needs to be carried through but not just through the election not just through the mid term election it needs to be carried through and that attitude needs to be carried\nThrough a on important things that that ah that matter beyond that including a legislative items and other and and who knows what kinds of other nomination process we may

I Would have taken it immediately and taken into Grassley then they would have gone to the FBI to do a background check but everything would have been anonymous\nAnd what and what the what you just heard too was the failure to recognize how Ford's story changed\nYou know and and they talk about how the remarry story change how the sweat story changed but look at how the Ford story change but but the point was on the political picture of being believable the scenario that was that was their\nStarted with a he said or she said he said\nWell then are we developing a pattern with the second and third no they fell apart and then we look back at the first one and realized it also changed and was falling apart\nWhat they what they were trying to point out here was she could have been the victim the one person to centrally if she were to give him a Dr Ford or to have given her testimony and nothing else happened she could have been the one and it could have been at least plate or spend with out the evidence to back it up\nIn a way that might have influenced votes\nBut because of the behavior and they mentioned\nCollins making the or the you know talking about having these role in her speech but it's\nThat happen all of that happened because of what because of the left and made it happen because the people sitting on this panel helped make it happen\nTo you and you think about it too because of the narrative that every woman must be believed mhm and after Ford and again her story was like ... the story itself is incredible yet right being told that was their major talking point you've got to believe\nThat the the alleged victim the alleged victim if it's a woman alleged victim must be believe we've seen the science we know it\nMust be ... and then you get a second and third\nThat also are not credible then you start destroying that narrative at that point right I Believe that's what they're probably saying even though they are the ones that plane you need to believe all the women all the time and they help even not you know they're they're yeah they're just you know even Chuck Todd is making the point well that really isn't true\nYeah well so is the this is the version of a right after the twenty sixteen election or we need to go to the heartland and listen to their voices huh that's basically what you see except for the fact\nThat it had greater substance en route and relevance to it I mean they ... they were right by the way in in in November of twenty sixteen when they said that but there was no expectation they were going to do just that in this case they're looking back on it and and recognizing\nAnd again they were part of carrying that narrative\nHelping to form those narratives along the way and then saying yeah well we shouldn't have played it that way it shouldn't have been played that way\nYou when when you look at well I have an empty a stormy Daniels'\nCase that\nNo one absolutely no one is shocked that a playboy billionaire had an affair no and again not shocked not surprised and also not politically motivated either way by it\nBut the let creates these narratives they give out and out of the the the ability to introduce the credibility if you will from their perspective not ours to introduce the sweating to claim\nIt must be because he's got a legitimate claim and legal claim against Trump now there must be something that he's got was sweating it must be legit\nIt's if it's against Trump Trump so it has to come out because there there must be some legitimacy to it even if there is that like I said the the only other point that I'd like to make is because this is what I Wonder and again this is a completely totally unfounded allegation without anything to back it up whatsoever but everybody will
