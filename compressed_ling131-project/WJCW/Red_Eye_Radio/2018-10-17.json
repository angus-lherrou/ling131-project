trying to hold do my share of there\nBut I have a story on Hillary now I Want to get a little while and the Democrats really fear that she's going to run again\nThat yeah that's why the more I thought about the more about it that's my number one choice\nThat the others that you you know I'd love to see ... guys crazy loon Tucker Carlson phrase from is not that bad right\nA sleazy porn lawyer bought a let me know what you think Andy in New York City you're on with mark Hi Andy\nYeah Hi thanks for taking my call [noise]\n[noise] um I you address was interested in why there's such a big um such big talk about Saudi Arabia and what they did [noise] um you know what they did was terrible book you know ... you know even if though to do something small that's all right but it's such a big they're making such a big uproar about it\nI mean you know I'm sure that they they have Saudi Arabia you know it doesn't have the cleanest record\nKing Solomon doesn't for sure [noise] um and I mean generally get involved in things abroad when it when it's in our interest you know when when we can prevent you know bigger a human rights you know you know crisis or [noise] or you know to expand our power abroad you know to protect us you know as you know offensive is defense\nBut in this case I mean she wasn't a US citizen I'm here to green card\nOn you know if they did it in it isn't our best interest to just you know the big player in the middle east for us you know to protect us against Iran so like whoa you know they they help us out why um what's the big uproar but you know\nThey've done things like this in the past that we've known about you know just I guess it wasn't so publicly you know he I mean this king Solomon he's locked elect all ... you know the princes in a hotel for a few months\nTo get to make them pay ransom saying he's not he's not exactly a moderate you know it is not your regular guys like I'm a stay you know it's trying to understand that\nWell let me see if I can add something to your thoughts about it\nLook at the ... it's always been a difficult a jigsaw puzzle out there in the middle east right the Israel's our basic friend and we can count on them but the other players or you know like Saudi Arabia the war more anti Israel than they are now they both have the one side of interest in terms of Iran trying to stop Iran\nBought I gotta tell you I just thought of it maybe it's a visceral reaction the idea that this guy goes in there and I'm not trying to say the great about him because\nHe was a supporter of the Muslim Brotherhood and you know ... they're just they're enemies of ours are as they weren't in Egypt\nOr so I'm not a big fan of what he believes in in that sense but to go when someone or be lured into an embassy which is you know he's supposed to have a special status when a country has an embassy in another country that if there is in their territory their land\nYou lord in there and and then you chop them up and you assassinate him and it just so revolting to people I I think that's what was going on in your right it's a complicated situation as we need their oil and we need them to find Iran\nIt's very difficult situation for President Trump but just the thought I I must have been taught to me too I I felt badly from even though I'm ... I think I wouldn't agree with them probably many as\n... yeah but that's you know agree with and the ... getting getting killed like that is horrible I'm\nSo ... yeah ...\n... even though there should be you know definitely should be an uproar and they should be condemned for it but I mean though that they really want a large scale it seems like a large scale you know cutting off you know businesses and\nAnd ... and I mean I I don't know if it's in America's Best interest to do that like just you know for this even though it's it is a horrible incident but\nFor this alone I don't think you know I'm In the bigger picture you know ... ...\nYeah I I I I cringe when you send cutting off business I Know that's bad and this and this story\nBut um you're right we we need them we need them badly and that's why I say President Trump ... isn't a very difficult situation and there are people like Lindsey Graham who is terrific on in the cabinet hearings now saying hey yeah I'm never going there again while in this guys and the princes in power and the and the Marco Rubio a ... there are people on our side saying\nWe we can't allow this to happen you ... you know which is crazy sounds you have to have some civility in this crazy world right you don't want the president was assassinated you don't take out food and even if you can\nYou don't do stuff like that that's why the the Kennedy thing John F. Kennedy thing was was so outrageous it to this day I'm One of the few talk show host I should say now\nThat does think there was a conspiracy I a little kid but uh I I've followed this stuff and um I you just don't do that you just you know what I'm saying I don't know if the Russians were involved the mafia was involved\nI don't know for sure I I'm not seeing Lee Harvey Oswald wasn't involved but you know this there's something about you don't take out people and that's why by the way he ... he was so outrageous by a Obama a because he was becoming our friend\nA difficult yeah so you you get it and it was right he didn't he writes for the Washington Post and stuff\nIt you know I don't want all the different countries and assassinating them go ahead\nI Know I I I Do feel I mean my my impression is is that let's say Russia you know they just recently had a story you know in in England with the ... I'm I'm sure you know it's probably no you know in Washington is probably like you know\nKnown that a lot of many countries you know Russia I'm sure shooting takes out you know yes people going down his political opponents you know here and there it's not it's not really um [noise] it's not uncommon\nYou know so it's just interesting the reaction I guess because it just became like ... it's a very public the public to know you know the story\nAnd he ... he goes he yeah he goes in there and it wasn't his girlfriend waiting outside and he said you know if I don't come out and you know here's what you do\nAnd and he just disappeared and they made it worse no we always say that the the if the not even the crime itself but the cover up\nAnd they said something they were never in you know they weren't involved and they came up the story that it was a wad of interrogation that ah got got went badly yeah a ... that that's that's a little crazed like well yeah the show they're\nPretty sure they're pretty bad [laughter]\nIf you ... yeah this wasn't a by the way it was mentioned my produced last night this wasn't a job interview that he was going in for that that would that would be a job interview that went badly you know the incredible hulk I think people even on our\nSide are reacting viscerally and I I don't blame him because I felt the same way you can drop 'em up and when they brought didn't he brings suitcases it's reported it and you know how do they think it's funny I mean so I don't want to be gross that way on the air but I I think all of that stuff\nYou may be right just the fact that we knew about there's always espionage there's always dirty stuff going on but this one way played out was not good\nYeah thank you Andy I appreciate your call very much by the way how old are you I'm a twenty two I thought you sound young who is your choice on the Democrats' side who would you like to see run against president I'm\nYou can pick whoever he wants to run with him is as his vice president running mate and it'll be hard for anybody because that recognition the incumbency being president is very difficult to defeat in rarely happened he he would likely run and pick a vice presidential nominee to go with him\nIf it is and you send a crack house that yeah the house has to do at ... getting a second so people know you miss it correctly the housing peaches the\nPresident but then the Senate has to try a the president and and they decide whether he gets thrown out of office so Bill Clinton was impeached a lot of people don't know this he was impeached by the house but the Senate wants to know part of it so he never went through a trial or anything\nYeah exactly\nAnd I'll read you get out there and probably get a little outlook and Nikki Haley I'm from South Carolina if she was governor there and I would hurt getting it to either bans foreign policy I think Haley Republican mayor you know\nYou're you know ... ... you know if they did they win either I I Would like I wouldn't mind Nikki Haley put it without one Democrat I Know why\nI'm tired of the White House look like a reality show you got K. K. out you know ... ... ... came out with a crazy because I'm black and I came up with our way out you know it's just like any of\nThat whole ... ... email us ... ... ... ... a show no respect for the ... and I'm like man\nI mean if you go to put in a favorite color oh it's been put on it and how ... oh my God it was this in a host but that ... states of America who allowed to\nCome all Republican Democrat to wear white outlook by any great oh my God I got I'm ...

I agree I didn't but that other caller when he was so nice and it made a number of mistakes like ... not mistakes but we disagree on by him that he he likes them a lot but I was given this chance he also said that\nUm what's his name that spirit house becomes vice president I didn't want to interrupt them on that\nThat's not what happened that if you remember with Ford and Rockefeller they get the you know the Gerald Ford got the ... we want that but I'm the look here to me the noxious but if you're on the other side he he's got the most votes in terms of there right now but that could be name recognition\nBut I agree with you he can be pretty obnoxious but\nThis whole crew does anybody they let me think I never asked that question is there's some of the list I read I don't know if you heard me the first hour\nIs there's someone as I look down the names that I liked person oh I got someone I think Bernie Sanders is a nice guy he's very foolish he's way out in the last one I think

that you get I mean it's crazy he you know his views are so far out there I'm just looking at the list there's nobody else I like I'm trying to think of someone I can say I like\nI don't like Oprah Winfrey not that she's going to run I'm looking at the names here Michael ... are you kidding me\nOh you got to give the other side some credit I think Bernie's probably nice chance to be the nicest

because they think Trump's got enough starch and his britches to go after her and do it right this time but\nOn the on another hand you're asking who I liked that she runs one of the things you know people talk about Trump and the way he speaks at all that when I go in for brain surgery I don't care what the guy speaks like I don't care if he tweets bleach whatever\nI just could that he's good with a knife\nAnd Trump is good at what he's doing is rock and the place I don't care what he says in the middle of the night I really don't I think it's great that you just end running the liberal

like you\nKnow what I said you would agree with you\nYeah you said you've been listening to I mean that's what I said I I just care what he does he's totally shocked me how good he is a I think he's
