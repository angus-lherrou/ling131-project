Thursday night that although he will walk his daughter down the aisle at her wedding Saturday his plans will not affect Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation vote\nScheduled for the same day ... speaking to Shannon brain which means just had to be late last night right a and a Fox News ... said he personally called cabin up Thursday evening and told him I'm going to be there to vote for you as needed so that isn't going to delay anything you know it's funny because you said\nWell you know it wears his daughter getting married and in Montana it legit you inside right I don't think he wants to anybody you know\nI'd probably doesn't want anyone to know and because and that really spells out how crazy this thing is a and has become the left bullies going direct especially after confronting a Jeff Flake that it's work\nThat they're you know that the tactic is not only working but acceptable\nAnd it will shame you out of a restaurant will uh will confront you on the elevator will anywhere and everywhere\nAs directed or I guess encourage further encouraged by Maxine Waters anywhere and everywhere it doesn't matter where you are\nGetting their face well that becomes dangerous because it's\nImpossible for somebody to be able to assess a threat just imagine in your everyday life and you're not a lawmaker or\nUnless we have lawmakers listening which we often do and we thank you for that but you're not included here you're just walking around grocery store [laughter] thank you or the Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell for listening and and also Senator Lindsey Graham for this yet like this I guess and\nProbably Rand Paul although he's screaming know all the time um but\n\nWe actually love rental but if you're walking around you know in public the average person\nAnd someone just ran up to you and stuff\nAnd screaming in your face you wouldn't know what they're doing and you wouldn't know you don't you don't know what the threat level is and and and and certainly it's it's different when you were Jeff Flake and you're confronted in the way he was and you you you know why they're in your face but you can't assess the threat level in public you can't you just cannot\nYou don't know what the person who is capable of doing if they're the you know they're physically harm you um it's it's impossible to\nAssess that so as such security has been ramped up\nA tremendous uh the restaurant in fact that where Ted Cruz was shamed out of the restaurant a first of all kudos to the restaurants saying you know because you can hear a person in the background on that video saying look you can't you know telling the protesters look you can't be in here this is a private you know business\nSo you saw the letter writing that Rand Paul's wife wrote to CNN ... and and challenge Cory Booker and everybody else saying look you people are you you're you are enabling yes these threats you have to own it now 'cause ratchet Maxine Waters especially by and yeah and you need you need to stop and she directly when after Cory Booker\nRight you know that's the whole thing is that it ... it they have to take their responsibility in it they have to be the

[noise]\n[noise] Hi for confirmation Trump rally vague and barbecue that the nation's highest court has a new justice and Brett Kavanaugh is correspondent Linda Kenny on reports\nRepublican John Cornyn says the confirmation process for Brett Kavanaugh traveled a bumpy road there is no lower road than the one we haven't been on\nTop Senate Democrat Charles Schumer says there is one more avenues that can be used to effect change change must come from where change in America always sneak in the ballot box cabin on now at the ranks of conservatism according can affect the American landscape for generations\nPresident Trump rally supporters in Topeka, Kansas ahead of the midterm election\nYeah well it's yeah it's just up the radical Democrats and that's what they make a fire electing a Republican House and a Republican Senate\nWent into a room and had a meeting\nWe don't know what was discussed but\n\nIt appears that it's really coming down to those now because you have essentially Heitkamp is said she's a nose so essentially right now the only Democrat it looks like you might be able to count on is Joe Manchin\n\nIf you've got every Republican on board assuming\nThat a Jeff Flake is yes\nThen that gets you to fifty two\nJeff Flake is a no you're still on the soft headcount you're still it's if you want with mansion with match\nIf for some reason Manchin pools out or Murkowski or they it doesn't appear that Collins will if\nCollins had a concern she would have issued that concerned\nAbout the report saying I'm not sure we got everything at the very least she would question\nPraising the report tells me you can count on that vote\nSo right now you're looking at I mean I think at the very least fifty with vice president ... at fifty one\nOr the word from and and there was another story in the in the wall Street Journal that the you know the GOP right now is a\nIs really upbeat about the confirmation process they\nYou know they it's a\nIf you look at it that the the talk right now is that they're confident\nOr so you\nGet through a\nA culture which will happen sometime during the day on friday as you mentioned Gary the process will start mid morning\nUm but then the actual vote may not happen until later in the afternoon right when it by the time to get through the procedure one with the actual both take place and then there was a third and they've already our lives the clock starts starts at that point yet up and they can take up to thirty hours it may not take thirty hours\nThey could end the debate before thirty hours but assuming they'll use the entire thirty hours\nAnd they might not especially on a Saturday the media might give them the the news media cable news might give them\nYou know all the time of the world\nAre so you look at the the so called hopefuls for twenty twenty\nYour usual suspects\nA warrant and all of them looking to get cameras time\nOr the debate might you know go on the full thirty\nJust assume that it will they'll that's that's why you've got the rule assume that it will so that\nPuts it late into Saturday Night as you mentioned earlier Gary\nDepending on where they landed on the the the clock lands on the culture wrote maybe into early Sunday Morning\nBut that gives them there's the I guess the wiggle room or the enough room for senator Danes to get you know home from the wedding I guess or or back to work for the wedding\nAnd uh as daughter's wedding and we wish your daughter and her\nSoon to be husband all the best uh but they'll he'll give back he's saying he'll get back in time to devote so that tells us is probably going to be a late Saturday Night but\nYou know I I I think about all the ... you know I'm just sitting here just contemplating and thinking of all the\nAll the protests the violence the civil disobedience when certain things you know a a when Trump was elected to you know the the women's march show all all of these things that go on\nAnd if you look over the last eight years and the number of protest remember Occupy Wall street you\nKnow all all that that that uh that went on all the the\nThe occupying of city properties and everything else that went on what you're seeing now\nAnd you have a party that constantly does that\nYou have another party that really doesn't do that at All right you see now the getting into the faces of people which can be quite intimidating but here's the question is it affective\nFor them right has it been effective in and you go all the way back like I said we go let's go back to the Obama administration I mean you can look at you can look at the uh you can look at the uh\nThe Tea Party but the Tea Party was completely and totally non non violent did not know know riots no tear gas nothing like that mhm\nSo you look at it and you get into the Occupy Wall Street right right where you're actually trespassing and you know taking over and wanting to camp out and you know there were riots in certain cities that that happened\nWhen the police tried to push them off\nBut at this is almost the exclusive domain\nAll the left and therefore the Democrats sure yeah and you think about the run that they had had since all of this you know really I'll I'll look at Occupy Wall street as just the beginning of of this portion of it has it been effective\nFor them when it comes to the vote do people actually respond to it or do they believe that the intimidation tactics\nWill actually work and change for example they're not you know you you you could see if they might be a you know threatening\nA just a a you know the the senators that are on you know a lot of you know on the edge right now right okay on the margins\nBut they're not they're going after everybody mhm I'm here whether it's Grassley doesn't care whether McConnell what do they really think that that's affected or is it the fact that when you are just so full of rage\nBecause that's what it is it's just insane rage that they're filled with right yeah just anger and ... and and rage\nIs it just a desperation tactic or do they actually believe that is effective I just I I really wonder and [laughter] and I was thinking to myself here before I started talking about this I'd like to sit down and talk with them all that wouldn't be possible [laughter]\nSo I'm never going to find out because I'm never going to be able to sit down and say you don't tell us what's your strategy is that right\nWell I I I think after the ... like a thing I think\nThey feel empowered to some extent they feel that it is effective to some extent but I think it's probably a lot of I was gonna say little of both I think it's a lot of both\nActually that they believe after confronting mansion and after you know\nThe behavior in restaurants and everything else and shaming people out of restaurants I mean think about that theory\nThat youre\nNot protesters in a restaurant you work there it's your job\nAnd you refuse in one case to do it\nFor because Sarah Huckabee Sanders\nIs eating the food you're going to prepare and serve\nCan you imagine that can you imagine being in that mentality you\nKnow\nIf I worked in a restaurant I don't care what I was doing in that restaurant\nAnd bar rock Obama and his family came in the last thing that I Would do is refused to do my job\nMe dot doing my job is not going to change his politics or change anything that I disagreed with that he did\nAnd that's the mentality but that's where they that's where they live we go back to the one restaurant where you had a man\nHappened to be African American wearing a make America great again hat\nAnd the staff was shaming him at a stable to the point that his companion I don't know if it was his girlfriend or his wife was in tears\nAnd they kept it up they kept it up they kept it up\nI Can't imagine\nI cannot imagine I wouldn't be able to face my friends and family if I did something\nSo despicable\nJust shameful just shameful if you want to talk about getting a picket going out on the steps the SCOTUS\nAs long as you're not trespassing are breaking the law I encourage that I don't care what you believe I don't care what you're promoting are protesting for or against\nAnd I remember it was about you know we've talked about it before is probably about seven years ago when um and and you know the person that I'm Talking about and and it was really you know somebody who I considered it a casual friend ... you know ... do the more professionally and and and uh\nThey were in a conversation and it was a ... a black man who was a huge fan of my show now I sort of knew her politics were more of\nThe liberal bent but she went absolutely insane we know we haven't talked since that point and she completely rejected me as a friend because in a conversation a black man said he loved our show right\nThink about that and that was really my first taste of that type of insanity\nBecause that person you're referring to uh\nYou described it before went\nFrom zero to you know basically right or just just a small talk we do have good to see a a thanks for stopping by that kind of thing to all

long as he wants to run for that house seat\nUm and I have friends there that say oh man he's got his hands and everything you know so um yeah uh\nThat's different though when you broadened it out to

against ah the the current Governor Greg Abbott\nUm that's you know again\nHe's he's very well in the lead but well when you broaden it out to the state right level you've got to go wild you got to realize that you you have to pretend you're in the middle\nWell then and that's a bit of work is trying to do is try and do you try to picture himself and he's not in the middle on anything no but he he realizes that he has to lie even to get dumber he can't be truthful even with Democrats in Texas\nAnd hope to get elected and that's the realization I mean the Democrats used to be that way all the

process to keep her name\nAnd have the FBI do a background check to see if any of this was true without her name\nEver being known\nAnd Dianne Feinstein really said excuse my language to hell with that if we're going to use is a politically\nAnd knowing\nThat linking it\nWould make it public\nWhere she's still quaint today she didn't want to come forward right\nShe's still claims that it is that today so if that was the case and I don't know whether that was a case I'm just looking at the different scenarios ... but if that was the case it was the Democrats that be trade who they thought\nWas a victim of sexual abuse they betrayed her which is why we said they didn't care about her claim they never cared about her claim because if they truly cared about her claim and her wanting to keep it secret to keep her anonymity\nAnd could have followed the process that existed that they helped create with the Democrat majority in two thousand nine enough to have a process yet for somebody to come forward keep their you know ... keep it quiet and still have a part of the confirmation process and and a part of the judgment\nOf why you would or would not want to confirm or the particular nominee\nBut Feinstein and the Democrats know that the only way to change those you know they were getting down to four or five votes that's what this is all about\nTo change any of those votes as the political pressure\nAnd the political pressure is built in the media and so you can't do it officially finance or Dianne Feinstein knew\nThere was no way of doing this officially\nBecause it would never get to the media because Senate rules prohibited from getting to the media now we know why Lindsey Graham was so livid\nLast Thursday a week ago today\nThis is what he was talking about\nViolating the process and the rules\nCircumventing those rules and processes along the way this is what he was getting too because that now the puzzle comes together Feinstein new\nBy submitting this to the FBI early on as soon as she got it and it being part of the background check it wouldn't have seen the light of day Dr Ford's name would not be known to anyone but her friends colleagues and family because that claim\nWould not have still would not be substantiated because they even with all of this they haven't substantiated anything except for the fact that she's making the claim\nAnd that means it wouldn't have left\nAh at all\nBecause it would have been apart as the rural states of that three oh to report and they cannot divulge any of the details from that report again keep in mind if there's a criminal case against a nominee\nWell that's public the people versus whoever that's public that would be no\nBut there but that's it's not the case when it's just a client when someone's making a claim and there was no report or authorities involved\nIn that claim but at the time so\nVery clear why the Democrats chose this route now and didn't and didn't want to go forward on the thirtieth you wait until after the vetting process the background checks are complete\nAnd then you get to the media and let the media help you hopefully build that public pressure that political pressure to drive that those four or five votes\nThan the Senate that were on the fence\nAnd now uh like I said today is going to be an interesting day I I wanted to leave earlier I said a ... ... two hours the shown repeated the rest of the day so I go home and go to sleep and wake up at seven o'clock because I won't just because I I I Am\nAbsolutely a as interested as you could possibly be in wondering how the Democrats are going to try to stall this another week\n... what are they thinking because you know they are ... are they are we got to be able to solve this in some way and so we know that we're going to hear the typical\nThings like well we don't have enough time to actually look at this report a twenty four hours a isn't a is isn't a enough enough time while we'll pay we believe that there's ... some cooperation here we disagree with the Republicans and we don't we believe further investigation is needed knowing that the Republicans\n\nAt this moment are not going to break the protocol and the rules that the Democrats created in two thousand nine to while the irony uh and and so I you know I don't know where that will do but I'm sure the Republicans have already said\nThey've had a look and say okay what different scenarios are out there who wants to release this I mean they know now the Democrats are going to the Democrats and Republicans\nBoth no you know what's in it and if the Republicans say look there's nothing here it's the same as it was last week\nWe're going ahead with the vote I think that no matter what the Democrats say they should go on with the vote and even if he isn't confirmed then you make it an election issue delaying this another week is not going to change anything\nThat we all know right now you you you did it once you go forward with it you have the votes Saturday if you don't have the votes than you make it an election issue\nInternally no doubt the pressure is going to be on those uh four or five people including mansion a flake or who was shown you know clearly a weakness and uh what they were so what what what they'll tell you on the left the ability to be thoughtful or consider it\nBut if you have\nA\nA I'm Sorry that was funny I Know I'm the but the but that's what will happen internally externally it will be about building the political pressure still in that and this is the narrative\nThis will be the narrative from here until we did not have enough time there was not enough time the FBI did an interview enough people\nThere is no way that could possibly know because they didn't even interview capital or Ford well they have both of them on record as a matter of public record as to their claims each of them\nSo all of that is a you know is is the political part of it um but you're right Gary I think in terms of now going forward are you the the the motion to invoke cloture was made yesterday\nOr the cloture vote will happen friday\nA than they will er and if if they've got the headcount then\nThey're going to move forward with a vote which can happen as early as Saturday I suspect they will not want to waste one minute\nA ... in terms of getting in Saturday and getting that done if they believe they've got those votes\nEven at fifty because the veep can be fifty one the tie breaker then they're going to move on to\nThe the the majority leader will not waste any time and going forward and say what you will about Mitch McConnell and we've said plenty about 'em over the years\nBut he has done since Trump has been president\nI think a a very decent job I don't know what grade I would give him a but certainly I think he's done a decent job across the board and bringing the party together on a number of things to get them done legislative\nThis this rises above legislation because as we know those decisions made at the highest court Thirty years yeah this is this is going this this is a big effect this huge affects the direction of the country and ... right now that the majority leader\nAh along with corn and uh\nAnd and a number of others right now oh well maybe not right now but last night and and just an hour or two we'll be whipping those votes together and ... and and saying exactly what we just said this is too important to wait any longer\nEight six six Ninety read I\nOne of the key agricultural based achieved said recent

I Know I don't want it appearing in my home no please\nI ... yeah yeah\nWell there was a there there's a TV show it's a British TV show it's on AMC\nIMC in the in the state chose it it's called humans that's about roe you've told me which by the way then the the the TV show on USA mister robot is all about humans but I I ... that's here nor there but\nIn the in in that they kind of deal with that in one of the first episodes of humans um you know because there was a like a there is a\nA program that you can put in to the robot and then engage\nUm but\nReally the robot thing is there to do your cooking and cleaning and everything else and they look very humid\nAnd it's interesting because they had to cast it with a bunch of people people of course who look like robots which is also

me\n[laughter] I I don't even want to [laughter] I might have finally my I'm done now found I don't know\nIt either keeps going down the road to further development\nRight ... because it's surviving as an industry or goes away\n\nYou and I we said that for a long time when we get our eighties or nineties we're going to look back and go\nOh man [laughter]\nWe we are so doomed\nOh gosh no I I remember when we were talking about had to be ten years ago round but remember this study came out robots will have rights by twenty fifty six yeah that is going to be ramped up to I think they're
