[noise]\nMoving closer honoring the victim's family and friends says hurricane Michael gaining strength right now is it barrels towards the Gulf Coast forecasters warn it is expected to hit later this week as a life threatening category three storm\nAnd they were all just march and aren't as strong as expected to dump four to eight inches of rain on parts of Florida Alabama and Georgia and are actually\nHurricane warnings out for portions of I'm far southern Alabama across the Florida Panhandle and then there was a surrounded by some tropical storm warnings and watches and it was pretty much will cover near the landfall so what the impacts expected to begin early Wednesday and then continuing during the day Wednesday\nIt is the substance of where we stand on the issues and us explaining the substance\nThat really really counts but one of the things that we have done\nIs we try to find those on the left that aren't trying to be political hacks\nA which means those on the left that agreed with us ah and we\nAnd we try to bring we we tried to bring the intellectually honest\nA left in and we've done that in the analysis for example of\nPresident Trump and many of the different controversies that the the media believes that uh he has created into those people are Jonathan Turley a the a well known constitutional lawyer and also Alan Dershowitz both did not vote for Trump mhm uh\nEspecially you know more I Know more about his political past than even Turley but he is an absolute\nA dyed in the wool a liberal\nBut he believes in the constitution and he believes in the bill of rights he is an old school left as sort of like a communal paleo that we are playing on the many many Times She's old school too and they don't know they look at the Democratic party and they say\nExactly like we do it they're they're becoming the mindset of a fascist\nThat the authoritarian streak is not in Trump\nIt's in the Democrats and well on Fox yesterday they brought in Bryan dean right who is a Democrat strategist who said Democrats will suffer the rightful consequences of using the victims of sexual assault to advance a political agenda\nHe was on a Fox and friends and he explain\nWhat he meant Brian van right and joins us now to explain\nWell I think what we saw at the beginning of August we had an opportunity to do the right thing which is work with Republicans quietly privately and investigate those allegations not in the public domain not do a a fact finding mission in front of cameras what to do it in a strictly\nAnd instead we used those allegations have the last possible minute and we rally that power base and we frankly traumatize a whole bunch of people are not just missed four but also a lot of folks in America who have a suffer from sexual assault\nSo that is the strategy that I found appalling are watching these these past couple of months so of the two parties who's more energized frying going into the midterms [noise]\nI think we have a horse race I think it's neck and neck I I think that's a real question or for November is going to be where do these independence fall so what's really interesting is that the polling shows the independents are leaning ... ever so slightly rather to uh to Trump and to the Republicans\nAre this is especially true of men a white man Hispanic man and those folks who do not have a college education\nAnd other words that is the name Trump coalition and so if in fact that can pays happened that's that's really the\nCoalition coming home for November So really benzene the strategy that they are Democrats employed or has backfired\n\nYou know the ... and here's another thing that the women and and I've talked about there's five or six women that I Know that I've been close to for a long long time ... all of them at least over a decade\nAll professional women when I first met them ... and and I was ten to Fifteen Years ago not that political the majority I think one in their mid to late thirties the other in their forties and fifties early fifties ... and all professionals\nOkay all executives and professionals and when I first met them none of them really political\nAnd they knew that when I first met them that I was a talk show host and it was whole home now when I talk to them total interest in what's going on in politics all of them over the course of ten to Fifteen Years not because of my influence uh want to make that clear a are extremely conservative\nThey are a whole\nNot if the Republicans there appalled at the Democrats\nAnd so there is this mainstream media narrative that women naturally\nUh are attracted to the side of\nDr Ford and feel sympathy and hate the Republicans for what has happened well the woman that I've talked to and again uh you know I've ... I've explain you know what what their background is\nEvery one of them know the fact that Dianne Feinstein could have kept a secret they look at it and they say the Democrats lose across the board here the Democrats lose because they could have kept quiet\nThey could have kept that she was she claimed she want it now they're suspicious as to who's telling the truth here but they said even if you believe\nDr Ford and that she really truly wish to keep it quiet\nThen the Democrats completely betrayed her Dianne Feinstein completely portrayed her\nBecause as he just said and he's a democratic strategist\nThe Democrats had the chance to keep it all quiet to fulfill her wishes and still do an investigation and they said no we don't care about the woman who claimed she was sexually assaulted and wishes to have her anonymity we are going\nTo use her as a political football we say to that earlier and I'm sure there were Democrats dating down on a there's a democratic strategist saying the exact same thing that's what will hurt the Democrats is because that's what he as a Democrat believes that they have done well and that's the damage\nThat's his job is to assess essentially damage what works for them what doesn't work for them and it is not it did not work for them on any level but not only did you have that situation where they clearly leaked it to the media\nThen beyond that you had the overreach with the two additional accusers coming forward and ultimately the nail on the proverbial coughing and that the sweating the allegation that\nCame across from her by their hands through her lawyer ... that was not only overreach but it was clearly a tactic by Abernathy who clearly has it out for this current president\nSo I have to ask this question because you know after on on Saturday on on on Saturday when I heard okay we're going to you know but you're Jerrold Nadler okay if we take Congress we're going to impeach we're going to impeach\nWe're going to impeach we're going to impeach we're going to a beach and I thought that would die out because I thought to myself but that's a pretty bread a bad strategy you have lost in a variety of ways here I don't think this is a win for you so why would you go out and attempt to motivate\nThe right unless you believe you would motivate the left but still if you could impeach them you're not going to he's not going to leave\nYou know it'd be his Supreme Court seat you would need to go to the Senate\nNow and this is a question I was asking does the house or the Democrats who believe that they would be part of the house leadership and ... would be the head of the house Judiciary Committee\nA you know under under you know uh what would go on it\nIf if the Democrats won a the the the house um are they saying that because they believe that the people to both of them are idiots and they believe that they believe that impeachment means we can take them off the seat\nOr do they believe that this will just motivate their base and then they'll completely drop it if they win that they have no intention of of going after impeachment\nAnd him they'll scream obstruction by the the Republicans that that we wanted to get it done but the Republicans wouldn't let us get it done 'em and that we still want to get it done a it is one of those campaign promises that is definitely going to fall short rolled over to outlook is\nIf they had the if they had the the the majority of Republicans couldn't stop an investigation of and people\nWill not an investigation the investigation may happen but it's not going to be an impeachment there's there's the thing is it's the promise ultimately what that you'll remove him from the bench\nAnd that and not only what happened that that's not going to have and what are you gonna do Dr Ford said she she's done or he doesn't want to be part of it are are you going to subpoena all these women and bring them back again right so\nThat would be my question is democratic strategist are out there stating you've done damage to your own party wrap this well\nBecause here's a question\nWhen you start moving in that direction how did you move in that direction and go through the entire process without learning who leaked the media is not going to tell you because they don't have to reveal their ...\nBut the investigation if you look at an investigation where would go and it will be public I mean there's nothing here in terms of classified material that is going to be in place this will be a very public investigation how do you do that without revealing who\nLeaked it\nAnd we know who leaked it so the problem is\nPractices Allen facing dogs as a practice is her leadership skills\nWe were with people no matter their age income or background

without pleasing anybody with no matter what the president will announce\nLater today Tuesday and then oh he'll go to Iowa after he announced this\nUm and he'll talk about uh you know no doubt while he's in Iowa the you know that it is the corn state\nWhat he's proposing is raising a not a mandate on the blend but raising ... on the blend a Fifteen Percent\nAnd then allowing wanting to change the credit for uh those blanche so uh this is essentially would be kind of a cap and trade means ... approach well there are credits though that they that the\nOil companies can buy okay oh they don't want to put like right now they don't want to ah ... blend at ten percent\nThey can buy credits from other companies and then get the exemption so if they have those credits they're still compliant even if they're not blending up to ten percent he wants to allow them\nTo blend at Fifteen Percent and to sell it year round the pushback on selling it year round has been for eight Fifteen has been that or eat ten even is that\nEspecially with the Fifteen while the more ethanol you have in the blend the more smog there is\nWhich is why you don't see a Fifteen a guy's widespread and even the e ten blend um but the they want a Fifteen to be able to be sold year round\nVoluntarily and incentivized through changing the credit situation with those lenders\nWith okay companies so does it take to complete mandate offer you still mandated to they were ten percent there the ... the mandate is still at ten percent\nSo then it would be Fifteen Percent but the credits would give you the the incentive to do it even though I don't see\nA the oil companies are not ... they're not responding to this a proposed a it is just a proposal now but they're not they're not responding at all they they don't\nDoes here for this idea does does this increased the taxpayer subsidies\nFor ethanol a ... I have not seen that changing the only numbers change in terms of uh I guess dollars are changing hands is the credit now you would have to\nGo through of course a Congress to get those subsidies and everything else the president may say I will push for greater subsidies what is pushing for a year on the surface really is selling more ethical\nWhy yeah this is so dumb that doesn't well it doesn't have a mandate attached to it and the oil companies don't care about the\nCredits they don't care about the credits\nThat's not something that helps them if the government forces a mandate and that's what was being proposed the even President Trump has talked about it in the past raising the mandate right to Fifteen Percent right well if you do that that becomes a that becomes a big problem politically ... outside\nOf Iowa good I just I've read like three different articles on it and that's what I thought it was was okay you're trying to please both sides but you're not really pleasing anybody well because you're not mandating it the oil companies aren't going to do it right it's not a mandate on it so you're simply saying I'm going to allow them\nI'm going to allow I'm going to allow the industry to do what the industry doesn't wish to do right and sell it year round well I think you're probably going to see pushback\n... first of all I guess we'd have to see what the participation rate is well once I was ... the the wife cities like Houston in LA they don't want more smog\nWhat gas stations going to be the first to put want to put a Fifteen in when you do as well as I Do on the Internet is going to be fine you could damage your car you know of of a faster you could damage your lawn mower\nOr you or someone you love them one of the nearly one million Americans living with Parkinson's disease there is no known killer\nThat you have the power to help the teams that last night dissipating in a clinical trial then Michael J.

the panhandle and Big Bend area of Florida\nKeeping a watchful eye on hurricane Michael in fact uh so is Westwood One meteorologist John ... who joins us live right now good morning John ...\nGood morning guys so yeah we're looking at the possibility now of a major hurricane a a a hurricane at the level three or above that's greater than one hundred ten miles an hour hitting a in in about twenty four hours from now\nWhat changed over I guess a late Sunday and into Monday the forecast seem to change and showed the potential for the energy increasing in Michael what what was it that we were looking at or I guess you guys were looking at a that showed that change\nYeah well one of the things that are well a couple of things that will slow down a hurricane would be a wind shear we don't have that one of the things that will slow down a hurricane would be colder\nOcean temperatures we don't have that or lessening of low pressure none of the none of the uh data that we'd like to see that we'll see uh lessening of strength is a is a part of this particular forecast now\nSo uh that's where we are getting this rapid intensification as we move from a category one\nTo a major category ... storm\nJohn where do you see a hitting on the Florida Panhandle of most\nLike talking about yeah we're talking about the Big Bend area somewhere between the Appalachian coal which is down on a state road Ninety eight over to um oh just north of saint Petersburg let's say but we're going to see some road closures definitely guys will see I ten affected from Pensacola to Tallahassee\nWe could see sections of vice Seventy five shut down the right to in the Georgia or Florida line area so are truckers are going to play an important role in this thing getting supplies in and out of the region there'll be needs for diesel fuel and some rebuilding efforts\nYou know with Florence we talked about the reign of at this will be a rain event\nAnd a wind event uh we're looking at the possibility of up to twelve inches of rain\nAll within less than a twenty four hour period of time in that Big Bend area what about storm surge what is the threat there\nBig time or we're looking at a storm surge and wave heights in and around the a five to twelve foot range with a a major category ... storm so that's going to have its impact certainly coastal erosion\nWe'll see folks with a coastal interests are with a maritime industry and folks with\nIt was along the region affected so will definitely see some storm surge effect and I don't believe we have a full moon right now but if we did that would increase the likelihood of being under a higher tide certainly inundation being grader\nAt this uh Michael is moving quicker though than Florence it's a fast moving hurricane\nYes just slightly faster so it's expected to move into that area and make landfall as I mentioned in the Big Bend area we're looking right now about eight to nine o'clock tomorrow morning and um [noise]\nOr just a hope that everyone hates the warnings is we've got several I mean we're talking thirty six counties I think now under some sort of a advisory either get out or get ready to get out and of course the state of Florida it's been under the state of emergency now for uh about twenty four hours\nAs we look forward to later in the week we mentioned Florence our friends still in recovery mode after Florence what can they expect in terms of rainfall that might affect them later this week\nYeah we'll see this system move right on up through Georgia and then into portions of South Carolina and particularly southern uh North Carolina so\nNot good news for folks trying to dry out in any of that area from South Carolina into North Carolina uh we'll see not the twelve inches but certainly between three and five inches of rain but we got to remember those\nThose are creeks and rivers are swollen there the ground is already saturated so any amount of water not good for the Carolinas\nWestwood One meteorologist drawn trout thank God thank you so much for your time we appreciate it you got to guess\nJohn Will be on that for us in the in the coming days of course in a well

hurricane damage has not increased since Nineteen hundred global whether damage as a percent of global GDP actually fell from Nineteen hundred to twenty Seventeen\n... so and\nI always like I said I I like going to him because he is somebody who believes he can quantify but he says he believes\nThat that global warming is happening and man has you know something to do with it but doesn't know you know what percentage but he's as you said you can't stop the economy's you can't put people into mass of poverty you can't do these insane things\nThat the left is is they need to do people have to have a quality of life somewhat shipped to do is you have to prevent you've gotta you've you've got to do the preventative things that you need to be doing but everything that the left his too when he criticizes as being absolutely ridiculous well and and that's again the proposals over\nThe years have been a remember the former governor of Oregon saying uh we need to ah essentially a decrease the economy and I forget what the number was but it was a ... Thirteen Prieta under like I wouldn't want to have her team I thought it was right on that but I was thinking Thirteen and and so\nIf you looked at that you're talking about effectively starving people in third world nations\nBecause if you if you are going to do this for the United states it would have to be globally well you do that globally and you you think about where the supply chain in terms of food\nThe most important item in any supply chain to third world nations you look at the breakdown of that not the supply chain itself logistically but the supplies\nThe content within that supply chain diminished greatly that the insanity that is the insanity that they're proposing the fact of the matter is\nWhen you have people who are willing to have a well intellectually honest discussion about it uh you and I said I'm\nWe don't need to be at the table how 'bout the scientists that are on both sides of this have the discussion\nWith the ... the problem with that as the politically driven the very motivated politically driven agenda inside of that to the extent that Al Gore by the way\nWhy in the world was she telling the UN and why why isn't anyone even listening to Al Gore who admitted back in two thousand ten that he lied about ethanol as we try this altogether\nA it's a it just to read a couple more sentences or from Carolina ... a a coat Carolina coast online dot com and\nUh and it's an article a rich and storms worse and a and a talking about the Washington Post saying that the president President Trump is complicit mhm and and he's and he said you're studying uh twenty six team in the Stanford law review that said we call a shooting\nIn the September fifteenth and sixteenth Wall Street weekend edition columnist Holleman Jenkins we've quoted him a lot and contrasted an archaeological study of the first century a de Germans who raised dwelling mounds and build dikes in response to rising sea and strong blood levels\nHe compared to what the us response or brushing them with federal dollars to rebuild so the next storm will always have something bigger and more expensive to knock down ... setting a twenty six teams studying the Stanford law review that said\nWe called weather related catastrophes natural natural disasters but the losses are often do to questionable government policies you said Congress struggled for years to reform the national flood insurance program and has turned it into a perverse subsidies for coastal development\nYou quoted Bob sheets then head of the national Hurricane Center saint after Nineteen Seventy nine hurricane Frederick\nIt was like an urban renewal program out there he said that the uh twenty Fifteen a A R worldwide and insurance consultancy said climate change it's not climate change but the growing number and value of coastal properties has the largest factor impacting hurricane risk today a whopping Seventeen trillion\nIn property now exist inside the U.S storm surge zone where is Al Gore when you need to be continued alright the climate change crowd has become enamored\nOf coastal development because it creates a constituency for doing something about climate change\nWell not exactly for doing something about climate change but for throwing more money at coastal dwellers and calling them victims of climate change for the benefit of generating media coverage of climate politics yeah wow yeah no that's a long genius way ... altogether\nBecause think about what that what what is done\nYou know if you if you look at that and and that's that's what happens if you look at those you know the the wealth that was created um and is very much displayed on the east coast\nWith people that have the home so I mean if he's got a beach house think about the value of a beach house right\nWhat's that would be now think about what it takes to replace that right\nNot just insurance but then there has to come after the insurance there has to come public aid inevitably\nWell the left has used that uh and the emotion behind that because who doesn't want to help\nWell than it is okay this is because this is happening because of climate change\nAnd so not only will we again continue the public aid that's not going to go away but on the other side of that it's to poor public money into in tax greatly\nThe American people based on the theory of man made climate change which is to say oh I don't know we'll start with forty or fifty bucks a gallon tax\nWill start with and that that won't be the end of the tax I mean if you if you look at it there'll be taxing this was why they wanted you know that it's not necessarily because of climate change it's because you can you can implement the taxation at levels before the retail level\nIt becomes a compounding tax like the vat tax this is the kind of policy that they want until you have a centrally tax the poor especially in the middle class because those are the groups that are affected immediately and greatest\nThen they become what even more dependent on government\nAnd they quote home and drink and some of the wall Street Journal here factoring in social economic demographics of the population on the Atlantic and Gulf Coast said Mr lumber damaged by future hurricanes will only increase because the population is greater and wealthier and there may be more deaths sane vulnerability is the main hurricane problem facing the United states\nWe should not allow so many houses to be built on flood plains or coastlines we should insist on higher building standards and increased wetlands to handle flooding we should stop federal and\nOn subsidies would encourage building in vulnerable areas and mentioning that every news site in cable news channel will be promoting heroin and heroic stories about Hurricane Florence Mr home and said major storms have become events\nThey afford great footage which feeds a false sensation and viewers it's drawn to become more frequent and more powerful meanwhile tragedies befall Americans every day for which the federal government does not shower them with aid because CNN is not president\nHe might also have said connecting extreme weather the climate change to encourage carbon reduction is today's falls mantra declaring practical steps towards Libyan rationally\nA A R possible he said they could begin with Congress quad defined for the

of our listeners are very concerned saying you know ... ... what's going on with the Pfizer worn thing it just disappeared\nWhat happened and what we did cover it a couple of times and ah you know over the last couple of weeks but just to just to go over it again so everybody knows and maybe do it in a little bit more detail here where we can spend a little bit more time on it\nOr the the president uh was going to declassify or roughly Twenty one pages including the Pfizer application and at the last minute before releasing it he decided not to\nAnd he didn't release it because he said uh there were some of our allies that did not wish us to release it\nSo he wasn't going to do and yet when we read it we thought OK they what are they trying to do figure out some of the classified information should stay out\nYou know ... or ... should than they need to read that more and that's what was I think our original thought and then the president said I'm going to give it to further review to the inspector general of the department of justice Michael Horowitz\nWell we immediately said wait a minute and even ... like the day after said you know I I don't know why they won't release it\nAnd then we thought to ourselves well wait a minute and this is the least covered story in America right now I think mhm\nThe least the last time I read I read or radio exclusively [laughter] have the uh covered about possibly the most important story in all of this over the last two years is that the president\nBecause he said and we were at and what a couple of stories said it was Great Britain because of Christopher steals involvement in it but some of our allies did not want us to a release sitting there were a couple of other things that needed to go over so he was going to give it to the inspector general for further review\nNow we were initially for the first day little dumbfounded go we couldn't understand why it was going to him\nAnd on the air this is going back ten or eleven days as you and I were discussing why were to go to the inspector general and all the sudden it was\n... yeah that's the role of the inspector general is to do what is to investigate

your national security director now you know the secretary of defense\nThose are the people you would go to\nTo to decide at least in my opinion whether you should declassify it or not and I say you're secretary of state former CIA director because they claim that some allies uh didn't want some things to be released in our initial thing was wait a minute what are their allies no they don't know what's in their right how how do they know that the\nAnd we were initially puzzled when he said he was going to give it to ah the inspector General Michael Horowitz until we realize\nIf you or

say things like that Denver fighting words well do you do yeah those are words that up those are words that get people upset it is a charge\nToo when you when you make it at ... and it was made by

also believe in due process under the law and you can do both and the less was attempting\nTo tell you that you must always believe the woman oh come on that's ridiculous and everybody knows it you

of the absolute right and you know that they just believe that they're right in everything then their opinion\nIs above everyone else that in essence while you called them the elite because they believe they're on a higher plane of consciousness where oh we just call for civility and the way that we think and just follow what we do and everything will be\nOkay so they don't for ride Redford

people need to pay attention to\nA head of Michael's landed a\nKnow you and I talked about yesterday which was like wow a after this you know after the last really over too\nIt's one of the judge a cabin on the the hearings and and the the ... the confirmation ... and everything that has gone out and the ... all the different the allegations all of a sudden we got to Monday yesterday and I woke up and it was\nThere was nothing\nIt was almost like a big exhale where it's like okay and where do we go next we need a day to figure out where the news goes because it wasn't really a big news day right of uh yesterday and it's when I came to the thought\nWhere I said what's the issue for Democrats with everything that I've discussed over the last two years I actually woke up yesterday thinking\nWhat are the Democrats have right\nWhat are they going to you besides impeachment you know what is ... you know what is the issue I think about is there we went through and and even just just before we got to the Capitol nomination it was still know Mahler investigation Trump illusion you and I I I remember ah\nThe ah the was it the the\nThe Thursday of the ... the Thursday or friday when when Chuck Todd said you better not miss work tomorrow that had to be like what was\nThat ... right around Labor Day that was the friday heading into Labor Day when and and that was because you know Mueller's going to let the investigation nobody's even talking about rushing collusion now it's gone on anybody's radar it seems like that was ten years ago\nAnd that's how fast the the cycle has has moved you know what is on people's minds\nAnd so when I woke up yesterday I started thinking what are Democrats thinking the issue is what's the issue that they can go after Trump out what's the issue that will even grab Democrats right now to say oh yeah okay that's the issue and\nYou and I talked about the fact that the un coming out and saying OK it's time for our annual we're doomed update because of global warming\nAnd we're thinking of the Democrats going to jump on that they've been jumping on that since the beginning of the Obama administration that and raised on a consistent basis and so I was looking at your earlier and saying I'm waiting for the race baiting to start some time by the end of the week because it's been their old standbys just what they've always use now even though at the same time the American people have said\nWe don't care yeah we don't believe those are the top issues we don't believe race relations or the top issue we believe we get along with each other really well uh you folks in Washington may not and you people that belong to certain groups or or you know or may not but for the most part we get along and global warming well you haven't made your case\nTo the vast majority of America let me go get a burger\nI is I mean seriously that's words that but you know and we ... we actually stay to during the Obama administration I'll never forget where we said are they doing this on purpose", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "city": "Johnson City", "day": "09"}
