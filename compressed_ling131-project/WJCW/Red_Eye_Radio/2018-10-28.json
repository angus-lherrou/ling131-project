tactic\nEffective uh [laughter] I guess they can't actually have clear saying\nI'm not one of those crazy Democrats [noise]\nBecause that has to be said because this was not that that has to be said by somebody else what well couldn't say that her thing is is\nThis isn't money this isn't something this this here\nIs the sort of campaign this is her ad yes it's her she you do hear her voice yet saying I approve this message right so I'm not one of those crazy got one of those dating right\nI'm not one of those crazy Democrats ... now I ... it's it's I think it's horrible in what it's trying to do you know what I'm saying I it's not effective in what they're trying to get done from the\nEd because it's well it's it's just bizarre it's contrived\nThe only thing that that I can think of is that there are internal polling is showing that independence or leaning haul these way and one of the reasons is because remember she uses these specific word crazy Democrats\nWill they did it right or some kind of ... and there's a reason that you there's a reason that you do that there's ... and and the reason that you do that is because there is a segment\nOf those undecided voters that you're going after\nThat in your internal polling you have found out they believe and and I don't know why because I didn't do I I was in pretty to the polling could be Kavanaugh could be a you know everything that has gone on it it'd be you know the the going into restaurants disturbing yeah Republicans whatever\nBut in order to use that term and words are very important especially words that will alienate your own party in a political ad means OK I'm Still safe from the base the base Democrats\nOr I don't have to worry about them I Need to get those independence and they're leaning Holly's way we believe and one of the reasons is they believe that the Democratic party and a significant portion of those that represent the Democratic party in Congress are crazy\nThat can be the only reason\nYou don't do that in an ad mean could you imagine remembered this isn't even a you can't even say well\nThis is just a house race in a particular area this is the state of Missouri and this is a Senate race mhm\nAnd so inside her campaign which means not just in her campaign but other campaigns across the country this is something that Democrats which ... who wish to promote themselves and pretend to be moderate\nWhat they're facing is a significant portion of independence who believe that the Democratic party and members of the Democratic party are crazy\nWhen I went in which shows that everything that has happened\nI think there's I I still think there's an end someone must have and and the research the the voters or whoever was you know being a part of the I I guess group that was being polled\nMust have used those words specifically otherwise it's horrible writing because I think a an ad by a Claire McCaskill a could could or for Claire McCaskill\nCould do the same again we're just talking\nThe politics of it by saying you know look we know that there are there are extremes on both sides in right now that I'm not proud of some of the things that are going on in my ... with within my own party and people that are clearly supporting my own party\n... I Want you to know that I Am not that\nPerson and I'm like right there but that that's the point that's a great point\nRight there yeah it was specifically\nUsing the term crazy Democrats someone who had a reviews that any Democrat [noise] some someone had to have used that in some\nKind of feedback that they were getting that feedback that it was crazy Democrats\nNot extreme right I'm not part of the extreme of\nMy party because he used that why did why the term crazy Democrats because that's the feedback you been getting back right in your own internal polling\nBecause extreme means that you've gone full on one side and in one direction and\nAnd to a further extent well no that's not what's going on\nIt it is crazy and and that's the perception what you're trying to you're trying to target with those words the very perception as someone who has given that feedback to you with those words that's the only way that happens\nThat's the only way those words ended up in an ad like that\n\nThey because someone must have made that that's that's where the the word crazy\nMust have appeared in feedback and unlikely multiple times\n\nAnd they're in their internal on you know you're you're talking about tens of millions of dollars to run a Senate race which means they're doing every type of of polling\nAn analytical research you can get in front of you get down to this point here and you see the desperation of using that in an ad that means you are trying to fight the perception of crazy Democrats in\nIs the one thing that is killing your chances of winning yeah it is the one thing because it is if you think about the build up to you know if you listen to that there's a building\nThat word is is is one of those hot button words that you don't expect to hear but it was placed in the ad strategically at a certain place right as you are listening to something and all of a sudden boom she's not one of those crazy Democrats because and there's another thing too\nIt's a poor attempt I think at recreating a conversation that people are\nYou know having out there but it's not that's not the conversation they're actually having the conversation they're having is if it were really I think accurate and and and portraying what's going on with some of the Democrats or independents interstate it would be two guys going man\nThose Democrats are crazy I don't know but I can vote for Democrats anymore including McCaskill\nThat's the actual conversation so you have to have you have to\nCounter it with this contrived and and again I think it's a it's a it's a poor attempt but that's the only thing you can do you're not going to get Claire McCaskill coming out going hey I'm not one of those crazy Democrats\nOr the other thing I thought was interesting you know and and I'm not you know very familiar with Josh Hawley who's running against attorney general against\nClaire McCaskill I'm I'm a I'm I'm not you know we live in we live in Texas and that's one of the top things is it's it's tough for anybody ... and and I mean it's tough for anybody on the national stage to really have a key understanding of what's going on for example in ... in Missouri raised in many congressional\nAll the heated rhetoric yeah an ad use that show you only thing they can make\nUp your own and\nThat was that's what you use and put an ad of desperation well\nHere's the thing is people are thinking oh wait a minute I Wonder if you could pick me up some wine next time he goes because people go to the gym during the day\nAll the time well what's what's people people run errands all the time just assume OK just to learn right that it's if it's on company time and it's it's well the the the the state time in this case and it's um it's being done outside of his lunch hour\nIt's not on his time\nThat's the worst she got well I'm assuming most attorney general's don't work eight to five I'm guessing\nYou hours I'm assuming there's meetings their speeches there's everything else that goes wind meetings or why aren't they going to be a part part of a job but but again I don't know the specifics behind it but I just went ... and ... and that's but from an outsider you heard that and you went\nThat's a pretty weak but for an ad of desperation that's pretty weak ... ... ...

this uh just the keeps a growing overnight and then I'm Amazed that we have gotten an email sided may rise we addressed it to start the the the the show a off with but the national review and it's been picked up by you know a social media of of the some different a conservative website said\nHave picked it up and this is where National Review\nOf wrote the article that said the pipe bomb or and powder delivered to CNN were harmless this is an article that came out\nA at nine o nine PM from jak crow at National Review and and the reference that he gives is the Associated Press story right it leads to that right they link is right so we linked to the story\nAnd said okay because we didn't see that anywhere else and we said what does the Associated Press story says you know what what does it say it is\nBecause during our priest you'll meet him when I read it I said oh it's saying it then I read it a second time I said well no it's not saying it because what it says is a law enforcement official such tests have determined that a powder found inside an envelope delivered to CNN\nAlong with a pipe bomb was harmless right\nRoute or you know you'll harmless referring to the powder though that it that's the indication as the it refers to the powder not a pipe bomb now there is no indication as we've stayed to start to show off the FBI has not we have not seen the words these raw active lied bombs that could have gone off\nAnd we have seen one but the potentially quote potentially destructive devices and we've asked the question what is potentially destructive devices mean we've seen suspicious packages I'm\nLooking at the last time I checked Fox News about twenty minutes ago they still have the headline suspicious packages\nUh we talked about the the Wall Street journal though actually are calling them mail bombs but not having a quote you know from the FBI stating that they were mail bombs these are the little things and and again we're just two idiots overnight\nBut these are the the little things that are picked up in different websites are not picking it up just quoting the national review story and not linked him to the Associated Press story\nThat you know that the that you know that the a\nPackage sent a to CNN was harmless we don't know whether it was or not\nWe don't know if the the uh the the suspicious package separate from the powder in the envelope was harmless there's like there's nothing in the a P story according to their source that says that\nRight and that's what National Review has reference right and they're headline pipe bomb and powder delivered to CNN were harmless and other websites are picking that up we don't know outside that associated\nPress story that doesn't say that right if you read the ... yeah that's that's the point is that right the the the story that their referencing doesn't actually say that they could turn out to be the case and maybe National Review has sources of their own but they're not sourcing they're not using those ... from the a P right\nYou know so it's just because\nThe problem is is with with if you're going to you know that if that are in the echo chamber of social media especially if that false information misleading information is going to be out there\nThan it is you know it it starts to become or build a narrative in the wrong direction if you start on the wrong premise everything that follows a\nMay sound logical but it still is built on that false premise so you know we just ... and we have a great deal of respect for the people over at National Review yeah the events but it was an oversight here in my opinion because that's not what the associated\nPress story all I can understand it because when I read it the first time mhm that's what I said do you write I said oh there's there's I'm reading here says the ... and then I read it again I went oh that's not what the scent\nWhat Washington Post on there headline had it right there headline habit that the powder that was sent along with the owner was harmless you know a along with the suspicious\nPackage was harmless and and so the the point being is that\nThat the narrative is going to grow obviously politically it's going to grow and and build and and still continue up until election day if not pass that and you don't you don't do any good by you know repeating false information now\nYou're white white smile will

she's still behind that she\nNeeds to use the term\nCrazy Democrats now I'm not like one of those crazy Democrats and and it was and and I just happened to come upon this article here and I was doing some scanning here a few moments ago\nFrom A Douglas shown who is the the the former Democratic pollster who's on Fox News all the time and just you know and and uh again since he's been a democratic pollster and he's identified a throughout his life as a as as a Democrat and he says the Democrats have a problem or a serious problem\nBut one that they have yet to acknowledge fully or frankly at all what's the problem here it is Democrats moved so far to the left\nThe Republicans that attacks on them for being an extremist and too far in the clutches of they're tired out of touch leadership have been working\nThe Republican campaign is now simple just focus on how far left the Democrats are and how beholden its candidates particularly congressional candidates are to the unpopular democratic leadership in both the house and the Senate\nI have argued here and elsewhere the Democrats need new leadership I've also suggested that those candidates were rejected their leadership are likely to do better than those who remain quiet take the money and some of the political consequences\nBut right now as we head into the final two weeks of the election campaign it appears that both the Senate and potentially the house races are tightening and it appears that Donald Trump's attacks on the Democratic party for being out of touch with the electorate and too confrontational as well as led by two failed leaders of the past are working\nRest assured the Republicans have failed to take advantage of what\nHas been their principal opportunity which has to run on the economy\nAnd get credit for something that voters themselves the is improving and beneficial you what I've said the exact same thing the Republicans still and even the administration focus on things outside of where they have clear victories that are clear to the American public\nAnd at times decide to get into the mud when there is no reason to get into the mud right as we said you go for the win every single

says tests have determined that a powder found inside a non below delivered to CNN along with a pipe bomb was harmless\nThe powder was harmless now not the powder and the pipe\nBomb right and so that's what they're that's what they're talking about again here in in that story but it's gone viral because the the uh National Review again unless National Review knows something that we don't but they don't state that understory they're sourcing\nStrictly here the peace story but the reason that it's important is because as you see something like this go why are all of that information is is incorrect or any information is incorrect and the discussions are surrounding this event clearly look\nLittle about this well and it's and and that's why we had a set to uh a mystery soccer over at the CNN or a whether it was close to your Schumer and their their comments\nOr you know going after and you know and in essence blaming the president's first provocative statements claiming that they're against divisiveness it's interesting that the people that claim that we need to stop device of this are the ones that have accused somebody\nOf responsibility of an incident where nobody has\nAny idea no one has\nAny idea who the person might be who would have done this we don't know whether the bombs were lie bombs and would have gone off or not there is so much we don't know yet they are assessing blame the the ones who claimed that they are against divisiveness are\nCommitting the the one of the biggest sends a\nDevice of this and that is what blaming somebody\nWhen you don't have the facts behind eat right\nAnd so as we've said we've discussed is a little bit and and gone through the different questions as others have yesterday and and we we've asked a question that if it was it if they are like that if they were alive bombs\nAnd and they would have gone off\nA then you have to look at that in a different way that if clearly none of them were alive bombs mhm that it would it be there'd been an attempt to scare or an attempt a possibility of an attempt to\nParty that are not like well by members of the right in this country\nAnd you know try to you know give the tried to send the message that they're out to get them\n... or that you know ... if if it was you know if it was it was a real bombing that but if it was a fake bomb it would be wasn't sent by somebody on the left to try to blame the right there's a whole bunch of different scenarios and questions you would ask is an investigator based on whether\nThe bombs were actually live or whether they were fake bombs right\nYeah and we can only ... will only know that if and when they find the person who or persons who are response\nAnd that could be never so at the\nYou can bet right now they have a number of great leads especially with the fact the nature of of how males sorted\nAnd and their resources uh they're probably on to some pretty solid leads right now then add to that of course cameras being everywhere\nSo you will you know as soon as we get information we can start having that discussion but we want to point that out that you're seeing that story from National Review go viral it's important to have the discussion based on facts based on what we know right and there is a difference\nAnd we may learn\nThat uh the authorities and and authorities will tell us or might tell us at some point that those devices were effectively harmless because they weren't set to go off but that is not what you're seeing here and there's a pie report that was the source of the national review article\nWhich again just looking at social media overnight it has gone it has gone viral that she there wasn't we don't know that yet and I Associated Press story does not state that and it's important that\nYou know facts were brought up I was reading the daily while your story where they they talked about the\nA reporter for CNN and that looked at Martha ... who was interviewing one of a one of the bomb experts right and this bomb expert gave out all the possibilities who said look could be somebody from the right and he said it could be a you know it could be but you know a foreign state\nThat is trying to destroy healthy you know this trying to disrupt the election or as you said it could be a false flag from somebody on the left mhm\nSo what the CNN reporter put out was only the response from this expert of\nThat it was somebody on the left and left out when this expert said it could be somebody from the right ... it could be a foreign actor or it could be a false flag from somebody on the left because the election is just two weeks away where I brought out all the possibilities and investigator would bring out\nAnd what did the CNN reporter to weed out just the port the report that apparently media matters poured out which is a left leaning or or you know media organization media a truth organization where they only put out just his opinion you know on the left as if that's who he blamed and Martha McCalla\nAnd which is our point on this entire thing with the national review and the difference between the story that they use as their stores\nIt's important we give a lot of credibility to the national review and\nHave for a long long time but it's important that as you as you\nYou've got twelve days here before the election this is all going to be in terms of the discussion not the investigation but the discussion about it in social media is all politically driven and has been from the start\n\nYou don't win anything by repeating false information\n\nNo new don't win anything by a you know a media matters by putting out incomplete information which indeed is false if you don't include\n\nThat's how we deal with I mean that's the world really deal with you and I have talked about this many times that much we spend much more of our time just trying to disseminate what the truth is out there right and arguing the truth versus the\nConspiracy theories the half truths that are out there and and it does become frustrating at times I Will admit that the story that you know the national review story that when we read the Associated Press ... when I read it and say you when I read it\nThe first I said Well Eric look they're saying that the bomb and I read the first sentence\nAnd then I re read it again and went on it's not what they're saying right now that wasn't on the air to see a right and it was like no they're not saying that what they're saying is it's the powder that came with the the the bomb they're not saying I both were harmless right they're saying the powder was harmless you know that that's what the source said the\nThe YMCA dot net slash more\n[noise] any given moment [noise] kind of way I mean
