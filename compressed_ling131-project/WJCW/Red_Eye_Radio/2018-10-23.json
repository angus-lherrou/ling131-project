are having the wall and explosive\nRemember how long they've been meeting for yeah remember we're going to me\nTo try to come to some resolution humanity perform on yeah it's nail nail\nI mean they still have the policy but there won't be fine there won't be any kind of penalty\nIt's don't ask don't it's don't ask don't tell what they're hoping what they're hoping is is that the players association because every it's tick tick tick tick tick\nAnd the contract negotiations doubt what two and a half years away mhm but but the negotiations could be starting yeah they could be going on right now right right wow and you know while she ate\nHold on a second because we talked about you know how uh the the uh the players association\nCould be saying look we got to go ... coming up that it could have been bad guys were starting talks right now or at least getting into the early stages of these talks and this is affecting it right we can we\nCannot have ... down TV ratings right uh you know in another year and a half everybody has to be everybody has to be on board do protest wherever you want right of course because all of a sudden these players are saying this could affect my next contract and\nOh well then have protests wherever you want a look we made a deal uh the NFL's giving to our particular causes so we won that but no like air a greeter Colin Kaepernick it doesn't matter what the deal is struck they just they they view the deal being struck\nAs a you know and and remember that Eric reviews the deal being struck\nTo not Neal and to keep ... out of the you know out of the players association that was going to decide where all that money goes to basically say no cap and if you're not a part of in ... ah air agreed wants to continue kneeling there's the there's the group or the the there's the one or two\nA out there that wish to continue kneeling no matter what\nAnd there's another group saying what we got our cash shut up [laughter] and yeah and so now there's so many ... so the NFL the owners probably said look don't ask don't tell and it's a liberal it's liberals fighting liberals and it'll eventually blow up in their faces yeah I'm Glad that we and then we can move on\nYeah I mean I I think you're I think you're probably right on it's probably you know unofficially don't ask don't tell for me it's a don't watch don't care\n[laughter] [laughter] well I Wonder if the thing if there is no reason to watch my team anyway because they're not colonizing\nWell yeah I mean you know my my team attempting to I I just saw the headline offensive to come back you know over the ah the Redskins this past weekend and then you know couldn't get it done but I\nI I think of again the bigger picture of the fact that it's not just the protest driving the people what you you you've got two big things to overcome right\nYou've got to bring back to people who left because of the protest but you got to bring people back who left because they they're watching other things because they're doing other things I mean that's where I think a lot of the erosion is you've got to create new excitement in the NFL\nNot just in the whole protest thing you've got to create new excitement in the broadcast presentation of the game\nAnd\nThey haven't even started on that I mean\nUh you know the use in a lot of the movement to digital and and we knew that ... there's going to be more of that in the in in the coming years\nNo doubt but that's about reaching the audience where they are but you know you put a store where the traffic is rights would you put your game your presentation is going to be where the traffic is if it's on digital if a if it's on line and that's where you're\nGoing to find that audience but you've also got to change and I think that will help change the presentation of the game but that's something nobody is focusing on right now because they can't get\nThrough you know this is even if it's just a handful of players if it's making the news it's like you know come on guys it's time to get back to football but you can't get there because these stories still make the news\nThat's you know if it's like the left you look at a uh\nA war and and oh Casio Cortez they don't represent the majority of the uh the the rank and file Democrat out there but they're leading the party if they're making the news and they're driving motivation on the other side as a result\nOf it is a ... ... was a Tim Ryan\nYou know challenge Nancy Pelosi for for his seat and and you know we've got to get away from the identity politics and and everything else\nAnd who else said that a couple of others have said that\nUm but they can't\nBecause it's not making the noise I mean the the I guess being a more moderate Democrats if you could they would still be far left but getting away from you know the identity politics or whatever it is that's driving the far far left\nWell where were you a moderate where do you because that's not making the news that's not making the social media or that's not worthy interest is by the mainstream media it's boring so\nIt's you know this this is this is all you know part of well and I mean really scrambled ...\nAnd what you see here is what you see happening in the in in the Democratic party where you have victims and the oppressors and ... and as we've said this that the identity politics\nYou continue to cut the pie of victims becomes greater but then when the number of victims becomes greater than the number of oppressors\nA must you know must become a greater\nOr you know we've seen it a ... look ... last week you saw the was it the cycling though the women's cycling a champion you know the the the the mail one the biological mail one and the female came out and said it was the the two females that are are one of the females that came in\nLike third place she goes ... this is ridiculous this was a male right\nAnd he is gone crazy stating the bigotry and the intolerance and right and and and and and all that 'cause I Know you're a you know you're a man you're not a woman so that's the debate that goes on and so as we said the feminist up today the ... the old time feminist which to protest is\nThe new time that the new feminist do not want to protest is but you destroy feminism as we said all along\nThe feminists have now become the oppressors thinking about this did you ever think that the feminist would become the oppressors of\nLiberals right now the feminist\nThe feminist movement this is how insane it is and what you have here is in the in the NFL you of Eric read\nYou know a ... you know Malcolm Jenkins was part of the group that agreed\nThat okay uh the owners are going to give a hundred you know a hundred million dollars for the for the organizations that we wish to give money to to help make\nRacism less mhm okay fine All right we will we agree that we're not going to Neal anymore ... well now he is viewed by air agreed and camper Nick as\nThe oppressor he is a Neal colonialist right he's a sellout right because the whole the the real thing is with the ... or a read\nThey don't want a deal no they want to be able to scream oppression so\nSo the victims some of the victims now that we're perceived as the victims here in the NFL or those in the NFL standing up for who they perceive the victims were\nNow they have become the oppressor they're just as bad as Trump they're just as bad as any top\n... because they have decided that they will negotiate to try to make things better\nAnd the radical left doesn't want to negotiate show they want the constant ... they want it's this constant a debate out there they want to be able to cry racism day in and day out and the fact that it's never going to be solved because it can't be solved once it's solved\nOr once you get to where most people believe society is today\nWe're racism is not a factor like it was\nFifty years ago or sixty years ago or a hundred years ago or a hundred and fifty years ago they have to insist that it's actually worse\nThan it's ever been or they lose their purpose their purpose is gone they can't say that things are getting better for it and so boom it's going to blow up and a significant portion\nOf the NFL of blacks in the NFL that were initially supportive of it and said OK enough we made the protests we've made our point we've got the money from the NFL to put to good causes we believe are good causes\nNow they aren't the defenders of the victims now they are the oppressors is what happens\nAnd what's happening with the Democrats everyday it's happening now in the NFL we've\nBeen saying it for years here not unexpected no because it doesn't matter who you are the person standing would you dealing with you as the case may be in protest could be the oppressor tomorrow and that's what's happening\nNow Malcolm Jenkins is a sellout right and I'm sure you know ... whatever other labels and want to throw it I'm Neil colonialist that's the that's my favorite one mhm he's now Neal colonialist yes that term was used on an NFL football field yeah well\nAnd we have a responsibility to help\nFinding cures saving

happened in this country I'm not saying not accepting refugees are paying not accept legal immigration what what a lot of people on a lot to say no one on the table and the one open borders and no consequences\nI Wish I Wish that the then the people on the right to tell the truth about what's really happening and immigration because the largest number of undocumented his name not telling us you know the people in the right around here on the right but I'm not talking about you and I have a frame of mind and I don't\nThink I Am more seem on that issue that I think than I think people realize I come from a border said and I think when you hear stories like ... half and finally I was shot and killed by an immigrant who is in a I'm a dyed in San Francisco which is one of the sad thing for you can go there now\nAnd I said I sang shot and killed sanctuary but let me just say this and you have a cat [noise] forty one percent of undocumented immigrants are from Asia\nFrom Asia a large majority of the link to undocumented immigrants from Sweden from Canada they aren't caravan and I will label on the right point that out as always about brown and black [laughter]\nProblem is by the way I don't I don't want to make this clear it's the left that keeps focusing on the brown\n\nThe color of their skin or the fact that it would be Central American refugees and it's the left that does it the right doesn't know\nKnow the right looks at it and the rights has no either you're here legally or you're here illegally that's how the majority of people just look at it but they have to use it\nThey have to you that that's more Raj of an opinion comes from the left well the right doesn't want illegal immigrants in the Asians or your you don't care about the Asians you're only care about no I don't know any I've never met one conservative\nWhen it comes to a legal immigration that same will know let's let all the all the Asians in here illegally but not the people from Central America right over that no\nMy biggest concern is Canadian\n[laughter]\nWell I mean it's it's not it but you only the only argument that they have is race so that's the only argument that they can use that can't defend it right and McCain got into sanctuary cities you see how quiet they got ... they got quite because they understand what the the one thing that I think even though the\nThat people in the media understand is that\nThose in power in the Democratic party actually do believe in open borders that's what they want and they want open they won't reject open borders\nAnd so since they want to open borders as we said whenever they talk about campaign whenever she was being whenever they talk about comprehensive immigration reform you and I asked well what would that be they never give you the specifics of what it would be because I Would think the comprehensive immigration reform to anybody out there\nWould be okay what we have to do is we get it would be ... to ... what do we do with the illegal immigrants that are here in this country that have been here for significant period of time right and you and I both often said she if you make the offer\nJust see what the response would be from the left if you said okay let's give legal ... let's give ... permanent legal status but not citizens ship or voting rights to every illegal immigrants that has been in this country since\nYesterday yeah right\nAnd from now on anybody who comes into the country illegally\n\nA must be sent back ... that we will give you everybody who is in this country as of yesterday gets permanent legal status and what do you think the response from the Democrats would be well there's they're not they can't accept that\nThe reason they can't accept that is because now they're at the point of wanting open borders\nIt is not about that because even\nThey realize that the argument doesn't change Twenty years from now assume that we did get politically on Capitol Hill an agreement for that\nAmnesty and then strong enforcement or the borders were Twenty years from now ten years from now five years from now we're still be people coming here illegally that will be here that will that will get here and stay here for five years and years whatever it is\nAnd the argument doesn't change so they know well forget about that we just want the open borders we just don't want\nTo have the borders at all come in and stay as long as you want\n[noise] I I have a challenge to the Democratic party\n\nGet together with the coalition of Democrats and put forth a comprehensive immigration plan we always hear them say that ... but they never explain what it would be ... and they're still saying it\nI'd I'd forgot who just set of recently but I I I burst out laughing but we need is comprehensive immigration reform that would include why tell me what it would include and be very specifically obese but be specific and tell me or at least\nGive the stages the major stages of it that would be effective the major affect them stages of your reform plan what would they be\nI think that you probably could go to the Republicans and you could get a comprehensive immigration plan that you can go to specific\nA congressman and uh and and senators and state to them say what would what would you want in your comprehensive immigration plan and they could and say we're totally they just wouldn't say\nComprehensive immigration plan so we asked a question to the left why can't you tell us what your comprehensive immigration plan would be is that a fair question right is that an outrageous question for us someone\nFor for for the two idiots overnight to ask price of any politician in Washington DC you keep saying comprehensive immigration reform tell us specifically what it would be give us the specifics and they won't do well why not\n\nBecause the leadership of the Democratic party wants open borders and prove us wrong\nProve us wrong come up with a comprehensive immigration plan show it to us and prove that we are wrong I Will be the first person to say okay I was wrong I Know I won't be wrong but I Am wrong because there is your plan and you're going to stick behind\nWell tell me one Democrat or it recently who said and I mean anyone right now either running for office or that is in office that says and has been promoting\nWe here's what we here's what I think we should do and it would look like this we would have whatever it is\nAmnesty and then border control because we've been asking the question okay fine what measure what measure of border control do you support\nRight what would your and now I I Want to correct is are there might be one senator on the Democrats' side there might be one senator that would give you a plant\nJoe Manchin yeah\nYeah maybe I ... I made I Want to be fair here and there might be one senator on the Democrats' side could answer that would that would give\nYou what does even if you plant is even a Joe mansion saying anything right no no no\nBecause the question is what is it really I mean the party has to promote it you're going to have to have the rest of the party obviously um and you know you're trying to get your tried to take control the Senate you think you're going to win the house you've got momentum in the house you want to build momentum in the Senate races so how do you do that\nWhat's the point\nMeasure what level of enforcement do you support\nBecause really in my opinion if I were answer answering there is no half measure and the problem with amnesty is that you're going to do it again later on it's going to happen you're just saying okay a amnesty now and then it will be also amnesty later because we'll have the\nThe debate and we'll still have the exact same scenario or Twenty years from now\n... as a as a debate point yes\nThat would be you bring that up as a debate point ... as a ... to find out what because the goal is to you're not to get legislation right the goal is to get out of Democrats what they truly think and what they truly want what the leadership of the Democrats want we know you don't\nWant a wall okay one level of\nEnforcement do you support\nIs that an unfair question Danny Democrat is that an unfair question to ask your party leaders right\nAnd you think about it how come we have all this discussion on ... on immigration and illegal immigration and that never gets answered ever find a Democrat leadership right ever does it get an answer right show me where does\nMore about the W.
