okay I don't know what the punishment includes okay it's it's it is the right guy but I'm Sorry I didn't mean guy against the rule not necessarily against the law right uh but those rules are very strict and keep in mind\nThe that memo that in two thousand nine who held that helped establish all of this and put this in place\nThat was created by the Democrats so uh that\nI don't know what the you know what the rules vote was a and and if Republicans will also agreed with that but the point is is that they they had power the uh they were majority in the Senate and the house and two thousand nine and that's when the rule was created so you\nYou take from that basically and it could be that the majority leader comes in and says okay we'll give you guys three hours as a team and we'll take three hours that could be the case because if it's Thursday\nThat's really the only I guess I'm proceeds not that the Senate doesn't have other things to do but I'm On this issue it's the only thing item on their plate because the cloture vote is not going to happen until friday\nAnd then you know the uh the wide vote over the weekend sometime they think but\nSo that's I don't know that we're going to uh I he may change he may allow more time he can he can do that but I'm\nIn allowing more time that doesn't mean he's going to make more\nWork ... ... it's important to note that none of the staff is allowed in only the senators themselves no staff and the look I still believe it's going to be leaked and and I believe that a ... and it may not be in in\nIn the best interest if uh you know what we saw from ah the wall Street Journal earlier that the uh sources tell them that the White House has said you know they've looked at the background check and there's nothing there just like before there's not there is no cooperation\nOr you know ... whatsoever and therefore it's the same as it was last week at this time after the the FBI did it which means which means if you know if that's accurate that we get from Wall Street Journal that means ... there's nothing\nRight just remember they talked to were mirrors are also because she had not yet had you know she didn't have testimony before\nA you know a a Congress so that came out earlier this week that you know she had been she had been talked to invade contacted a by the FBI so if we hear that there is no cooperation that would I guess it would also mean no cooperation\nFrom Ramirez uh unless the\nSources talking to the wall Street Journal were just referring to Ford right and I'm saying that because I don't know I'm not making any assumptions uh\nUh uh on this but I just I have this look I just have a feeling the Democrats are going to come out and they're going to lead part of it that\nOr they're going to say things that are that put the pressure yeah on the Republicans to change this rural or forget about this rule in this particular case because I don't think look if there is no cooperation Democrats don't want him to release it\nI think they'd rather have the Republicans say no this is this is a rule that the Democrats came up with yeah and we are bound to stick with it for this ... uh you know you know this nominee and other nominees as we've done across the board and the Democrats will use it against them\nBecause it's the only thing that they've got if that's the case they have nothing else except to do use innuendo and\nForce the Republicans than a too you know break the the rules of a background check and release all of it I just have a feeling that's what's going on because you you weren't going to have I mean I\nI you know who knows what the Democrats have up their sleeves now me nothing really has stuck to this week we're we're the Thursday now nothing else really has stuck that has come out nothing right so\nFord and that's it there's nothing else out there right and so we've got today and then friday as a cloture vote and so the Democrats are I guarantee they are scrambling their up right now listening\nOr listen to us on W. I. male right now because they're up trying to come up with another way to delay this and they will look for any way to delay it and so I just don't see I I again I Would be surprised that the Democrats said nothing about it\nA\nI'd be very surprised I have a feeling that you're going to have leagues or they're going to give their opinion maybe not to the point of a leak but to say there's evidence that shows that you know it there is cooperation and the Republicans are just wrong which means you're going to have to release\nBecause remember cooperation is the fact that she said\nAh that ah she told other people mhm and she told her therapist mhm that's their cooperation but they won't get specific on it well but that's not cooperation at the crime actually happened that's not a witness said stating know these people were here that's just cooperation that she at one point\nTalked to somebody about an incident that happened yes but they won't be specific on it which will force a Democrat or the Republicans I think probably to release release it ...\nYou know there's where we stand right now but it's important to know uh what they actually do a in this and it's very important and I'm so glad you brought it up to let people know that uh it is the Democrat Senate\nThat came up with this rule and in two thousand nine riots there rule right\nAnd that and that rule being essentially this memorandum of understanding from two thousand nine that\nThat that it it really kind of added to the process there was there was this understanding our\nOr or a rule another rule in place before the two thousand nine rule\nUh that talked about how they were going to proceed with the vetting and information found during the vetting process of any given nominee but what the two thousand nine rule did or memorandum of understanding which is adding to the rule\nSecuring it in the modern age essentially because\nYou know you've got yourself on your smartphone you can take a picture or you can you can email you can create now you can since two thousand nine you can do a lot more they may have to up the update that memorandum again but I mean you can create\nPBS and and actually copy a it's it's really more of a photo a or scan documents with your phone you know I mean\nThey it so it really if you look at at the procedure it should be because the the deal was even though this one has been very very very public\nThe deal was is that it's up for the senators to decide ultimately\nAnd there may be some things in the background checks but don't pertain at all let's just say you know something that happened in high school that somebody just claims without anything to back it up\nYou know that doesn't relate at all to their experience as a judge\nBut the the entire background check process has always been something that was again respected on both sides well that changed that likely changed long before Kavanaugh started to change but\nIf you had any doubts before this one than those those should all be put to sleep\nWell I I just I unfortunately think since it's going to come on any way I think that we should say our sources say that the spit wad controversy in from seventh grade yeah ah probably will be released\nWell I mean again you look at it and someone making a claim\nAnd and the problem is is that the ... claim they can't find anything to back it up the left screams for an FBI investigation well that wasn't going to happen but it's a supplemental background check the president agreed to that\nYou know I was watching a Sarah Huckabee Sanders part of the press conference on Wednesday you know and they were wanting her to basically say the president was wrong for mocking you know Dr Ford but then one of the last question actually I think it was the last question\nFrom a female reporter\nWell why is it that the president came out and spoke against the abuse in the Catholic Church and those those who were claiming that they were abused were men but yet he won't defend any women\nI'm paraphrasing but I'm pretty damn close that was the question and she said Sarah Huckabee Sanders answers well wait a minute he\nHe's the one who actually ordered the supplemental background check he's been more than accommodating in this entire process so his comments at the rally or were a factual base but he believes that there's nothing to back up the claims\nYou know why because there's nothing to back up the claims the left at once\nYeah it has created their own little fantasy that these are credible claims but sorry in this setting they're not if you can't find anyone to back it up\nEight six six Ninety red eye looking to purchase your own trucker trailer exile financial company may be able to help with financing Eric Gifford

White House said the FBI background check is done uh the supplemental background check which makes seven background checks or in the history of of uh of Brett Kavanaugh and\nUh nothing a is cooperated any of the allegations and there would be Ford and apparently I'm guessing Ramirez too because they talk to her ... month but all we know is that the the at least we know without question with Ford because that was the main focus of it but we also the FBI talked to were mirrors\nA and so I'm assuming that they\nTried to find if there was any cooperation there and as we pointed out to earlier now they all get to see the document there's only a it's a thrill to end the call it so\nUh it's a document that ah it will be just a piece of paper that the Democrats have to go into a room and look at they can't bring any staff members and they can take notes but they cannot walk out with the notes right\nAnd this was the protocol and rules and regulations that were set by the Democrat majority Congress back in two thousand nine and they came up with the rural and had the majority to do this rule back in two thousand nine which is very important because you're going to hear cries\nFor members of the Democrats the party that are now in the leadership position that were members of the Democrat Party back then and we're a part of making the rules do not want to check that\nThe side that would be called shutting the rule or protocol aside that would be called the new Feinstein rural\nYes ah interesting note of the way it is carried actually in to uh the holes there and you know

companies corrupting [laughter]\nOh I'm only halfway joking and uh then later they're going to throw it into a fiery volcano um the uh ... it's interesting to know because\nYou know do we talk about the Senate rule that prohibits them from leaking information to the media about this ah now it would be content or or details or from the three oh two and I don't have that rule in front of me but but let's assume that it's a it's specific details right you wouldn't like that\nIt's there's likely [laughter] this is going to be the understatement of the century [laughter] it's like ... we're going to see some in the Senate I'll let you guess which side\nThat will live in that gray area of that rule and not necessarily knew you had on his first a little while ago a few minutes ago\nBut but really I mean the approach would likely be yeah because I can see a a rule being enforced is breaking the rules and and it is punishable I don't know what that punishment is um but certainly\nYou don't ah you you've got to be careful I guess which way you go keep in mind in the house things may be working for Democrats according to the polls maybe right now but in the Senate there's a lot of close races and there's no one\nYou know talking about a blue wave in the Senate so you have to assume that McConnell still going to be in place or in the new year but the point being\nA Democrat doesn't want to go out and blatantly violate that rule\nAh because they know internally that's going to create a lot of problems for them going forward\nI'm not saying they won't do it but but uh there's a huge disincentive for them to to to do that but you probably could see them saying look\n... and it it's going to be this it's already this from the liberal media\nOr NBC News on on Wednesday well there are dozens of people dozens of people I think they said over forty people that have said that that have ah have information that potentially they could be witnesses that's one of the words they use potentially and their story\nOr that that could help substantiate all these claims and blah blah blah\nThat's not how this works they don't get to control that but but nonetheless that will be the narrative and you'll probably see a couple of senators or during the day on Thursday or friday more likely on friday as they try and hold up an elevator doors open\nThey're going to

officer to hijack the election rather than some conspiracy between ... and Trump\nHe says they knowledgeable source told him well I get from that but that would be knowledgeable source close to the Trump campaign because hijack the election it's a term that uh his source used up with him but\nThis is huge because this is the first this would be the first direct testimony with evidence to support it other evidence besides the testimony according to this article\nThat a a\nThe former FBI general counsel\nThat someone extremely high up in the FBI\nMet just weeks before the twenty sixteen\nElection and it was just weeks it would be just weeks before even closer to right before the bureau secured a search warrant targeting Trump's campaign it would mean the FBI met\nWith the Democratic national committee's lawyer and Hillary's a or you know\nIt was the Democratic National Committee private Laufer okay so you have that at the minimum but Hillary also her campaign paid money\nTo Perkins who we also Roche also went down the line so but we know without question the Democratic National Committee is private law firms and the FBI met with at least one attorney from ... to discuss\nThe Donald Trump Russia collusion there's no reason for\nRussia collusion that's completely against any protocol of an investigation would it not be I Would think so\n\nSo that's huge news about well\nAnd and if that is the case if this is an FBI attorney but this is FBI council then is that information not uh own essentially by the public\nNow or the hill and John Solomon was the first one that that actually went into the specifics of it the Fox news story former a top FBI lawyer James Baker gave explosive closed door testimony on Wednesday detailing the congressional investigators how the Russia probe was handled in an abnormal fashion reflecting political\nBias which would that exactly with what John Solomon's column said\nAccording to the Republican lawmakers president for the deposition some of the things that were shared or explosive in nature representative mark medals told Fox News the witness confirmed that things were done in an abnormal fashion that's extremely troubling meadows claimed that\nThe abnormal handling of the probe into alleged coordination between Russian officials and the Trump presidential campaign was a reflection of the inherent bias that seems to be evident in certain circles the FBI agent to open the Russian case Peter ... FBI alert or Lisa Page and others some politically charged tax\nAnd have since left the bureau\nBaker who had a close working relationship with former FBI Director James Comey left the bureau earlier this year the lawmakers would not provide many specifics about the private trends ascribe interview studying a confidentiality agreement with Baker and his attorneys however they indicated\nIn broad terms at Baker was cooperative been forthcoming\nAbout the genesis of the Russian case in twenty sixteen and about the surveillance warrants application for the Trump campaign aide Carter Page in twenty sixteen during the time that the FBI was putting\nA video of the deal Jay and FBI we're putting together the size of surveillance worn during the time prior to the election there was another source giving information directly to the FBI which we found that source to be pretty explosive said representative Jim Jordan\nSo that's really interesting too but I just said that's the Fox story the story is that a Baker met\nWith ... with at least one attorney just weeks before the twenty sixteen election and just before the bureau secured the Warren\nTargeting Trump's campaign met with the dance seize private law firm\nWow\nWell what do we have we also know that the spouse of a a top official who was associate\nDeputy attorney general at that time\nUh at that\nUh the again in the in the Justice Department a ranking official in the Justice Department his wife worked at ... ... I'm Sorry worked at fusion GPS so you have so you have here this this again this loop being closed further by this story\nNow that the FBI council meeting with ...\nA further down in the story from the the hill from his allegation of what his sources told him they then writes Baker was interviewed by lawmakers behind closed doors on Wednesday sources declined to divulge his testimony others\nOther than to say it confirmed other evidence about the contact between ... and the FBI the sources also said bakers interview broke new ground\nBoth about the FBI's use of the news media in twenty sixteen in twenty Seventeen and for further the Trump case and about deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein conversation and spring of twenty Seventeen regarding possible use of a body wired to record from\nThe interview was one of the most productive we had and it opened up many new investigative leads one source said\n... ah another said Baker cannot answer some questions about the FBI media contacts signing an on going investigation by the department of justice inspector general into alleged illegal leaks during and after the election\nAbout the Trump collusion probe and other\nAs we know now the the word declassified but the president's send those to the inspector General Michael Horowitz which one we saw that we went\nWell the we we know that they said that there were foreign allies and we heard that the sources that that the the news publications we have seen I've said that it was Great Britain that ah they didn't want the the thing that the\nInformation to be released the redacted information\nI don't know why how they would know what was in it to begin with that'd be I mean why would they object would how would they know it was in it\nRight to begin with I don't mean adbusters action if if you know something damaging Islam in it and and so a Trump said he was going to send it to the inspector general which made us question wait a minute inspector general's office doesn't look to see what there is something should be released\nOr under adapted or whether it has too high of a security clearance they only look for corruption in the department of justice right so the only reason that we could think that the that Trump\nAnd the administration said okay we're not going to release this yet we're going to give it to the inspector general is because whatever unprotected information is in there\nThey must believe that the inspector general confined corruption in the department of justice concerning the procedure over the Pfizer warns\nYeah\nYeah that's if you're listening for the first time I know that this is all calculus I think most people that have listening for a while to the show understand where we are going\nWell it it ultimately when you when you look at that especially with the idea being given\nAll this ah on redacted information from the White House you you know that there's only one reason the inspector general exists that's to look and see if there's any kind of corruption or misdeeds\nStealing in the department of justice accounting irregularities things take a pencils home things like that and just you know if you're new to the show what we've always talked about is the Democrats have said Trump colluded with the Russians to act the election mhm that was the initial charge or what are we all find out and we all know now nobody's\nIn it is it was the Democratic National Committee and the Hillary campaign that he didn't offer ... within paid a opposition research firm fusion GPS who paid a former British spy who got dirt he says from people close you know Russians close to the Kremlin on verified\nThat they then\nTook to use against Donald Trump to defeat his campaign and when that didn't work tried to destroy the legitimacy of the election and use that and verified information that they got from the Russians are to get themselves a Pfizer worn a secret warrant to spy on the Trump campaign\nAnd what we're being told now is that somebody from the FBI met with the law firm who helped initiate the whole thing along with the DNC and the Hillary campaign right before the Pfizer warrant was issued and just weeks before the campaign yeah so hopefully that does I think that explains it all simply as you can explain it\n[noise] any given moment in their babies taking an\nAcademic mental milestone for

joined us for all the breaking news affecting the trucking industry along with are awesome rid of the week broke on the truck or dot com is the one friend's not you're not going to want to have them busy travel down the highway so tune in every week and watch the news channel by going to the front of the dot com [noise]\n[noise]\nUsed to be very early and get\nRid of the radio\nAnd he's currently I'm Jerry McNamara eight six six Ninety read I saw the\nProcess is now a by the way he's our computer so now the process or is that uh all the senators will get to look\nAt the actual background check report from the FBI\nOr there is only a single copy that will be provided that they must look at in that room they can look at it over the next uh a couple of days before the cloture vote or if they take notes in the room they cannot remove their notes\nUh with them none of their age are able to look at the actual a document and we'll see where that goes from there whether they'll actually be the call to a you know make public\nOr the report as you add talked about earlier Eric from doing research a this was passed by this rule that it's supposed to be kept\nA private um was a rule that the Democrat majority Senate put into effect in two thousand nine this actually as a Democrat majority\nRule right well by the way the nature of that rule and the process by which that\nCame about\nLikely had something to do with exactly this type of scenario so imagine that uh got out that you know I mean they could have been any of them that someone claimed a subtle my word did this while in college but it was just somebody claiming\nKnowing the potential of a story like that going why without being backed up\nCould do damage that's the whole idea you look at that and say okay but is there anything to it you mean\nBecause as happen exactly that's my whole point is that it likely has to do with this very kind of scenario where well the police went to his house after they were called by a neighbor\nOr the uh someone claimed that the she did something depending on who the nominee is but there's nothing else to substantiate that which is exactly what we have here\nBecause you get that out into the media and it's a story really that doesn't ... it should not be binding as everyone on on the right right now is is saying about Kavanaugh this shouldn't be binding if you can't back it up\nOh or your biggest river background checks simply simply talks to people right somebody could say well uh yeah I heard he had a friend of mine told me that another friend told me that he hit a guy back or when he was in college right well that's double here say yup and so I think that it\nWould be in the report right because it Will Wright said during the process\nBut for a story to go on like that it could have the media can take that and they can they can run with it or any any other politician on Capitol Hill could take that and try and use that to their advantage in order to undermine the the integrity of the process which is exactly where we are today and\nUh so we'll see what happens today the cloture vote has been set for friday and a general vote could happen as early as a as Saturday as I said I Wish you and I could go home right now and just repeat the rest of the show so we could be up all day because it will be interesting to see it's not over\nNow procedurally it's it it's not going to it's not going to be over what the Democrats attempt to do to stall this\nAh procedurally basically the petition or to invoke a for cloture a that has happened that happened Wednesday late Wednesday by Senate majority leader a they basically Thursday is a just a kind of a blank day although it will be about reviewing the documents\nAnd friday they will move forward or to move with a cloture vote the than closure for those that may not know is basically just ending the debate and discussion on it and and saying okay now it's ready for a vote\nSo that vote would happen I'm assuming if and don't know the headcount there on the cloture vote will tell them you know with what the headcount is for the vote and I I doubt they're going to want to delay a much longer after that cloture vote if they get fifty or more\nWe've got a Christian Battle Creek Michigan Chris welcome you're on Radio Welcome to the show\nThey are good that [noise] [noise] ah [noise]\nWell I'm

something we've pointed out very briefly in after a you know the claim starts to you know walk back a little bit well that\nThat becomes very different because of the way that it was presented by her attorney or sweating it and the fact that it was sworn you know it was a sworn statement that was presented officially\nYou must would draw that statement because items major items in that statement that the major claims in that statement we're now by her own admission in public\nDuring a broadcast walked back and changed so you can't let that sworn testimony or or sworn statement rather stand it cannot be part of the official because that's where it is right now it's still there officially\nIts edge should be an obligation and I believe it it is there but that's what ... what was saying procedurally they're gonna have to go back and they need to withdraw this\nBecause that's an official claim when you do that and it's submitted that's an official claim which she is now changed\n\nI I just I Wonder what Democrats are thinking of of an eddy now\n... well remember what happened to liar Lanny Davis that you know when he started talking about his client calling\nThe former personal attorney of about Donald Trump be having information that mall or would be interested in and and you know basically implying that Cohen was going to bring down the entire Trump house of cards\nAnd it went on for a long time it went on well when on for a number of days but I mean the media was really on this and the liberals were like oh here we go finally finally they have something\nThis is going to be it because if he's got more and you're the first one to go I'm a hello children children if he had something for Mohler there would be no play you would not you know he'd be going home after a steak dinner provided by the prosecutors\nBut you know because of that that was the first ... you were like wait a minute what do you mean it's got something from all they have something for Mohler there would be up to ... deal there won't be no deal because he'd walk right but that wasn't enough until they got to the liar Lenny part\nAnd the whole thing with ah with CNN and yeah I think right now with ... ... you know they're they're he's still fairly useful I don't think he is and the sweat in that case\nWhat they're hoping to bring back the porn star you know and make and maybe it's the porn stars slash stripper who can undo the president\nBut I I have to believe these days are limited number if not over all together with Democrats because of the fact that it's just\nIt comes up short you're you're with the with the sweat next thing she changed her story so that's a ... with a you know Stormy Daniels well\nThat's didn't seem to have the legs no pun intended in terms of wealth or I mean she she's out there now\nTalking in and doing interview she was on one of the nightly show's the other day and you know talking about having sex with Trump but I'm thinking\nIt's going nowhere it really is and and I know why the media does it because if you say porn actress before her name they believe they're going to get ratings and maybe they do I don't know\nSo but beyond that the claims go nowhere you know what I think what the liberals don't realize\nIs this is not that this is not the nineties in terms of a certain things now certain we were the first to say that after the hash tag me too movement it might have been a different if if that had happened in twenty Fifteen twenty sixteen election season could have gone differently\nHowever in terms of people and a claim made about an affair not abused but an an affair\nThat's it's not the nineties any more people don't I don't think especially the younger generation is motivated like a lot of the people in the media who believe that it could bring down a president or an affair is not really the big you know the big deal that it used to\nHave you actually with a man who's been married multiple times is a billionaire and was known you know I mean affectionately called a playboy for decades I I just\nI just wonder what's going to happen today what the Democrats are are going to use because you know with the whole evidently with a a a Julie sweating to that falling\nBecause of or television or interviewing her credibility\nA weakening drastically because of that interview to the point where a ... a a liberal civil rights lawyer a like a a Dershowitz was saying you know\nFrom what we can see right now she doesn't change should go after her criminally right wow yeah uh then he's lost a lot of cloud and then he came up and then he came across with another unnamed accuser ... and an affidavit from another unnamed accuser uh who went to a Washington DC area school in the early eighties\nAnd claims that ah she knows a that\nKavanaugh spiked drinks at parties yeah right and that came out you know yesterday morning and sort of die by the end of the day is that even the media saying\nOkay got burned by a man that he wants right not and you know not really going to go there\nSo the Democrats you know if you know that was yesterday and that died by the end of the day and and so here we are today Thursday they've got one day to make another point just stop the cloture vote on friday mhm\nSo were they were I Know they're going to go somewhere mhm I just don't know where they're going to go now right\nWe I I yes we predict they may say we don't have enough time we don't have enough time but that's not going to go anywhere we don't have enough time to look at the FBI background check
