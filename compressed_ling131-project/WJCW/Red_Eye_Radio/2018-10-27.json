on the other day and the beginning of mighty ducks\nWere uh he told Emilio as good as as a lawyer win but don't spike\nAnd that was the terminology that she used to me about the horse race she said he wanted\nHe had to win ...\nThat the lawsuit was thrown out and she's got to pay ... it's done with it you wanted move onto the next when ... don't don't even don't even\nThere and you know go if if you're going to do it go after ... say see this is typically that this was a kind of lawyer this was kind of soup that he files this is a kind of thing that he did with Kavanaugh and this is why the Democrats are dangerous but she just was in ...\nAnd she really hasn't President Trump is set in the past that was the thing that\nFinally hit her she said why does he insists on going back\nAnd doing something like that when you have the wind and you and I talked about this before in politics you get the win and you move on you've taken you promote the strengths of that when but you take nothing you promote nothing that can be perceived as negative out of that when everything is positive and then you moved to the next win\nAnd that's one of the criticisms we have had a of of of the president he gets a win\nAnd then makes it not as big of a win because of the things that he says afterwards when there's no reason to say it\nNow she it's not going to change her vote she's still going to vote the exact same way it's not going to change it my concern is when I look at this election is when it comes to Trump's exhaustion or somebody like her\nWho again was wary of Trump and then came right aboard and things he's done as we do has done so many wonderful things with by the way the business tax cuts going to help her tremendously in her small business it's going to help her tremendously so extremely pleased\nShe's angry at Trump not because she hates Trump She wants them to win\nAnd so again she's still going to vote I just wonder how many how many people that will affect\nWomen and men who are on that border and when you have an election when you had his election in in twenty sixteen that was so close how many people does it affect and that gets back to the again the the\nOld the I I think political philosophy is once you get the wind move on well dining that don't do anything that changed the way or\nIf there's one thing with being a sore loser don't be us or when\nIt's gonna be able to remember we said that remember at an in twenty twelve yeah\nWhen we had Democrats calling up and we said you you know you said you guys were sore losers were how were you haven't said anything that would make a sore losers in fact it sounds like you're a sore winner mhm\nAnd this was an Obama supporter when he won in twenty twelve I'll never forget that\nNow because we called him pretty you know fairly angry I wouldn't say you know are just\nYou know all the way angry but ... but he wasn't why wasn't gloating and he wasn't even it wasn't like it was ... he was still any reason was still angry and we weren't angry I guess\nThat that was the problem is that we didn't we weren't angry enough for him\nWell yeah that's what it was right now and that apparently angered him and his guy one but this you know [laughter]\nThere are certain things that are are are are I guess you know built in when you're trying to\nCompartmentalize this current president um\nWhat's not built in as well as the unexpected is the is the language that is used in and everything else\nI don't think there are a distraction the problem the problem for anybody who's going to be on board one way or the other neither do I the ... except the problem is elections or one by people who aren't on board yet\nIn every case that's where your over the top that's where the you know whoever that is or the people that are in that group\nAre going to put you over the top\nOr to either win or lose and and that's what you can't uh so you know for us are doing this for a living of course but having following all this you know daily um and and and very involved\nThat was something that you know all the language has given it's it's it's built in for anyone who's on board it's a built in it's not going to change your vote that's not the case that I mean that's not the point the point is is that you've got to worry about those in the middle that are going to get you there and that includes right now\nIn the in the house everything needs to be focused on the campaign trail but the president's building huge numbers massive numbers\nAnd these campaign stops these rallies are really doing well ah so someone someone posted\nA on a on social media or Ted the it was so crowded Ted Cruz even Ted Cruz had nose bleed seats\n[laughter]\nSo you know the the Houston rally ... but it's it's going well and it's ... that momentum is going for you\nWhat you're trying to do is you're trying to bring in New business basically if you're going to talk to this president trying to expand the ... you need to talk to people who don't you're talking to people who don't know you or don't know what to expect W a who aren't decided\nWho aren't in your corner just yet that's who you're trying to lure in and those distractions or just that\nWell it's and and that one led me to also think about the whole thing that you and I joke to uh uh uh about when remember when the new NAFTA was passed and he said\nHe called the people that disagreed with his tariffs turf babies ... and we laugh because we said we were the original theory argue over their head and and we we left but we laugh about it but then we thought about it and we said what about a farmer\nWho's losing his business because of it\nAnd the president says something like that to me and again I don't believe the president was talking to the farmers right right right but if you're a farmer he is talking to you I thought he was talking to you know the political pundits out there and maybe even us to see the terrorists work we disagree with it because\nThe only victory he claimed was the automobile victory that's the big victory that he claimed which\nCars going to be more expensive so if you\nPut tariffs on that hurt American business to raise the cost of automobiles tell me how that's a positive he never explained that and so we went through that at the time but we laugh at the whole thing and did don't take anything personally we we do this for a business or any ... any fact our business right does it affect\nBut if you're if you're a farmer heater in mind right if it affects your business it's quite possible that your family your spouse your your adult children and everyone\nIt's it's your entire families livelihood and then you think of the region and all the small businesses that support that industry as is always the case and what it means when we're town and community and everything else it's a big\nDeal and maybe a number of farmers yes that and and people that weren't a you know it'd be initially you know would not both Republican and did because of you right right and then you and and again that's\nWhat I couldn't I was one of those state right and I don't know I don't know what kind of an effect will have only knows it's not a positive effect when those things happen right you don't need to my I guess my point is you don't need it seems that this president at times\nThings that the only people he has to satisfy is his base in his rhetoric mhm\nHe's satisfying I Believe his base for the most part\nUh and and I think the the base has has his base has expanded because of the whole cabinet thing what's your base isn't going anywhere from space isn't going anywhere they're staying with him and and the people surrounding his base\nAre going to stay with him that it's ... it's those people who are okay there's some good things some bad things where am I going where you know what do I think and then boom\nAnd and so I just thought I bring up what the the the one loyal Trump supporter told me who will vote for him again and vote probably straight ticket Republican I'm I I guess you know I'm not sure but it probably would vote straight ticket Republican who was just finally ... that was the limit the horse race was the limit was because\nYou had the when you had to when it was a slam dunk win and then you made it less civil went right why why are you doing that why do you feel you need to do that when it doesn't help expand your base right\nAnd so there you go but uh what is your calls in common is coming up your life you know we do have a line open eight

[noise]\nFederal case humble they're spending on bart neck or a fingerprint and DNA evidence led to the arrest of fifty six year old\nOh if it's a six year old man from Florida for allegedly mailing packages containing a pair of pipe bombs do prominent Democrats and others correspondent Steve ... says he faces five federal charges\nCaesar sake could face additional federal charges according to the United states attorney Jeff Berman\nThe defendant conduct as charge is cowardly and reprehensible and totally anathema to our democracy\nThey had apparently been living out of his van which was covered in images of Trump's critics in the crosshairs of a gun site\nHe was arrested several times including for making violent threats against Florida power light and its employees steak hopped around from job to job managing touring male stripper reviews and working at a dry cleaners his social media accounts were an endless stream of means attacking Democrats and liberals I'm Steve cast and down\nAnd I said you know the tax cuts you know probably would make them the most conservative and so I mean uh I could see anger from a traditional liberal on the corporate tax I said but we've always do that is bogus\nAnd because the control maybe you know on on what\nBorder control well not not a border control from what from what Democrats how they stood ten years ago well and and really not a you know you had to walk that back dot with where the majority of America stance or Jordan and Iraq out of control they stand with them so that would be made well Trump was out yesterday promoting what Obama said in two thousand five\nWhich sounds\nThey like Trump ... exactly I mean there's no difference in how Democrats sounded tend to Fifteen Years ago mhm\nUh you know even as recently as six seven years ago then then Trump sounds they were exactly the same and and when I brought him down and comparing this to today's goal posts which has moved tall which moved ... but he is professor\n... said yeah I Know it goes his he's because he's not as bad he goes you know again can't stand how he talks but yeah he's really not that he's he's really not that ... and\nAnd when I said I said you know and even a corporate taxes as a come out and the liberals talk about it when you have someone you folks talk about it you know the corporate taxes or a a hidden tax on the poor and he goes you know I Know I Know\nAnd now this guy if you if you met him the the image that he portrays and people that know him that tell me he's portrayed as an elite liberal he knows what's\nGoing on and and so\nYou know the the when when we look at and then we had talked about a President Obama speaking yesterday in in or two days ago in Nevada\nAnd we said what did he say what is the issue\nFor Democrats now we know\nThat the traditional conservative who is now come aboard if they were never Trump they've come aboard you know because of of of ... I don't believe they left I Believe that they are motivated to vote\nBased on what based on\nAny allergy and constitutional issues that are really really dear to them I'm Talking about the conservatives that abandoned Trump\nBack in twenty sixteen the never Trump voters\nThe people that might have voted for him but we're still a little bit wishy washy might not have been as motivated to go out in the midterms cabinet change that completely\nI looked at Democrats and it's the hatred for Trump remember\nYou know I we talked earlier about uh about prompt exhaustion let's talk about Democrat exhaustion how many allegations have they made against Trump that have gone away\nIncluding rushing collusion that whoever thought that Russian collusion just six months ago would not even be a talking point at all from the Democrats going into the mid\nTerm well you think about we're about to go I I mean we're less than\nTwo weeks away from election day and they're not talking about\nCorruption in an election\nNo and it was almost a sure thing given fact as as they presented it and have them for the better part of two years\nAnd so the the Democrat exhaustion that's been portrayed Trump is Hitler Trump is Hitler Trump is Hitler Trump is an authoritarian Trump is this Trump is well it's like the other day when Trump came out and and and I think that the the ... what oh there he is okay he says he's a nationalized\nYou got to understand what Trump's definition of nationalist is\nYeah right that's the risk of changing the definition of words because if you're talking about somebody a president of the United states who would like to put the United states first that's his definition\nTheir definition has to do with hate groups right has to do it a hate group sent and Hitler yes and so if you use the same term even if your definition is different it doesn't matter the the the label sticks but even that fading away because people have experienced them and the thing is remember\nWe weren't going to be around in two years because of Trump ... the whole world was going to be a huge mushroom cloud\nAnd when you throw up that incredibly heated rhetoric day in and day out and day in and day out there is also an exhaustion that you put\nOn your own party that every allegation that you throw out never goes anywhere right and you find out\nThat I and I think what may get Democrats more angry right now than anything is Trump has become normalized we're used\nTo it now well that that's the other that's the other side of it uh in\nIn the political realm it is not really it right now it it it nothing has changed in well gosh since January twenty sixteen to at least\nI went back and I was I was looking at some old the videos or clips or news clips and the different videos on YouTube and coverage of Trump before he officially started you know ... or ... announced that he was going to run a twenty sixteen\nI'm going back to the a fight with Rosie back and forth there right\nAnd they certainly people pick sides but it wasn't really anything serious\nThe left really kind of in many ways adored him they may not have stood by aside during the back and forth with Rosie would they really didn't they weren't coming out you know and and it wasn't that kind of hatred until he became the threat and that's when he decided to run for president\nAnd if you think about it I Do wonder\nIn terms of the things that he promoted at at the core lower taxes fewer regulations are these pro business thinks\nI Wonder if they knew that threat was real and and the way to engage him and this is you know are certainly would be a strategy from the left\nKnowing that he's probably got the the skills in terms of negotiating if he's got the the uh the makeup on on the numbers on Capitol Hill he can get those things done to do away with Obamacare things he was promising and twenty sixteen\nAnd even before a lower regulation lower taxes the thing's all of these things that the left AA he became the real threat because they knew he was going to be effective in those things and rolling back essentially the entire Obama agenda\nThat's the real threat so how do you start to unravel that threat you engage him and other things knowing that because of the history of going back and forth on social media with with Rosie O'Donnell or whoever it is knowing he's going to engage\nIn that way that that would hopefully derailed his campaign the fact that it didn't\nAnd look at an all of the things that were said during that twenty sixteen campaign\nStaggering it really is it's it's totally unprecedented and it tells you where we were as a nation\nThis is why I think we can't underestimate you know the the silent majority or whatever you want to call I don't think you can call this race and say you know a ... the houses definitely go to will go to the Democrats I don't make predictions\nBut there's this is this is anything but a normal election year because twenty sixteen wasn't and we've ramped it up well ...\n... and the thing is as I mentioned earlier the danger of Trump's exhaustion was blown out of the water because of cabinet\nAnd is it is as it is it's about ... fire right on that I like how energize yeah is there are the Republicans yeah because I have never in in that time\nThat that happened I don't have a read right now because everything's basically gone silent we'll find out in two weeks but I have not in a long time I don't know the last time I saw\nI'm trying to think of the last time I saw the Republicans so United and I really can't you know again going back to Reagan I really wasn't studying politics as much ... ah back then I became a talk show host in eighty nine so uh you know I wasn't as observant\nOr you know as to the unity of the Republican Party at a you know at that time I Know it was greatly United but over an issue I in my lifetime I just don't remember the Republican Party being as yet\nAnd I did when they were more fractured than I seen in a while and become this cohesive United group of\nPeople over Kavanaugh that to me that to me still is the biggest unknown as to how much it will drive Republicans to the polls if it is what I think it is\nOr what I suspect it could be if it actually is that I think the Republicans could hold the house\nIt's not their own ... right right\nYeah um and and again all the things that we've talked about the factors of you know what's going on in the Midwest and and what's going on with the you know ... ... if that's affecting enough voters in the mid west or just to turn some of those districts or or to just keep people at home\nIs reducing the YMCA\nWhat you already know the why we're so you think sure you know the life for a swim all worked out

very common to have cameras in your home oh you do see I thought just walking down the street going for a walk every day oh yeah there's there's there's a there's cameras in the home and then what is my job\nEverybody can monitor every word I say on my job they can monitor [laughter] or I guess I'm Talking into this microphone well I Am zero privacy now [laughter] I'm not sure that as proactive in that we engage in that yeah you know we rented that voluntarily\nUm you could uh I'm I'm sure the hearing in the hearings or the back and forth and and the debate on this whole thing with the license plates scanners in Florida\nA on this case will be okay but you also that's kind of a voluntary uh you know process\nUh you can choose to not be in a vehicle or you know you could take public transit a depending I guess on the availability of that well if that were ... were using a bicycle or walking or whatever and I guess you would start at this particular point\nMany police officer if you're in front of them for any reason to run your life ... ... yeah they don't try right but they could run your license and make a judgment on you right at that point ... just based on the information that they have that you have unpaid park\nAnd the question becoming a is your you've got a warrant out yeah you know what on that and what the what the complaint is is that\nBecause this is where it gets interesting\nIs that you're developing a pattern it would be like the police following you as opposed to a of a police officer just by happen happenstance you know out while Ron patrol right you know I'm you know pulling that up\nNow an officer can also follow you I mean if they if they suspect something now they're not going to follow you for days and store all that information for three years outside of an investigation but they legally could they would not need or hang war it's\nA four or most of the you know for just following you in a vehicle so I guess what is the difference between\nThat and do you why road blocks\nWhere they stop everybody who goes through if the\nIf if their claim is if their argument is by the way folks were just having a discussion here [laughter] I realize we're on the radio right right [laughter] it was like oh we're on the radio here\n[laughter] but well I think it's an it's letting the days just based on right technology and the world's hanging out you know you got a DUI now some states like Texas in Oregon as far as I Know I don't know about Oregon anymore but when I was there\nNo robots aren't allowed they find that unconstitutional by the state constitution right so we don't have road blocks here with ... so you can have more rights in a particular state you just can't have fewer rights and uh but across the country do you I road blocks are are fine so\nWith the with the same a premise behind a or that or\nCould they would that I I'm assuming somebody would try to use it that look worse scanning every body it's not that we're picking out one individual were scanning everybody if we will not one individual by race or one individual by you know\nI I think the the difference comes with with the the data and storing it on what it can be used for beyond any given day or moment right so in the moment of a a D. Y. road block or like a ... when they set up a\nWe call them speed traps are our apologies officers but that's what they call them the dress [laughter] radar gun well that's why they they call them that to get caught [laughter] yeah right [laughter] I you know the the whole ... you know what\nI resent that a policy [laughter] ... [laughter] you know I hit my break you know I had my breaks but the but you know when they so when they do that it's kind of the same thing right it's just that\nThey are going to be in a particular spot whoever passes that spot is going to be subject to that uh action or level of enforcement by that particular uh an enforcement agency well now what's different is you're getting a you're you're taking this data and the\n... what what that data base now becomes right if it were just scanning\nAnd let's say they kept it for\nForty eight hours Seventy two hours uh thirty days\nBut didn't keep it for three years because three years would be a pattern or you know I mean thirty days could be questionable I mean you could have the same argument\nBut it's but the DUI data isn't necessarily stored on any given a I mean the deal I wrote stop right a isn't necessarily stored on any given individual I mean unless there is a pattern of behavior just by happenstance but but\nBecause of a person engages in certain and we all do we all have our certain areas that we go to shop at the same store we go to the same places maybe a you know whatever it is a you know nightclub movie theater or whatever it might be for entertainment or job and everything else\nOf that becomes something different when you could say okay here's what that person a engages in or where he visits or she visits it doesn't necessarily prove anything but it backs other circumstantial evidence\nThink she's children's research hospital we're fighting against childhood cancer every day at the heart of this battle\nOr our donors most of us want to make some difference in the lives of others saint she does miraculous or\nThe fact that no one has to pay it's a place where everyone is treated as an equal\nEverybody is welcome here and it doesn't matter the religion or what part of the world you're from all that is taken away it just gives you some hope [noise]\nIt's just a nice feeling to put your energy into something that really does genuine we make a difference in a child's life [noise]\nThey just know\nIf we have the ability to help\nAnd when you have a responsibility now\nFinding

Mac Murray take six Ninety red eye so yeah one winter there in\nSouth Carolina from what we know ... uh one winner in South Carolina of the mega millions up one ticket won ... to one winning the ticket was so I don't know if there's one winner but yeah um\nBut that'd be crazy if it was like a the entire population of South Carolina got together and bought a ticket and they all get ten bucks\nI mean it didn't have all after taxes they after taxes they get five [laughter] um yeah that'll\nThat'll come out of money to deal with we read that Fox News of a a story earlier that said\nHey remember how it was supposed to supplement education it does it have been talking about the states where it doesn't even go to education uh anymore that hey taxpayer your soul to sold a bill of goods and also since twenty Seventeen they've made it harder to win the big prize yeah so uh purposely that they they said no the cost has\nDoubled over a period of time and the chance of winning the big money now has gone up even higher\nIn and they talked about how they originally you could pick a number I I've never played it but it was like between one Seventy five now it's one in\nMy probably was one in Seventy one Seventy odds are are they are much slimmer and and whites more expensive\nRight you could still when some of the smaller prices but they made it very hard\nThey made it harder to win the real big prize for it and and uh it really doesn't go to supplement education anymore because the state's even that use it for education I've taken other education money that was targeted for education from the general fund and move that elsewhere in so it wasn't this great you know huge edition\nOr to what schools or were you know we're we're getting to fund them\nAnd the other thing is it's mostly poor people to play the lottery ...\nThe poorest people spend the most money on it\nYeah uh over what they say the average American spends on average American spends two hundred and I think two hundred and fifty something dollars but the average per person spends\nOver four hundred dollars a year on lottery tickets now that's the average that's taking everybody into consideration if you just take the people that play it it's probably higher\nYeah I just you know for me\nI just I'm an odd kind of person I don't fear of flying because I Know the odds are one in ten million of meat dying and those were extremely high odds I understand the odds I understand the odds of winning the lottery or what\nA twenty times greater ... thousand times greater than me dining in an airplane right mhm\nYeah you don't get ... entertainment that has anything I think for people that they they\nWhat they buy a ticket for what the dream yeah yeah ah for ... for I don't know what's the cost of a mega millions at two bucks as sitting on how\nAnd what what do they say if you you can't win it if you don't play it and I always say well I don't lose if I don't play I\nI didn't know someone who won I say I did because they did the right thing\nThe well [laughter] they were forced to do the right thing this is in the early nineties or when our state first got the uh the lottery um and it was I think it was either I was six or seven million dollars and they want\nAnd but the they didn't keep quiet about it and the phone started ringing before cell phones are off the wall and they disconnected their phone the next day and left\nAnd you know because I'm sure it became crazy with relatives you didn't know you had in the whole thing\nUm and and that's\nThe real you know that's the real risk because that's like we said the psychology is different because people\nLook at it as well you didn't earn that money and it's a jealousy thing and they were trying to win the money and their little dream in their mind of them winning the money and you got it and you're there relative a wait a minute I Want or or just somebody that that you know\nAnd sometimes it's not not even people view you know some of those stories about the just the you know and then God Bless all the non profits but nonprofits non stop\nKnocking at your door you know and you want to give back I'm sure most people would but you can you can give you know I mean you could pretty much give all of that a way if you fulfilled every request there would've been\nMuch more exciting and when I was younger me winning the lottery in these days would be like what a hassle\n[laughter] well I mean it would take I saw it about it wouldn't change my life too much I I thought about that kind of money\nBecause after taxes uh it's going to be somewhere around what five if you want the one time payout it's somewhere around the third or thirty five percent\nYou know of the overall price a one point six billion so pair that down to about a ... you know somewhere around five hundred and fifty sixty or or six hundred\nMillion dollars that's a ton of money you're richer than Mitt Romney already you went to bed poorer than than a Joe Biden and you woke up richer\n[laughter]", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "Johnson City", "day": "27"}
