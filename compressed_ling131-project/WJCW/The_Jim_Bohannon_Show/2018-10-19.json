I Hope that I did ... how are they going to take before things get really out of or their\nAs I'm Talking about a civil war amongst the United states you're right the left left or right ever hell and\nIt looks like the current cultural ... through all the time a special state\nLike a mixed up state but I live in I live in a string\nNorthern California and the ... gun and go out there and you know ...\nOr ... you have any ... ... ... how are you going to have to go to college going to be the only uh oh that we've gotten down during a baseball wall it getting in there and you can always get worse and our job will grow back\nAll right let's let our guest to answer that by the way to Jim thank you for your service I had a guest on this program Mr Kagan just last night\nWho said that in his view is not likely but he deems it's a possibility that in fact\nUh we could see an actual armed conflict civil war break out in this country um I Would as far as with the aim is to say I'd even also very unlikely but I I was a hard pressed to tell a flat out I felt that it was impossible you're take\nA look we we certainly are having a high level of of of conflict in disagreement but if you think about what\nA lead to the civil war it was a very specific set of circumstances a it was a first of all you had the country divided geographically you had a southern\nPart of the country that that had an institution of slavery that the north opposed and didn't have and you had a neat dividing line and in fact Thomas Jefferson said\nYou know in a way it's precisely because there is such a neat dividing line that makes it impossible to avoid conflict eventually you know the divisions we have today they're like\nNeighbors disagreeing with neighbors you have people in the suburbs disagreement people in the city it's really hard to see any kind of geographical line uh and we don't have the kind of fundamental institutional difference that we had between a slave holding south and a capitalist north so\nI think we're we're obviously engraved disagreement and we see polarization uh but I don't see a civil war I think that was a very special circumstance\nWell I certainly am happy to hear you say that I certainly hope and and I actually think that you are correct Carolyn ... Pennsylvania now good evening Carol\n... or you say that it and you need to keep that radio turned down Carol this could be a very long call [laughter] [noise]\nI don't want to say much all I Want to say as I Am against the United states doing any first strikes\nWell okay I'm not sure that ah that we have any comment plated or as a matter of uh of your thought process Robert Kagan\nA I guess we would have to define a further first strike\nA I doubt that were of a mind to go around and let's say when they first a strike a nuclear option a full scale World War three type of auction of option although my guess would be that there may be places and circumstances in which\n[noise] well I think you're right I mean I don't think we would we needed to use nuclear weapons but we had to be willing to stay a long enough I think we could have a established a peaceful a and relatively safe South Vietnam but we would have had to be willing to stay there and protected you know you look what happened in South Korea\nYou know we we uh we were able to beat back the north or we created a South Korea that could flourishing become democratic\nAh and but we still have troops there you know I think most Americans don't even think about the fact that we have troops in South Korea are but we do we protect them and I think it's been worth at South Korea's been ordered the great\nYou know triumphs of a of our world and I think those options were available and some of these other countries but as you say we wanted to do things with the least effort possible and we wanted to get out as

jumble I really love your show tonight I'm definitely going to be tuning in more often will thing like a like a year a gift to I think he's very sharp Mr Kagan I wanted to ask if you think it's possible to get the Mexico through bargaining for perhaps a a special you know favored nation status\nIn trade to close up their border with Guatemala and a and a belief that it's probably less than one fifth of the length of the border their northern border with the United states\nOr they're interesting thought uh in in the general course of events\nAnybody who comes to this country and Mr Kagan from Central America will tell you the by far the toughest part of the journey to go from Central America overland to the United states just across the Guatemalan border into Mexico as a general rule\nThe Mexicans have run a very tight ship on their southern border it's their northern border that they've tended to use as a as a toilet to flush their unemployment and other problems in our direction\n[noise] well you're absolutely right I mean the the Mexicans are very sensitive about their border with Guatemala you know for one thing Central America has been a source of conflict for years and the Mexicans have also worried about revolution coming up from there so uh and uh so I think that you know the problem is not so much ceiling that border but\nBut as you say you know trying to control the flow\nA over the south but you know I just I I feel like this is a these are big problems but you know compared to the larger problems of the world of they're they're just not as great a threat to us\nAs the kind of threat that we face from China and Russia and Iran and other countries and I just I just hope we can keep our eye on the ball in that regard\nAmen to that here's Carol

... suffice it to say as I think we've lowered tonight this is a complicated problem on that requires a considerable amount of thought and we're fortunate that our guest Robert Kagan has applied that

Thursday on Saudi Arabia's investigation into the disappearance of a Washington Post journalist or customs teeny report\nSending west in an hour with the president secretary of state Mike Pompeo speaking briefly in the White House driveway about his two day trip to Saudi Arabia and turkey looking into the apparent killing of ... he dismissed concerns the Saudis were effectively investigating themselves\nI told President Trump that we ought to give them a few more days to complete that so that we too have a complete understanding of the facts surrounding that which point we can make decisions about how the United states should respond\nOr the ... sway my mind just say that that the most celebrities don't have a lot to say is not to say that they don't all a James Woods the actor for example if you ever have a have followed him on Twitter\nIs a very profound things to say of course words almost had a degree from the Massachusetts Institute of technology and left a I think we're just a few credit short of agree to pursue his acting career or there are so very bright people out there and I would grant the James Woods brilliance that even if I didn't agree with him\nOr the point is that for the most part I don't hear from celebrities any reason to apply special importance do what they have to say\nIt goes down to this this celebrity culture in this country and a particular surveys that have to take a look at what young people want and of course there were a time when young people wanted to be ...\nFirefighters are or what have you ah that graduated into Gore's rock stars or movie stars but at least they still wanted to be something recent surveys of young people have shown that what they want most of all is to be famous\nWhich is about as vacuous a position as you can have Lee Harvey Oswald is famous fame isn't enough\nAnd yet that's what many young people want to be well known a okay I've well known why am I well no because I shot up a school not a very good reason to be well known to be to be for example hated\nAh that's not a very good reason to do anything [noise] so that's part of what's at work here but I'm curious about how you feel about this at one eight six six five oh Jim boat one eight six six five oh five four six to six\nHow you feel about celebrity endorsements if for example I was to hear\nKanye West or Taylor Swift speak out\nAbout the quality of a recording studios in let's say places like a Hollywood versus New York versus Nashville\nI Would take it as a given that these are two people who really know what they're talking about and if I cared about the quality of recording studios\nI Can't think of opinions that would matter more to me that people like Taylor Swift or Kanye West in terms of politics again if people have a track record of big pretty smart and pretty analytical like say a James Woods then I'll I'll listen to them otherwise I don't care I just refuse\nTo apply this theory that if someone is well known\nTherefore their opinion on anything\nIs worthwhile now by it I just I just can't buy and so I'm curious how you feel about that one eight six six five oh jumbo one eight six six five oh five or six to six\nBecause goodness knows that is a viewpoint that is fairly common in this country oh well celebrities said it it must be important\nThis is particularly difficult for me uh by virtue of the fact that as you stand in the supermarket checkout line and look at the tabloid headlines they are often of course first name basis only and I look at some of those headlines that I see first names\nTo which I cannot attach a last name\nA new job and Marcia separate and I'm thinking John Marsha who this the sort of thing so out of graduate and in many cases we're talking about celebrities\nWho are not that no new to me because I don't pay that much attention I Know who Kanye West and Taylor Swift are a\nFrankly uh I I wouldn't be able to hear either one of them perform and know that it was that person I I I've heard them I'm sure before a Taylor Swift for sure for this program\nI actually I thought about a a given some examples of Kanye West and that that disappeared quickly [laughter] as I listen to his stuff and discovered he doesn't do anything that you can put on the radio but we'll hear a little Taylor Swift as the the evening progress is not just like your thoughts about this because it obviously affects a lot of people\nAre for example a a fundraising I I'm not mistaken for for the Democratic Senate cabinet tendency filled president went up\nAfter a Taylor Swift attacked his opponent they have they have an impact and my thesis is that they've got more of an impact on me oughta have I don't care what they think and I want to know how you feel about it what eight six six five oh Jim bowed to mark in Jacksonville, Florida ... good evening\nGood evening to you know it was just thinking I've been listening to you for decades that makes me feel old\nYes ... and it makes me feel old too but you're right\n[laughter] yeah I ... you know I agree with what you say I kind of resent their bully pulpit if you will uh to say anything that's on their mind but I Wonder how many people really does it affect\nAh at the end of the day when you're in the voting boat I mean are there are people out there that say well gee you know Kanye West really seems to like Donald Trump maybe I better vote for him you know is that widespread I don't really\nI don't know it's hard to quantify as I say I I don't see any qualification from ... reeks of discussions with Donald Trump but I Do remember that there was a fundraising raising uptick in the tendency Senate race following the comments by Taylor Swift so\nI have to assume that there is a certain impact there really is\nYou know it it's probably both ways it probably angers as many people as it may happy so it's probably a washer you know\nThat's an interesting thought and I I don't have figures that could prove or disprove that but that's an interesting thought that there may be a backlash impact of these statements\nPossibly so budget later\nYes sir thanks for your call

things I Know it won't me I'm an independent I voted I vote for the person I think is best for the job I don't let a celebrity tell me\nWell I think that's very wise of you are and and I I Would uh would hope that frankly everybody who listens to such views will do so in the same spirit that you do Neal because\nAgain it's a it let's say there's something special to say I just don't care the fact that they've sold the zillion records is of concern to me again if they were abiding about uh\nAbout a record labels or recording studios then I Would respect their knowledge but do I miss not particularly\nYou know the only celebrity I can think of that ever made the transition from Hollywood was Mr Reagan he went to the governor's office in California and then the White House but then Reagan had a lot of credibility as a spokesman for General Electric and\nAnd yeah he he was a well known figure but you know as I said ... wedding Kanye West both very overrated not okay I think the

of Minnesota that's correct\nThank you um how do you hire instead but how do you feel about your performance besides being reelected\nWell let's let's look at the at the the people involved there as I say I as I understand that there was a particular issues and\nUh uh east would uh I I Believe a rent a bar or something in ... my understanding is that his brief tenure in opposite he improved ah Carmel certainly for the the business community\nSchwarzenegger I think was a very credible as governor Reagan I Would I Would feel the same way Jesse Ventura\nI think he had some problems of being an independent uh dealing with the legislatures when he didn't have a any voting block it'll be in the assemblies but again\nA I'd have to look deeper to offer a more profound thoughts about the ... the simply I Would note that that did they did in fact it or the arena they didn't just offer their opinions but they they put themselves on the line and in the case as we mentioned they they were elected so I I give them credit for that\nAll very true I mean they were a lot of cases Schwarzenegger wasn't gee uh reelected\n... did he what he was in fact a reelected yet that's a that's correct in fact he\nHe took office I Believe in the aftermath of a of a recall of a of a governor drew Davis so yes that that is true a again\nA being a celebrity does not disqualify you from being enabled

questions I suggested maybe was George Soros paying for all this one way or another and sure enough people are talking about that today so I may have been right about that\nBut I've certainly become more cynical about what is going on and this one seems clear to me I think they're timing it so that their arrival at our border it's time to her President Trump and Republicans in the upcoming elections whoever's paying for it\nUh doesn't matter I think that's what they're up to it so I think they don't ask me of course to consult with them but I think the Democrats are once again misreading things as they didn't earrings with the judge Kevin or were they clearly overplay their hand\nAnd showed you know the even the independent voters remember most people don't follow the news

American people will see crying children right so is the children and distraught mothers at the border\nWith a willing press reporting how heartless Republicans are to allow such suffering to take

a tan or eight or whatever that when they spouse certain points of view you know they've been indoctrinated by the parents even if they're precocious than some of the things that come out with you know the parents have just using their own kids\nBy the way not unlike the Democrats use\nYou know a Ford there and they're all the usual spin I owe the slime drives me crazy that this is not who we

compassionate we take everybody you know you guys just full of it you want them here for the votes and you didn't care about basically for whatever her name is because of the final analysis you leak that when she didn't want the stuffed leek\nAnd Dianne Feinstein the rest of the time this so do maximum damage you didn't really care about her\nBy a there's a bigger topic for tonight just like I Believe the Democrats don't really care about minorities that just using them they know they take their votes for granted and whether they help them or not that it's is it relevant they are using them for them to get power [noise]\nSo I Want you to comment to continue in common and any of those stories that I reviewed tonight at eight six six Ninety red eye and and let me know what you think it and I go with where you want to go there is a hot topic uh after our topic I'll go to that pretty quickly\nEight six six nine o seven thirty three thirty nine is is the same number a digitally\nBut colors also mentioned the reaction of some of their friends this kind of always comes out a little bit some of the friends and family members to ah if their political beliefs are on the conservative or you know you call them on the right I guess\nAnd a friend of mine Scott who used to live in California now lives in Colorado I'll leave that his last name because I didn't get permission to use his last name\nSo he does what he posted on Facebook yesterday he was ... just because of his political beliefs and he thought I I thought he wrote a thoughtful commentary which I Am going to just read from is pretty quick\nA and from what I remembered by the way he's a moderate Republican not even a conservative like me here's this quote we continue to learn life set lessons in many ways\nToday I had a friend who I've known since high school an friend me she was always ... a nice person in fact I helped her out in school and gave her job to provide her additional Lincoln\nNothing has changed as far as who I Am but today she and friends to me not because I was nasty to her or because I was mean to anyone she knew about the cause I posted a political post that she disagreed with\nKeep in mind that she posts political commentary that I disagree with and some I find very offensive she asked me to never let the other stuff and yet she comments on mine but\nSadly there's a way of our politics we can do people for years even all of our lives yet they have no tolerance for a different political view than their own it's so angers them that you have a different opinion that then there's that they will not talk to you anymore\nPersonally I find the beyond said today I've only an friend that one person mainly because they're noxious and intellectually dishonest\nAs most no I guess people are no and I will debate anyone on any issue and I've changed my mind than issues and vote had others change their mind you I appreciate that too when colors of done that in the past and you'll see me say sometimes you know that's a good point I didn't consider that\nBut today it just seems that we're starting to forget the whole of a person is not just measure by their political views and if the ... if you've had a lifetime of friendship that it should be more important than a different view on one area\nHe should have said in one area of your life\nI think I'm more saddened by the fact that my experience today is more symptomatic of what our society's becoming than about losing a Facebook friends if we can find a way to be more civil to each other and then we're in for a bumpy road ahead actually I think he's under doing it\nUh and by the way the same thing happened to me a couple of years ago so I used to do in a show in Los Angeles with two Democrats two Republicans discussing the issues in the news whatever came up that we can\nThe audience and the guess loved it some of the gifts I they greet each other and a future show and I said how do you know ... oh we became good friends because of your show mark up and I I was really that touched me a despite their differing views they become friends socially and otherwise and kept in touch\nI'd love to reprise that show at some point if I was given the opportunity because of the audience loved it I loved it it it was just a lot of fun we didn't have very professional way you know\nBut one of the guests moved to Tennessee and posted on Facebook was one of the other gets the more you see what he did he posted in on Facebook after Trump won that he was the ... anyone who is evil enough to vote for President Trump your host included obviously well he wouldn't friendly you know he did\nIn all of his appearances on my show he was one of the milder very friendly and plus and guess on the other side\nAny chair he shares vice with me when I was dumb enough to run for office in California which\nYou can imagine for a Republican is a waste of time so I was pretty surprised when he poses letter saying goodbye to all of us now evil human beings I'm not sure you said the word evil but that's what he was implying\nForget his past interactions with me or others he thought were his friends they thought he was there for his friend so I Want to know from you what has been your experience when people find out your views if you're a Republican or a conservative or maybe you keep your politics quiet as I Do with my teaching job\nOne of the reasons I'm getting lower now I'm probably still teaching is the left just about never listens to the other side\nSo they have no idea that I'm a talk show host if they knew that might be the end of me but here uh several anecdotes you might appreciate on election day when President Trump was running it was the first day of new class of my school\nSo I was texting a lot to see the election results and I remember I I tears roll down my eyes when he a Trump won Pennsylvania which was always a Republican fool's gold always stay we might win but when it counted like with Romney we always came up short so when he won Pennsylvania real is he was like you going to be president\nIt was unbelievable even though I predict that morning I predict on Facebook that I thought he was going to win so what did some students do and these are adults students they went to the system principle to complain that I was texting a lot\nSo she called the inter office at the end of the night and she said you know mark I defended you to the students because all of us were so upset with the results that it was not surprising that was a text and going on [noise] it didn't even cross or mine for second that I could be on the other side\nAnother time there was a teacher's meeting and the ... a teacher trainer who was running the meeting said you know we have some time why don't we go around the room tall you teachers and you could tell us something that would be interesting that we don't know about you\nDo you think for a second I Would tell them about my other career life\nI Would have been the end of me and a final anecdote was when Justice Scalia die than another teacher said mark let's play knock knock joke so I played along and his answer to who was there was just a Justice Scalia just died and he said that was funny enough I'd probably\nWe didn't hide my look of dismay because he shot me because you immediately walked away having no idea that I adore Justice Scalia and he was my favorite judge so now you know why I'm Still teaching the public school system\nIt was on music uh voices all you need to get tens of millions of salt

deal is and I try to gauge the cut it with a smile but that you get hostility right back it is when did we become those people I just do what it said\nIt ... you you know the other night you say is your first night you're you've been listening to the other night I was asking about who would you like to see get the nomination on the Democrats' side and if you're a Democrat who to like seeing the Republican side and that evolved into who would you like to have coffee with could you pick someone on the other side\nSo you you kind of give me an idea that we we can evolve this thing in would you I mentioned my monologue Mary Madeline and uh what's his name I just lost a carnival\nYeah James Carville um they're married and married stream Lee opposite I worked in political campaigns for a total opposite candidates so here's how this may evolve\nCould you marry mark someone who had really diametrically opposed refused to you\nOr why not I mean if you're compatible in every other way and do you why ... why does one little facet of our lives defined everything you know of course I could\nHave played by like you're ... you're consistent but I'm going to play devil's advocate okay\nBecause it doesn't politics get into values somewhat about what people care about ride or as an example again from this I think a lotta times single women who vote Democrat or looking for the government to take care of them are and so you start to get into your values system I think\nSo now I'm going to play on the other side maybe not marriage because it may affect lots of things I'll give you another one maybe this very I teach my students values or what should count not so much and I say it's my opinion I don't have to agree with me nuts and you know look through obviously important at the beginning but that fades over time\nIt's it's the person's values that you should care but here's one what if you are religious as an example because of that\nBecause you're conservative and you believe in God and the other side doesn't so if you have kids some day\nYou're obviously going to fight about that you want them to go to church or whatever she wants no part of that so I hear I'm almost contradictory myself I Do understand if it's going to be something really permanent ... share the same values and the isn't this one of the values I'm not saying not to be friendly",
