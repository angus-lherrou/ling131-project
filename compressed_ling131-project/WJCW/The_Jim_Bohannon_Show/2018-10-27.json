first World War true but the year before the United states was involved in that war in Nineteen sixteen during the first World War two young Americans met by chance on a mysterious and now forgotten the state near Chicago at first they seem to have little in common\nShe was Elizabeth Smith a Quaker school teacher who found joy in poetry he was William Freedman a Jewish plant biologist from a poor family\nBut they fell for each other and within a year they were married they went on to change history together in ways that still mark our lives today they taught themselves to be spies of a new and vital\nAll right and this was buying in the initial era of among other things or electronic messaging a telegraph and later radio right\n[noise] right so this is sort of a new dawn of radio as a mask ... technology um this was when a radio began to be used by the army is the world to transmit secret messages or through the air and ah I'd never been done before and because anyone with an antenna\nCould intercept or any radio message in Morse code or the sensitive messages had to be encrypted they had to be protected with um secret systems of writing a so that anybody could into intercepting\nAnd read them and that meant that if you wanted to read the messages that the enemy as we wanted to do it all for one\nWhen we entered the war in Nineteen Seventeen as you said um you needed code breakers meet people who could solve those messages and I'm Elizabeth Friedman and William Freedman or were in their early twenties you know they had they had fallen in love it is a\nA sort of rich man's the states or in the middle of Illinois they had initially gone there are invited by him to try to solve the secret messages that he thought were embedded in the works of Shakespeare it turned out that those messages weren't really there but I'm\nA year after Elizabeth arrived a year after she met William Freedman fell in love with him\nUh America entered the war\nAnd at that time there was really no in American intelligence community to to speak out there was no national security agency there is no CIA and the FBI was only about eight years old\nAnd so the result was America which was completely unprepared for the part of the war that involves trying to figure out what your enemy was doing by intercepting and reading their message\nIt didn't matter of fact breaker there were there was a famous I Believe it was an American who made this statement the gentlemen don't read other gentlemen's mail\nRight this is Henry Stimson secretary of state so he said that a little bit a little bit later but that this was you're right I mean this was indicative of kind of the American attitude at the time which is either something disreputable about about trying to solve secret messages that other people are sending but the fact is if it's an absolutely vital\nOr intelligence need during during a time of war and so in Nineteen Seventeen when America entered World War one we were unprepared\nWe didn't have any code breakers and the only the only people who really do anything about health breaking or were these young people out that this rich man's of states are in Illinois who are trying to solve a secret messages that that he thought were hidden embedded in Shakespeare\nAnd some very quickly this kind of quixotic literary project that Elizabeth had had originally signed up for it age twenty three turned into a um an urgent a project a secret thing German or messages during time before\nAnd without getting too much into the tire science of the group ... suffice it to say that you can make some efforts at a hiding what you're sending but uh you will often lead clues and of course if you were adept in the art of or uncovering those clues that you could figure out what they were saying anyway\nAnd that is of course is what we're talking about tonight in the woman who smashed codes one eight six six Bible jumbo our number and a journalist and author Jason ... is our guest doc calls in from Wilmington, Delaware a good evening dog\nDying you as always for taking my call vegetable and there's a fascinating topic I wanted to both why laboratory a quick question for your author or a ...\nLaw a minority of freedom and I tried it on my record breaking first started out as on on top of this one author um Bush's terminal and breaking a Japanese foes that German soldiers at World War two and a show did she could change after or two orange crap for a war two\nAnd a ... she was she the equivalent in America the unnamed spies and bread\nA boy you're you're all over the the the area that is in fact you're at it even goes beyond that the dock adjacent uh\nI guess she was quite active in World War two and and and also active in between the war is working on all things ah ah gangsters and and the Nazis in South America give us a little an outline if you will of the of the rough history of Elizabeth Smith Friedman is activities\nSure a that's a great question Dr ... so briefly a rough outline is that\nShe um she got her start during World War two uh the cooking German messages then asked award she moved to Washington um he went to work for the army animal would go on to create the team\nThat during World War two broke the Japanese a diplomatic safer noticed purple and a while Elizabeth went on a different path she went to work for the Treasury Department specifically the coast guard and the coast guard or in those days the twenties and thirties us on the frontlines of fighting the run more\nTrying to stop the tide of uh illegal liquor that was being shipped all around the world\nI'm run runners we're a running circles around the coast guard which was under powered and and corrupt\nAnd or a loser figured out how to intercept the radio messages that run boats were were sending a encrypted with ah with codes and snipers to control their uh\nTheir shipments of liquor so she would she would intercept these are short wave radio messages that run runners we're sending to pirate ... stations on the shore and she went to a break the codes read the messages and figure out where the votes were and send the coast guard after them she she caught a number of a sort of notorious gangsters of of her day\nWith these techniques and then it turned out that I'm at the dawn of World War two\nShe uh she was really well positioned to go after Nazi spies who are spreading across South America because the Nazi spies\nHappen to be using very similar or radio equipment and very similar types of codes as the ... so it wasn't that she had had it had had any training specifically to to go after a German intelligence agents it's just that\nKind of through an accident of history in through long experience and skill she gotten very very good at this uh discipline or intercepting um radio messages breaking them in trying to trying to light up at\nA dark in network whether that be you know hit a network of rump ships on the oceans or hitting network of Nazi spies are spreading into the western hemisphere\nAnd I would ... the only option was after after the war went to the African World War two\nYeah oven by which time I guess she was getting on in years wasn't gee\nSure well uh I think she was in her late forties at the end of World War two okay what else extremists that when\nShe was still she was still a you know still in the sort of in the prime of her professional career but it's just one of the this is one of the sad or\nA tragic parts of the story which is that even though all through World War two she done is incredibly vital important work a of a you know lighting up these are hidden Nazi spy network she she was providing um\nThousands of messages to the FBI to British Intelligence the army and the navy he's messages were used to destroy the Nazi spine networks ultimately render them harmless and give the allies a a an advantage in the war\nUm she did all of this really difficult work and uh the FBI was not able to do it because they didn't have the code breaking expertise so she she did it for them and then after the war gender Hoover\nCame out and you stuck up his hand and essentially told America you went on a publicity blitz told America that the FBI had done all of this work\nOr he did not credit Elizabeth he did not credits her team the ... coast guard and um and it was but it was not able to do anything about it or protest\nBecause all of that work was part of the top secret ultra program so she was she was down to secrecy and and uh Jagger who are sick to credit for what she ... she dead so as a result of that and the FBI\nWas kind of known as a you know the author of this road deed and nobody ever knew all this this man and as a result uh in Nineteen forty six a while the FBI was sort of reaping the benefits of of this uh adulation to the American public for doing the cool thing or Elizabeth team was\nSort of an ceremonies flee disbanded and she was fired a given a reduction in force so she was like a\nAh thanks for your call docket more calls to come for I guess Jason ...

getting stuff on a on TV and and got to get married so I\nI Will I Will leave a I Believe the screen writing to them that's not my not my area of expertise\nSarah do about it would you like to be

times a year where there I\nI mean I think there are a lot of uh a lot of actresses who could do a was with justice I I'm I'm a I'm a big fan of Amy Adams a she's a really a wonderful and everything I've seen her and but uh\nYou know there are probably five or six others uh who would who would do it justice\nOr another very good now that uh uh Elizabeth Smith headache Quaker background was there ever any a conflict that uh she expressed regarding the fact that uh that she\nWas in fact you gauge didn't work which led to many cases directly to people dying\n[noise] yeah that's ... that's a great question she struggled with that tension all of her career she was brought up quicker by Charlie without parents she couldn't believe it or what Quakers believe the basic precepts one of them being\nUm non violence and um you know even in into World War two a while she was helping to sort of pinpoints um the locations of Nazi spies said that that seems the ground going arrest them disrupt the rings while she was\nYou know it's a cryptic messages that um you know would directly lead to the enemy getting killed\n'em or ... or at least captured she she was copying down hospice poems and keeping them in a a a ... file a [laughter]\nThat she she had a personal effects so um I I think that you reconcile that by um [noise] uh which just sort of a a a sense of duty and sacrifice that uh I I think was was common in that generation than a lot of people who served\nShe never a glorified wore a she thought that it was horrible\nBut um I think that she felt that her government had asked her to do a job\nAnd um that's a it was a time of global crisis and that she had a she had to accept that challenge because\nYou know and a lot of ways she was indispensable she was just too good at what she did a a lifelong complaint that birds actually she she always uh complains that are men from the government were always showing up on her doorstep asking her\nSolve puzzles for America and the only way to make them go away with to solve the puzzle that was a problem she was too good at what she does\nNow of course you mentioned how how later a or sexism principally manifested by a J Edgar Hoover prevented her from getting into credit you deserve but this story begins\nBefore she even had the right to vote in this country I'm Wondering about early encounters with sexism ah you know yeah she she's smart but she's only a woman that kind of thing\n[noise] right [noise] uh she she complained about a lot in her diary and we just dire actually she she felt that um she was very easily dismissed by by men that she was dismissed by professors or dismissed by other men around her\nAnd take her seriously um partly because she was a woman I'm also partly because she was very good teachers physically she was about five foot three and very ... built\nUm she also she also thought that it was it was her name that that contributed to um to being minimized ... she was named Smith she's the most common name in English language and she she couldn't stand that cheap chic complain that her diary that uh as soon as she introduced herself as somebody named Smith than\nUh whoever she was talking to immediately as soon as soon as she must be ordinary and if there was anything that she wanted\nA it was a a life that was unusual and something out of the ordinary so she says she definitely experienced sexism in her life very early on and I think\nYou know one of one of the major manifestations of it was the fact that she couldn't find any other job after she graduated from college accept a job\nTeaching school and that was that was what she was doing when she was twenty three issues that principle of small high school and Indiana\nAnd at the time um you know this is before there were you know in any significant number of a female professors at colleges yeah uh there were only a handful of women who are even getting PHD is in America\nI'm sort of the end of the line if you were a bright young woman or an educated was that you taught high school or you're taught middle school you're caught elementary school you got married you have kids and he died and yeah and she just wanted something more than that\nThose those are all added up to make a quote a woman's place unquote er at the time\nWere there any instances who came to cross into looking into her story Jason in the woman who smashed codes of ah not just sexism but just flat out and out jealousy that she just salt stuff to other people couldn't solve\n[noise] sure\nAh this was that this was a recurring problem in in her career too is that she was a she would solve these spectacular cases are and and then she would get written about in the paper because she was a story you know she was she was as an American housewife who had two kids and yet\nAh during the twenties and thirties she was taking on these gangsters and she wasn't just taking them on in an office you know solving their messages and getting them convicted she was actually\nAttending their trials and testify and\nSo they knew who she was\nRight the newer face they could see her and um it's just not necessarily the safest thing to be doing right you can you can uh you can imagine and um\nAnd so yeah so there were there would be you know there'd be gangsters or on trial a lot of these a lot of these run running rings where international crime syndicates it was essentially the mafia and so she would she would walk into court a unprotected with\nYou know a pink dress in a in a in a of a hat with a flower pinned to the brand and she would stare down these guys the defense table you know five three and see what the explain exactly how she had broken their coats exactly how she had essentially\nStolen their thoughts and uh you know and she did it fairly fearless we all all through that time\nBut it was necessary for her to actually get into the tradecraft\nIn a court of law that's that's remarkable of today is of course the minute anything like that came up a federal agent would would would walk in with some kind of a of a federal court order and would immediately shut down that testimony at least in part of a public trial\nI mean that the free market you know these are things that were these are things that that uh\nLet me put it this way when I left the army uh I took an oath not to talk about certain things which I have not read many many decades later I was even forbidden\nTo visit a a a an iron curtain country for five years after I left the army and I was a a relatively small

World War two if she was working on the German\nEncryption machine did she ever deal directly with the famous people at ... park in Britain\nWe'll see some people it at ... she dealt with a group that ... that was focused on cracking a new machine that were used by a spot in South America and that's the same a project that she was engaged and she was tracking spies and South America mainly in in Brazil and Argentina and some of this\nEyes were by Nineteen forty two and Nineteen forty three or using a versions of the ... machine enigma model\nAnd so I'm so Elizabeth and her team at the coast guard in America\nOr was working on trying to crack the spy enigma machines are simultaneously in a while the sissy ended up ... was trying to crack the same machines and today they develop the kind of like a friendly competition um they would try to each each group would try to break the or a new nigger machine first\nThen ah if whoever thought they had a broken at crossword set of secret cables\nThe other say uh we got it and uh a couple of times the uh the coast guard unit I got there a few days before\nThey sent the answer over to ... and then ... cable back like oh we already solved that we don't need rats were good here um\nSo uh so they managed to break the spy enigma as they were being used in South America and I gather a number of a sort of important intelligence tidbits on on the rings they're a Elizabeth figured out that said spies heads a head group themselves in Argentina\nAnd that the uh the Nazi agents there had formed a secret alliance with the Argentinean security forces\nAnd that they were trying to create a fascist block of countries in South America that would be um um that would be against the allies and what uh what what tried to turn the southern part of the confidence fashion so that would be aligned with the access and\nThat's one of the uh a potential threats that she was able to neutralize\nIn their later years ah ah her husband are William ... suffered from depression right\nYes so he he suffered from depression really all all his life I mostly undiagnosed and um you know it it it kind of came to the fore during times of intense stress so\nUm he he he was hospitalized for the first time during World War two\nA beginning of Nineteen forty after his army team had um spent eight months to a year um cracking this Japanese purple coat as as soon as that that work I was just very difficult was finished he um he sort of had a breakdown mental breakdown collapse and he was hospitalized for a number of months\nAt Walter Reed army hospital and then after that he was sort of re hospitalized or several times um you know those conditions it's sort of resembled a bipolar disorder and or worse than throughout throughout his life\nWhen he finally passed away here and we got about another minute and a half year uh she designed his tombstone William s Friedman lieutenant colonel United States army Eighteen Ninety One to Nineteen sixty nine knowledge is power a quote from I guess or Thomas Bacon ... there was a message had been that\nYes it's a this is one of my favorite pieces of the story so I'm so

company just recently a package addressed a democratic donors Tom Steyer\nThe found in California [noise] and earlier one intended for former director of national intelligence James Clapper address to CNN in New York was intercepted at a New York facility and another address the New Jersey senator Cory Booker was down in Florida\n\nSo that it was a prologue let us continue our discussion divided one eight six six by boat jumbo one eight six six five oh five four six to six by starting our calls with Dan who calls in from Pittsburgh this evening and the damned good evening welcome\nAiming Jumo how are you are really the same thing\nI'm fine thank you\nOkay ah I just wanted wanted to say I called in life [noise] and I wanted to poll guys that I was ... you were all were neighbor I stated that I thought it may have been a Democrat\n[noise] it was trying to\nMake 'em get more Democrats to vote mhm\nWell and that was a perfectly logical supposition giving some of the things that we've seen it just didn't turn out to be true but no\nI just wanted to apologize to you that no ... no apology\nNecessary Dan ah again it it ... that would not have surprise me that turned out to be the case again we're obviously talking about a deranged individual\nUh and just how he he assuming that he is in fact sincere about supporting the president\nOr just how he he uh in whatever twisted logic he applied the thought that this would help the president uh in particular or Republicans in general is is beyond understanding\nOr obviously it it does neither but again as as I noted earlier we we are now talking about about a logical rational being he apparently ... it all yeah go ahead\nThank you\nUh well you're you're more than welcome goodnight use it for you to Danbury she had a very much and again no apology necessary again a a logical suffer position a but then of course assumes that we were dealing with the logical person obviously a well this was the person who doesn't think logically\nAnd who ah who in some areas for example or to note uh some of the the various activities of George Soros doesn't mean he is behind every bad thing that happens in the world\nOr to be opposed to someone as devoted\nA to identity politics as as Maxine Waters would would up to that point only make him a rational individual she is a despicable human being make no mistake about it she has not worthy of being targeted with the bomb nor is anybody else and this is a person\nWho has clearly again and it would seem repeatedly demonstrate and his er an fitness for being out among the rest of us\nAnd ah that that bothers me a great deal with a a past criminal history that uh is considerable\nThis goes back a at least a\nTo a twenty seven years\nWhen he was arrested for larceny in Florida according to Florida State records he's based other charges of larceny grand theft and fraud in southern Florida in oh to Miami police arrested him\nFor contacting Florida power and the light and threatening to blow them up saying that it would be worse than September eleventh and furthermore threatening the company's representative with physical harm is electricity was turned off so that seems to be a common theme\nAmong his uh his various activities seeds are say are apparently is a person who for whatever reason if his electric and he was in danger of being turned off\nA the answer obviously is not to phone in a bomb threat\nI don't know if it was in danger of being turned off of he wasn't paying his bills whatever\nA but obviously irrational individual does not engage in such behavior at some point society has to find a way to deal with such people in a legal and responsible way not just keep turning the loose in this case by the way he pled guilty\nWithout trial and was sentenced to probation in hopes apparently that he would be a good boy\nOne eight six six five oh jumbo when eight six six five oh five or six to six Edgar in Akron, Ohio but even then you had your\n... well the last caller played a lie et cetera et cetera or\nThe crisis I really feel it faces psychiatry Renee okay I Do apologize for little or no need to be a Democratic Party plot to have someone running around planning bombs that uh yeah so satellite and everywhere else\nOn the air that I said that was a perfectly plausible a view to take and I I stand by that it was a leader but I'm not apologizing\nI guess well I don't expect you to but I certainly ... paintings plausible in the world we live in today but\nThe evidence indicates now that we're dealing with something entirely different\nWell we're dealing with the man who is obviously ... and or a danger to society of themselves as well and we can see that I I'm sure when the agents ... is a van they\nMay have a breed the sigh of relief well they they ... him at this as a lunatic\nAnd unfortunately I Am Janet I take no pleasure and saying even though I didn't vote for Mr Trump\nThat we had a president who ah who is your ... call though he has now shifted a strategy just saying well the media treats me bad and get a tiny bad\nWhat Lester presidents or do you do get did you sell throughout your career as a liar\nAnd you're now on indicted coke and spirit sharing the rabbit mother will probably make little if he removed from office\nLet's go back to what you said I'm not sure that you could make any case that he has spent his entire career as a liar\nAnd in terms of uninsured either ... let me just respond to you by noting that so far Robert Mueller has not laid a finger on Donald Trump\nHis entire probe of close to two years has come up with a few minor players who were in ... and their associations with the president he's found nothing is is entire investigation has been a sick joke\nWell he's released not being oh gym rats\nCan do all of this way believe me believe me or I'll hold my breath but I I think that if he had anything he would have released it by now he's got nothing\nNothing Edgar a or are we would have already heard it in for the more we would have already heard it not only from him but it would have been leaked\nA I don't I don't see any big surprises coming up in the next week and a half that I don't I don't see it all he's got nothing\nHe's indicted ... Russians will never see the inside of a courtroom and a few minor players with only peripheral connections to the Trump campaign and the entire rationale promoters investigation of Trump campaign collusion with the Russians was false from day one\nIt was an investigation in search of a crime which in of itself is a violation of the special counsel statute\nTo are littered in Crawford county Illinois on the jumbo Hannah Joe littered good evening\nGood evening yeah I just wanted to make a real quick comment in regards to everything going on with this finding the guy\n\nYou know in our society today people like the broad brush and all you know groups of people for the active you know one person or just a few people\nUh you know whether\nOr not one Democrat doing one thing like the shooting a in Virginia and\nSaying well all burning orders are like this you know so on so forth at one guy had an obvious support for Donald Trump as it looks right now ah I just wanted to say I really hope everybody\nListening to your show or regardless if they are not not that out that brought\nWere cause [noise] when you take your jumps out at the Y. someone else is getting job training [noise]\nTake the cardio class once kids are in an after school enrichment program [noise]\nPractices down facing zone as its practices or leadership skills\nWe were with people no matter their age income or background and give them the opportunity to learn grow and thrive on all with one simple goal in mind\nTo strengthen our community and we got so much more that does just that [noise]\nThe one you might think why is that place to live the way we're also about lifting tired [noise]\nWe're so much more than a place called\nYMCA dot net slash more\nUh three five eighty three sixty\n[noise]\nCut back to the gym ... one eight six six five oh Jim vote one eight six six five oh five four six to six\nWe are taking you look at the aftermath of the arrest obviously this story is going to go on for a long long time the wheels of justice turned very slowly in this country but for the record these are say oc fifty six of a avid tour of Florida was arrested friday morning\nAt a business in plantation Florida some thirty miles north of Miami apparently he had been tracked for some time\nAnd the attempt was made to arrest him at a place other than a known address of his that is to say out in public where would be less\nLikely for him to be able to respond in a violent way we have a no further details about exactly how that arrest wind although ah\nAh it would seem that he was it was rather docile and cooperative in his initial\nDiscussions with the FBI said that the bombs were never meant to hurt anyone and couldn't hurt anyone so uh\nAgain the he says that that was a that is that that was his intent why you would bother to send out the bombs that couldn't go off\nOther than just making a big fuss and to destroy the rest of your free life isn't clear but as we've noted this is not irrational individual and is clearly somebody who should not have been running around loose [noise]\nAh the laws should reflect the fact that there are some people out there who have no damn business walking the streets\nAnd obviously you've got to have more precise language the mat and obviously this treads into areas that need to be very carefully explored with precisely written laws but nonetheless that needs to be done\nWe should not just sit back and give people every opportunity in the world to keep trying and trying and trying again and again until finally we'd say okay you've done enough damage [noise] uh\nWe are lucky that this did not involve anything that was fatal Steve in the ... North Carolina on the jumbo Hannah Joe good evening Steve\nGym but I have three little comments here and\n... to me what's going to be important here is I mean we got one that's the ... so that's where I'm a disturbed person was trying to kill as many\nAnd what would have if it hadn't been for capital Capitol police but many Congress center set up there as possible\nUm which was a Bernie Sanders follower ah it would have been just a very steep but to blame that on a or try to attack that Bernie Sanders\nA than the guilty party or the ... that was decided to show up with a gun that day and start start trying to kill people exactly\nI I certainly say that it will be quite fair a to a place blame on the like let's say of the mass antifa thugs or and or people who go round committing vandalism and attacking other individuals they certainly set an example and uh I'm happy to pass blame for something like that in that direction\nBut no Bernie Sanders no Bernie Sanders is not the kind of go goes around shooting people who would encourage people to shoot other people are engaging in the act of violence I disagree with Bernie Sanders on almost every issue of the day except that he's relatively moderate on guns\nBut uh that fact not withstanding Bernie Sanders was not a terrorist so you're right\nAnd my second thing would be and this is just foods the salt and I've I've thought about this that that I'm\nHeaded back in the course we don't know all the details of this yet so things are going to come out I Believe that had a band or the other way around\nBy by other way around it or you mean had it been a somewhat from the left who did this\nAttack and Republicans ... ... Republican Bob where it's not very long ago that was a the ... or ... or or something that was\nPart of their head back to various incidents of a of a genuine poisons that were mailed yes\nYeah but anyway if it had been the other way around that this was a\nFull fledged or let this\nThat was sending bombs to\nWear what the the storyline they now on the news would they go back and say that that statement from Maxine Waters or Hillary Clinton about being syllable or kick them when they die out you know\n... whether down right at that as a reference to a Eric Holder right [noise]\nYeah would they go back and take the ball I put that\nNo the short answer is clear and it is obvious no they would not it is a double standard in and there's only one of scores of such a double standards that exists out there there is a blatant\nAnd a deep seated bias against Donald Trump and ... in particular and Republicans in general is reflected in the media today and that's just a fact and you can find countless examples to prove that you're exactly right\nUh that double standard would prevail without any question whatsoever and and again how many people live\nI'm Out and and and uh assailed antifa from the left how many I mean I don't I don't remember ever hearing any of these principles people here that the Schumer is the pillows these the Feinstein's the Clintons anybody you know why 'cause they're scared to death\nOf the the left wing of the Democratic party that's that's why [noise] uh so I think your points are well taken Steve and yes there is a double standard time and

is going for a good cause or so you've been told in the middle of the twentieth century\nWin lotteries first started in the United states there were soldiers states as a way to benefit the American public by providing additional funding for education that means as a jackpots get bigger and people spend more money on lotteries two hundred and twenty three dollars per year by the average American in fact\nThere would be more money in state budgets to spend on education but that isn't happening\nHaven't been using lottery money for additional education funding\nInstead they're using it to fund the basic education budget and using the money that would normally fund education\nOn other things altogether what's that mean states are misusing funds well no they're not there are you kidding may know the the lottery isn't adding to the education up you know ...\nThey're taking money it it's going into the education budget but then they're taking money that used to go to the education budget and shifting battles yes there are misusing funds yes mhm\nWell they're not misusing because not breaking in law they're just\nThey're using your the original they're replacing funds\nThat they're ... misusing\n[laughter] and they're missing [laughter]\nWhich is why that money's going into the Education Fund it doesn't mean more education money because the other education money is being taken somewhere else isn't that what you just said\nI I mean that's what I read earlier that there are misusing dwell on is that they have now and this this money is going into an education fund but it's not actually increasing the amount that they're spending on education right\nWhat they used to ... they're well they're moving money around it doesn't mean image of using money misusing money to me means that you are using it for inappropriate purposes well that might be ... well I Know know how I ...\nIt's it's it's money that's not appropriate for that that to me as a misuse if it's not appropriate it and they take it from one cough or to the other that's to me that in Minnesota but that's like\nSaying if you have if you open up a new tax ... and you say okay this tax money is going to fund education and this tax money that used to fund education is going to go elsewhere that isn't technically misusing anything\nYou're not ... well you may be in line yeah you may you may have\nIt may not be the original intent of what you told people you were going to do those politicians back then sold you one thing and politicians today by the way\nWe had said this way back when that eventually they're going to move the money around we talk show host back then said this was going to happen in ... and ... and it did happen so you can say is the did the system\nOverall\nUh not tell you the truth over that period of time you would be corrects or could you pick one individual Who Lied about it probably not yeah\nWell in my opinion that's the misuse of funds are observation because it's allocated for this and that is what you settled on that's that's you you bring something to the people\nAnd you tell them we want to introduce this way of raising funds for this purpose I slept and can because remember they'll still tell you it's going to education but in fact they plug it is that it's not adding ...\nRight but as it was originally sold it would add to the educated would you agree it would make it so we would solve the problems did you also see what was that did you see the attorney\nGeneral of the of the Colorado saying that ah you know that overall said coffers aren't benefiting from\nThe marijuana sales right because it's recreational things that people would spend on ... ... and other things\nWell it's funny because you and I talked about this about sports venues or something and they they sell you you know okay we're going to build his new sports than you and it will bring a lot of money to this area well it might bring money to that block that the vicinity [laughter] that um that neighborhood\nBut it's actually shifting it from somewhere else in that area\nIn other words people were making the because there's only so much money they have to spend on entertainment right um you know unless unless with the exception of the Dallas Cowboys where you have people mortgaging there [laughter]\nIn front of city license for that seat license and typically they wouldn't do that before so there is that but ah yeah it's just you're just taking entertainment\nMoney I don't know if you know what would be a great study now you've got me curious\nPeople who are spending money on legal marijuana\nAnd I guess we could only include the the people who\nI don't know who are smoking more marijuana or just started smoking marijuana because it's legal what did they change about their budget what did they give up in order to afford the marijuana I Would I Would love to see that poll I'm just curious just curious\nIf not Netflix\nOh come on and say but [laughter] but if if you're a heavy pot smoker you really worried about a budget\nWell the money has come from somewhere [laughter] right [laughter] okay what is it that you're talking now what's in the pawn shop now\nNot ... not you're you're not cutting back on Monday [laughter]\nWell and she 'cause that's that's adding to the budget so you're Cheetos slash pot budget where where's that coming from\nBut the judge just seeing a little bit about the lottery there we thought we'd start the show out with that and speaking of ... coming up with a little bit we'll talk about Mr Potter ...

[noise] ah you know I just I saw this article\nI I I thought it was worth bringing up 'cause we talked about the midterms and the the tax cuts and everything else in the president promising more tax cuts are coming up\nFollowing a you know the the the election even in the lame duck session\nBut the the hill dot com or talked about\nThe latest poll the American barometer survey and before you say look that's a big pool because everybody loves the tax cuts\nEven if they won't don't emit let me first of all through the numbers a majority of Americans want President Trump's tax cut to be made permanent or left alone ... and allowed to expire according to a new American barometer survey\nThe poll a joint project of he'll TV and Harris exit polling company found\nThat twenty seven percent of respondents want the plan to remain permanent\nTwenty nine percent gutter should be left alone and allowed to expire forty four percent of the respondents said the plan should be rolled back and you're saying wait a minute forty four percent that seems pretty high doesn't it right want the tax cuts rolled back right\nWhen you have close to fifty percent of people that pay no income tax why would that be surprising write a song do benefit out of the tax gotten they're not paying mhm so that isn't surprising at all\nAs to other folks are there and and again we we always asked this question um\nAnd this is on on the tax cuts in certain districts and we if you listen to the show for a while you know we said this the danger this could cause especially in house races that are read\nIn high property tax income tax areas\nAnd this is the fact that I Know and and again I live in a I don't live in any extravagant mansion\nThe my house is twenty three hundred and\nForty square feet not tiny not like the house I grew up in ... was you know with my parents for the first house which was probably I don't know\nHow some square feet eleven hundred square feet ... was tiny a but still I live in a you know middle class middle class section I Am with property taxes and sales tax I'm ... right against that ten thousand dollar limit\nRight and\nMy property taxes maybe a little higher but we have no income tax\nHere whether there is no state income tax and uh in in Texas\nBut we have always worried about the Republican tax plan not because Eric and I not for that reason but for other deductions at you and I can't take because of business interests were in not because you and I have to pay higher taxes because that's the even though you and I have to pay higher taxes that's not going to change the way that were voting\nRights not going to change the way that we plan on voting at all we're not talking about us we're talking about a significant portion of people out there\nThat are having to pay higher taxes in that plan because they live in a high tax state and they may live in a Republican district but\nIf you see some of these districts in these in these blue states but even in in some even in Texas there are a ton of people that may be hit oh yeah because you because you have that cap on it mhm Euclid gives a tax\nRates very um you know from you you can go just a from where I live to just uh you know several miles north and the tax rate varies greatly yeah and then of course the value of the home that influences\nThe model now that I Believe my tax rate in my town is higher than a quite a bit higher than yours I Believe I'm\nA yeah my my tax rate is is very low which is why it's one of the most attractive areas in terms of people moving to it um but even aside from that if you've got a a home that's worth more\nThan ... where's your your taxes are higher\nAnd lower rate right so when when you see that and you see the number of of a ... and and remember ... ... the the the people that will be at that add\nA aren't we're not talking the super rich were I heartland about what his view in many of these high income areas and as solid Republican voters who are in the middle to upper middle class\nRight and they're getting hit and they don't like it and\nWhat's their only recourse right now\nThere's still a supporter of Trump but what's their recourse to send the message my Republican congressman ... and we've always we worried about that from the very beginning\nI don't know how it's going to affect I'm simply bringing up the issues out there that when it comes to people's individual budget when it comes to then paying more money I don't care who you are nobody wishes to do that and even though won't change everybody's vote it has the potential of changing\nFive percent of the vote yeah which makes the entire difference in a house election so that's that's a you know that's one thing we've talked about the Democrats and we've talked about what what they face the whole cabinet thing", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Jim Bohannon Show", "city": "Johnson City", "day": "27"}
