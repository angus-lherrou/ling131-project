Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh was questioned by police after a bar fight in Nineteen eighty five New York times reporter Ben protests Mr\nKavanaugh or was hanging out with friends at a bar and what appears that the police were called after a man they got into an argument which\nHad to go to the hospital because he was bleeding from the right here it appears that for Kavanaugh didn't cost that and then so but he apparently one pointed throw ice on that man and\nI was part of the larger kind of shrug that they were and and there was an eye witness that identified with the other people who are involved in the Internet and they all seem to be part of Mr Kavanaugh's group of friends to reveal\nThe FBI is also talked a long time Kavanaugh friend mark judge but his attorney says the interview has not been completed the U.S has reached a trade pact with Mexico and Canada the agreement\nCanada and to the detriment of the U.S you know and and yeah\nSo they uh Trump took a look at it and said we have to do this over and he's come up with something that uh it's not perfect but I think it's a step in the right direction it will be revisited every six years\nOld he a good he legitimately say that ah I Donald Trump the dealmaker have made a good deal here\n[noise] um I I Would say um it's a good deal it's not a a great deal the idea was a free trade what really everybody would like to get to the point where you had no terrorists on anything\nUm that really benefits both great trading partners now politically especially what a country like Canada or who wants to protect their dairy farming industry are coming up with an agreement that has no tariffs on anything would be very difficult\nUh so this doesn't do that but\nI'm a little closer to it and I'm a little more putting in balance um the uh agreements with a Canada and Mexico rather that having being such imbalance in favor of our trading partners\nIn I suppose an ideal a universe perhaps a free trade will benefit of both trading partners but not if uh you uh happened to be a worker in the uh a higher income to pair of the partners and the euro workers vastly undercut by people working for a penny Easter bread with what you're getting\nA matter of course is the basis for re doing this whole thing\nThat's exactly right and that applied um a lot to the auto industry um where Mexican wages in particular are much much lower than American wages or the other issue is the um environmental laws\nFor factories are much more relaxed in Mexico than they are in the U.S the result was that was much cheaper to make cars in Mexico and then bring them into the U.S a which is exactly what what happened\nOn the the other issue particularly with cars a there was a little bit of a cheating sort of by China or so when\nA imagined that site [laughter] cars made in China\nAnd imported into the U.S as a a a fairly small tower of only two and a half percent that put on it now China if we make a car and sell it there they put a twenty five percent Paris and some models cars we are a sell over there they put a fifty percent terrorists\nAre so that's not fair and Trump wants to bring China to the table as soon as possible um and I believe they'll come to the table before the end of the year\nNot only as it was just going to look at China for just a second here you know it was somebody in this country really stupid enough to make that deal or are the Chinese simply a ignoring what they agreed to do in the first place you\nKnow as somebody made a bad deal\nWhy when you make a deal that ban I I'm I'm astounded\nI mean why would not anybody run against any administration made such a deal by citing those very figures and campaigning in every state that was affected with workers that were affected by that I I'm just astounded how could it would be better to have no trade with China than than trade in that kind of circumstance\n... yeah um it it's it's worse than that if ... if you look at every agreement we we have NAFTA with China or what we did have with South Korea what you made a little better Japan or even the European Union\nEvery one of the agreement is slanted in favor of our trading partners\nAnd the example I use is it's it's as if for playing baseball\nAnd we get three outs every inning and for some reason the agreements resign give every one of our trading partners for outs every inning\nThat why are losing every ball game why\nIn the world would we do this I mean I just ... I'm astounded that that we would do this ... surely on ... behalf of the minister rations which have done this a night given the number of deals you just mentioned I assume this covers democratic and Republican administrations why would you do that\nI think the idea was that a particular with master back in the in the nineties look the U.S economy is so big that um we'd like to create a free trade\nZone in North America but look we're so big we really should help Mexico and Canada or develop their economies so even if we give them a break that will help them grow and develop and we ... we should have an obligation I guess I had to help uh some of our our trading partners\nNo blessed are ... are you kidding me that's not a I mean I I guess that would be nice for all of those are those are those voters who elected us presidents from a auto was Saskatchewan and a Chihuahua but of course there are no voters they're the these are are deals worked out by administration is elected by Americans we have no\nObligation of legal certainly I'm not as far as I'm concerned no moral obligation to build up their economies I mean this isn't the days of the Marshall Plan for Pete's sake\nThat's exactly right and ... you know and President Trump when he was running for office he said look at everybody we're all concerned with globalism and trying to help everybody else and it's time we put America's interests first\nAnd then uh other countries of interest steals um are are just so bad that we have hundreds of billions of dollars\nFlowing out of our country every year because\nWe allow these the deals that they have to look at the European Union same thing with cars they have a two and a half percent to Arab for cars made in Germany or France we charge a two and a half percent tariff we make a car sell it in Europe they charge at ten percent tariff\nSo we buy a lot of their cars money flows out of the country they buy very few of our cars very little of that money flows into the country we end up with this huge negative balance of trade\nAnd what do you wonder how that happens [laughter] and by the way just for the record just for the record now you're talking about Europe the European Union I suppose from a moment of its formation until this very day has always had a bigger economy than the United states ...\nYeah in in total ... of the of the European\nUnion yeah yeah so um the idea what was it was all look at with with Canada ... so the the us dairy\nFarmers are extremely efficient at producing dairy products we can make a product sell it in to Canada for a dollar\nThat Canadian dairy farmers cost them three dollars and fifty cents to make the same product so the Canadian government said look we want to protect our dairy industry were gonna put two hundred and Seventy\nPercent higher of on dairy products or something we sell for a dollar two dollars and Seventy cents ... fix it up to three Seventy that may means the Canadian dairy farmers that can make it for three fifty stay in business but it closes the U.S dairy farmers out of the Canadian market\nThis agreement it doesn't completely fix it by ... works toward a rectify that situation\nWill talk some more about this with our guest Dr Michael butler he is a public policy analyst and professor of finance at Stockton University on line that the Stockton dot edu dinner you look at this and this case a renegotiated NAFTA which has yet to be ratified to be sure it is called\nThe United states Mexico Canada agreement it doesn't have quite the hand the acronym of NAFTA but I guess maybe a\nA N lined with an old popular song us M.

new trade deal there's been worked out but among the United states Canada and Mexico\nAnd it is a deal which must be ratified by a Congress are sharing and crane Missouri called with some questions about to follow the money\nAnd uh I gave up my answer but I'd like our guest professor Michael butler from Stockton state universe locked in university uh to give his take on the motivation behind these bad trade deals up till now\nYeah so Sharon brought up two points one about uh why we do these trade deals the other about some things that China will do so let me comment first on or why we made these trade deals um maybe I Am being a little naive\nUm but it ... talked on the very beginning of the show your cat and when I said all these trade deals are skewed in favor of our trading partners you kept asking me why and I don't I couldn't come up with a real good answer\nAs though it may be have to do is follow the money\nUm I still it looked to me like uh the u._s. was just trying to make these deals and uh had some\nA sense of wanting to help other countries\nAre and that's why these deals were so a lopsided in favor of the trading partners it could have something to do with the money I don't know I Can't for the life of me figure out why everybody kept making all these deals for all these years or so if somebody comes up with a good reason mid may it may make\nSo much Sharon I Would I Would only add that again seriously you must understand the first of all and this was a view that as far too widely held among some ... some elite circles in this country we're only Americans number one and\nNumber two there is this\nThis deep empathy for the the vast teaming masses of anywhere else and this notion that we have this this moral obligation to to lift them up and if it costs American workers a little bit well that's okay\nUh they all have a relatively higher incomes and I really believe a serious ... that's a major motivating factor a lot of these people\nWith a lot rather have a Nobel Peace prize that may would a billion dollars Geron\nWell you know what can I think a ... not done that pulled a suspect or ... but it's that that they believe that the biggest budget cuts while if I ever [laughter] and\nWhy thoroughly agree I thoroughly agree you just you just have to understand the people with whom we're dealing here I I like I said that I've been around these people and that is the attitude maybe there's some money here maybe Sharon's on to something but I I think that a lot of simply has to do with the fact\nThat that these ... you must understand that the the ... many of these people is how to make themselves morally superior to the rest of us\nAnd and if they go to night go to bed every night thinking you know I've I've made things better for the teeming mass was out there somewhere thanks of course do they're screwing over a lot of my fellow citizens in a better term by the way that they\nThey it's true that they don't believe in citizenship anyway they they are they're all part of this one world sing coup by on hold hands crowd or but but seriously that that's a major part of the motivation here\nUh but anyway thank you very much\nYeah absolutely I mean I I I really honestly do despite my questioning of a doctor bus or about that I really think that's a large part of the of the motivation and uh let's not talk to a Maggie who calls in from Alexandria, Virginia ... hello Maggie\nNo thanks for taking my call short stay there might be more nasty a reason for this um situation if these lopsided trade deals because we have to think this is not really trade that's coming in here either outsourced American goods coming in here from China from Mexico from ... in from Canada all those cars you know\nSingle in some cases no they're not all outsourced but some are that's go ahead and\nThe thing is so um DC oh see the problem is outsourcing American seals they should they should be made to register as foreign agents for the country that the uh for production to really have a tattoo on their forehead\n[laughter] scarlet letter I like it\nOr I Would and read too yeah yeah you know\nEndangering the country and see if we have no steel industry here or know anything else we can't defend this place you know see see trying to hit a communist government will be to shut shut down your opponent or shut down your opponent and altogether is shut down their industry you know the if if you have an industry can we can defend this place you know of course ...\n... that those reports that are worth discussing first of all of course although officially the Communist Party still runs China but uh as I've long said\nThe the changes taking place over there you could power Beijing off of Mao spinning in his grave with all the millionaires driving around Shanghai and therefore are is so it's not a communist economy although it's still partially come to this but it is a a\nA a a a communist government with a huge dose of capitalism but your thoughts that Dr butler\nYeah I I was just going to say I'm everything that makes sense now here's the argument for allowing a China to make the products instead of being made in America so so let's say it cost a U.S\nA company's a hundred dollars a ton to make steel\nSuppose China can make it four eighty dollars a ton and sell it to us at twenty dollars less than we can produce it ourselves that will result in lower priced steel which means that the lower\nPriced steel going in to finish goods and that should keep the price of finish good low so that all consumers benefit by having the lower priced steel now some people argue well it's lower price because China subsidizes the Chinese government subsidizes the steel industry and that's true\nBut if if that's the case um many economists have argued if they subsidize their steel industry so they pay part of the costs and sell it to us for less money aren't they really subsidizing what we pay for steel\nAnd if that's the case shouldn't we take as much of the subsidies as they're willing to give us\nAll right let's legendary carry the argument a little bit further here it costs about nine million dollars to make him one a one Abrams tank I'm sure the Chinese could make if we're far less than that so why don't we\nOutsource our entire capability of making battled tanks to the Chinese and while rabbit we could also outsource the F thirty five fighter and our modern ships in the like and that we would just make out like bandits except for the fact that of course we will become a third rate world power\nYet except we don't have to have them built the tanks in the planes but\nIf the tanks in the planes have so much steel and them we can buy to steal from the Chinese are much lower cost\nThan it cost ... than for us to make ourselves then instead of these planes costs thing whenever they cost a few million dollars a piece you can reduce the cost to make the planes we don't need to give China our technology we don't need to let them make the finished product but if they can make components\nCheaper than we can make them ourselves are we better off taking it from them um and that allows us to produce it cheaper and that will be better off for us is\nWhich raises another point and I only have ... there'll be I'm going to bring up when we come back from the break\nBut the point is you said that ... we\nWe shouldn't have to give the the Chinese our ah our intellectual property secrets but of course to build a plant in China Today that's exactly what the Chinese have extracted from us\nAnd we'll come back we'll talk some more about uh some of the the Chinese are applications that possibly this new trade agreement with Mexico and Canada\nAh may preview\nOne eight six six five oh Jim boat with our guest\nA that it the products are made out of the country out of the money is falling out of the country even if it's a little more expensive here in the U.S at least the money stays here there's a multiplying effect of spending a money once it gets into the economy and Trump said look we're better off even if you have to pay\nA little more even with this agreement that has been signed it will result in consumer prices going up slightly but again the feeling is even if that happens and then we rebuild the the steel industry and rebuild industries that have been shut\nDown we're better off that way and lay overs pay a little bit more back in the moment\nIf you or someone you know is struggling with addiction please call this toll free number right now eight hundred

us\nAll I can gamble\nAll right uh will introduce two other guests to be with us in a moment here first of all regarding what most of us know about this uh the book Black Hawk down and of course especially\nThe Academy Award winning movie I gather that that you were a key points of disagreement or not so much a inaccuracy as shall we say an incomplete story\nIncomplete stories is an accurate description I mean I don't criticize Ridley Scott first of all he probably would end for Hollywood with a pretty good pretty good job of telling a story about the military the intensity of this combat chief of staff of the army and General Mark Milley said recently\nAt the time of the battle Ninety three this was the most intense urban combat since the battle of weigh in Nineteen sixty eight you know and\nSo that the movie after that intensity why it matters what the book primarily mess in several other books and\nThe one that bothered me the most likely it's one of the History Channel at a documentary called Black Hawk\nDown the real story it didn't even mention ... Mountain Division in that History Channel documentary and the fact is when the team went out to rescue the Ninety nine\nGuys that were trapped around super six one the first crafts go after Ninety nine guys passports rain to their track surrounded by a thousand well armed Somali people but when a rescue them there were three hundred and forty soldiers from ... Mountain Division\nWho was led by colonel or general bill ... will be our hair\nShort who led that group out there and there were about sixteen\nRangers in about eight Eight Belles guys three hundred and forty from Tempe mountain basin and those guys have got ... virtually no credit\nOr and they speak to that and so we can solve\nIt costs are coming up on the twenty fifth anniversary commemoration of in this battle that the story of the soldiers from Tempe mountains of theirs and\nIt was finally told fair enough and this would be the time to introduce the first of our guests he is in fact\nRetired army brigadier general build David that the commander at the time of task force coup fourteen back in October of Nineteen Ninety three General David is a graduate of West point he's had

four\nWhen we were on a work college fellowship at the University of Pittsburgh and\nUh he stayed in contact throughout the years and you know who would've guessed that uh you know\nThat association back then but it led to this so I'm first of all Randy deserves just an enormous amount of credit or for taking this on and I'm blushing has bludgeon his way through the bureaucracy to\nUm you know to\n\nTo get all the supporting historical documentation which makes this a an actual documentary and a and an interesting story as well so I'll I'll I'll start there\nWhen we ... we will certainly uh ask a current Larson a good deal about a bludgeon his way through the bureaucracy I spent some time in a in the army in in Vietnam I've seen bureaucracy an action I suppose the times I've been a minor part of it\nI'd like to introduce our third guest at this time and he is a retired army lieutenant colonel Michael L. or be a graduate of West point is well an airborne rangers as well in a highly

Bush had a very serious drinking problem at one point in his life to the extent that is why flowers said if you don't quit and lay than an asset written down there\nThat he was arrested for DWI\nUh up in the main area I Believe where the the family compound was that bad I I live that that that they did not try to have that it's fine it's because I think they they could have that you know Bush became president\nHe did of course we had to keep in mind that we're talking about two entirely different venues of approval here for the presidency you must merely get enough voters to like you to constitute an electoral college majority\nAnd here you're a entire constituency is one hundred people in the United States Senate\nAnd many of them with shall we say intense partisan viewpoints either way\nAnd that is an entirely different gauntlet to run than the the the general electorate\nYes it is I totally concur with that but the other thing is I'm really glad\nThat they're having this FBI a interrogation that cause I think that that probably will exonerate hand and cleared the record hairs with whereas if we didn't have it for the Democrats but they always be crying file\nA although I I think you're you're correct in in your assessment but\nI think that it wouldn't matter it could go a week it could go fifty two weeks that could go the rest of Brett Kavanaugh's lifetime and it still wouldn't be enough and we should never lose sight of what is at work here and that is\nAnything everything that can be used to keep a conservative off that court that is the motivation right down to its core\nAnd apparently in some cases a motivation by those who feel that it's just such a noble cause that anything is worthwhile are tearing down a man's family are uncorroborated charges or who knows what will come out next I Believe there was some\nSome thoughts brought up about his time a a coaching a youth sports in the like\nI'm not sure where this all goes but I Do know this that it does as a Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina noted\nIt does point out the extent to which are Democrats will give up their uh their power quite grudgingly and of course they're concerned about the fact that with the Supreme Court\nYou're talking about a a presence that is a lifetime job and very few people ever leave that job voluntarily they die or become disabled sometimes people such as that is a media predecessor Anthony Kennedy\nA will retire because they feel it's time but the ... at the very least you're probably talking about\nA a thirty year tenure assuming the the usual ah actuarial tables for a person of a Brett Kavanaugh's age and that's a long time on the on that court and it is just a against something which is apparently fueled in opposition to Kevin or or anybody else\nAnd in general I think we need to remember that it really doesn't matter if it's Brett Kavanaugh but it could have been anybody\nThat is true but don't you didn't beliefs are that given the fact that there is photographic evidence of it that were made against bird is going to sleep during the oral arguments she's nodding off and not being able to pay attention and the bad and and I think that\nThere should be some sort of criteria Janet in fairness to everybody and this for conservative and liberal judges that like going for there to be asking you maybe get the Seventy five or something cents a mandatory examination that would determine\nYour capability of remaining on the court\nI wouldn't be opposed to that notion although of course an examination\nOf would clearly lead to all kinds of controversy about who conducts the examination et cetera and so on I think the only way that you could probably in a practical sense ever address that Charlotte would probably be with the mandatory retirement age and that of course would involve a constitutional amendment\nOr but I I can easily see that the quite frankly there there comes a time when people probably should not continue in office you could probably make the same argument or Charlotte\nA for an elected members of uh the uh uh well the Congress even the White House perhaps that of course the the president's he already has a two term limit\nThere are currently no term limits on Congress'\nBut ah I could see if you were going to let's say limits a Supreme Court ah members and let's say the age of eighty will just picked at random or then um I can see that same thing being applied through a constitutional amendment\nFor members of Congress the Senate and the and the presidency\nOr you would run into of course a ton of the opposition and uh since we've always mended the constitution starting in the halls of Congress you don't have to you can go through an article five constitutional convention but use really would have to do that for members of Congress\nThere's no way in the world Congress would ever put an age limit on their activity Charlotte\nNow that said they would not have ever I Believe you also can occur as a state as you are that there are some people that are more mentally proficient at age eight bad than maybe somebody at Seventy\nOh there's no question about that on any any age limit is always arbitrary on the the top end or the the bottom into of human activity I mean there are people out there who are I'm sure quite physically and mentally and emotionally capable of driving a car at say age Thirteen whereas there are some people at age fifty\n... who aren't and never will be a really fit to to drive a vehicle I Would note in defense of ah of Justice Ginsburg ah

leave the court may be health issues maybe and I certainly hope this doesn't happen maybe she passes away she's eighty five\nBut for whatever reason another vacancy and there could be a potentially others but Ginsburg certainly just by the actuarial tables would be number one on the list if that happens what\nHappens to the next nominee I think it probably the or the woman who has been

gets die a horrible death a status because ... I think ... days\nAnd the top of the Democratic Democratic Party they do pay a record called Democrats out there are as radical as the rest of the leaders are but I just appreciate ... ... ... it's ... I can I say what about your heart's last week\nA pilot okay fine to we had to guess toast too that we use frequently hear dom Giordano of W. P. H. D. in Philadelphia and the ... in St Louis or\nIf there were black or a pilot's old about Kavanaugh ... or ... gas and any time that gas came on the wrist or remotely saying that the positive about Cabot law it's paper expressions was well hold on and then it well\nYou know the previous caller you had was really no I Believe both he didn't believe cabinet or you didn't cut him off\nYou let him speak or your guest last week or so biased against Kavanaugh it was disappointing because you're so fair and everything it was just a departure I've never been able to show before last week\nThis is my second part that's I'm not entirely boiled or here's the young man forgot I'm Seventy so anyway thank you figure out what you call it well\nI appreciate your thoughts as I say I think that we have had guest hosts who do an exemplary job but uh certainly we are interested in in your views and those of a ball others as well one eight six six five oh jumbo our number one eight six six five oh five or six\nTo six of course the the battle here is a for a court which would appear to lean\nFive for conservative that is to say we have had up till now of what are generally considered to be four\nLiberal justices and with almost without exception they they have been and they remain of course\nFor conservative justices including of course a chief justice John Roberts who has in fairness to Roberts been a fairly conservative and fairly reliably so the Obamacare a is a tax decision not withstanding\nI've heard some speculate that he might become to do at the Kennedy but I really doubt that Kennedy really had views that that frankly parallel parallel or straddled if you will uh most of the conservative liberal splits in the judicial world\nA But Kevin over certainly tilt it to five four more often than not conservative ... another justice and and the list that the President Trump has put together is pretty uniformly a solidly conservative that is to say or people who believe in in the the wording of the constitution not in an activist court\nA that would converted to a likely six to three which is to say even with a surprise or two that you would have an almost uniformly conservative court and perhaps for a considerably long period of time\nA these are our times that uh our our perilous indeed for uh for the left in that regard in that regard to the views of the Democratic party frankly a lot of of top Democrats are not nearly as radical as they are sounding\nA lot of them and looked at what happened to to some of the of the top Democrats are like in New York ah ah where\nA top Republican or Democratic House member was uh was expelled and a primary by an unknown and uh they they don't want that to happen to them and Dianne Feinstein of California wasn't even endorsed for reelection by our own party for Pete's sake\nOr so they're running scared of the left and the left maybe doing conservatives a great service yes they're saying outrageous things\nI think that every time they drag the candidates further to the left\nThere making those candidates less likely to win re election I think that there are a few things that will help Republicans more in this midterm election\nThan candidates for the Democrats who had been dragged so far to the left that the moderates all leaning their direction we'll see but that would be my take on on the subject is evident Frederick County Maryland and listening to W. F. M. D. nine thirty am Dave calls and good evening Dave\nGood evening areas even I'm fine thank you\nUh uh just a cold for a couple of things I was listening to a radio station in Baltimore and um they were talking about the Montgomery County\nWhat was going on with Kevin all and in Nineteen eighty two and that back then it was only a misdemeanor for what he would have done and there was only a year a\nStatutory limitation statutory limitation ... uh which I found was interesting as soon as I guess now currently though it's there's no limitations on it at all [noise]\nAh well the evidence that law was changed or after the fact and the there's one thing that they cannot be done in this country has passed what's known as an ex post facto law\nThough if you change the statute of limitations on a crime let's say you make that change in just to make up the number here you make that change in the year uh uh\nTwenty twelve okay and you're talking about an action that occurred let's say in the year uh Nineteen Ninety eight\nWell that that changing the law doesn't affect that crime or yes all crime subsequent to twenty twelve when that law was passed now suddenly have no statute of limitations but if you did a certain bad thing\nBefore twenty twelve it has no statute of limitations you cannot make a law that applies to things that happened before the law was passed so that statute of limitations for Brett Kavanaugh even assuming that he did what he's accused of doing a would would still not apply\nYeah and the other thing too that I don't know why a lot of people don't understand or surprised by this whole thing because then we see something like this happen in the United states wants before\nI well I mean there were certainly there were charges that were brought against Clarence Thomas before his Supreme Court confirmation that consisted from from one person of course\nNot not all of a variety of such people in and of course the the piling on goes back to the days of of Robert Bork infected as even become a verb now up or a nominee to be quote board unquote\nBut the other thing is the is the guy that cold about the drinking and assuming that he lied because he said he didn't have a blackout\nAnd that's the one thing that I'm not here of people would spell known as one this is the greatest a public service announcement for kids don't drink because this is what can happen if you do and the other thing is you know alcohol affects so many people\nDifferently everybody's got different tolerances every it has different affects it you know\nSo the fact that he says he didn't have a blackout and he didn't has nothing to do with the fact that you know here's a here's a big help your kid and she can't remember anything but she's a a small tiny Fifteen year old girl so\nYou know I'm sure that she doesn't really remember a lotta stuff clearly and he may not have ... you know if he drank too much which\nIs anything at age Seventeen because he's not old enough but you know it the way his buddy process as alcohol may be different from anybody else\nSo everybody process was alcohol differently body size and other factors enter into that\nAnd and again there may be all kinds of quote unquote reasons why she doesn't recall but the point of it is\nThose do not apply in a story like this about a a public policy decision or she needs to be credible in order for the rest of us to listen to what she has to say regarding a public policy decision\nRight at at work but that's what I'm saying is that I'm a I'm Sorry I'm object now but\nI Would I Do understand I Do understand what you're saying but the important thing for me to to note is the fact that uh again\nRegardless of what happened in that room the fact remains that we are being asked to listen to this person not just as a victim but as somebody who shouldn't affect a public policy decision and I haven't heard sufficient corroboration on that issue will be back with

fact and then she walks it back but I think this is what the president was getting at you know so many things have changed in the entire thing\nYou could look at the claims and depending on what is set to the FBI and these interviews you could be looking at perjury\nFor Dr Ford and I think this is what her attorneys\nAre worried about I think it's why they were so anxious over the weekend remember they said over the weekend we've contacted the FBI trying to set up the interview and as a Sunday they were saying you know no interview yet they haven't talked to her\nWell why would you want to do it so soon after testimony because you want to keep her on track you don't want to change your story now the FBI is not going to do anything against her and I don't know that there would be
