relationships\nTurning other agents and certainly in his back outside is real\nMuch around the world you know now that are let's get down to the particular story or that it is involved here because it is in that story that we can start looking for any parallels with the with real life\nIn this particular story we do not have a Russian President named Vladimir ... and we have a Russian President named uh maxi ...\nThat's right yes how similar is the to boot and\nSaw all the exactly I mean I don't like to use people who are lives real names in my dogs but the uh the character when I started researching and trying to build a a Russian President\n... researching a lot of it and then you just can't make that stuff out so I thought why not just\nGo straight with him and and change the name so you know everything pretty much everything you read about him even his background is in the book is just\nA stray from ... his life\nWith with one or a major exception and that is that a a\nPresident to grouping of Russia discovers that he has inoperable brain cancer and um it's a run to the beginning so I don't think I'm giving away anything and will not certainly give away the ending but but suffice it to say he's going to die and and and knows it right\nYeah I mean he's he's attempting treatment and that is kind of the the the crux of the book that that\nWhat happens when a a dictator who really has to stay in power I mean dictators who Lewis tower or become a week definitely don't do well and uh you know even in ... in in true real life\nYou know became has become obsessed with the fall of the dictators during the ... the Arab Spring and and as sits and watches the death of Gadhafi a on a video loop a you know it could occupied at the hands of his own people so he's incessant with maintaining power\nUh athletes should be frankly it's completely rational and when he gets brain cancer I mean this is sort of a thought experiment what happens when somebody that powerful who was desperate to cling to power finds out they're going to become a week I mean how far would they go to hold onto that power\nSo a person with a finger on the nuclear button decides that he has nothing to lose well that's a scary little scenario\nWhere it is and that's why it's nice to have you know democracies around the world that you know people in power changes hands and peaceful ways there are people that can step in you know I mean if uh\nYou know Donald Trump or apt to step down he doesn't have to worry about Mike Pence putting a bullet in his head or throwing them in prison for the rest of his life so it's a it's a it's a better system than the the Russians have developed\nThis to say the least one eight six six five oh jumbos we're number one eight six six Bible

folks which is to say the least scary a great read do we have a call for our guests to Kyle bills from a duck who calls in from Wilmington, Delaware this evening and the good evening dog welcome\nTo you as always for me and my comment as to why on\nTwo ... two quick questions Mr males or do you yourself have respect about fair share their background and number two are you familiar with ... research is within ... with a non ... short of a famed and very controversial American defector an early nineties ... soon and I'll listen listen\nTo her before you go further with or just dropping that then that name out there a sense that nobody else that I Know of is ever heard the name dog could you give us a little hand is who that is\nYeah and it's why the legion was the most controversial defied driver of the Cold War era\nHe was the ... you know the editor of them stay current charges ...\nWho a stay at that um he predicted in at a book or in Ninety or not you eighties published by a dog needed companies aren't on nor the existence and new allies fraud that Latinos and pet a story or were of a fictitious a game show or the KGB to buy time for Russia to rebuild\nAnd if you really read read that book alliance rolled it's out of print but it could be gotten off of Amazon dot com or whatever the bookstore a site is ... of a\nA Portland, Oregon oh I'm In that book and I have several hobbies are my library okay he predicts that pretty serious habit since since since the fall of the Soviet you accurately I Want to know Mr Mao says I don't regard\nYeah let's we'll we'll certainly ask him of that are having been in a in Moscow at the very time that the glass nose to strike it was kicking in\nI can assure you that was a that was no joke or the Russians were a moving forward very cautiously very carefully with the notion of opening up their society and of course as carefully as the Gorbachev or tried to do it the whole thing felt like a house of cards I\nRemember eating in one of the the first\nPrivately owned restaurants in Moscow at that time this was mayor Nineteen eighty eight we were there for the regular Gorbachev summit in in Moscow\nUh so uh that was certainly a it was a shall we say a questionable time for them and they weren't exactly sure how to approach it but I'll I'll be for that to our guests so let's start with a A N e familiar and he has with that individual labs ... and then we'll ask about the your your own background\nI have a I have not read his book started a definitely sounds interesting um I think it's kind of a theme though is is that Americans I think well mistake we made historically is that\nWe don't realize how hard democracy is a you know we've always been do we've been doing this for hundreds of years and yeah I mean that to some extent it tends to be hard for us to but\nThe difference between democracy and chaos is not much um it's sort of a belief in the system that everybody holds an infant if you don't have that the Russians didn't have that many of the middle eastern countries don't have that\nIt can just slipped into a real mess and um I think that's probably what he was predicting that that the Russians had no history of this kind of thing and uh probably would have no capacity to to handle it [noise]\nNow it's your background is rather interesting that he brought that up as I understand it it's it's not your background but your father's background that had such an influence\nRight yeah they and so my father was an FBI agent for twenty five years and he was the director of our poll and the legal asked shady United Kingdom so I grew up surrounded by you know FBI CIA and my six five special operators\nAnd ... you know they it was very much that influenced me to get into the thriller\nGame and not you know when I first wanted decided I Want to write a book\nI I thought about all kinds of different genres that I liked in and in many ways I I'd grown up on thrillers but I also knew all these people so I thought it was before the Internet um\nJob by research would be really easy I had all these characters in my head and the stories that I had heard and everything and if I ever needed to reach out to somebody or for research uh it would be really easy ... at the end of end of the end of the phone so that's a made it a lot easier for me\nWhen he's six six five oh jumbo

its population certainly went away to a huge chunks that lost all of the various stands out in the uh\nThe far east or ... or ... which is still where Russian space flights a lift off from but it's a separate sovereign country it was back then and all of those of course a a\nUkraine the Bella roofs\nAnd of course all of a satellite countries of er of Eastern Europe all stripped away and do what you do have a deed is a vast expanse of territory is our guest Kyle meals notes but economically as he said Russia economically is a is about the size of Texas in in that regard [noise] uh and uh\nIt it it has pretensions\nOf the old days the good old days of the evil empire and it also has all those nukes that that sort of changes everything does the guy on all those nukes\nIt really does I mean you combine those with their conventional capability and the fact that they've said historically that they don't they don't seem to access sort of the same way we do is this kind of\nYou know a thing you have that would never use you know they see them more as a part of their conventional capability so the idea that they could roll into say the Baltics very very quickly um with with\nTheir ... their conventional army and then set up nukes and basically say this is our territory now things are very real threat the question is you know what is it in their best interest to do so at this point no but\nI was by books poses if ... or or in my case the character Maxine trip and really had nothing to lose and was looking less to gain something for Russia or to hold onto without power I mean that would be a smart place for him\nAnd uh which is worth pursuing by the way of course we've already seen what the the Russians that will do around\nOne former Soviet Republic it was a part of the Soviet Union although\nAs part of the the fiction of uh of independence or following World War two uh back when the Soviet Union had a a seat in the U.N General assembly so to Ukraine and Bella Ruth even though they were it would be like if if the United states\nLike California and Texas had been given votes in the United Nations General assembly will of course those are all independent nations now except of course in a big chunk of Ukraine has been taken back\nBy the Russians you grade of course is not a member of NATO now the Baltic states which were also a part of the union of Soviet socialist republics as stony Latvia Lithuania small states along the Baltic\nThey are members of NATO and of course the big question that many of asked is of course NATO's is based on um the article five minutes charter an attack on one is an attack on all\nAnd there is a growing view that\nAt least elements of NATO wouldn't be prepared to actually live up to that literally figuratively or maybe they they they might give lip service to the notion that if in fact the Russians grabbed one of these old Soviet states back\nThere was a question of how much some members of NATO would be prepared to actually uphold the NATO charter how do you feel about that\nI Hope that's true yeah certainly the United states benefited after nine eleven when a NATO king to back us a\n... this is kind of an interesting situation and and I don't agree with the position that we've taken off on that so we being NATO\nThey we've been historically very afraid of provoking Russia um and Russia seems to have no similar\nProblem with provoking us that they they have learned that you can push really far and not get any pushback poodle always push until someone pushes back I mean why wouldn't he so\nThis idea that we're going to provoke them into what I I I mean to me we should have\nA very heavy military presence in the Baltics but we never really wanted to do that because of work and he would consider it a provocation\nWell I mean not to be overly flipping about it but I say bring it on I mean he or a country where the economy the size of Italy wants to go up against the combined forces of NATO\nAnd the only way he can be successful as the way he was successful in Ukraine role in with a lot of propaganda send a bunch of military guys in there with no insignia and pretended sort of an internal uprising\nWell that'd be pretty hard if we had you know tens of thousands of men and you know across the Baltics with a lot of heavy metal over there\nAnd what's he gonna do I mean\n... attack I mean is he is and get over what you know attack us with hackers is already doing that it can't hurt us economically because he doesn't really have much of an economy so I think if he wants to play our enemy\nI think we need to fight back I mean obviously we wanted to be peaceful with Russians but it's it's frankly impossible and I have their goal is to make us an enemy and to defeat us\nYeah and and and again the weaker you are with someone like that or the more likely there is war I mean that will Chamberlain going back\nIn eighty years to be the Munich conferences which they had to over\nOf Czechoslovakia to to Hitler and uh and Chamberlain goes back to Britain waving that that's still a piece of paper you know peace in our time hardly it guaranteed that Hitler would then make another step forward in the heat really didn't think that the the west would do anything well over Poland they finally did a and again\nIf you appease people like that you will always get conflict in it it seems I suppose counter intuitive but the only way to ah\nMinimize the risk of conflict is to be actively prepared for your your thoughts\nRight you know I mean it is absolutely critical to put it in that he looks strong I mean that's how you maintain a dictatorship and control of Russia that people want the strong dictator it's why\nTakes likes to take pictures of himself shirtless on a horse or you know catching him probably large fish so this is the the Russian they're right and this is what he projects and every time he slaps the United states\nYou know seen gains face we don't really reactor we react to some sort of economic sanctions which we should do but it's not really um\n... you know it doesn't play that well to the ... the Russian people he looks like he's winning and that once again they have power to a face down in the United states but if you made it created a penalty if you said you know you know you look around at our\nIn our investigator in our uh elections or we know U.S House and they did this guy with a nerve agent\nUm so we're rolling twenty thousand guys into\nThe Baltics well now he looks weak he has to react to that and you have stability to react to that so I I mean you've created a penalty for him\nBut uh if we just keep letting him push at us um I just I think it's a really bad strategy I don't know why he's ever going to stop for to come back

bit of a nine to five or I work and start in the morning and uh what I'm outlining I I Do pretty elaborate outlines of my book so and I'm outlining I found a over Twenty one year career that that's really hard I mean that's just pure kind of creative taught and\nI work until the ideas run out\nThat sometimes if it's a great day that's eight hours and sometimes it's a half hour and I just can't come up with anything\nThe ... the go ahead go ahead\nI was gonna say once that's done and I'm writing the book then I set up a very elaborate schedule is typically a chapter a day because you're like you're right that you know you can knock out a four hundred and fifty page\nBook you know with a bunch a note does in coffee you know the weekend before it's too much to be done before that\nYes it does just ... ever talk back to you on the word processor and say a ... a kind of I Would never say that or I Would never do that\nAll the time I mean it's such a problem when you're an outline or like I Am you create this elaborate outline and then the characters don't do what you want them to 'em and you know this is a\nThis is kind of an amazing character have certainly been compared to the ones that I wrote when I wrote under my own brand I typically without the character that would\nGo one book or maybe a few bucks but that's about it\nAnd this one I mean we've we've followed Mitch from when he was in college too now when he's kind of a finger he's about forty four\nAnd he's such a rich character it has such a long history he feels so real to me and a lot of times I'll walk out and think oh I Can't I Can't believe Mitch did that and that would have to go back and change my whole the rest of my whole outline\nYou or you have any ... any of his uh his work appearing on the big screen or the small screen I'm not aware of of any as we appeared yeah\nMhm [noise] yeah the last year the sort of his origin story a book called American Assassin a okay in a movie movie the same

can you give us a preview of what a is coming after red war\nYeah this one I kind of wanted to go back to a really classic Vince plan a structure that red war is probably as grand\nYou know a political thriller as as you're going to write about uh the character Mitch so uh what kind of wanted to go back to basics and this one is much more about uh Islamic\nTerrorist threat and kind of brings in the drug cartels and the Mexican smuggling I'm into a book that you know is very much about Mitch and Mitch is solutions to problems as opposed to a\nYou know the grander scale where you have naval battles and you know Russians at all that stuff so it's been kind of ... what I thought what I tell people is this is basically a book about mid trapped kicking butt yeah\nOr if he had case I mean it's obviously very confident that what he does but I mean would would you want him to be your brother in law\nUh maybe not maybe maybe not a great brother in law or or boyfriend um the thing that's great about this character and the thing that I think events did so well or\nIs he changes that you know it's a very it's a progression of very realistic progression for when he was in college a little bit of a head case in college and then not so much and then his his wife and unborn child were murdered came one bit nuts again and now he's\nA little bit calmer face so it's it's\nIt's really a a character that that fans and I have gotten to know and to feel very real reacts to situations in a very real way so um you know he's not too bad now but you wouldn't have wanted to meet him

saying he died of an apparent chokehold during an altercation during a roundtable event in Arizona President Trump was asked how his administration will address the situation\nThey've been a great

take punitive measures against Saudi Arabia\nOn that menu is everything from arms sales to sanctions to financial a cut off in terms of uh international banking or as a starter\nThe left is very good at slogans right so hope and change right Obama had hope and change how can you argue with hope and change you have the it's much more complex to explain our position wait a second\nOr you always for change and I'll ask my students or you know where you're happy when you're younger and your parents are decided they were moving and they didn't ask you how about that change or how about a change you know the take away your car not every change is good but hope and change sounds fantastic\nSo those on our side or off and on the defensive even though as I said they're explaining the obvious the most recent case being parents with children trying to get asylum and you know why mentioning because it's happening now but I'll get that in a minute\nSeeking asylum and President Trump and Republicans accused of ripping children of course there's the help of the media ripping children from their mother's arms and putting these children in cages never mind that this was started under the bonus ration\nPresident Trump and Republicans are on the defensive never mind that if the parents of these children this is crucial but Yardley ever heard of the parents of these children didn't come to the border and the first place there would be no wish you know one force them to come here\nThey made a voluntary choice\nAnd we have a right to our sovereignty and to protect our borders and to decide who is welcome to enter just like we do with our homes this is so obvious it's incredible that we have to explain our position but again\nThere's a simple right how can you you know you're ripping away from their parents how could you do that and we're on the other side having to explain things like what is it coming here legally means why that's not acceptable\nWhat the left and the Democrats and the media likely do not believe in having us you know our sovereignty but rather they believe in open borders\nBut they don't like to admit that because they know they would lose the argument\nWhich is why they would rather talk about tearing children out of their mother's arms is really bad they get to this set the debate and the terms of the debate when the media's on their side because no one's questioning them with comments like I'm throwing out there and that you would\nNever mind that when anyone does something illegal and they're hauled off to jail their children do not go with them to jail boys that a big one\nThat's a huge one you'll never see it\nWhen you know in the in the last time this happened and it's going to happen again with these Honduras or Honduras refugees coming you know seeking asylum that's going to happen very shortly whenever they get here\nYou get to stay with your kid who hid you can use the same phrase oh she was found guilty of robbery first degree robbery and but our child was ripped out of her arm you never hear the media say that but that's what happens in effect\nThere also Vince\nSo to speak torn away from them why isn't it said and I was just indicated the latest reincarnation of this conflict is is a news hundreds of Hondurans are heading for the U.S border in a mass migration to seek asylum\nSo again President Trump and the Republicans will be on the defensive just because they want to defend our borders and the media will again show crime children and distraught mothers you know it's going to happen\nBut no one is forcing them to come here and we have a right to decide who gets to enter our house and under what circumstances\nAmong other things we have a right this is pretty obvious to it seems to me to protect the American people from harm weather from terrorism or disease we don't know the terrorists aren't coming through our open border or disease or we checking for diseases like we used to\nOr ... well you can't if they come here and Russian or even for that matter this was important people don't talk about this\nTo make sure that people who come here share our values\nAnd just about every country does this including our neighbor immediately to the south Mexico good try the same thing down there\nSome of us think this is also obvious but there have been huge forces arrayed against this common sense\nThe Democrats won more votes they will tell you that they they know illegal immigrants vote for them in huge numbers and the country club Republicans for lack of better name they want cheap labor so you have or newspapers like the wall Street Journal I I stopped subscribing to it when they would have their editorials and it would talk about immigration in the title\nAnd then I mean they say illegal immigration the title and some are in the middle they would just sit switched immigration oh immigration has been a great for America over the years how could you you were in Iowa list right how could you oppose this this is insane\nBut they would switch on us even though they pretend to talk about illegal immigration in the title\nOf course the Republicans are also the stupid party that's my party than like knowledge that so you have people like George W. Bush and Karl Rove saying things like boy we can get this vote George W. Bush got up to forty percent of Hispanic vote in Texas wonderful\nI'm not a math major but that seems like a formula for defeat\n... Lawson politics by the way politics in particular a loss of sixty percent of forty percent is huge and that is based on an optimistic assumption most illegal immigrants come here for jobs but they also take advantage of government hand that says we know that the rest of us are paying for\nAnd by the way the Republican Party can never out do the Democrats in offering benefits\nI uh I think I use this phrase years ago when I ever voters given a choice between Democrats and Democrats meaning larger Democrats they choose the original ones they need us to who these people don't vote for it's not that hard to figure out\nAnd if left unchecked the Republicans will never win a national election again\nSo even on a purely selfish base it is clear that we need to control the border not to mention fairness what do you say to the people around the world who have been waiting many years I've heard of people waiting a decade to get here but it has to undergo long waits an incessant paperwork to even have a hope of getting here\nSo they have to follow the rules but those who dashed across the border do not\nWhich is why a border wall makes sense among other tools not the only thing but it's one of the tools so one color of this week and if you didn't hear it suggests that border walls don't work in the long run\nAnd I said but even if that were true I bet they work in the short run while we try to clean this mess up and have an orderly procedure coming to our country\nIt's to me it's the same ridiculous logic that the defenders of illegals murdering innocent America's like Americans like Kate Steinle use\nAnd I you know I pointed Geraldo Rivera because I watch them do a time and time again saying oh illegals commit crimes percentage wise in lower numbers the Native Americans as if\nThat matters who cares even if that's true if an American is killed or harmed by illegal immigrants that person would not have been hurt if that illegal had been denied entry no matter what the percentage isn't that obvious and that wall by the way in Israel preventing Hamas for murdering Israel's Israelis is working on the front room\nA lot of these arguments is baffling to me unless you realize they have no real argument unless you change the words the terms\nI more to say but I Know we have to go to the break surely let me give you the numbers and I'll go on a little bit more eight six six Ninety red eye and that's the same as eight six six nine o seven three three three nine\nSo example how can you ever justify sanctuary cities were criminal illegals or given safe harbor if you come up with phony arguments like illegals will not you've heard that they won't cooperate with the authorities if they know they can be apprehended were sent home so that's why it's important that you know we have sanctuary for them\nBut how about they not be allowed to cover in the first place and we wouldn't need to cooperate with authorities isn't that obvious how can you ever justify harboring criminals who commit crimes that native born Americans have no asylum from\nYou change the debate watch this to the evil police officers at ice who have the audacity to arrest people commit crimes that said these guys are really clever on the left\nSo the rest of us live with long lines at hospitals you're eating schools and intolerable traffic while the elites often live behind walls and their gated communities so what's my solution\nYou take away the benefits like free healthcare and free schools you enforce strict penalties against businesses that hire illegals even sending some CEO to jail you say in the first CEO to jail for hiring and illegal immigrant and they'll never happen again\nAnd you'd be amazed at how many illegal immigrants would return home\nRun the actually had a right to use the wrong language self deport there we go again with language right we're not good at that self deport we keep losing the language war to the left\nBut I Would say that those who remain right everybody would leave it there were no better I take it back not everybody a lot would leave and that's what's happened during the recession a lot we leave there are no benefits no government handouts and they couldn't get jobs legally\nWe but I Would say that those who remain that's the point I Want to make I'd be willing to have a conversation about with them because they be saying for the right reasons\nAnd for heaven's sake enough of the government sending out the wrong message message with actions like ball legal education classes I'm a teacher I Know or bilingual government documents\nA country is United by language and it's shared values English is our language and immigrants need to learn the language our history and our shared values our ancestors kiss the ground when they landed here at Ellis Island they were so happy to have landed", "show_name": "The Jim Bohannon Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Johnson City", "day": "20"}
