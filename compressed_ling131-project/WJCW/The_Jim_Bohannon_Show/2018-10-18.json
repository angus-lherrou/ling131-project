Saudi Arabia over the disappearance of a Washington Post journalist and he asked for audio recordings Turkish sources say indicated he was killed by Saudi agents in Istanbul correspondent are with Damon says the U.S is awaiting investigators reports\nIt's going to be quite interesting to see exactly what sort of differences are similarities there and that being between the report that turkey comes up with and the one that Saudi Arabia decides that you are really specially given the various different ... eating interests and of course various different nations economic ties to the came to\nThe final Washington Post column written before journalist ... she disappeared in the sunny consulate in Istanbul\nA like a allowing women to to drive cars and other things that seem more from the nineteenth century the twenty first century uh but uh again I I Would really notice that there are no Thomas Jefferson's than there are no John Adams is walking around the Saudi peninsula\nThe choices in that country pretty much seemed to be this regime\nOr al ... or ISIS and a as a result of it as as many cases that we see in this world today\nAre your choices are not between good and bad there between bad and worse that when I was thinking a rational person that will always choose bad just to avoid worse\nI recognize that they had been helpful in a number of ways in terms of ah combating the extremism of a of the Iranians and tried to stabilize the region even as I also recognize that they fund well hobby mosques in this country\nOr where you can find so anti Semitic literature\nThey would make a klansmen blush so again making no apologies for this regime but it's there and it it may well be the best thing we've got so with them as a prologue your take\nWell it's actually exactly the same as yours frankly you know I thought as soon as I heard that Fifteen men had gone in the embassy before him with cases and he\nNever came out and they came out of an hour or so later and I saw a video of a guy going in with two huge buckets full of rags on a mop it wasn't hard to put\nThe pieces together for what probably happen to this very vocal dissident of the Saudi regime who had put himself in self exile for\nObvious reasons [noise]\nYou know the one thing that occurs to me here and it goes beyond the morality whatsoever it just gets down to what I have been calling the gang the good and kills straight OK you are brutal your fascist Dick and you're not an all above murdering a critic\n[laughter] have have you know brains I mean this guy you find a way for a couple of days okay he's got a pattern alright every afternoon at three thirty this stop life a motorcyclist drives up beside him double tap same with a pistol and zooms off into the distance complete\nPlausible deniability and I'm not again condoning anything here I just I Am appalled at the other arrogance and stupidity of inviting him into a government facility and then apparently this member and yet I just I'm Amazed anybody could be that stupid\n[noise] well I think that it was very clear message and deliberate message of the Saudis to any of their dissidents abroad\nOr they simply don't tolerate any sort of division or expression and freedom of speech and criticism of the government whether it's in the country or outside of it\nAnd I've picked up a couple of stories today that indicate to other people might have disappeared recently from other countries that are Saudis\nI don't know whether um I don't have the names of those or anything to give you right now but it it just kinda\nIt sounds like it might be part of a pattern that they're cleaning up internationally at this point it's horrifying it's absolutely horrible but you outlined all the competing considerations that the president Jared Kushner have and how complicated very complicated the situation is [noise]\nAnd something else that I Would also take note of and that is this atrocities happened on this planet all the time I had this been an American reporter and by that I mean a citizen of the United states\nAh that would be one thing but he is not or was not as I guess probably seems to be the case past tense and as such a again\nI I'm I'm Glad to see that we we stand for certain things but I'm just not sure exactly how our deepest\nStrategic interests are at stake here and I again I I Know it sounds as though I'm a I'm a\nA centrally are adopting a very a Mackey of LA and are almost to the point of of a a moral point of view here uh but as I say I have no illusions about the reality of this world and I'm Wondering your thoughts on why am I not uh being outraged enough\nWell I think everybody is outraged by what happened but what it boils down to is what businesses it of ours is you know it wasn't on our property is not an American citizen it's doesn't have anything to do with us other than it's an international outrage\nAnd everybody should be outraged about it but what if anything we can do in response to it I I'm not or whether we should\nI I'm not sure I certainly don't think we should cancel the a huge contract that any number of American companies have to provide equipment to them because they just go buy some place else\nAnd those contracts provide jobs for thousands of Americans\nAnd of and furthermore I Would would do that as I say they they can be useful at times and to give them the alternatives that exist on that wretched peninsula ah they this is the Saudi royal family as tragic as it is probably represents the the uh the best\nAvailable governance\nFor that area I mean the only way you would ever fix Saudi Arabia quite frankly is an international occupation lasting maybe half a century and costing trillions of dollars in which people simply had a very barbaric culture just erased\nAnd nobody is prepared to spend that much time money and blood to do that I mean ... you know some things are just beyond fixing\nOne of the things that the Bush center has done in the last um well since the ... since President Bush forty three left office and built the Bush library as they've started a program for women internationally\nAnd they bring women from Saudi Arabia and other countries like that over to the United states and take 'em to different places so they can see\nHow democracy works or not you know that their their view is that we you know we can make the world more democratic one woman at the time and that women are the key to the future for any democracy and I think those are very good points and they're doing very good work with that\nYeah and there's only so much we can do as a country the Sufi another country and its sovereignty\nYeah uh and uh again it it it is very disheartening it is very unfortunate although I Am amazed at your your analysis may be quite accurate here that this was\nDone in such an arrogant way as a deliberate message but I must say that or\nAre they so devoid of reality that they could not foresee this international reaction there may well be far stronger reactions than you and I are offering there could be all kinds of\nOf cuts in aid and the like and for a country that was presumably moving in the direction of civilization as I say letting women drive cars or is it pretty uh pretty temperate step but it but it is a step\nA for a country that it was supposedly moving in in a a civilized direction it it is remarkable that they would at the same time countenance something that is a step back into the darkest times in human history\nAnd you're right about that too it's just hard to imagine given how outrageous it is that it wasn't deliberate\nIt it is that we would certainly encourage the thoughts of all of you out there in the audience tonight how you feel about this entire

simply Powell attorney is our guest for looking at the apparent\nBrutal murder of a Saudi destroyed a journalist in a conflict of the Saudi Arabian government in Turkey we we have heard many references to it as the consulate a a\nA nation's tend to have more than one consulate this was one particular one just for the record and do we were about to get a conversation from Chris in east Texas with the break intervened who wanted us to ah\nAh I guess a apply logic rational thought so Chris please go ahead\nExactly thanks jumbo so let's just go a little Sherlock Holmes here and just apply some uh some logic here so number one that your former caller Luke was rightfully outraged but never stops to think about ah maybe that was the point is anybody really stupid enough to do this this publicly\nAnd you lead look at all the events that lead up to this so Jared Kushner goes over and quote unquote negotiate a deal of the century to completely isolate the Iranians we all know that the Iranians and and the Turks right now and of course this happens in Turkey of all places that the Turks are are very tight against the Kurds\nNobody stops to say wait a minute is that just coincidental\nOr or is is maybe there's something else here a couple of other things is that\nThe journalist himself is a known as a Muslim Brotherhood a supporter and if you look behind the scenes of everything that's happening here or something just doesn't smell right because I Know that that the the Saudi crown prince is bold he's young he's thirty three years old a but\nWill loose cannon some would say yeah somewhat safe but it is a really stupid\nBecause there's no way that he wins out of this deal to put President Trump in this situation\nUh and it seems purposeful that you go and create outrage to create chaos and when you look at all the other things and just get introduced one more factor that I'd like to hear Mississippi's a interpretation of this\nUm who is the gentleman that is the former now under investigation CIA director and at what point during the nine eleven attacks who was in charge in the CIA office desk in Saudi Arabia at that Saudi Arabian desk\nWell by who is a ... a pardon\nJohn Brennan John ...\nAre you what are you I'm not sure exactly what you're suggesting are you suggesting John I Will just a just a pose the question are you suggesting that John Brennan was was somehow involved in this\nI'm suggesting that there's a lot of stuff that doesn't smell right when the heat gets turned up on the quote unquote deep state\nAnd all of a sudden this just happens to be after Jared Kushner very quietly goes over there and isolates the Iranians now here's another thing that's happened in the last ten days Mm what pressure was applied to the church to release our dear pasture that just came home to great fanfare\nAt all of a sudden now this happens in Turkey so ask yourself the question we already know and and I think Rush Limbaugh pointed this out that it is impossible for an apple I watched technologically unless it is connected to a ... network to record this\nAnd so so where is this coming from well Ayers the recording oh we've heard that a a quote unquote source an unnamed source in the press in Turkey has heard all of these recordings this this just it doesn't pass the smell test\nWell All right let's let's examine just exactly what all is is going on here as regards to the notion of the crown prince with Saudi Arabia and chaos\nChaos is exactly the last thing that the Saudi regime needs stability is what they need desperately their clinging to survival and uh I seriously doubt that they will survive the next twenty five years they are such a throwback to the dark ages\nUh I'm not sure quite how the Kurds fitted to do all of this but I don't think the Saudis care one way or the other about a quote the Kurds that's where the connection between this and the release of that to that pastor a again a\nThis this involves a Mackey valley a tie ins that the that frankly allude me Sidney Powell it sounds to me like an arrogant regime that uh apparently thought they could get away with a lot more than they could have uh your take on on how how deep this goes to do all the connections that were just put forward\nI think we do have to consider the possibility at least and less evidence proves otherwise that there are forces that work in the background particularly with earth through the Iranians\nTo make it up to drive a wedge between the United states and the Saudis and other Middle East interests because we have been effective in causing them a lot of problems with sanctions and and\nCarrots work to isolate them\nAnd are you talking about about about sanctions against the Iranians are against the Iranians Iranians\nAll right again or if we are to assume that this took place on Saudi property that is to say a Saudi consulate in Turkey\nAh it's hard to imagine how the Iranians could have been involved in activities on on that property I mean the last person who could get into a Saudi consulate undetected would be an Iranian\nI mean I'm I'm not suggesting that Iranian people went in I think they've identified the the people who went in yeah just a large extent I'm suggesting that the Iranians may have had some sort of hand and facilitating that being done encouraging to be done\nPaying for it to be done I I don't know I just know that they re Iran does benefit apparently from selling discord and likes to\nWell yes they would benefit from sowing discord but I mean it is bad enough to do things with such an action could take place inside a Saudi consulate\nThere suggested it could be done a ... by a sworn enemy of the Saudi regime the Iranians would go far beyond any level of incompetence imaginable I mean [laughter] yeah\nWell it may be right\nOr the again the Saudis and the Iranians detest each other and and how you would a range as as the as Iran for such an action to take place in side a Saudi consulate uh I mean if they could pull that off\nA that would be ah the ah the double cross of the century will come back with more and they just just a moment\nIf

society then people will have differences of opinion and they will express them and like minded people will get together and organize in order to pursue those goals in fact\nThe presence of differences of opinion and factions supporting them is almost a litmus test of proof that there is a free society a city what we have here is some\nKind of a malignant outgrowth of that\nWell yes and again and I think that's why I chose to frame this in terms of apocalyptic religious conflict\nThis is not a question of a society that's trying to deal with the differences come up with ... constructive solutions as a society where one wasn't part of the society looks at the other\nSays this is the point is essentially the body evil and really needs to be stamped out and uh when you have that type of mentality late uh there's really no room for compromise\nBut when you have a boy that that that that some or another group to be stamped out the new seeds to be a part of the discussion that takes place in a free society you were talking about dismantling the very foundations of a free society\nAnd and those who propose that if in fact they're openly proposing bat a live\nIn a free society you don't you don't know about the other side you try to persuade the public to your point of view and if you believe stamping out is an option\nA than a free society has got to deal with you a by eliminating your influence until such time as you are willing to conform to the rules with society you make your case and you win or lose\nWell I I understand that and I think most liberal minded individuals uh would ascribe to that but if you look at the politics of America\nAt this point in time into those Eighteen I'm not sure that the longer the case you have one one party or the two party system whose entire motivation is just to obstruct resist a that's not a system that's workable\nI agree absolutely and so uh uh will will a pause for a while but then to absorb what we picked up this

what eight six six five oh jumbo one eight six six five oh five or six to six as we were speaking tonight with Dr Richard ... he is a physician psycho\nAnalyst the author of out of control apocalyptic psychology in the age of Trump and we're looking at a what causes I guess this type of behavior it would seem to me that in the\nThe case of many young people and it does seem that some of these problems are concentrated in young people\nOf that uh this is my view only use comedy either way but uh it seems to me that for a couple of generations now we've had a lot of people in their formative years who have been the essentially instructed in such directions by a idiot logical a\nSecondary but especially college instructors\nWho have essentially been teaching things that are I think contribute to the breaking down of our society or the I think that the this was happening because we've had people systematically taught this and they've created a a a generation if you will of disruption now that's just my view what's yours\n[noise] uh once again I think we're in complete agreement um I I think the greatest problem that the United states faces maybe the entire world at this point is what's going on at the center of higher education uh\nThere's always been a kind of liberal bench or the two most to universities are in the country so that's not unusual a but it's no longer than ... liberalism as as we do it's a fifty years ago uh this is now a radical leftist the gender\nAh which is which fails really to educate so the the curriculum and many of these institutions no longer includes the the bases basic western Canada that's critical of the maintenance of a a democratic uh society\nAnd instead it's been replaced by ... a racial and feminist studies\nAre all these things which again a indoctrinate or the young people into a mindset and they really\nNo no no better they knew very little about the history of this country\nAre and what they do know is largely inaccurate distorted\nAnd propaganda rather than factual so what what people are learning in in the schools now are not really the types of facts that one needs to learn in order to again maintain a democratic society they're learning propaganda and unless we somehow preach what's going on in these schools\nAre using some of our best schools unless we do something about it I I think we're we're going to be facing a generation coming up that's going to be truly problematic\nNow than in that regard at private institutions it is difficult to have a lot of influence although I Would suggest\nThat a federal aid and in many cases are many many such institutions receive a lot of federal even Harvard which is in doubt like a a a moon Gulf Oil shake dumb even Harvard gets lots of federal aid that that aid could be withheld\nBut a lot of this was happening at state institutions were talking about the faculty the job paid for by state tax dollars and for the life of me I Do not see why\nThese universally deans ... presidents are not call before the state assembly education committees and read the riot act that they want one penny but their institution\nThen there will be the following changes including personnel changes and in fact if necessary at take ten year at and toss it in the trash can or the the idea that this happens it's bad enough but Dr grade but that it happens on the tax payers die but is beyond intolerable its its tragically comical\nYou well I think all your points are well taken is certainly at the state schools\nAre there should be ... I have to stay and I think the curriculum and the people teaching at the schools need to be closely examined\nUh but the same is true for the private schools as you mentioned I I I've been offered a but the schools are not really private in the true sense that have tremendous amounts of federal dollars pouring into them and I think they really need to be redefined and certainly that needs to be more ...\nA lot of states are as to what's being taught and who is teaching in the schools because really they just are ruining society\nWhite six six five oh jumbo one eight six six five oh five or six to six our number\nA in regard to the the whole notion of a of I'm virtuous therefore I should get a pass on the the rules of society or there was a portion of your book out of control here on page one hundred fifty for a title hypocrisy\nYou ride it is easy to maintain once opinion of oneself as a quote good unquote person if one's own flaws are kept at a distance could you amplify on that thought just a bit\n[noise] Oh yes uh I I think that's one of the greatest ... that were encountering now that you actually on the left or most of us like to be thought of as as nice people we'd like to be liked by a fellow man\nOr however you know there is a certain degree of honesty and introspection that's required or if one completely aggregates any possibility of being less than a morally virtuous individual\nThan what one sees psychologically is again this phenomena projection\nA so that one's deny it or maybe less than perfect traits\nGet projected onto everybody else in order to protect oneself image and so I think this is what we're seeing in large measure in some aspects of the left you know they see themselves as or at least superior early\nA virtuous individuals and they see anyone who doesn't agree with them as being a either evil or or failing and so a moral way\nAnd ah it's probably not in a way of being in the world\nWell it says this type of conflict\nYeah uh I I again I I suppose that I'm hardly unique a in a thinking that uh that my viewpoints are correct\nOr they are my viewpoint that I have arrived at them by whatever thought processes involved I Would like to think that it is a rational analysis of of evidence and arguments that\nThat reflect the the circumstances in the world but for whatever reason yes I like everybody else would tend to agree with my viewpoint but it's almost a a a ... uh uh it uh it it naturally follows however\nI have never been so enamored of my viewpoint that I Would suggest that hey I must be right and therefore everybody else who disagrees with we must be wrong\nA door be that no matter how right I may be that it's somehow gives me a pass on the rules of society that that is the level of arrogance that escapes me even on issues where I'm\nVery confident that my viewpoint is correct I just uh it's it's the attitude that goes with the viewpoint that escapes me\nWell we we've done a very poor job over the last generation or two at raising our children are children have been raised with this concept of preserving self esteem or with the concept of self esteem is based on never criticizing never corrected\nAn individual in this carries on into the educational system so you've ... you've got ...\nNow at least one maybe what what generation that's really able to look at itself critically a as a

Richard Creighton amount of uh impeccable credentials he is a senior position at the Massachusetts General hospital trained psycho analyst Harvard professor author of the book out of control here's a call from Jerry in Baton Rouge Louisiana Jerry good evening\nHow ya doing just fine\nI was listening to the guy that called in before there and I think that your guest should at least know what a station says\nBecause there's not there's no such thing as separation of church and state that the Constitution's separation of\nGovernment will be able to mess with church does not say about church as\nWell to me are quite specific sense of this is a matter of great interest here I'll simply read the appropriate to article from the constitutional amendment number one Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise their ah so that's what it says\nOr does that say about religion not been able to be part of government\nWell what it says Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion but just to say there could be no state church at the same time you cannot prohibit someone from really exercising their religion but it absolutely has a lot to say about the relationship between government and religion\nBut it but it's not a limit to what religion can do it limits what government can do\nThat is correct ... to ... that is correct\nAnd and the gab and a lot of people are misconstrued by that ... or say there's a separation of church history\nWell there is a separation of church and state Jerry to the extent that Congress cannot establish a state church or I don't know how many times we have to go back and forth over there's a doctor grade\nYeah how are you know I Do think the founding fathers or any problem with having a religion as part of it\nOh really yeah I mean I ... in the army a chaplain at do open the open session of Congress yes you just cannot have it at the time we must remember that there were a ... and many of the colonies are there had been officials state churches\nAbsolutely and there was a ... church and England and so the concern was that they didn't want to have this new governments are\nInfluenced by an official church stay put it that they had no desire at all to exclude card from a or was being practiced in society that was not an original lamb\nAnd and and certainly a a efforts in that regard go far beyond anything that was ever contemplated in the the First Amendment in the time that we have left your thoughts about a remedy as you pointed out a severe problem\nAnd I would have to ask your thoughts about what we can do\nWell I I think one thing again is just the the enforcement the regular enforcement of the law you know for instance in watching the the recent uh\nKevin hearings ... it's amazing to me the mobs can basically ruined the capital and the costs senators with without the Capitol police like removing them from the buildings ah before these legislators would cost like this this is just much too much ...\nI I don't understand that it's very difficult or even with reporters credentials to get around the capital and they are all kinds of a of a a security checkpoints and uh and detection of a medal of all I could go into the airport I must confess I'm at a loss doctors to how those people even got into the capital\nIs it's it's it's a very serious question it raises real questions about security but more important it sends the wrong message to society\nA ... of the laws that are on the books in the way they they were in the forest in previous years a would be one of first in court and start cleaning up the schools is another very important piece a\nAnd I I think the politicization of a lot of the ancillary a institutions for for instance I work in a hospital associated the recall but it's become very political or you know it's no longer primarily interested in in patient care the other major concerns about diversity et cetera\nYou know in places like a hospital which never\nUsed to be a subject to those types of of concerns a but in terms of what will happen I I think one of the things is likely to happen I think either we're going to see something that looks like a civil war\nAlthough I think that's unlikely\nA I think there may be some intervention from some foreign power or I think that's very possible is the degree of\nFactional lives in a dozen results but the third I think those peaceful resolution is that somehow overturned a these these factional concerns just dissipates\nAnd that's something that we see a in individuals who are conflicted at times ah that with the passage of time what seems to be an overwhelming conflict or just no longer\nSeems to fascinate individual or grip the individual and that may be true at the level of the country as well\nAbout a in any way we look at it this is a a very reasoned and scholarly look at a problem that is certainly gripping the country and I think we've all been aware of the general outlines of the problem although not in the detail and the analysis was provided by our guest again is Dr Richard created\nHarvard professor senior physician at the Massachusetts General hospital a drain psycho analyst with the author of the book out of control apocalyptic psychology in the age of Trump and are we asking please stay on the line we will speak

strike me that uh with what could happen today to one side of the political spectrum if this becomes acceptable behavior could happen to another side not one thing that that some have pointed out and I think we should bring into the discussion is\nThat is the presumption of innocence is a court room presumption and that technically\nBut it does not apply in a proceeding that it's only about ... or not grabbing a privilege since there is no right to be a Supreme Court justice\nI I personally I find that argument a technically correct but that may be getting kind of violating the spirit of fairness\nAs I thought we lived in a country\nAh proudly where you're innocent until proven guilty near accusation will not to an allegation is not enough and I don't think that\nThe Democrats in this instance war\nOr anything like a jury of one's peers older one doesn't get that got off in in America anyway [noise] but um it was awful to watch I was totally mesmerized by it\nI was mesmerized by it and I was rather fearful ah there is now I'm told another movement at least it's being so described to me because of its own hash tag will hash tag ... me to\nTurn into hash tag not her in other words will there be a tendency on the part of those in the hiring and firing positions which of course remain predominantly male to simply say a yes or ms Smith is is more qualified than anyone else including Mr Jones\nThe with Mr Jones I'm not afraid that it's a higher will turn around and to an end wind up leading me into a lawsuit so even though Mr Smith is is quite qualified I just feel more comfortable for example let's say having a a late night meeting with Mr Jones or you know I mean is this going to turn into a problem for women getting hired\nYes but I think this is also another face a backlash and I think we have many faces a backlash\nAnd that's conceivably one although there on the men who have been hit on my male employers and or who have made false allegations against male employee so I think he's a very dicey times I mean what is [noise]\nUm but I think that the hesitation to believe women and or to hire women or to be alone with a woman a me the heightened because of this\nHearing because of these times and that's really very terrible because with a woman is qualified hell higher\nExactly and and I agree with you that while I Do consider when I just described to

Martians at jacking because for protection ... we jumped in the pews and jumped onto the seats wow\nThat what was the point at which there was a group called the Letterman and you could look around at each other and say you know what I think we could make a living at this in other words I guess what was the big break\nWell it it actually it was built floor we record it\nUh I I got the idea that we could make a living doing it because we see that from the original letter ... this is the fortunes of talking about them in my Barnett was actually his wife was the\nPerson who named us to Letterman we were rehearsing his house in Sherman Oaks Mike bond that was a studio singer to believe he was about ten years older than me and he would be on the road with that\nCarol Channing and Debbie Reynolds is a boy background singer and so he was really a experience in showbiz and so uh when they see somebody at a party I was singing solo after the choir boys and he asked me if I'd like to join this group\nThat was playing together and I said surely science so that was doing the ... went to his house in Sherman Oaks and sure enough were sitting there with ...\nWas another boy singer in Hollywood that three of us got together start seeing his and said you know this to go somewhere and my partner was the actual sparked like and his wife said well you guys you get it ain't\nAnd all that said what what what's your name what we call ourselves as she said look around their groups and naming themselves after school names there's up for fresh meant\nThat for threats Danny into junior she said you guys\nCall yourself at school then I bought the Letterman but it was my one that's why we actually gave his name\nJust out of the clear blue sky and I can tell you folks yes as they too are today they do still wear those letters sweaters and it's a it's a just a a wonderful wave of the ... to see that\nLet me correct you know here's a letter sweaters and we had two and a half hour show and we only bring up the sweaters for about four minutes segment and I don't want your ... your\nPeople you know they were back in time when old fashioned we're up to date entertainers has two thousand and they can't\nThey are absolutely that folks that I can assure you but yes there is one segment of the show when they do put on the the letters what it's about the entire show that is that is absolutely correct\nNow these days of course the Letterman consist of a Tony Tyler and Donovan tea and Bobby pointed now less ... think of them as the expansion Letterman in point of fact they've been with the the group or an awfully long time right\nUp bodies been skin in an eighty eight and Donald became an eighty four dollars in a Letterman ... body longer than any other letter and then have been Letterman\nBeside myself wow\nThat's a remarkable ... the thing that is most notable about the stage show it in your early drivers home of course we all know the Letterman can sing so marvelously as a group and met wonderful three part harmony but each of you is an extremely accomplished soloist is that by decide\nOh of course when I started this group that then you know most of the time to see this group that for a ... a a there was always one guy on the lead us standing out front and the other guys are being hurt them the two or three guys and then go and do a lot do I do watch it and I caught it was ... you'd have a stronger group\nGet all three guys are so low as first of all as I said the best looking guys that gets fine you know they would at the time and fifty eight and then I looked at it\nFor the best solo singers like I just was a theory is you're only as good as some of your parts\nThat he had three good looking tall handsome showmanship guys with great voices that's going to make the group stronger\nWell it certainly is a very strong group and we're going to talk some more with Tony Tyler one of the original Letterman and yes there are still out

her Larry Nassar indictment alleges penny ordered the removal of documents from the Karolyi Ranch relating to announcers activities they're also which is the removal was aimed at impairing the ongoing investigation of Nasser\nOf course it helps in all of us have the media on your side perpetuating these faucets I recognize that that's huge and one of the other callers pointed that out and mark you can't leave out the medium\nSo those on our side or off and on the defensive even though they are explaining the obvious by the way one of the other things I mentioned last night\nThe left is very good at slogans right so hoping change right Obama had open changed how can you argue with hope and change\nYou have to it's much more complex to explain our position wait a second or you always for change and I'll ask my students or you know where you're happy when you're younger and your parents are decided they were moving and they didn't ask you how about that change or how about a change you know the taken away your car\nNot every change is good but hope and change sounds fantastic\nSo those on our side or off and on the defensive even though as I said they're explaining the obvious the most recent case being parents with children trying to get asylum and you know why mentioning 'cause it's happening now but I'll get that in a minute\nSeeking asylum and President Trump and Republicans accused of ripping children of course there's the help of the media ripping children from their mothers\nArms and putting these children in cages never mind that this was started on the bottom and ministry\nPresident Trump and Republicans are on the defensive never mind that if the parents of these children this is crucial but Yardley ever heard of the parents of these children didn't come to the border and the first place there would be no issue no one force them to come here\nThey made a voluntary choice\nAnd we have a right to our sovereignty and to protect our borders and to decide who is welcome to enter just like we do with our homes this is so obvious it's incredible that we have to explain our position but again\nThere's a simple right after ... you know you're ripping away from the parents how could you do that and we're on the other side having to explain things like what are coming here legally means why that's not acceptable\nBut the left and the Democrats and the media likely do not believe in having us you know our sovereignty but rather they believe in open borders\nBut they don't like to admit that because they know they would lose the argument\nWhich is why they would rather talk about tearing children out of their mother's arms is really bad they get to set the debate and the terms of the debate when the media's on their side because no one's questioning them with comments like I'm throwing out there and that you would\nNever mind that when anyone does something illegal and they're hauled off to jail\nTheir children do not go with them to jail boys that a big one that's a huge one you'll never see it when you know in the in the last time this happened and it's going to happen again with these hunters ah Honduras refugees coming you know seeking asylum that's going to happen to very shortly whenever they get here\nYou never get to stay with your kid who hid you could use the same phrase oh she was found guilty of robbery first degree robbery and put our child was ripped out of her arm you never hear the media say that but that's what happens in effect\nThere also and so to speak torn away from them why isn't it said and I was just in case the latest reincarnation of this conflict\nIs is a news hundreds of Hondurans are heading for the U.S border in a mass migration to seek asylum\nSo again President Trump and the Republicans will be on the defensive just because they want to defend our borders and the media will again show crying children and distraught mother you know what's gonna happen\nBut no one is forcing them to come here and we have a right to decide who gets to enter our house and under what circumstances among other things we have a right this is pretty obvious to it seems to me to protect the American people from harm weather from\nTerrorism or disease we don't know the terrorists aren't coming through our open border or disease uh we checking for diseases like we used to know or ... well you can't if they come here and Russian or even for that matter this was important people don't talk about this\nTo make sure that people who come here share our values\nAnd just about every country does this including our neighbor immediately to the south of Mexico good try the same thing down there\nSome of us think this is also obvious but there have been huge forces arrayed against this common sense the Democrats want more votes they will tell you that they they know illegal immigrants vote for them in huge numbers and the country club Republicans\nFor lack of better name they want cheap labor so you have a newspapers like the wall Street Journal I I stopped subscribing to it when they would have their editorials and it would talk about immigration in the title\nAnd then I mean they say illegal immigration the title and somewhere in the middle they would just sit switched immigration oh immigration has been a great for America over the years how could you you were in Iowa list right how could you oppose this this isn't seen\nWhat they would switch on us even though they pretend to talk about illegal immigration in the title\nOf course the Republicans are also the stupid party that's my party than McDonalds during that so you have people like George W. Bush and Karl Rove saying things like boy we can get this vote George W. Bush got up to forty percent of the Hispanic vote in Texas wonderful\nI'm not a math major but that seems like a formula for defeat\nAll a lawsuit politics by the way politics in particular a loss of sixty percent of forty percent is huge and that is based on an optimistic assumption most illegal immigrants come here for jobs but they also take advantage of government hand that says we know that the rest of us are paying for\nAnd by the way the Republican Party can never out do the Democrats in offering benefits\nI uh I think I use this phrase years ago when a ever voters are given a choice between Democrats and Democrats meaning larger Democrats they choose the original ones they need us so who these people going to vote for it's not that hard to figure out\nAnd if left unchecked the Republicans will never win a national election again\nSo even on a purely selfish basis it is clear that we need to control the border\nNot to mention fairness what do you say to the people around the world who have been waiting many years I've heard of people waiting a decade to get here but I have to undergo long waits on and says some paperwork to even have a hope of getting here so they have to follow the rules but those who dash across the border do not\nWhich is why a border wall makes sense among other tools is not the only thing but it's one of the tools so one caller and this week and if you didn't hear him suggests that border walls don't work in the long run\nAnd I said but even if that were true I bet they work in the short run while we try to clean this mess up and have an orderly procedure coming to our country\nIf to me it's the same ridiculous logic that the defenders of illegals murdering innocent America's like Americans like aids finally use\nAnd I you know I pointed Geraldo Rivera 'cause I watch them do it time and time again saying oh illegals commit crimes percentage wise you lower numbers the Native Americans as if\nThat matters who cares even if that's true if an American is killed or harmed by illegal immigrants that person would not have been hurt if that illegal had been denied entry no matter what the percentage isn't that obvious and that wall by the way in Israel preventing Hamas for murdering Israel's Israelis is working to shore room\nA logical these arguments is baffling to me unless you realize they have no real argument unless you change the words and the terms\nI more to say but I Know we have to go to the break surely let me give you the numbers and I'll go on a little bit more eight six six Ninety red eye and that's the same as eight six six nine seven three three three nine\nSo example how can you ever justify sanctuary cities were criminal eagles are given safe harbor if you come up with phony arguments like illegals will not go you've heard that they won't cooperate with the authorities if they know they can be apprehended were sent home so that's why it's important that you know we have sanctuary for them\nBut how about they not be allowed to come or in the first place and we wouldn't need to cooperate with authorities isn't that obvious how can you ever justify harboring criminals who commit crimes that native born Americans have no asylum from\nYou change the debate watch this to the evil police officers at ice who had the audacity to arrest people commit crimes that said these guys are really clever on the left\nSo the rest of us live with long lines at hospitals through reading schools and intolerable traffic while the elites often live behind walls and their gated communities so what's my solution\nYou take away the benefits like free health care and free schools you enforce strict penalties against businesses that hire illegals even sending some CEO to jail you say in the first CEO to jail for hiring and illegal immigrant and will never happen again\nAnd you'd be amazed at how many illegal immigrants would return home\nRun the actually had a right to use the wrong language self deport there we go again with language right we're not good at that self deport we keep losing the language war to the left\nBut I Would say that those who remained right everybody would leave it there were no better I take it back not everybody a lot would leave and that's what's happened during the recession a lot we leave there are no benefits no government handouts and they couldn't get jobs\nWe but I Would say that those who remain that's the point I Want to make I'd be willing to have a conversation about with them because they be saying for the right reasons\nThat the

retreat eight six six Ninety red eye that's\nEight six six nine o seven thirty three thirty nine getting your take\nOn illegal immigration and by the way I don't blame the illegal immigrants you may not have thought about this before I put myself in their place what would I Do if I was living in a country where there was little hope little opportunity and tyrannical government let alone violence like Salvador\nOr the drug cartels in Mexico I don't blame them and I did television show years ago I had a TV show and I had people from all over on the opposite side of me saying yeah we agree that's the government they've given us a signal to come on over\nA or mixed messages or it's not clear I don't blame them for trying to seek a better life\nAnd I blame us and the government and this idea ... in the George W. Bush did the same thing as the wall to Wall Street journal\nOr he would you know talk about immigration how great immigration is no no one's arguing that people are ancestors are relatives came and lenders Ellis Island and they share our values and and what they want to make a difference and they wanted to get freedom but it was\nLegal immigration and by the way if you had a bad disease my knowledge they didn't let you in\nThat's coming here legal that's a huge difference\nSo don't don't call me an eyelash every country has a right to have borders are much you believe in open borders one world and you know good luck it could be Venezuelan a large scale or Cuba\nNo let me know what you think and let's go I said I go to your calls and let's go to Steve and I'm In a whole Virginia Steve you're on with mark\nHey yeah I Love it or something\nI'm One of ... you know well why don't we start on the phone or and with all the eight you\nKnow the money but we go away with them to come out of it anyway\nSo why I like your idea about the way it's an interesting idea why do you use the phrase document\nWell at that point it do you call it whatever you want to know what that's what I think lately but if you want to call it ... you get ill or any of the people not only that when we got\nA whatever on the bus\nLane whatever we look for that as well and or any children that are separated for you know\nIn some ways you're harder than me but it yeah get them out on him out and\nThat's assuming you give it to every one of those countries which is the case for the most part of our writing\nOn stage eight or stolen but oh well Amy uh quite true you know I'd say we don't get\n... you don't mean in the United states you mean in the\nSenate outline of the world I mean the world we go we ate\nYeah well we don't give aid to the Soviet Union I mean you might say on now Russia there are certain countries you know you might say we get paid like the China you might say we give them aid because they take an unfair advantage of\nUs but there are a lot of countries where are we going to have a ... actually there were\nActually the Russians are helping us more with the satellites right now than we may be helping them financially but that's not your point your point is a good one which is we ought to charge the country's I'm a for their illegals coming here I I I kinda liked that idea\nEven though oh\nNo no it's a it's an interesting idea\nAnd it on a monitor their own people\nYeah and as you as you're kind of indicating this and they they love to send us they're poor right a lot of especially Mexico right ... or send us the poor and is not our problem right [laughter] you're a problem\nAnd it and then you can also add onto that health care bill that helped them deal with it but when we got a big it will stop or stuff you know let me but\nI yeah there's nothing like the writing the sentiment and that's the point right now it's been the wrong incentive you come here as I said I don't blame them and you get to go to school for free you get to have free hospital care right and you get to a drive in our roads you you know we pay for the roads and this is terrific you you you know I I Would come here to that's why I said", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Jim Bohannon Show", "city": "Johnson City", "day": "18"}
