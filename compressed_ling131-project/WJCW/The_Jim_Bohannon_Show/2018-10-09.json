an opportunity to get another a Second Amendment case before the high court and this might have to do with the right to carry so we're going to see how this one shakes out\nI'd curious just as an aside on on Supreme Court rulings in general\nI understand why Congress likes to duck hot potatoes because their chicken and they feel any hot potato issue a hurts their chances for reelection which is probably true I'll be at the fact that that's also part of their job to to handle hot potatoes but the corners these people are there for life\nOr they don't have to worry about a an election returns someplace where somebody's upset about the ruling in Smith versus Jones I don't understand why the court doesn't just weigh in whatever circumstances would seem to dictate that we needed a ruling\nWell hi to get something or other settled\nWhile I think a part of it is you know we've seen a ... in the last few years a couple retired justices or remarking about the second amendment John Paul Stevens the even suggested that the second amendment should be repealed which\nAre just stunned me as a journalist I've covered Second Amendment issues for most of my adult life even way back when I was a\nLittle weekly newspaper editor literally that was my first job out of college\nAnd uh it was stunning\nNot only the ... a retired Justice Stevens said that\nBut then I got to thinking of how the guy with the belief like that ever get appointed to the U.S Supreme Court and the first place you know we've got a bill of rights it has worked very well for more than two hundred and Thirty years and uh for for a retired Supreme Court associate justice\nTo suggest that hey we were really ought to repeal the second amendment\nIs just dumb founding to me\nWell it is a pretty hard to to figure ah not always clear exactly how our views are are are are brought about a sometimes but nonetheless there it is a interesting enough Stevens of I'm not mistaken was selected by Gerald Ford was he not a Republican\nI Believe it was yeah and you know that just goes to show you that are no matter who gets nominated and confirmed to the Supreme Court you can always count on which direction they're going to go after a particular time and you know they they get settled in they\nThey look at the various cases various issues and maybe maybe their minds change on some things too\nI I think conservatives at all I have a lot of hope for a justice cabinet or a I I Know that most of the people I Know wish him all the best in and hope that he has a a good in a long career on the on the Supreme Court\nBut you know as a journalist you know I'm a skeptic ... you're you're into broadcast journalism I'm sure you're skeptical about a lot of things too and it it let's just wait and see what happens over the rise we still don't know if there's going to be a Second Amendment case coming up or not if there is\nA we'll get to see how he handles\nYeah having having noted that but yeah it's always something of a crapshoot when the president's elects a a Supreme Court nominee one that they they always of course regardless of their background always hope will be more or less an idiot logical clone of their own thinking it seems to me that in recent years\nThat a Democrat democratic presidents have done a better job of picking such people than have Republicans that that most of those who uh enter into what their uh their father was my call heresy tend to be a Republican justice is maybe the most notable in recent memory of being a jeep Justice Roberts\nOn a Obamacare being constitutional since it is a tax ignoring for the fact that if it is a tax and it was adopted unconstitutionally tax bills have to start in the house but\nIt just seems to me that that somehow democratic presidents have picked more shall we say idiot logically pure nominees I Wonder why that is\nWell honestly I don't know if I figure that one out I'll call you then we'll both have a scoop but I I think that\nA ... on the left uh with with Democrats picking the people who are either ... the same as as they are\nThat's that's fairly predictable or I look at it this way or the Republican presidents\nPick judges that may or may not adhered to a strict party line and that's maybe a good thing you know because uh when when somebody gets appointed to the highest court in the land\nThey have to I think have some flexibility and look at each case as it comes along I didn't agree with the way the Roberts came down on Obamacare I I thought that was just nonsense but he decided it that way and\nUh on the other hand Robert sided with the four other justices\nIn two thousand eight and two thousand and ten when they affirmed that the second amendment does protect an individual right to keep and bear arms\nUh that's my that's my news beat that's where I'm at with this and and uh I think that was very important for the nation and not just good owners of the nation but\nUh the in the entire nation um the writers there you don't have to exercise that right or the trick is not trying to stop somebody else from exercising that right the right as always gonna be there\nAnd are twice in the last ten years the high court has protected the rights so and Justice Roberts was with the majority on that\nAnd I stay with us more to come as we're going to be taking a look at this aspect of

the top of a leader who calls in Pittsburgh good evening and they do\nHave a gym and gay um you know I remember my mother always saying that when the second amendment was written\nThat we had no police department and and I don't ever remember learning at school but when what the plea apartment formed life when did they start at least\nI mean I'm not mistaken and I could be wrong but police department so I Believe in general I began to come into being probably oh sixty or Seventy years after the nation's founding\nOr you may have had constable or or something of that nature but in terms of full scale police departments are I'm not sure Dave that uh\nThat they really did exist at the time but no I don't\nThink so in fact uh if I recall correctly the oldest a law enforcement agency in the United states is the Texas Rangers and uh I've always had a soft spot in my heart for the for the rangers my grandmother was from Texas\nAnd ah I I think that the idea of\nOf a law enforcement in those days was going out and getting the bad guys and I've never the noon the rangers or to get the bad guy he's ah but yeah I Want a law enforcement\nUh the uh I think began forming any you know we had to have a town constable that was pretty much a\nOr something that came into being and in the early Eighteen hundreds or where the county sheriff here or there\nBut a police departments that it took a while for the\nFor police to to kind of advanced but uh uh you know we we've seen a a that developed over the last two hundred years and and in uh right now is thinks everybody in law enforcement you're doing a good job with not a hell of a lot of uh appreciation out there but I'm I'm\nI just checked I just looked it up here a and I'm not sure where the Texas Rangers fall into this particular spectrum but uh\nThe uh the first police department in the u._s. or was established to Boston in Eighteen thirty eight or New York city in Eighteen forty five Albany New York and Chicago in Eighteen fifty one\nUh Eighteen fifty three was New Orleans in Cincinnati in Philadelphia and Eighteen fifty five so began to pick up steam and my guess was probably it was when the communities reached the size but you had to have some kind of such protection once you begin to get a cities of the ten twenty thirty thousand people in them\nThat uh it became necessary to uh to create police forces but that day dean thirty eight to answer a question in particular\nA and I don't I'm not sure when the the Texas Rangers as such gave it to be much more history of the police departments per se Charlie in Syracuse New York joins is hello Charlie\nA gym I I guess so I I Know what the fighter jet Bob because of the uh ... about ...\nTimes it does sometimes it doesn't it doesn't always

they're going to a ... term protection protest or the constitution show or when they do a then they can they got a nine men legislature that took the liberals that type of items old\nThat's why I get

twice in the ... to extend the bit Perkins article it says you have the right to life liberty and property a while without due process and there's no due process or their child\nOr I'm a thoughts are on a what a Charlie had to say uh Dave\n[noise] well I'm ... isn't really a line that country but I worry sometimes that judges or justices or take it into the cells to to legislate\nFrom the bench that bothers me because we had pigs earlier that we've got three branches\nGovernment executive legislative and judicial the each one of them has a job and the judges are suppose to interpret the law not invented a they're supposed to follow the constitution not try to rewrite it\nUm and I you know I I think a part of the fault lies over on Capitol Hill to when you get a activists uh at one extreme or the other trying to recreate the the constitutional laws the way they want him created\nI'm at some point\nThat whole process is going to run right off\nThe rails and yeah I Wish I had the answer to how to keep everybody in line but I just don't you know I I just write about this stuff\nYeah I I certainly a share your uh\nYour uh your views and and and the Charlie I have great sympathy for him as well I've cited us with for a number of times on the program and I think it was sort of my or one of the liberal women on the court on British or in at some point during arguments Soto my are I Believe it was made reference to something being beneficial\nI remember thinking of the time beneficial is none of your damn business you're concerned about beneficial than resign that Supreme Court seat\nRun for the house the Senate or the presidency and let's see if your idea of beneficial coincides with that of the public\nBut beneficial to describe me coming out of the mouth of U.S Supreme court justice beneficial ... nothing to do with your job\nWell yeah um so you know here here we are a back I guess at square one or how how did she get on the court will the Republicans say they were collegial and didn't challenge some of these things\nAre obviously they at least somebody had to know about this did they ask the tough questions but I frankly I think\nWe just witnessed with the cabinet or a confirmation process\nThe rules just got changed even even Senator Lindsey Graham who is typically a laid back guy he is things were out the other day he was\nFurious at his Democratic colleagues are on the Senate Judiciary committee\nAnd I don't think that's going to go away I think they changed the rules\nAnd you know what they're going to have to live with that for a very long time in ... when Republicans come back and say there is a Democrat is president uh sometime the next four to eight years on and we'll see how that works out uh if if\nIf someone is nominated to a a vacancy on the high court I think the gloves could easily come back off again and ... and ... what is what good does it do for the country I don't know I don't know what some of these people

in ... very Idaho is our next call hello mark\nHow you doing fine thank you\nMa'am listen I'm of course up here in North Idaho we're very starch defenders of our Second Amendment rights um and I noticed that through the heartland and other states they really relaxed or the carry laws for um arms and the question I Want to ask your guest\nIt was a guinea provide any concrete um statistics regarding ... reduction in crime rates with the increased um secular and carry well\nThat's always tough because there are there are different points of view on whether or not a concealed carry is contributed to reduction in crime but I Will say this over the last several years we've seen\nA steady increase in the number of citizens who are legally licensed to carry right now according to a one estimate it's about Seventeen and a half a million people in the United states are licensed to carry over here in neighboring Washington state where I'm at\nA we're above five hundred and Ninety eight thousand the active concealed pistol license I'm not sure how you guys are over in Idaho but uh we're both open carry states too and and people really do need a permit a license to do that\nUh but I have noticed a a ... a lot for example\nWho was a crime of prevention Research Center bag and a frequent guest on the program but yeah and\nA nice guy and and he always has a pretty good handle on\nHow I'm concealed carry and gun ownership relates to reduction in crime\nA now the other side will say it has no bearing whatsoever but I I Will say this\nI've written about this several times ah it hasn't contributed to an increase in crime so everything that we were told for all those years that more guns in in private hands are more guns on the street more licensed to carry concealed is going to lead the blood baths\nThat's nonsense and it's been demonstrably proven so but it's nonsense all the crime we see in Chicago for example the Detroit the Baltimore Washington DC none of those people was licensed to carry their own quirks carrying guns legally\nOr the law abiding citizens don't contribute to the problem at all but it it's the bad guys to begin with and that's why there are so many law abiding citizens we want to ... an even playing field\nAnd if in fact it was the the presence of guns per capita that contributed to crime then the murder capital of America would be a young males living in rural areas\nWell yeah and believe me we be reading about that every day on the front page of every English speaking newspaper ... of the fold because that would be a real genuine problem\nYeah uh uh looking ahead got the lesson admitted to go here of what are you thinking is likely to be the next ... such a Second Amendment case to hit the court\nWell I think the the high court is eventually going to have to consider a right to carry\nA whether it's a challenge of concealed carry laws in in California or New Jersey or one of the other states with very restrictive laws and then we're going to get around eventually to whether or not semi automatic\nA modern sporting rifles are protected by the second amendment I happen to think they are we'll see how the court comes down on\nThe right very good say on the line we'll speak unfair again a day's work when our guest is senior editor at the gun maggot dot com and at liberty party press these communications

resources available to an actual student at a given school they have their own dormitories their own or a training tables\nAnd I think for alumni in many cases to get all interested let's say in a\nIn such and such a player who was a student the good old enormous state just like I was well they may be enrolled there and they may wear the uniform of colors that you remember but ah to call them a student just like you were would be a scratch your\nThoughts I think that's true and I think the criticisms level there are valid and in some cases but I think people are much more conscious of it now and they're much more aware of that and the fact is I think coaches today are getting a little bit more involved in\nReminding kids and recruiting kids\nThat they want and the graduate they wanted to come back and get their degree I think that's a very important part and it's happening or you just gotta just take the time to give them I'm not here to defend everybody I realize their shortcomings but\nI think people have made enough of that of a criticism that the people now are much more conscious of it and I mean schools are conscious of it too\nAnd we we have one thing that we have to deal with that is very big and that is and you mentioned it earlier\nUh the NFL has a really captivated this country to a certain extent or by the news is by the ... are finding that even Suzie as it might generate by the publicity it gets\nAnd you know kids grow up thinking that's their dream maybe it's the same dream the kid going to major league baseball but what I'm trying to say is when you add up the number of kids that come out each year as seniors or eligible for the pro draft when it takes place around one a little\nOver one percent of those kids make it so there's a large percentage of people that have to go on to do other things with their life and that's why it's essential that they get a degree get an education\nAbsolutely uh just to uh to quote from the forward to the book was by the way there's a producing was cast of characters along with Bob cats the ... in the book first in forever forward or is by Archie Manning afterward by Bobby dowden that's football royalty\nBut uh uh\nJust to quote from uh some of the remarks that were made a bio Archie Manning as he was a a being a a presented I guess if this was the he was a twenty sixteen recipient of the national football foundation gold medal award a\nBoard they give and it's got its for presidents to coaches who Archie Manning\nRight uh and of course of those who don't happen to follow football that much the father of Peyton and he lied and a number of other ... by the way some of whom also played football but uh yeah the father of two\nUh imminently or a successful a professional football quarterbacks and of course he was one himself here uh\nManning had this to say I understand that everything evolves even our game and like the changing seasons everything goes in cycles including how young people celebrate how they want to address different be different but it's still a game of blocking tackling competing and getting up after you've fallen down and doing it all over again that's called resilience\nAnd no one who questioned the value of resilience and the ever changing world\nAround us I'm a bit old fashioned but that's okay I admire when opponents show respect for each other including that well deserved post game hand shake up I Wonder your thoughts about football the character builder because as much as I said about that and the notion of teamwork\n[noise] I think the thing that sets it apart from other sport and this is not a criticism of other sports but just the fact is just what you said team got eleven guys on often eleven on defense\nYou have especially team you have a kickoff team you have a lot of participants involved in the game and for them to work together eventually to go out there and put on a show and hopefully be successful not always but they are\nIs team and that's the concept\nThat art she's referring to in most football players when they talk about their experiences in the game and go on in their lives\nThey come back to it and if you read that book you'll see that the majority of those guys will talk about the fact that they referred back or cold on that team or concept in their lives when things were a little bit tough matter what the situation he can't over exaggerate that that team work has to work a condo Lisa rice\nAnd we all know her very well [noise]\nUh in two thousand Fifteen was awarded the gold medal of same award that Archie got two thousand sixteen\nAnd people were wondering why it was kind of leads to rise they brought a New York to dinner and he got Fifteen hundred people from all over the country in the audience college hall of famers and what have you and she got up and she summed up I think the game as well as anybody I've ever heard he said\nYou won't believe this but my daddy\nWas a football coach he coached high school football and Alabama and he used to say Condi or what is the last guy do when he pulls the right he's trapped block and daddy each trap block it and why they have five defensive backs in there and his third and long that's uh prevent daddy that Supreme it\nAnd she said she summed up the impact of football or the American culture she said you watched team made up of young men of all backgrounds all related all races all ethnicities\nPulling together working together it's teeming loving each other respecting each other\nIs a reflection of the Americas journey and I think that's exactly what I mean when I talk about the team work and football and the kind of game it is you need all those guys make it successful and uh I think that's what sets it apart and still does you know why people continue to play\nOutstanding and we'll continue our discussion here but I'm going to\nTake a little change of pace or you're just a note one particular thing that may have

six\n[noise] first and for ever is the book that has the subtitle of making the case for the future of football Bob cast viola our guest is the author of this and just to note or you you bring this up so we'll we'll take a look at it and that is a you know to hear on page one hundred eighty eight\nOf first forever that it probably sixty and the ivy league banned the tackling entirely in all practices something which incidentally we had been doing at Brown university\nUh for some time there are calls now a to eliminate tackle football at the pop Warner league as the New York times had headlines said\nIn September of quality Seventeen the headline was playing tackle football before twelve is tied to brain problems later and so I ask you Bob cast viola are we heading to the day when all football is a\nFlag football or or tag football this sort of thing because there's still a lot of athleticism that could be performed there and yet I don't see stadiums being billed either at the college or the professional level\n[noise] I don't think I don't think you and I may see it perhaps we may but I think we can see that that is going to be less contact and that the smaller level it could very well be that they changed the rules for young kids and youth football to do that or because they didn't keep\nThem away from hitting before they get to a certain age and I just want to make a very quick note here because I think it's important yeah ah this past year in the state of Texas aha that the football every high school\nCoach whether he'd be varsity junior varsity freshmen had to take a test\nOn statewide tackling certification program teaching the proper techniques of tackling or they couldn't coach over Ninety percent of them got through it but it's something that was run by a company called out of this eighty eight of us had to Portland, Oregon\nAnd a half moving on through different states and that's what you're going to see it in a seat techniques changing you know seek teaching techniques changing and getting more and more away from using the head as a tackling weapon going back to what even\nBy the thousands says in his chapter he taught and coach and played as a shoulder attack that I think to see a lot of those kind of changes they may come back at the lower level too\nBut I Do believe you're going to see a greater tendency now to put emphasis on coaching techniques particularly tackling technique\nI suspect you're quite correct that that's the direction that we are heading a but again can you see a a football\nGame if you will or that is is that much a reduced from the level of violence that we've seen in recent years or maybe it does become flag football as such but the contact is so reduced it's I think to a certain extent\nLike why many people will honestly admit they go to work to stock car races or they go to watch NASCAR to watch the crashes and I think that the more than a few people go to football games college and professional to watch the collisions I mean the the the greatest hits videos up there that exist in some of them are\nAre are pretty brutal stuff\nUh they're very popular and I'm just wondering if your thoughts about whether or not granted football can remain an activity of that is played at the\nLevel the for fun level the stay in shape level but will remain a big time spectator sport without a fair level of just flat knocking people down\nI think it will come to that totally but I Do feel that that will be a greater and you'll see it you see it now\nYou watch a football game whether it's a Saturday afternoon or Sunday and you see more flags on the ground why because they're calling more penalties\nThey calling penalties perhaps they didn't call before the cut back\nOn this that the intensity as well as how people are going after each other I Do feel in my heart I don't feel that's going to happen because he said something very important [noise] they ... they had a game in at Texas a and end the Saturday at a hundred thousand people watching Kentucky play Texas a and M.\nI don't think that's going to change dramatically right away\n[noise] are you concerned about the number of high schools that are dropping football and and apparently that's quite a few nationwide\nOr it's it's been reported that and there are some short and and there's some that have gone from from a\nA you know cutting back on the quarters they play that much time in the game yes that's happening yeah I'm concerned and I think it's happening and you've got to face it let's be honest about it the entire country is changing when you think about how many towns that can go back to the days I recruited in Pennsylvania heavily\nPolls have steel town a lot of those towns don't exist anymore because those industries that God the retailers have done the young people who were involved in\nOr not there anymore so they're changing scene of the population you got a lot more students coming from different parts of the world\nSo I think that part of it could have an effect in time but there's still a great deal of time for people to see the opportunity to play the game I Believe and what it can do for you as far as education as far as a future beyond the game [noise]\nStay with us more to come as we look at the case for the future of football person forever Bob ... our guest what

football is published by post to press [noise] what do you think the future is I mean having major\nCaves are you an optimist\nAnd I'm an optimist if people are willing to consider what the game has meant to so many you know we need to promote would I I said earlier the good in the game because there's so much of it too much to squander and then I have people that the experience\nThat over the years has helped build so many young lives and let them take great futures and careers which for many led to great contribution to society that's not an exaggeration\nThe game is it does that for people and there are many examples of it not just in my book there examples all over the country and I just feel it's so important that avenue will be there for them wherever they might be not everybody should play the game I realize that\nBut there's a percentage of kids who might have the physical structure mental toughness that set city and the talent to make it work [noise]\nIs there anything about the equipment or the rules which you would like to see changed\nBut I think the rules and tackling have to change\n... years ago we went to sprint practice a coaching at Dartmouth who in the spring practice in the south and read a couple of coaches came back after being at a university down there and they came in and said you know the teaching a whole new tackling technique and he said what does that all about\nAnd they said they're using the head they feel they get more balanced by putting their heads right in the chest of the the ball carrier or wherever they intend to defensive player is because you have more balanced and less chance of making a mistake or slipping by and that became\nThe way to do it that the biggest difference now I think those kind of rules have changed and they are and as a change I think you'll see a as and coaching techniques change with it\nOr I think you'll see more safety and more kids playing the game and less less injuries as I said earlier it's a physical game is going to the injuries but\nLess hard tough injuries and I think we'll see a change of that\nI'm not sure what we can really do I mean today's helmets are so are designed to distribute to\nA force or a you've got the face guards of course a a padding all over the body I'm not even sure my imagination can't to carry me or to a great deal more in terms of just what we do short of a case of a player in a in a virtual suit of armor\n... would you change the equipment at all\nI think it is changing him and I think you're seeing new changes in helmet structure\nYou mentioned something earlier you mentioned the a buddy you mentioned tackling in practice study havens is the coach at Dartmouth College and he instituted about five years ago a rule that once preseason practices over he never was going to have contact during\nThe week contact with someone they played on Saturday and he created all kinds of equipment with the help of manufacturers\nBlocking tackling dummies and things that gave some type of resistance but safety so they could run through something and not be running into a brick wall it has taken on so well you mentioned Brown University several schools throughout the country are looking at it now and I think that's what you're going to see less\nPhysical contact during the week and limited to the game time and uh basically I think those kinds of changes will help the sport and also show\nPeople parents that people care and looking at the best ways to coach their kids\nAnd the briefly what is the time remaining if you will check the highest paid public employees in any state or you will find invariably a bit of this uh uh the uh top basketball and football coaches and that given the state is there too much money in college sports\nWealth you know ... you know one of the drive anybody about the opportunity to make money but I agree to a certain extent when you pay for the fall of take football\nThat we don't get about Fifteen seconds or so it it will you pay a guy seven or eight million dollars what does that physics professors doing up there\nThinking about yes I think it can be

hope that if someone did that to you they were found\nArrested prosecuted and if convicted given sufficient\nPunish much having said that\nThe notion that because something like that happened to you we must be outraged that just because allegations are brought up against someone in a circumstance about which you know no more than the rest of us because you were there when these alleged parties took place which allegedly involved Brett Kavanaugh\nThat you become so outraged weeping and gnashing of teeth\nPounding of or your chest I mean my goodness what is this level of indignation\nGet over yourselves\nAnd do not take whatever may have happened to you as a metaphor for what has happened in the processes of the U.S Senate\n\nIt is just amazing the level of outrage out there that exists and often very misplaced outrage the fact that someone who had charges unsubstantiated I might add charges against them has been confirmed as a Supreme Court justice is being looked upon now as the rape of every woman in the country\nGet over yourselves\nThat isn't what happened\nAnd just a little bit of perspective would be very helpful and again for those who will go out of their way to misunderstand what I'm saying no I'm not encouraging\nSexual assault by anybody against anybody I Am not excusing sexual assault by anybody against anybody\nBut I Am saying that the mere fact that you may have been sexually assaulted and you feel that\nEither the authorities or society did not give your claim sufficient do is the bases therefore for denying a position of public trust to anybody who was accused I'm Sorry it may make you a very aggrieved person it also makes you an idiot\nOne eight six six five oh jumbo one eight six six five oh five or six to six and when I saw this letter it just it just occurred me that that's the perfect metaphor for the year and which were if everything is the basis for our age\nLighten up lighten up\nThere was not an epidemic of rape of women in this country that it happens at all is of course terrible one case is one too many but we are probably more aware of the problem than we've ever been certainly the law is very much on the side of women\nAnd again\nIf you could just bring back the outrage just a notch or two maybe we could even have a rational reasonable conversation about after you do much\nThat's what we call a rhetorical question it damn sure isn't asking too much it's asking the bare minimum of a civilized society which is not by the way characterized by getting in people's faces and screaming by shouting like in fronting by disrupting people in privacy either\nIn the restaurants or or in their homes we've had enough public information put forward a homes addresses phone numbers and the like\nOf senators who voted quote the wrong way unquote\nWe are talking here about a descent into Savage read\nAt a civilized society cannot countenance that\nAnd the very people who are doing it\nOr people who probably under other circumstances would not countenance it\nAgain\nTry to put your indignation your outrage in some level of perspective\nI just like your thoughts about that one eight six six five oh jumbo one eight six six five oh five or six to six this letter just struck me as a perfect\nMetaphor for where we are right now shameful and appalling is the only way I can describe Sports Illustrated

okay for me it's okay for me to be outrage but no one else\nI'd do it wrong absolutely not I said no such thing I simply have noting misplaced outrage and I gave the the two principal types I'm Talking about talking about outrage\nAbout a silly basketball game and I'm Talking about outrage at in the form of a because society did not treat my particular sexual assault\nCorrectly therefore lash out at anybody else in particular against somehow redress the ballots that is the type of outrage I'm Talking about\nI I agree I'm almost entirely okay but again\nYou're\nBeing outraged about

difference\nBetween that little girls happiness\nOr what was that um how long ago now that they first announced\nA week because today I forget\nYeah it's just heartbreaking that list\nSome girl will

[noise]\nWhich would be a likely voters unless the questions that they asked to make it so it's tougher to figure out who will likely voter is six months before six months before an election right up and and I don't know what that would be yeah they don't that's a good point yeah right I Am so um\nYou know we were looking at some of the different analysis out there what are the analysis that I was telling you about\nI'll I'll bring it back up here coming up a little bit later on the show but it was really interesting saying that in a normal election for example that you know and this was talking about Ted Cruz and uh uh Robert Francis or in your in ... not in in the state of Texas and it said that\nAnd and you were talking about the ... the average went from a toss up to\n... yeah they well they had at the state this is our state Senate race went from toss up to ... ah ah leans Republican and it will it end if it if the polls keep trying the way they're trending now it will likely go likely Republican before the election\nAnd messy and they the some of the analysis of looking at said six percent of Republicans a will in an average election ... ...\nAre sit out the election or vote for the other candidate mhm and they made the point that if that six percent of it was just a normal election and that six percent which is a huge amount ... all decided to vote for work and he would still win by five hundred and fifty thousand votes cruise would still hurts would still one\nYeah yeah I'm ... and looking at the the breakdown of it and the the uh the\nHistory of of those waters because you look in El Paso in his district\nUm and and El Paso county uh it's it's he can run for that house seat and keep that house seats as long as he wants to ... ...\nYou when you move out to the you know the the broader\nMuch broader state of course the demographics changed drastically\nUm Dallas County alright he might win that uh there's in fact you if you looked at the polls I'm sure Dallas County would show going for him Travis County Harris County so those are Dallas ah Austin and Houston are respectively if if you're if you're not familiar with the counties\nBut that's those metro areas are tons of support tons of money coming in from uh the packs that he promised to or not ah except\nUh in terms of that and and and not he while he promised to reject the the the pac money I guess in in earnest but you really can't reject pac money pac money\nUh ultimately I guess but the the point being is there's a ton of a liberal money coming from out of the state a ton of liberal press from out of the state\nUm and of course uh the the make up the demographics in those those areas that we talked about a bear county in San Antonio uh same thing so you've got all these are blue counties\nAnd these metro areas and and that's that's kind of the breakdown of it and he'll do well and and likely win and those that were that were mentioned are and some other counties in or districts\nIn the state but ultimately it comes down to the broader state\nAs it always does and uh right now it's got an according to our cp leaning Republican\nAnd looking at a Tennessee uh uh for example you know as as we look at how did the cabinet thing and uh how might it have you know change the way that that people are looking and you look at the CNN the tendency race ah Marsha Blackburn against\nA a Phil Bredesen a British it was up by five ... democratic challenger back from the poll taken just from the eleventh of the September to the fifty\nHe was up by five and a from the twenty ninth to the second Blackburn up by five and from the second to the fifth which took us to Saturday and write a note tickets to friday friday black burn up eight ... that's a third team point movement in\nA matter of a a matter of a month and that's why we've always said we don't really\nWhen you see plus or minus ... ah you know five or even six or even seven ... it doesn't give you an indication as to you know how the polls may tightened and this is the time right now I mean I'm Talking about right now in the election right is when you get a much better idea\nWe always hear from our listeners that polls are never right mhm that is incorrect analysis\nA you know\nPresidential elections for example you and I really paid attention\nA front in two thousand eight two thousand twelve and two thousand sixteen ... after the election saying how many polls were close and normally you find\nUsually a a three or four of the polls were probably one or two we're almost dead on and three or four were pretty close then you have the you know some of the outliers out there and we always bring that to you after a presidential election but the polls actually do do a good reading in the ... there were a couple of polls that were\nDead on they didn't have Trump winning ... because they just do the popular vote they don't do the electoral vote\nOr but they were dead on us to the vote mhm what Hillary won by what two percentage points for a and so there were a couple of polls that were dead on but they didn't figure out the electoral college so they didn't figure out in those states in those particular states because they weren't doing the electoral electoral college\nAnalysis right so uh but they had the the actual vote count which again we come to a presidential elections from now on if the Democrats if a case you're Cortez doesn't succeed in getting rid of the electoral college in the Senate [laughter] uh you know a\n... will will they start trying to figure out are doing more detailed analysis and ah because you've had a you know a a Trump you know have this\nHad his victory so it'll be interesting to see what what happens there will go be going over some of the polls but yeah the un says that we're doomed unless we pay the amount\nBy twenty Twenty one hundred ... two hundred and forty dollars\nTax on a gallon of gas okay\nAll right well anyone ... no no I here's what I Will commit you what you I Am willing I I cannot speak\nMy children grandchildren great grandchildren or anyone else in my family that is present now or will be present in the future I\nIf I Am I live in a year Twenty one hundred will will pay that tax you know it's going to happen don't drink some scientist is totally totally going to mess it up for me\nHey we found a way to make their lives six hundred years oh yeah yeah yeah ... ... ... oh okay I thought you might come up with a new energy form like the movie the St ... with with ... ... well no she hears that thing by Twenty one hundred\nIf we're not transporting\nIf we [laughter] if if I Can't just sit there and then yeah beam up to something ... which I'm giving up\nAnd all but you're forgetting word it where does the energy come from robots to disassemble and the Adams of a person and then put them back together that's got to be\nYou know it may take the energy that that a nuclear bomb would create in order to do that for human beings we're assuming that the energy source is there for beaming\nOh it is I mean there could be tremendously because it may beaming may leave a huge carbon footprint or a black hole [laughter]\n\nSomebody's just came in like in the last minute you listen to the show going what the hell are and what an on going to go to a man that just totally lost their mind also coming up hurricane\nNow Michael a could hit Florida as hurricane three well three and\nYou know a hundred and ten miles an hour you look at the analysis a and and apparently from the flyovers as as you and I are following it and we are not meteorologist salvo John trout is with us of course every hour\nUm and we we look at that and but when you read the discussions the the discussions changed drastically and those reports from the national Hurricane Center on Monday morning and they started to show signs of that and that uh Michael strengthening\nA and having potential to strengthen greatly late Sunday and Monday morning but then they sought there's apparently a sheer that's involved here that they said typically\nWould mean that it's not going to be such a powerful storm but they said despite that chair and I I read the ten pm central discussion on it and it said it defies all logic that the sheer is still in place\nOr this this element essentially that would diminish the strength or keep the strength\nFrom growing I guess I'm despite that and they think maybe it's because of the size of the I thirty five mile high a\nIt is it is showing great potential for strengthening so for our friends there uh in in the Gulf Coast in on the panhandle of Florida\nListen to the authorities listen uh to keep your radios on uh make sure you were up to date on the

[laughter] I don't know I mean you know you'd have to tell the bell rings but here in a very heavily democratic district\nYou're going there I mean there are some people are talking about how it's broken and it's so polarized both of which I think are true um and you're also coming really as an outsider at a moment where I think people like for watching what happened today and want to storm the gate and you're going to actually do that this is a well that's what's what's your plan well I think a\nLot of it has to do with changing our strategy around with a lot of inside baseball and inside the beltway I hear you now you know we had that term thrown around but\nThere are very few organizers will Congress and I do think that organizers operate differently ed Cooke different kind of strategy and what it is really about Oregon I go\nAnd and really thinking about that word organizing sentimental people being strategic in their actions and we're in bringing together at ... strategy of putting pressure on the shoulder instead of only focusing on the pressures and catching fire that's really interesting thought [laughter]\nIt is [laughter]\nAnd so this was on social media over the

from the Democrats and stop\nStop ... owner analyzing what she says she's not the leader of the Democrats she's not the leader she's only going to be in a small district\nYou're right because of her performance she isn't going to be right now the probably the leader of the Democrats until she gets in the Congress and she starts actually saying what she believes instead of the mumbo jumbo stuff\nBecause I don't know why she going to win the she going to win or\nYou know in that heavily democratic district she's going to win anyway ... but you know her her you know she she is setting up I mean we know what she is she's a true socialist ... she's a social issues and she calls it a democratic show socialist and you have to because first you saw it was a democratic socialist before you

I just\nLove criticized on MSNBC oh that's very interesting you didn't Sandra Day yeah if I knew what it meant it would be more interesting yeah that's\nIt is that uh you know just kind of ... ... ... if you look if you go back to the history of ah of Brock Obama's political career\nWho he was as a political operative and and there was a lot of jokes made about community organizer right\nBut the
