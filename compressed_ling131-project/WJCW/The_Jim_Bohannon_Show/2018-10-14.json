energized in the Democratic base and that might take the Democrats down to pick up a only Eighteen or twenty seats in the house he wouldn't take it\nThen there's more polling that's come out in the last three days this week that now suggest the Democrats are going to be well over and pick up a twenty five in the house let's say you\nWell I think it's going to be an interesting split here potentially just because of the way the Senate map looks are I think the cabin I'll Fight is going to be a positive thing\nFor Republicans at a number of key races I think it could work well for them in Missouri it could work well for them in Indiana or could work well for them potentially in Florida and Montana too and it has probably shored up the likes of Ted Cruz Marsha Blackburn possibly\nAh Martha ... valley in Arizona and maybe even Dean Heller I I still think that the Republicans will probably lose one incumbent but they're in much stronger footing with their income and and they're in

I don't have children but I have a nine year old nephew who I adore I used to also teach high school in a boys' school so that also bothers me to\nTo a great extent the uh the the the wholesale demonization of\nOne particular gender or and then also as a\nAn attorney who and in fact I'm Talking to you\nFrom are outside of a courtroom line up to go in a few minutes um and due process is so\nExtremely important if we're going to have any kind of a ... of civilization and analyzed society and like you said to China Boy from thing along the lines of a new ... or whatever it was it it does on them or the French Revolution and I think\nThat what happened with and it didn't start with Christine Blasey Ford but she really she just pulled out the bigger ... team I like your analogy that started\nIt really started I think back with some nuclear cross when this started sort of honor catching into a a um a frenzy\nWhere people are just willing to believe in Egypt fashion that if a woman made an accusation that occupation has to be had to be true and you know to go across also had the cross currents of race in there and class but I think what\nWhat's happening is meat are flipping or or one thing that pendulum and such an extreme opposite direction from yeah what people thought about the patriarchy where women were never that we're a centrally turning our men\nInto second class citizens and I know people will laugh about that but it is essentially what you're saying as a man is accused if anyone's cues even on the most in the in the stands evidence such as that presented\nOr no evidence at all or ... or no evidence at all\nJoined salary write a story I mean we see I I really I I mean we're kindred spirits on this I mean it would seem to me if you look out if you really start looking at what's happening I mean a more like you were more oil rig or even someone like me we have the skills if we want to\nWe can produce a bunch of actresses right door already does this for a living I mean she can sit down with one becomes ten becomes a hundred and becomes a thousand she can sit down with these\nGirls and say you want to be on the today show do you want to tell them what you want to make a lot of money\nYou you were attacked words you you were assaulted weren't you and and the woman looks at her and says oh\nYes I forgot I was attacked now we know that she does that I mean a lot of is becoming a job [noise]\n[noise] yeah it is and I'm a ... ... people are being couch and unfortunately we ... now learned that\nThere is going to think that because the money for those also coached because she was scared to\nIt would be very difficult to keep her name hot until twenty four and the only possibility would be if Lindsey Graham\nIs is a future attorney general secretary of state or something down the road maybe she knows that and maybe she will take Lindsey Graham's seat that's the only thing I can think of big other than that keeping her name had for twenty four seems\nVery very difficult and I wonder is she's a moderate a does she have any thoughts of a primary against Mr Trump\nYou know if if this had been a situation I'm similar to how Secretary Tillerson or a general McMaster was dismissed and in sort of a by tweet or\nIn a very dismissive or acrimonious way then I think that might have been a possibility but the press conference\nOr where she and President Trump or sitting next to each other and work could not have been more complementary to each other leads me to believe that that is not the case\nI Wonder I'm I Wonder what the Trump Haley was kind of a surprise I mean obviously she you know she\nChecks a lot of the diversity blocks and of course she's a woman and\nDo you get you but but I Wonder you know with the Trump you had almost in terms of the ... national security advisor a cigarette is the UN ambassador you\nHad all the really had no foreign policy professionals I just can't figure out why you would put someone in there to be in with wouldn't you rather seen the foreign policy professional and a job like that\nAs ambassador to the un yes uh\nI mean particularly when you don't have any anywhere on when you start out with Tillerson or you start out with a charming master I mean you've got a lot of empty suits you have a lot of empty suits in foreign policy jobs right\nSo when you leave you if you're somebody like ... that's an empty suit as a businessman so what you're saying if you're going to let a staff around the state department is what you're saying now you essentially do the same thing she's not quite as she's more engaged in tellers and but she has no real background you're basically turning these agencies over to staff I mean that's the way I look at\nThe ...\nYou well there's that's one explanation um I don't believe that that was the intent I think that uh during the transition phase when President Trump was trying to discern what\nHis cabinet will look like what a senior officials would be\nUm he didn't come from a background for instance like President Bush did\nWhose father had a long or a series of of a confidant an aids in a previous point teas and he himself had confidence from his time as governor of Texas Trump came in\nRelatively or without a great deal of staff around him that he could I'm drawn to fill these positions and so I think she went through the process of\nTrying to uh identify candidate should this through a with a very open mind and she went in to interview him and she um it from a based on the rumors she was actually offered the secretary of state job\nAnd she declined that and said that I Want want something a little bit less\nUm central to the foreign policy establishment and she and he offered her the U.S at all I don't know that one I\nNo I've got one bread I have I have trouble believing that I've drawn out maybe that that might ... that's\nThe if you go back to normal believing that one I and that's always going on\nIn the category of all those people who say I turned on the VP slot on\nThe ticket that I I you know I was offered but I turned it down there about a hundred and that every convention writing\nBut uh but yeah I mean we were regardless of whether you believe it or not he did end up choosing Secretary Tillerson who was a businessman not a old a school for all it's a expert and a and so it's it's certainly within reason to believe that that was a possibility\nUm and so when Tillerson was in there the odd thing is that uh for someone who had so much experience as a leader of a large corporation\nHe was very reluctant to talk to the press and for better or for worse and I think for the better a bathroom Haley field that role I think she did it very effectively she uh she became the face and the administration on a number of foreign policy\nWhich has been saying well they haven't now she's had a number of important successes let's talk about what she did let's kick off her top three and successes\nSure she led the effort to try and reform the human rights council and then when the other member states resisted that effort or she stood on principle and round the administration behind the decision of the United states to withdraw from that body and as your listeners may know it's incredibly flawed body um arguably misnamed\nAnd that includes human rights abusers like Russia China Iran Venezuela among the membership that a council throughout its history\nAnd it also is very reluctant it's never a to confront human rights abusers through its actions in its resolutions never passed a resolution on China despite that country's horrible human rights record for instance\nA and it also is very biased towards Israel in disproportionately so now no country should be above reproach or above criticism or but for the council to focus roughly half of its condemn matory resolutions on one country is clearly\nA ... a disproportionate attention in terms of the uh the resources in time with that particular body\nAnd and she argued that these things need to be addressed the member states refused to do so and so she decided that\nUh she made the argument within the administration and the president agreed with her that we shouldn't be lending us credibility to such a flawed body and they were going to address human rights concerns on our terms I'm through other alternative means and mechanisms and ah and that's the path that they've chosen I think that's probably the wiser course to go\nUh that doesn't mean they're going to or not pursue reform and possibly or rejoined that council if it is reformed in the future but nonetheless it's standing on principle it's standing for human rights and that's\nSomething that's number one number two\nAh she's she successfully got stronger resolutions on North Korea to the U.N Security council it was a careful delicate diplomacy working with other countries particularly China and Russia to get those resolutions through and that increased the pressure on North Korea and perhaps at the stage for some of the um negotiations that we've seen\nUm between the administration the Trump Administration in the regime of North Korea we haven't seen the progress that I Would like to see on that\nBut you can't argue that Nikki Haley's or was not successful in getting those resolutions through which is a notoriously difficult thing to do or in the U.N Security council were any where any of the ... to ... to the resolution or she was also a on the third side um led efforts to reduce the un budget\nOr she cut them are here to un\nAnd she also got roughly a billion dollars cut out of the UN peacekeeping budget also led a dead body to finally closed down some missions that had been a talked about being close for a long time but uh had been delayed for a number of different reasons mostly political reasons\nAnd finally got the closure of the uh uh missions\nIn Liberia and inquisitive are and uh also downsize to Haiti mission she's also set the stage for review of other UN peacekeeping operations as well so that's a not a very is not a negligible thing getting the un\nBudget gee I've never I've version keeping missions in Liberia in Cote d'Ivoire wonder how much money was poured into those\nUh they weren't the most expensive missions but they also were or were not cheap either in the hundreds of millions of dollars every year\nUh basically to keep my guess is actually to keep warring drives apart which is might be a a which could be a fruitless endeavor oh red shaving were real

J. play mhm and uh you know as as I've always said OJ was one of my boyhood heroes ... uh was um\nAnd uh I never saw anybody accelerate\nLike O. J. but\nI don't think I've ever seen anybody have the kind of moves to bury Sanders had when he played for Detroit but his his career was a a limited Gail Sayers also was just a a superb running back there's been a ton of good running backs up there I don't think anybody had the power what what differentiated Jim Brown was\nHe just had the power go back and watch some of the old films of Jim Brown ... I mean walking over\nPlowing over linebackers bigger than him ... and and just having incredibly now any power but he had great balance didn't have the speed I don't believe we're the acceleration of an OJ or berries Sanders and but he had the power nobody I I don't think anybody ever came close to the power that he had but\nThat being said Jim rounds old Jim Brown is not a part of popular culture today\nA you ask the average or a a thirty year old if they know who Jim Brown is down on who you're talking about that all the\nThe the old guy that you know they might remember the fact that you know he has worked with gangs before mhm uh you know Jim Brown comes into the substance issue huge for anybody who was paid attention over the last Thirty years as to what he's been involved with\nBut Jim Brown is not part of popular culture today with the youth and millennials like Kanye West is the leftist scared to death of Kanye West because he's smack in the middle\nOf the the culture that is expected by the elite liberals to be a liberal supporter mhm\nHe cannot have a different opinion and if he does have a different opinion than Trump is exploiting the mental issues the Kanye West had nobody was talking about mental issues economy was when he when you know he was up the award show where they\nKnow on the left no no no uh nobody in the love was talking about his ah you know his mental state when I he said that uh George Bush a hates all black people because of Katrina didn't hang\nRight that that that that's not a because it again that's not a threat is something at that time politically they could use", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Jim Bohannon Show", "city": "Johnson City", "day": "14"}
