I had swept in with my father a long time ago and we uh we did a good job we fix it up we uh eleven hundred and sixty four units are remember the exact we fix it up I worked here for two summers sick of it by a garden that's right right by since I don't even know if it's still there now\nAnd knocked down about six months ago a really yellow and gone the whole thing is loading the garbage day with your ... and what's going to happen with the making of housing development\nOh okay good but it was great for us we fixed it and sold it for more money and uh it was very good but I Love since the queen city I Love the queen city\nLet's talk about what happened today with a pastor Brunson yeah major accomplishment you're like the hostage receiving president all the world they're coming in how important was to get back just religious leader who was being persecuted in Turkey\nWell he is that he's a great religious leader and it was a you know they accused him of things that he didn't do\nWhat we got back here we got back to Iowa we got back many people actually if you look at it as like seems like all the time we're bringing back people and uh I Know President Obama pay one point eight billion for nothing to bring back a few people from around one point eight billion\nAnd uh we got him back and he's going to be safe very shortly he's in the air just eat literally just took off\nAnd he'll be at the office he'll be in the oval office big welcome a big walk me up you know evangelical Christians everybody everybody wanted a back what happened to them was incredible and he was held hostage but now he's um he's going to be happy I'm sure he's very happy right now\nAbout your wife is a good trip to Africa sure which is unbelievable what happened there talking about what was the goal and what was accomplished with Maloney in Africa\nWell she's a terrific first lady and a great human being and she wanted to go and see for herself Africa because we've heard so much\nAbout it some very good step but some very tough tough in a sense of the way people live and she made forceps and she also went to the pyramids and Egypt and that was quite something special\nBut uh and the poverty is incredible you know the level of poverty a it was very sad and beautiful in one way and very Saturn and other kids were beautiful they loved her\nAnd she came back and she said I Hope you're going to continue to give a lot of money because they need it is not a question of it's not a question of defense is not a question of it it's just such a human basis they need it and she had a big impact on me I Will tell you a bill she really had a big impact on\nMe and the other thing the mid west I looked at Canada Mexico in South Korea\nMillions of jobs have been credit and you were told a year or two ago by Gary Cohn and others that you know the candidate deals probably not going to happen Mexico's too tough NAFTA is ingrained what'd you do that caused Canada may not be real happy right now in Mexico may not be real happy and then South Korea\nTo kind of play because we're the big dog in the kennel but they don't treat it that way what did you do with the\nDeal and we're also the piggy bank that everybody wants to come in and Rob\nAnd uh Mexico we made a deal and we told him look otherwise we're going to have to just actually car industry which would have been bad for them and frankly I wouldn't have wanted to do it but we were going to do it and\nWe made a deal with Mexico we could not make a deal with Canada they just wouldn't make a deal that was fair for us because NAFTA was a total and complete disaster you know the better the nominees or what happened over here with you still have building's empty with just everybody moved out\nI don't know what they were thinking so that's why I refused to call it NAFTA I said the deal with making I refused so we call it the U.S MCA and it works good but we made a great deal with a with everybody what happened then is Kennedy came along in the end\nWe were unable to make it I said we're going to tax you cars coming in and then what happened and they made a deal they made a deal they made a deal and it's a deal that we're very happy with I Hope they're very happy with I Hope everybody is but it's a fair deal for us and we have\nWith South Korea which is fabulous much a a much improved approved deal you know improved I Will say that Hillary Clinton to remember she made that deal and she said it's two hundred and fifty thousand jobs and she was right for South Korea so they got two hundred and fifty we didn't get two hundred and fifty\nIt was a terrible deal so essentially we terminated that deal and we made a new deal with South Korea's\nPresident how many jobs you're talking about are we talking about Canada Mexico we're talking about a million\nWell you're talking about millions of jobs for judges don't forget we've opened up countries that were just totally close to it right if you look at Canada we couldn't sell our dairy products out there and if we did it was a three hundred percent tariff people don't talk about that you know if I put on a ten percent or twenty percent Arab they make a big deal if they have three hundred\nActually three hundred percent two hundred and Seventy five percent two hundred and eighty five percent these are the terrorists they charge so essentially that's a wall\nBecause if you have to pay a tariff like that you can't sell the product is so expensive so we've opened up Canada and we have a very good relationship now I think they respect us more than they did before\nBut now at least it's fair in our farmers are in love with it you see what's going on it's beautiful now we're working on China and we're working on the European Union which of absolutely taken advantage of our country is the European Union has been brutal and the way they took advantage of the United states for many years\nI mean they were formed to take advantage of the United states that was a reason they were formed how can we\nHow can we take from the United states so the European Union they formed and they have their very unfair to us they have barriers where we can't sell into their into into their countries\nThey have a tremendous tariffs that make it impossible and yet they show Mercedes Benz and BMWs by the millions they come in there and Indians and we charge him essentially no tax it's two and a half percent but for the most part they don't even not elected\nSo we charge them virtually nothing and they send millions and millions of cars if we want to send a a piece of grain okay we want to send a piece of grain we can't do it and to the European Union so it's unfair uh we met with them I told them I'm going to start\nTaxing your cars because Obama they wouldn't even talk to him right they said we're very happy the way we are and that's that was that Obama just went away and then a with us I said look we want to talk I didn't hear from I said we want to talk I didn't hear third time I said as soon as I recall me back but\nI'm going to give you one more chance and said that's okay I'm going to tax the cars at twenty five percent coming in which is frankly more money right it's devastating to them but it's more money and they immediately after the plane and came over and talk to and now they want to make a deal I I don't know that we're going to make a deal with um I can tell you they want to sure but we're going to make it one way or the\nI've only counting of the great American thanks for listening to always expect to have on the president\nAnd a share his thoughts with you and uh I understand it's going to happen a more frequently or over the year twenty Nineteen and twenty twenty which I could not agree they imagine this country imagine some of the fallout and what about uh three weeks three weeks in a day or two\nIf the Democrats take the Senate\nOne consequence of that will be there would not be any federal judge has confirmed\nBy the U.S Senate\nBut so necessarily going to take the house I Do not believe that the polling was so wrong and twenty sixteen it was a joke and so if the house in the Senate stay in Republican hands good stuff this is just the beginning on the other hand\nA wise man told me in Washington that the first two years of the Trump presidency will be peaceful compared to the next two years at the Democrats take the house and or the Senate that what we're going through the past two years to fight coal and scream to move this country forward it\nWill stop completely and there'll be investigation upon investigation and no legislation it'll be think Trump at all costs saying the ss drunk and you know it and I know and so if you're in\nOne of those contested congressional districts whether it's California Texas Florida Ohio Colorado North Dakota wherever it is go out and vote Republican to keep the house in the hands\nOf ah the successor of Paul Ryan whoever it might be and especially if you're one of those five or six states that have a Senate race that is so competitive\nLike in Nevada or Arizona or North Dakota or Missouri even in Michigan Ohio Florida you've got to go out and vote imagine the world with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer completely in charge of the house in the Senate because at that point zero ... NATO will get done\nCNN and et cetera is then to destroy Kanye West mode because the most loyal voters in America are black voters for the Democratic party and\nWhen African Americans figure out what the Democratic Party historically has done to them and not for them hopefully the Democratic party ...\nThanks for listening and I think not I think having the president on is always a great joy also Bill O'Reilly the book is killing the ss and of course diamond in silk and I don't know how we equal or exceed this kind of show next Sunday night but the great American built Cunningham\nWill do my best thanks for listening tonight and fleas I'm going to urge you if you're in one of these contested house districts are one of these great Senate races please go out and vote to goes to the future of this country is a ... silk ... fly with you and the president says some [noise]\n\nMessage indeed ... burning your degree from one of the top business schools in the country might sound impossible to fit into your workload\nBut what if there were a business degree that further your career and give you access to world renowned faculty leaders and mentors all on your schedule one that open doors to some of the most influential CEOs tech companies law firms entrepreneur in thought leaders\nAnd what if you could earn that degree in his little less sixteen months one hundred percent on line\nTo find out more checks market to seven nine six four or five\n...

effort for himself\nFrom higher taxes to lower taxes for more regulations to fewer regulations this was the defining left versus the right from a stronger military to weaken military to courts making laws which is what the left loves that's why they were so upset with the Kavanaugh hearings\nThey want judges to make the laws to courts interpreting\nIt seems to me that we're fighting for the soul of our country and there are signs of could be getting much more confrontational\nFrom the ... fascist to black lives matter we're free speech for those who disagree with is in jeopardy there's no doubt in my mind that's what's going on by the way that was just such a battle Saturday between the conservative patriot prayer group and counter demonstrators from antifa\nSo that when they get they got into a bloody battle outside of popular bar where members on both sides used beer spray\nMy producer a terrific producer Brian what's beer spray I don't even know what they're so I guess you use it against bears I said beer spray but it's better spray or maybe ... you know these guys route the bar\nAnd ... the beach and that that's a great night police reported seeing both groups with hard knuckle gloves knives and firearms or what they've done in the march flash march for law and order in pi DX I think that's the name of the Portland\nOr even in the city of Portland was organized by patriot leader Joey Gibson or responds to Portland mayor Ted wheelers oversight of the city's police department you may remember he doesn't want the police department to do anything most of the time that's what's great part of the problem\nSo in my opinion is preventing them from doing their job I bet you if you interviewed the police they would say the same thing he just let us do our job we they cannot I Can't imagine that they like to see violence take place on either side but this is just one indication of how the nonviolent civil war he's turning violent\nAnd you're currently I Know you know as you certainly can't speak on college campuses without interruptions or the threat of violence if you're a conservative on college campuses that's not a problem for the left or liberal to speak\nWhere the you know if you remember the free exchange of ideas was supposed to be the role of the day if you look go to college campuses you'll often see that somewhere that they talk about truth and the exchange of ideas that's not taking place anymore\nAnd of course now you can't even go to a restaurant or have privacy in your home\nIf you're on the conservative side of an issue and the opposite side recognize you or knows where you live they were giving out one guy right he was arrested I think last week the giving of phone numbers of various senators and addresses and he did it on a government computer\nAnd just this past week the state Republican Party headquarters in New York was vandalized they smash windows and spray painted the doors with anarchy symbols\n... left behind in the building read that the attack was putting the Republican Party on notice mentioned as they continue this quote heart attack is merely a beginning we're not pass if we are not civil and we will not apologize uh-huh unquote\nBy the way it maybe they were following up on Hillary's remarks did you hear what she said this week where she said Democrats can't be civil with Republicans during Donald Trump's presence\nI Wonder what would have happened if she had one and Republicans said the same thing we certainly can't be civil until Hillary Clinton's term is over\nA ... of course get it if you wear a make America ... anywhere you're you're in danger you are in jeopardy I mean it's amazing what's going on out there you may be putting your life in danger and even putting a sign in your yard or on your car risks great property damage\nBut it may even be getting worse than that\nWould the shootings of congressmen so what was it about a year ago serious injuries the Steve ... ... who could have been murdered and of course on an order ... from the very beginning I forget which actress or singing or whatever was I don't fault those people there was a threat to blow up the White House or worse you know I remember that\nAnd Senator Rand Paul said recently he voiced fears about possible deadly force being used\nAnd who can say for sure that he's wrong you said it's it's gonna happen if this continues at something like that is going to happen the left and the Democrats and the media which kind of results seem like these days the means not supposed to be like that but it sure seems to me that they're on the left\nThey can't accept the fact that President Trump won\nThe resistance of you know that's what they call it started before he was even president and there may have been we're finding out now a soft coup against him to remove him from office\nMore and more information is coming out about that\nBut by the way we were not supposed to find out the information Hillary is supposed to win and Obama said she was going to win and there was no reason that you wouldn't when we went and found out about any of the stuff\nThat that makes me think like a banana republic\nBut there were those in this country they were ready to overthrow the will of the people in whatever fashion they could so in my opinion that was the beginning of the civil war may have started before that but that with what's been going on President Trump to overthrow sitting president to go against the will of the people\nJust because you don't like the results let's let first is right\nAnd it continues they have President Trump so much\nThat anything goes because they have truth on their side they can't imagine\nThis the shock them when I say it on other shows that there probably an equal number of people that were devastated by the election of President Obama I Do for many resistance but I got to be honest I I like to count the days out of this year's over you know all you have three more years left of him\nBut that I had never occurs to them because they're so arrogant to begin with\nSo why don't you tell me if you agree with me how bad things have gotten between the two sides in this country and do you think we're fighting for the soul of our country that there was such a thing as I Believe as American exceptionalism that is under attack\nAlong with our basic institutions free speech mountain that's under attack what we used to think of traditional marriage\nFrom individual rights the free market capitalism and these are all under attack and if I Am right what are you doing about the upcoming elections to make sure we don't lose the house\nWere impeachment hearings they said this now learn some of the other two by the way if you imagine who is gonna windy these committees like during the Adler Maxine Waters no she's going to the banking minute what you would do\nI Wonder what you're doing about making sure this doesn't happen impeachment hearings will likely began the day the Democrats are sworn it they're going to try to teach President Trump and they've got they've already said they're going to try to teach cabinet and you're going to have hearings for ever\nTell me what you think of what you're doing about this at eight six six Ninety red eye and this whole week I'm filling in on red eye radio but just a couple of more points to consider\nWhile you're calling and I want to add that the extreme hatred for President Trump is palpable you can feel it I Know Hillary was all set to be crowded and they were shocked by President Trump's win but the hatred for him knows no limits\nPart of it I'm sure is what they regard as his unsophisticated behavior in a good part of it is his personality which can easily alienate people I knowledge that use difficult sometimes especially with the things he says he often says things you should especially on Twitter\nAnd he picks fights where they should be not\nHe demeans the White House see I'm being honest by answering some of his outrageous critics\nAnd he's clearly incapable of accepting much of any criticism I get that oh a few of us are but the spy his personal short ... I think I better see the softly so some of those in the left don't have a breakdown\nOf the mayor breakdown judging from what is going on these days I think President Trump has done a great job as president\nThat's right I didn't even say a good job I said great job now you can disagree of me but then vote him out of office don't try to undo the election results those on my side didn't try to undo a modest when there was no such thing as resistance\nMake sure you guys on the other side you get the vote on on your side if we lose fairly we lose but don't set up ... and use the power of government to destroy your opponents this what happens in banana republics not the United states of America don't destroy what makes this country so unique in so exceptional\nSo I Want to know do you agree that there's a civil war going on in our country\nAre you prepared to fight back to save our country let me know what you think at eight six six Ninety read I I Am more ice are filling in on red eye radio and the guys will be back the next week so I'll be with you this Sunday through Thursday\nSo I said he's done a great job tell me if you agree with me and certainly call me if you disagree more gosh they're on radar raid [noise]\nEight six six months with Iran [noise] oh\nYou have driven over one million preventable accident free miles been registered and joined the million mile club on line at red eye radio show dot com\nRed eye radio in our sponsors support your safety on the highway\n\nAny given moment in America a baby's taking that academic mental milestone for too many ...

next Monday and we're taking your calls right now at eight six six Ninety red eye which in terms of digits eight six six nine I was seven thirty three thirty nine Robert in San Antonio you're on with mark Hi Robert\n... a good evening I Believe you're completely correct\nWhen you say that the left 'cause uh convince themselves they're good and the right as bad I Wonder when you can correct me if I'm wrong but I Wonder if the right uh you know sort of copying their civil war language can be dangerous I Know\nI'm twenty five and are just getting off the coast campus um the younger right we is a really um [noise]\nThey're they're in love with this idea of you know not your grand puppies GOP so they're they're really getting going along with the idea of punching back against the law but I Wonder if our energy should be more focused on convincing the left that it's not this um this good versus evil that they probably don't even they kind of a justified in their work\nYeah I don't think you can convince the hardcore left it there is no talking I mean you'll find out there maybe some independence you can reach maybe some of the Democrats I used to do a show in Los Angeles where I had two Democrats two Republicans on every week\nAnd those kinds of people you could convince in by the way this or you can almost distinguish the left from liberal liberal used to be like Alan Dershowitz where if you disagreed with people you know you followed it through the ideas and and the ballot box with the left or people like the antifa groups or where they won't even let you speak\nThat there's the new fascists even though the accuser enemies are being fascists so I don't think there's any talking to the left if that's what you meant\nBut I Do think there's a great middle that you might be able to reach and even some perhaps conservative Democrats are and that is true of our base to my best to the hardcore conservatives right wing conservative you're probably not going to change their minds\nWhat you try to do and the reason fashion people who are open to it have you met people at school that you can talk to as opposed to some you can't\n[noise] uh no no no not at all so you can't talk to them at all [laughter] oh no yeah no I like what you're saying yeah they\nCompletely censored who they want to um [noise] yes I I I get what you're saying\nYeah your your friends on your side\n[noise] [noise] yeah I mean the you know like a young Republicans group\nRight and it's you know there was a hundred and one [laughter] yeah how about your professors and teachers on campus and you don't have to say where you go\nYou know that it's a pretty it's pretty left leaning to you can't really get a word in and then when you do it just kind of like a ... a shame fest\nYeah pretty discouraging uh what's going on in the camps especially you can never hear conservative speaker they won't let them talk my right\nOh yeah no you're absolutely correct\nYeah so I think you have to join the organizations you do so you don't feel alone and try to work on people you can't how about your family out of the ... the ... did they think you're ...\nNo not at all your thankfully I grew up in the Christian household so clearly a pretty level headed\nYeah well I I Would suggest to you that you you know keep up a fight with people who are willing to listen and try to work on those people who might be persuaded by the fact many people don't know right they live their lives they work hard at their jobs and the you know they tune in occasionally maybe that's why the Kavanaugh
