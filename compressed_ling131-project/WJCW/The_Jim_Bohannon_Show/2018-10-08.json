thousand actual votes cast a Republican has an actual votes cast the machine's gonna say eleven hundred for the Democrat nine hundred hundred for the Republican it's programmed in advance\nAnd the

power\nWell it wasn't about helping out professor Ford who wanted to keep things private it was about using her to advance their political agenda and even a\nA Democrat to understand that Brett Kavanaugh academically and my character deserves to be on the Supreme Court said he had to come up with ... and keep repeating it through their megaphones the mainstream media to act as if there was a point to be made that Brett Kavanaugh might might have been a serial rapist\nWho spent time drugging young young girls and that was\nThe polar panic in in what they did it man\nBut it's unbelievable

Kavanaugh issue I I I Will say all but I Would guess that the vast majority of Democrats would be very happy to know\nConclusively that Brett Kavanaugh at salt at the swamp and that they would be very very disappointed\nGreat great to be with you and I have three things that I think we all my keep in mind as we go to the polls in November one is that just like you mentioned this woman who says that the junk care what happened she is glad she wrote Brett Kavanaugh's white wonderful what\nThe left and the Democrats have indeed done to others they tried to do to Brett Kavanaugh what they try to do to break capital they will try and do to us if they can the second thing is is that\nOver mine was entirely destructive behavior of attacking institutions people face people constructive\nIn ten of these things about our society\nIt really to me bill is nothing less than a continued some version of our nation beginning in the Nineteen twenties\nWith the communist and their attempt to undermine us from within and I don't think we see that but I think if we do a it will provide a great current tax for the situation that we're in your Catholic as my or are you aware of this terrible\nA present state of revelations in these sexual abusers and the official cover up that that was actually very much started by the communists\nWell wherever it was it's all those laws and we should be able to let me\nTell you this Joseph Stalin the mass murder and Soviet dictator\nWanted the church undermined from within the neutralize the cemeteries and to eliminate\nThe healing power of the church of the free and empower the church in this country a woman named ... died who was a member of the Communist Party starting in the Nineteen twenties the late twenties and for\nTwenty years I\nIntroduced into the seminary placed in the American Catholic seminary\nOne thousand one hundred men who were communists and or no overload faith or morals and according to the plot many who was a sexually did it once that was established then successive waves bought a more of these people and they work their way into the priesthood and ultimately into the heart or\nMom says if the devil themselves\nWant it to destroy the Roman Catholic faith he would have done exactly what many praised up and do in the past forty or fifty years and I want to get too deep into this but if the devil themselves want to destroy Catholicism the double could not done done a better job than what I see going on\nLet's continue not what Patricia and the great state of Florida Patricia go ahead you're on the bill

and the president has individuals like\nI Am Feinstein Nancy Pelosi Chuck Schumer and Dick Durbin to run against and Blumenthal of Connecticut the war hero isn't it wonderful to have someone like Elizabeth Warren to run against I mean you couldn't pick these caricatures any better\nThan ... you know I don't come in and got caught in the game and crack the demon rats\nAnd why they have mental problem and a lot of rain that they take their personal background and ...\nAnd that they can get anything anything they want to people and I don't really know what the went in I haven't minding my

the man he's on television radio and often on Fox News Newsmax etcetera the Reverend Jessie Molly Peterson welcome again in the bill Cunningham show Jessie how are you\nAll that well built thank you for having me are\nWell you have a column posted a couple of days ago about the Democratic plantation really is worse\nThan the plantation I grew up on what's what's happening in Chicago with conned McDonald what's happening to to Kanye West on the previous or Saturday Night live when he was he was blast famed bought backstage you're wearing a magma a mega ... make America great again hat\nAnd I guess the question is you and I've spoken out for years about the status of African Americans\nAnd uh and it concerns me greatly that things are getting better can you give me any advice and counsel\nWhether the urban activists committed to the Democratic party that's resulted in the failure of every institution in urban areas that they're going down in popularity and that your ideas I've taken hold can you give me any hope\nWhy I had I can tell you that there are a younger black Americans who are starting to catch on\nAverage specially now that President Trump is there a wet speaking now started to take a look for themselves\nAnd they are noticing that uh the Democrats have fell down for the last Fifteen Years and any where Democrats are in control it to get all violence and crime and abortion and everything is out of control\nThat was the incident in Chicago as you know they're having a car by violent orange everyday right yeah that was a young Fifteen year old black male\nThat the gangs had tried to recruit he refused to joy they put them in a fifty five gallon barrel earmark fire alive they burned alive\nAnd that happened two years ago not to have been done about that there is no outcry from their so called black leadership on like creatures\nThere's a a a ward off for the rest of the people who did that\nNo one has been caught because the mayor of Chicago on during the Iraq Obama won't do it but as a result of a Wes in President Trump's because now the blacks are starting to catch the thirty six percent\nApply for now supported accredited and we've not had that number four Republican and here's\nJessie theaters you said quote when I was a Democrat I blame the white people for all my weaknesses and failures I suffered forward it wasn't until I\nReally began to look at myself to understand if I'm black and a Democrat racism is holding me back why is it that is not holding back black people who were telling me that it is racism to married with kids going to good schools you say I realize I've been lied to by the Democrats\nIt wasn't about racism that why people are not holding me back and Democrats didn't care about me they were lying to me as long as you have fear you only gets worse\nAnd so I I don't sense it in the major ten or Fifteen urban areas which you can't find a Republican with a search warrant\nThere there's any movement toward free markets marriage a quarter boarding quite committing crime study\n... get good grades a business is flourishing it looks to me objectively like the forties fifties and sixties\nBlack businesses flourished and black areas there was a black doctor the black ... the black pharmacist there was a black lawyer there was ... pharmaceuticals stores there ever retail centers and after the riots in the sixties and seventies they're all burned out here in Cincinnati, Ohio we used to have a functioning\nAvondale in Evanston and and and rose lawn parts that had\nFor black areas but they were black middle class families were moms and dads went to work and children were educated in control I look where you live in Los Angeles Chicago right now\nThe complete collapse of the black family has happened\nAnd that is light at the doorstep of the\nPolitical decisions of the modern Democratic Party that they simply walk away from that you know the party of the clan the party of lynchings the party of Jim Crow that's the Democrats that the now the party a ... on the Democratic party look at what they're doing in the urban areas whether it's education or crime or job formation\nDo you have any sense now I guess we kind of began this by saying you have a sense just sit there in Los Angeles things are getting better\nYou know no matter of fact uh you know by the water the wicked witch of the west but like here\nShe is out there encouraging people to a cat or a or how far people in public that support the president why hurt districts are absolute ghettos bill\nWas there there over forty years a cargo warmer over those areas and I have to carry their catering danger zones and this woman would not do anything about it and she doesn't want anyone else to do it at the age to solve the problem\nAs a matter of fact ... be quiet him because he doesn't understand how he's in Florida the black people he doesn't she doesn't want him to think for themselves what they get old\nShe made a promise to black people that\nThe Republicans were trying to carry it on the project and ... and the ghetto right but she said I'm not gonna let Republicans do that and not all that are not going to let them get out of the projects I'm going to build more for you\nAnd making that kind of ... black voters district while she's living in a four point three million dollar homes suburbs she doesn't have to be concerned about the climate of violence that's happening in those areas\nHow is it possible that the worst place for an African American to live in America\nIsn't a black congressional district no matter where it is you take the twenty five or thirty blocks rational districts and it's the worst place for black folks to live anywhere in the country but there are so good at a voting responsibility\nFor the implementation and the results of their policies\nYeah there are so good at blaming everyone but themselves\n... will black folk ever look at themselves and say look at our status\nWhat do you have to lose whatever Logan themselves in Los Angeles Chicago Cincinnati New York and saying wait a minute we have lousy education systems we have no job creation wave rampant crime rampart abortion rapid welfare and the Democratic party's been here for fifty or sixty years\nVote for the Democrat but if you are free to your job you want to be said you'd better be kinda voted comes conservative Republican that kind of put country first and support the president who is doing at this point\nJesse ...

auto emission standards on a free flowing Internet\nBecause it makes sense to them clearly independence understand the presumption of innocence clearly they understand due\nProcess under the law the polls have showed that Democrats may they just wish to ignore it because what they want now is more important than anything it is about their day to day politics and so I think it's just important just a little nit picking their and then I Move on ...\nYou never happy with anything no men were maybe ... maybe we're a little bit more content\nBut we understand because we've been doing this for such a long time is just one battle and it's not over the next battles in a couple of weeks well it's a couple of things\nThe um the\nThe whole idea of of this there are two parts of this the political part of it and the question is is a greater moderator a greater motivator for the right or greater motivator for the Web or a greater motivator for the center\nYou know the left a you know says there are since Saturday evening while we're more motor ... motivated now well that's what the press will have you believe we'll see about that\nUm will look at early voter turnout as we always do but really even with the right I Know I Know the motivation on the right is there we know that\nSo that's not going to go away or the motivation in the middle that's the question that's where you win the election\nAnd so you look at the undecideds and how many of the key races right now are undecided\nOr have a great number of undecideds are certainly to the extent that they can throw that election one way or the other that grew going one way or the other end turnout is is is the key so beyond that the win at the highest court\nRemains to be seen\nBecause we have to go back to chief justice Roberts twice mhm rewriting Obamacare for the from the bench it is a victory in that the left did not get their way and their attempt to destroy the process I'm certainly\nThey\nThey distorted the process\nWill see what happens to it next time there is a a an opening on the high court and if this president is still president ah how that goes\nBut ultimately now you're going to have to wait and see what what Kavanaugh does on the bench what effect the ultimately has and that won't be seen for years and so the when there is that\nIt's an odds game as we have been saying for for many years going back to Andrew Breitbart ... and his comments to us during the twenty twelve race and talking about how important\nThe Supreme Court was when we asked the question why should we support or should conservative support a moderate like Romney at the time\nFor for president and his answer was SCOTUS Andrew Breitbart the answer was very clear and it is an odds game because you can support a John Roberts Neil Gorsuch or Brett Kavanaugh\nThen through all of it you still may not get those decisions you think you're going to get its always intriguing but sometimes it's disappointing and how they decide\nAnd we'll again we won't be able to see that effect or if that's going to happen uh for many years ultimately on the court there there will be cases where his decision will\nBe key in those cases but we'll see how he decides and and what his thinking is in those opinions as they come across right I mean if what what it's about ... if you look at his judicial history I Would say that\nAre most likely I'll agree with eighty percent of what he may be eighty five to Ninety I don't know that between eighty and Ninety percent all agree I'm a ... with him you know we we talk about a true construction of some and by the way when we talk about ... what was that the or\nWas it the location device or is it the location of ice on the cars\nAre about ... what was the case that everybody has a cell tower case was the ... there for everybody where everybody said we're we're especially the never Trump first came out and said she said oh you did you see he sided with all the liberals [noise] excuse me you didn't get your judge ...\nAnd then we had to point out as many other people did no uh actually on that particular case it was the liberals on the court uh and and the Gorsuch that actually used the Scalia ruling\nA you know Scalia was probably the ... the the most construction is judge of my lifetime paying attention to what the Supreme Court has a has a has has done\nClarence Thomas always is not always a construction is right\nClarence Thomas will a judge based on at times based on what he views as a conservative win for the day right that's not what I'm looking for I'm never looked for that I Want that's up to the legislature to decide to me is these are all constitutional issues I Want judges look at the constitution said doesn't say that\nNo well that's not up to me to put that in don't\nBend the constitution or straight from the constitution in order to fit your political agenda\nRight so I'd say ... I'd say if I look at a a a a Clarence Thomas he's probably ... or ... it was almost Ninety nine probably Ninety nine percent\nJust doing it off the top of my head Clarence Thomas probably somewhere between Ninety and Ninety five percent ... depending on depending on the year [laughter] yeah and and what I'm hoping is that you have a a you know you have a cabin on that uh would get to the Ninety percent level at least a for me on\nOn the on on the important cases I'll be very pleased if it's greater than that but again nobody expected Roberts to rewrite Obamacare\nRight do you ... and and then you look at some of his other cases you're like Oh absolutely right absolutely right absolutely right absolutely right so\nI'm a again this to me was about\nThe greatest thing that came out of this besides getting a ... Supreme Court justice that isn't a a roof gator ... Ruth Bader Ginsburg ...\nIs the fact that you and I talked about that the left has made it very clear what they want\nA but I don't think that the Republican Party a I think a lot of\nConservatives knew this was this was a a part of who they were I don't think a lot of the moderates in the Republican Party\nI thought they they were uh I I Will say some of the moderates that were never Trump or some of the conservatives that were never Trump voters\nBut to see it in action and to see\nThem look to see the debate points that they were bringing up to see what they want it done to see that they rejected\nThe mindset of due process the mindset of a a presumption of innocence this stereotyping but if they're\nConvenience all women are to believe unless you're deals those type of woman over there by the way to one of the stories I saw is that now Democrats are starting to blame white women for cabinet are being put in well wait a minute I thought women were always right\nRight and then I then they started a blaming even Eddie\nAnd the case if he well wait a minute thought the woman was women were always right right yeah yeah but that case had too many holes well that's the whole point that the\n... so now we're just in a comparison of holes in a case right you are stating that and so they're all over the place and when it comes down to is they're just trying to fit in argument to fit their narrative at the moment in order to get the judge in that will fulfill their liberal desires and a judge that will legislate\nFor them they're all over the place on their opinions as their opinions don't have their opinions on their goal post move all over the place right so to me it was the fact that you were able to see\nThe left and them and not just the far left\nWhat you saw because we normally get calls where people will say well that's not the mainstream of the Democratic party what you saw\nOver the last two weeks was the mainstream of the Democratic party in Washington DC the leadership of the Democratic party that reject due process under the law\nReject a presumption of innocence\nAnd we'll slander and defame somebody's character\nWithout evidence to do so yeah\nAnd I think a lot of I'll tell you I had a conversation with independent Bob yesterday boy he was renting he was burned in my ear\nAh because ah as you said you know and and I've talked about independent Bob for years and used to vote for Democrats he's sort of tell me how I can ever vote for democratic ... ever when I'm being told what white males thanks as always Ron and white men are always evil and women are always to be bullied because\nEverybody knows that's not true right but that's where they are so we'll get to that or by the way last year it was getting rid of the electoral college by the lab we told you the next thing would be getting rid of the Senate\nThey got there because of all this now ...

at conservative media and I'd just say stop it\nAnd whether it was the you know in a drudge you know we know he's conservative but you basically just list things but\nHe had the Taylor Swift story as the number one story half the day yesterday yeah and it's the number one story right now on Fox that nobody cares what she thinks no ... nobody cared opening Taylor Swift things why do the editors at Fox News\nBelieve that she deserves the Taylor Swift comes out and supportive tendency Democrats who cares oh ... before she said she won't speak on ... not ... who cares somebody cares nobody cares what she thinks\nThere's so many things that we can be doing as a as as as a media that are important and I'm not saying you don't put the you don't have the story somewhere ...\nYou know I guess you could you get your story but it's been the number one story now for a few hours studying there\nAs we go into a Monday with everything that's going on right right Taylor Swift as a story that they they put up there even though ... story and you know him supporting Donald Trump is a Side Story it's notable and the different because you have\nA mega hip hop star supporting Republican president who was hated by pretty much everybody else in his community and in in his profession so that's notable because\nIt's not what a what he respects unique it doesn't it news just things that are unique and different right\nAnd ... and the thing is is that ultimately\nThough the the endorsement doesn't really do anything now sometimes you'll see a you know these mega endorsements come on ah come on board for an Obama but that wasn't what\nGot Obama to the White House the endorsements don't do anything except show that those celebrities are getting on the bandwagon\nA most often but you're not it doesn't matter who the celebrity is that's not the influence with the with the people\nThat's not the the real influence with real Americans they really don't care what celebrities have the say politically unless those celebrities are getting involved in politics and they're going to run for office that's that's the difference\nI just just to that was just a side comment there'll be death I just saw it and would wind up sick okay let me when I woke up well you know it's funny when it when it when I went to sleep last night it was there when I when I woke up to come in the show was there and I'm like All right enough in our pre show meeting we were talking about it because\nSunday we always I always measure of the day by the number of\nOver the top breaking news headlines and sometimes it's breaking news on an event on something that happened uh and it's actual breaking news often it's breaking news breaking news Trump's tweets that no that's not breaking news\nThe ...\nThe number of stories on Sunday dwindled down to just nothing I mean it was it was really well it was down to Taylor Swift endorses Democrats\nThat's what it was down to because\nHere's what happened on Saturday you had your vote\nKavanaugh confirmed the left is going to wind about it they're going to whine about it a little more on Sunday Morning\nAnd then as we predicted or as we told
