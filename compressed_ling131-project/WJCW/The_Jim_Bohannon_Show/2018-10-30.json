going to see us in Italy or in some other part of the world\nThrough years down the road but if we played your town we've had that night with you so it's a time for us to reflect on some great times\nTo thank the people who made it possible and they get to do the same\nYeah there you go so they're going to be out of here three years from\nNow ah and then you know I mean one of the things was and there's a couple of things they talked about it you know first and foremost a lot of people asking the question of like All right so this is kids but are we going to get care\nLike eh\nYeah is it just basically you two guys\nWere not ruling anything up but don't could yourself we're not playing the game the people you're looking at right now or kiss\nIf you're the Yankees you can bring out somebody in panic oh hey great you know he was on the team a little while ago\nAnd you know recognize that fact and some ... or just as important at the outset of the band as Paul in ourselves but trust me and not everybody is designed to run the marathon you have a ... self respect and responsibility show up on time respect the fans\n[laughter] like that was a slide show up on time\nUser never on the look gene Simmons is one of those like he's a businessman first and foremost\nHe to him this was a ... him being a rock star is what he was he was a marketing business man and his\nWhich it if you will happen to be music and that's a lot of what does it and it was always the\nBusiness the the sex drugs and rock and roll and and all that stuff that came part of with it but the reality is for him this was a business and I have a feeling like you see this in a lot of bands right like burgers or feel like who were the two in in in the eagles was it Don fry and it was on hand lane Glenn fry\nYeah there were yeah they were the ones that it was like they were at and everybody else was secondary ... that was a very big thing you you know it's like you're part of a business and\nI think that people you know forget that and I think you know same thing that you look at the Beatles right like\nJohn Paul show it was I mean you do that Ringo\nThey're like wow we'll give them one so you can do every album that's it just because he's wearing only kinda like him and you know and and you look over and George is the best musician and it probably just playing the instruments but he's now we're ... outside of that like that is in the in the end it it's what it's about\nSo I think uh you know I look at it and I'm like oh and I but when I when I was talking to somebody they about gifts I said look do you think that it's rock and roll just happened to be his\nBusiness that's just how he would have been\nIf he could have he would have been a he would have been at you that if you ask them to have you been a rock and roll or and then they should do or would you rather managed a large hedge fund\nHe might have said large hedge fund he likes business and his which just happened to be

Pittsburgh\nCaesar saying Oakland before a judge today in Miami after his arrest for mailing pipe bombs to top Democrats and CNN defense attorney Cheney Benjamin reacted to reports that say I had a hit list of more than one hundred people\nYou're you're absolutely right Jim in this regard look there there's a couple of things let's take the nature of the particular institution in this case the synagogue and and there's characteristics that whether it's at temple whether it's at church whether it's a mosque\nBy its very nature it's a sanctuary it's a welcoming place it's a place where people go to worship it's a place where people go to find comfort in solitude\nThe very design of the building and the structure of it's a building is meant to accommodate that the openness the welcoming as the open space in which you can have fellowship\nIn this particular instance it though as we saw a both in Pittsburgh and we saw 'em down in Texas uh last year is that an attacker is going to exploit the very features of those buildings that exist you know a central walkway a main door a Congress\nIt's all in one area present targets of opportunity in large numbers to your point\nListen we have thousands of religious institutions in this country ... ... you know from a national cathedral ... to to a variety of lesser known you know church mosques temples et cetera\nAnd the reality is is that none of them were built specifically with physical security features in mind and unless you design build that from the ground up you're not going to have the protection that you really need the heart in these target and equally to your point\nThere is money behind here you know it it costs money to ask a small congregation regardless of the ... nomination or face to to pay for security and like anything after a while it's kind of like your your fire insurance you say well I got it but I'm not having a fight or do I really needed\nA and eventually we're going to say do I need the security and when you're when you're balance between trying to raise funds to do social work or or works for outreach through your particular ministry ... versus an armed guard you've got to make some real tough business decisions\nFor those who are starting from scratch building a religious or building a school a shopping center a an office building whatever even a home for those starting from scratch should they planted them the cost of additional security\nAt ... absolutely look a gym in this day and age um you know we've seen it that it's this is a reflection of the times we live in we can uh pine all day long about how we got here or not but the reality is is that we're in these times\nAnd the design build from the ground up both from a practical and cost standpoint to factor\nIn security features from a range of particular threats is a it's a smart way to do business it's a proven way to do business it's an effective way to do business\nThat'll return many times over whether it serves as a deterrent because the feature is hard enough\nTo deter an aggressor or whether it serves to mitigate the events of an attack or both are reasons to do it from the ground up but but I Would say this also even if you're not in there isn't an opportunity of a design build\nThere are still physical security manager matters or or measures I should say rather that you still can't take to harden it but to your point\nParticularly in public space gatherings or whether it's a government facility or a meeting venue like we saw out in in Las Vegas\nUm or or a religious ... building in security features heartening that facility from the onset is the recommended approach\nOne eight six six five oh jumbo is our number one eight six six five oh five or six to six we'd like your thoughts how you feel about this whole notion of going to hyper security\n... and something that we must keep in mind of course in all honesty bruised and we talk about this increasing security even if you you go to a tremendous linked almost the ridiculous links there are no guarantees here that you are doing is making it less likely only\nYou're you're absolutely right Jim ... what what you're doing is you're you're got one or two frankly a response is on the spectrum if you will at one end you're you're it's a deterrent at the other end you're mitigating the results or the impact if you will of any such attack and to your point\nYou know the story I like to use is is um Hank Lee with President Reagan you know the United states president is arguably one of the most protected individuals in the world very robust security you know basically the resources of the entire nation\nWhen to protecting the president yet here's an individual as a tournament individual with a revolver\nManaged to penetrate many you know that those levels of security and still prove their point to the other end is is this even with an armed guard\nYou know it only takes his German attack or time enough to figure out what is it I've got to overcome and build an attack plan that seeks to overcome whatever security measure you have there so you're again you're you're spot on there is no panacea for this\nAh and then at some point in time we also defeat the purpose of what these institutions are intended to do\nThat you know we can harden that facility down so much so that nobody can get in and nobody could get out and ... would defeat the purpose of what is there for an end to what end we we'd be right back to where we started from\nOne of these six six five oh jumbo one eight six six five oh five or six to six I guess Bruce Alexander the president of security one solutions David and crushed than Iowa joins was hello David\nBut your wall and worrying about or you know a ... or ... ... s\nA I think for all this stuff ... family values on the hill for a large in the country a lot of them and also uh I like to say that there that\nI don't know how we could probably approach this other than that have the public when they hear about people like this either give 'em a reward or I don't know whatever you know we'll get a tip of liberty is low but\nA weird and acting kind of gray like they're talking about I hate this light that you know it it probably\nBut there are local and you know at least have a name you know what I'm saying to tell you what might be familiar to debate or a look bad or you know checked out a little bit more sharply or watch\nAbsolutely are excellent points it even further than the than what a a David is is talking about even or even further than that would I think it'd probably be the question of frankly Bruce of of whether or not we need to change our laws\nIn a such a way that some kind of preemptive action as possible recognizing full well that this opens the door to a lot of potential abuses would have to be a very carefully worded law at a very carefully enforce law but nonetheless\nOr in the case with some of these back to the case of the last two situations like the uh a pipe bomb Baylor in Florida and the shooter in Pittsburgh we're talking about people with a serious history of ah letting in the world do what they thought\nAnd and I'm not sure that the public isn't going to demand that we do something preemptive\nGym you know I I don't I think we've got some options are already available without even needing to change or to look at changing the laws and and I don't dispute that but you know to your point and data David is that if\nLook at many of these instances somebody knows something someone always know something\nWhat what the issue is is that having ineffective reporting mechanism that protects anonymity if you will but facilitates coming forward with information no matter how innocuous but that information once it's been received after all\nHas to be treated like a piece of intelligence from the perspective that it's got to be completely process has got to be analyzed disseminate it's got to be evaluated it's got to be investigated you know the NYPD has got their very famous ... see something say something you know I think that without changing our laws it's something that we ought to all be encouraged to do\nA oftentimes people see things they have indicators they had nuggets of information and we do want to do things we dismiss it out of hand and say oh now that's nothing you know that can't possibly be because we approach it from our own optic of logic\nBut to someone who is carrying out these acts you've got to sort of look at it from the illogical perspective on his face and so\nA David's right we've got to have some mechanism to encourage people to come forward um freely and also without fear fear of retribution fear of perhaps some of the other ... overlays that do exist that might preclude or prohibit ah people from sharing information voluntarily the last point I'd say is is\nThis has got to be a community effort\nIt's got to be a stakeholder community effort we're not going to solve this just at the point of a of a pistol you know when we're not going to be able to show gun face to everybody or in terms to deter this\nA what we really want to do is to identify these threats\nAs far away from ... in this case let's say the synagogue door so that we can enter Dick Dennis ... start to target collect on these types of individuals and or the threats sources so that we can stop this before it gets to the door of the synagogue before it gets to the door\nOf the school as well but that's not just the law enforcement that's that's the community\nAny given moment in America a baby is taking effect that\nAcademic mental milestone for too many of the things that I talked to my town and there are these parents babies who were born\nPrematurely or we think it's a

six five oh jumbo with eight six six five oh five four six to six our next guest repeat guest always welcome back\nOne of the most celebrated and a\nSuccessful attorneys in America the full professor at Harvard law school history is now the feelings Frank ... professor of law emeritus Alan Dershowitz joins us this evening by the way you can follow him on Twitter at ... ... that's A. L. A. N. D. E. R. S. H. a good evening Alan\nHi how are you I'm a troubled\nFrom time to time I have in my life for deluded myself into the notion that we were getting the sort of thing under control I Would still I think a cling to the view that probably anti Semitism isn't as bad as it once was but it certainly has disappeared has a\nNo but it really is a lot better than it was when I graduated law school first in my class ... editor in chief of the yellow a journal about to be a Supreme Court law clerk I was turned down by thirty two at a thirty to Wall Street firms and it wasn't only because I didn't dress well\nThey would just not hiring Jews in those days they also weren't hiring ethnic Catholics Irish kids tally in kids they certainly weren't hiring gays and women\nBut a discrimination against Jews was rampant we also knew he couldn't work in certain industries we couldn't live in certain areas and that kind of social anti Semitism is now\nOver religious anti Semitism for the most part is over or the various a\nProtestant and Catholic churches have rejected it it's still exists with in some in the moslem community and some moms preach\nAnti Semitism both in this country and ... around the world but we're we're seeing increases is in in really three areas one and the most important one and the one that's never mentioned is on university campuses uh among the hard way\nAnd that's the most dangerous more dangerous than the hard right let me tell you what hard left our future leaders of the students on university campuses and the faculty demonized Jews people at Hunter College to yell and scream Zionists are not welcome here by which may mean Jews\nComplaining about the design is president of the university we don't even know what the sheet sports Israel just happens to be Jewish so what's going on in university campuses with a hard life\nIs extraordinarily dangerous 'cause it's teaching the future leaders the heart right is very dangerous to as evidenced by these two horrible events or the shooting in Pittsburgh and the the pipe arms um and um then we're still seeing tremendous amount of Islamic anti Semitism\nMore in Europe than in the United states but someone in the United states as well\nSix six five oh jumbo is our number one eight six six five oh five four six to ... what is our guest of the jumbo had a Joe and pat calls in from northern Michigan good evening pat\n... or ... um well I was talking to your your call screener gather you bought a totally different subject that you were on last half hour but rather I was a bouncing ball um I guess\nMy my question would be to your guest ... back\nI don't know a couple of thousand years ago the uh the Islamic community and the Jewish community which has always been migrant because of their land problem back in the day live in peace ever just gone up people in the book\nThey weren't a threatened they weren't or as they were assigned their own section of town but\nYou know that this whole thing didn't exist\nDo considerably spending that's true you go back of course the Islamic community only goes back to the the seventh century uh and they they certainly spread or shall I say at the point of the sword but there were periods of greater uh uh shall we say a coexistence what their Allen\nYeah there was a golden age are in North Africa particularly where Jews and Muslims or work together and of course Jews and Muslims were victims together at the crusades which was a\nA Christian I'm bigoted attempt to murder a disc believers Jews and Muslims who lived in in Jerusalem so we've had these problems throughout history and it varies from time to time I looked at one another group that's very important and that's a very dangerous\nAnd that is followers of the Reverend Lewis spare time\nOh who's ... hater of vicious anti Semite anti gay anti women\nAre but he predominantly focuses on the Jewish religion and what she calls gutter religion he admires Hitler and he has hundreds of thousands of followers and the thing that's so disturbing events Eric on is that people like Bill Clinton were willing to sit next to him at a retail Frankel\nI'm a funeral and that a bronco bomber was willing to meet with him and joined in his million Man March and that Keith Ellison number two made a Democratic Party worked with him and you know when he made his horrible statements recently\nUh comparing Jews to termites you didn't see very much condemnation from people on the left Democrats on the left certainly not from political figures 'cause they know that a fair ... supporters\nAre important part of the African American community in some inner city areas\nAnd you just can't allow any group to get a pass on anti Semitism\nUm whether they're black or white or or Muslim and I I've been very disappointed at the way a democratic leaders have remain silent in the face a ferret cons complicity to her credit Chelsea Clinton was one of the few people\nWho really came out and attacked him and deservedly so but we haven't heard enough of\nThat yeah I I just don't understand the mentality is at stake here you you you think sometimes I guess listening to people like this that Farrah Khan\nA being a person of color is a is immune from criticism from the left of being a moslem which is ended up itself rather odd given me the views that he expresses and some of the middle east express from that point of view of that faith of people who live the Islamic faith should be put to death that women are property and the like\nBut the part I Would think I guess for the left would would come in to criticize it would be the uh the anti gay views that he expresses does the left to ever have any principles left at all\nWell there are some on the left who don't have any principles that many of course you do have principles and there are some on the extreme right or don't have principles look when events like Pittsburgh occur the first instinct\nFor parties and politicians is to try to get some partisan advantage from it people jump on it immediately and blame their political opponents and you know I think we have to\nFocus on the fact that we've had these kinds of shootings 'em all over the world from many many years now and your earlier guest made some very important points about our targets and all that\nYou know in Israel when new synagogues or a new public buildings are built they built by security experts\nAnd they're built with security in mind it's harder to do that to old buildings\nBut today in Europe you can't go to a synagogue um without going through multiple ... metal detectors I went to a synagogue in Madrid a couple of years ago you couldn't go unless you a made an appointment in advance went to the synagogue the day before showed your passport had attract\nThen you had an appointment as to when you could come I wanted nine thirty in the morning and my wife and I were allowed in and we when we try to leave a little early is not you know I don't usually stay for the whole service um they wouldn't let us\nThey said number no once you're in the building you have to stay and then when we left they made us leave two at a time and walk into different directions so you know synagogues or targets mostly Islamic terrorists all over Europe and now of course there are a target of these kinds of ah

course the terrible events of recent days most notably the eleven people murdered in Pittsburgh\nBut a similar such activities in the goodness knows we we followed them all on this program Tulsa as uh the the side of this call from a John denied the good evening a John welcome\n[laughter] I Love listening to both of you at all and may God just keep you healthy and mail you a link and speaking out\nI just I absolutely love it and you know and I would just say that I Would just say this I\nThe school thing is very important concept to be talking about because it we remember Iran and the seventies\nAnd they were the ones that took the hostages were school students supported by the ayatollah and so on and so forth that Iran is the biggest threat that that that the Jewish people have it it's it's just a it's a given and what I wanted to say tonight is I I really feel like what\nEating this narrative but I think Mr Dershowitz is gonna is gonna be more and more Republican every day because we have a president that sets up at the oval office that absolutely is a supporter of the Jewish nation\nThey call him a race that they make it seem like he is anti Semitic and anti black and anti everything else\nBut he is doing more for nationalities all over this country and for a belief system that the Christianity and up the Jewish faith that he is doing more for us that any president I have seen in my lifetime and all that I Would well I\nGuess I guess respond to you a job that you're going to see our changing party registration anytime soon\n[laughter] it may happen at some point if the Democratic party abandons me and leaves me I'm not going to leap Democratic Party I completely agree with you there isn't an ounce of anti Semitism in\nIn Donald Trump there never was even before he was a grandfather to Jewish kids and a father in law to a Jewish a a son in law in it and and the father of a Jewish daughter\nEven before that there was never an ounce of anti Semitism that was always a bum rap\nUm you know he has a he has strong use uh I went to Israel to be there when the embassy was moved from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem I thought that was a great day and it was very important that he undo rock Obama did in the last month a lame duck\nAnd he declared the western wall the holiest site of Judaism to be illegally occupied territory\nIn the Hebrew University in the hospital the Jewish quarter all to be illegally occupied territory that change the status quo and made it much harder for there to be a negotiated peace and uh when he recognized and move the embassy that restored the status quo that there was a great movie I think many of the city Arab countries\nNow support that at least they don't openly oppose it\nAnd so he's done some very very good things do I agree with this policy on immigration now I don't I think separation of families is a terrible thing and I think some of the language they use is a is is unacceptable and so I'm not surprised that I have mixed views of our president\nThe way I'd mixed views of every previous president I don't think there's ever been a president in my lifetime that I've approved of completely but with President Trump\nThe extreme views or so\nPolitical that when I have done anything to defend his basic rights is basic right not to be charged as a criminal for exercising his constitutional authority I have been so ostracized by people of the left on Martha's Vineyard and elsewhere they simply wouldn't talk to me\nUh they demanded that people giving advance warning if I was at an event so they wouldn't show up\nIt was so personal um and I've never experienced that in my six years of public light\nBut the thirty seconds to go here are are we going to see an attorney here a light at the end of the

that doesn't mean that that I frankly as far as I'm concerned that should give people a pause to to just crawl up in a corner and I'll just say at the way I see it sucked their thumbs I mean yes I

related activities or things like shutting down for example free speech on college campuses\nThings like groups calling themselves antifa are using fascist tactics of intimidation and vandalism those are very serious things and those indeed uh uh can sometimes make me loosely but\nThe general level of political rhetoric while not\nWhat I Would prefer I don't think is a basis for nail biting

high in our country and for others it's not so much at ... or worry or anxiety\nAnger and they're looking for an opportunity to express their views I think so often what happens chance is that when

frankly in my view a total cop out we're talking I think in many cases you're about spoiled children\nWho lash out like spoiled children and who in some cases\nAre have anxiety because they simply

dropping\nNearly half of us think the other political party isn't just wrong they're evil we're the richest country in history but we've never been more pessimistic\nWhat is causing the despair Nebraska Senator Ben Sasse believes he knows he has written the book them published by St Martin's press subtitled why we hate each other and how to heal who are them senator\nOr in our political tribes which are ramping uh they're pretty much everybody that's not consuming those same narrow a political outrage channel you are but it got you Jim but whoever is in the in the tribe of media consumption of that moment but what's weird about these political tribes\nIs that they're really not the core problem there a vacuum filler I think I think we're going through a strange moment where the digital revolution which is a fascinating thing economically but culturally is a lot more mixed and complicated\nThe digital revolution we're going through as undermining place and it turns out places were almost all people derive their real happiness\nSo in other words the place I gather you mean geographic place\nYeah so I mean there's the social science literature on happiness is actually remarkably clear over the last decade or so and it says things that probably most whites humans who have grandparents\nThat believe through almost all of human history which is there's a limited number of things that determine whether or not you're happy you have a nuclear family do you have a couple of deep friendships idea of meaningful work do you have shared location do you have co workers and number forty you have a theological or philosophical world view to make sense of death and suffering you have a local worship at community\nFamily friends work and theology a religion those are basically the for drivers of whether or not people are happy and they're all highly connected with rooted in the actual place where humans with bodies can give each other hugs and help each other up when they fall down and pull on orders in the same direction\nAnd what's happening in our ... that is there's this great tension between rudeness and ruthlessness rooted in this is what makes us happy and yet the technology that we get a consume now that is making us the richest people in all of human history is\nConstantly whispering to us that we can be ruthless we don't need to be anchored in any one place we can let our identity in our consciousness and our tribes be these really distant things what turns out being aligned with people emotionally on social media 'cause you support the same politicians\nDoesn't actually give people much of a sense of community it really is just a sense that the enemy of my enemy could at least pretend to me that it will be my friend but it doesn't really give you any comfort when they're getting older\nNow as we speak I'm about to go back to my old hometown of Lebanon, Missouri love the town I Love the people who gave me a great start in life most of the good things that I Am today\nAre up due to that town and my parents of course in particular but but the scout leaders of the church leaders and the teachers in the schools all of that I left there uh after high school I've never been back except to visit\nA I feel a sense of connection but it's a it's tenuous I also feel a sense of connection with the other communities are my broadcasting community and the like and I certainly have not found any of these different if you will competitors for my allegiance\nAre uh are evil or in competition with one another I'm not sure that I mean I recognized in other words my life has has them and us in it\nBut but it is not like the people on the other side of the divide or by mortal enemy\nGood Anya right I mean that's that's a healthy way to live um what's different in our time though is we have statistically an epidemic of loneliness where we have half as many friendships in America today as twenty seven years ago so I graduate high school in Nineteen Ninety\nA town called Fremont, Nebraska pretty similar to Lebanon, Missouri I suspect and in Nineteen Ninety the average American statistically had replied to rent\nAverage American today statistically has one point eight Pratt half as many\nThe nuclear family is in statistical collapse at America lots of the things you started with with the deaths of despair\nA from the fact that we're gonna have the third consecutive year of declining life expectancy a lot of this is about the standing of local tribes a lot of times in the in the media and\nThe national conversation or pundit tree we talked about the word tribe like it's always bad clearly the political tribalism at our moment is bad this tripling of the sense that people that don't new politics of the way I Do I'm supposed to think of that is not just confused or people to be persuaded but as evil but that that kind of tribalism politically\nOr leads us to forget that the word tribe is often a really great thing when you think of your family and your brothers and sisters and their cousins as a part of your child when you think of your friends as people that you're going to keep over the course of life despite the fact\nThat you might have a dispute about something tomorrow friendship isn't transactional that decline of local thick normal natural traditional tribes\nIs happening at a pretty great statistical pretty horrible but pretty a meaningful statistical rate right now that what we see is a decline of association all neighborly America Robert Putnam uh the\nPolitical scientist and sociologist at Harvard has done a bunch of work on things like the Bowling Alone phenomenon that he discovered Twenty years ago\nWhere more Americans are bowling or were in the data that at any point in us history and yet bowling league memberships where at their lowest little leagues are declining at across America the Rotary Club is declining across America\nThere's much less participation in a sense\nWe locally where most people live and so then when that subset of us that fleet of politics as the way to fill that void\nI Try to find out why there is a great meeting there there's a lot more U.S and them a lot more them frankly\nA and very little we but when you say that isn't your experience then you're a part of that healthy chunk of America that is seeing that atrophy of of neighborhood and association and deep friendship and then it allows us to go in and gauge of politics at a meaningful way where we tried to do stuff like get a cost effective infrastructure belt on\nBut not try to fight and grand meaning and Republican versus Democrat\nMost political power most political leaders in America are interesting enough to project your grand hopes and dreams ought to\nWell probably not do and although I ... my own experiences have not been quite so ah so dire but I I Know that they are for for many others out there and it sounds as though you are suggesting senator that Facebook friends are not actually a substitute\nYeah there's tons of data which shows that so if you go for the two hundred five hundred social media friends if\nYou go from five hundred to a thousand social media friends you don't actually get any happier at a certain point actually more social media friends was correlated with declining happiness but there is a lot of evidence which suggests if you know the person who lives two doors away from you and your neighborhood you're gonna be happier and more time spent consuming social media\nActually displaces real human friendships so what we have happening is not a use of social media to augment the good relationships we have you can use it that way that's why I still use social media is because I Want to use it to keep up with\nYou know my college buddies and and group X y and Z a across my life work job change let us to move\nA it's an easy way to communicate with people on the Fremont wrestling club or by my son wrestles a there's all sorts of ways that social media can be used to augment relationships but what it usually is doing is supplanting physical relationships and then it's correlated with declining happiness\nThe average American is now checking our iPhone every four but it's a four point three minutes per American adult check on their phones and usually what that's doing is displacing relationships and people and ... that are right in front of you with sort of a ways to\nRage and grieve and worry about things that are far away from you that you can't do much about and we move for being active at a local community to being passive at a digital community at a lot of that loneliness spills out as rage and it's one of the reasons that our politics looks so deformed and the present moment\nWe'll continue our conversation with the rascals Senator Ben Sasse the author of them in just a moment\nIf you over ten thousand dollars in taxes or have an file tax returns we can help you take back control like holding the experts at tax mediation service\nBecause kids are really not the center of what my calling it investments are in life and so we also practice a digital fast or one day a week at our house we lock up our phones on Sundays and people need to go get more\nIn the summer for a week so the kids that that experience of being totally disconnected this is all a shorthand way of saying we're gonna have to figure out how to navigate this technological revolution to figure out how when rooted in this matters and ruthlessness as our temptation how do we become sure that we use the tools as servants loss\nRather than us as servants of the tools they are also things we need to do about figuring out what recovering a sense of American that says which means we need to assimilate a new folks that are into the country and we Americans need to get\nBetter at remembering principle pluralism which is a way of saying I'm I Believe a lot of things that are way more important than my politics\nBut in my politics I Want to have a common deal with people even that I disagree with about about legislation for instance or about economics and culture I Want us to have a shared sense that America is a place\nWhere everybody wants the government to be merely a framework for ordered liberty so the the communities of love and affection and persuasion and volunteerism and entrepreneurship where people actually raised and they're raising their kids and and getting to know and love and serve their neighbors those places that need to flower government is a framework for ordered liberty government is not the purpose of life\nAnd right now we have too many people who are addicted to politics and they're crowding out the local\nSenator Ben Sasse of Nebraska the book

about a paragraph for me\nAnd he said he kept going and my nephew couldn't he couldn't get it only got about a paragraph or two and he goes that's all I Need and so he went to the party walked through

terms is it just me mhm pre show meeting you and I said the sort of the same thing it's really quiet\nFor a long term election with everything that's when ... ... maybe it isn't quite maybe it's just with the you know the ... from cabin on everything else the caravan and everything else has happened it's just maybe just a temporary low for a day or just like it's quiet yeah yeah I mean I\nI think right now especially with the house seats you're seeing so much concentration in those districts are right now because the Republicans are just you know doing everything to hold on still the chances the odds are against that the Republicans would maintain the house but if\nA ... again the momentum has shifted and there's some things that we haven't seen in polls we we mentioned this earlier and at the end of last week and yesterday we mentioned it and at the end of last week as well you know there are only a few polls the pollsters aren't as active in the house races so I you know there's there's a lot of stuff we don't know\nUm could this be another Nineteen Ninety four or\nIs a Nate Silver right\nYou know is it is a is it pretty much a given that the Democrats are going to take the house we don't know but a next Tuesday will be a very interesting day\nWell I mean has said is it to the point\nOf the the ... the one woman or was it on on CNN who said that I Believe it was CNN ... who said that ah you know a\nTrump has radicalized more people than an ISIS yeah right yeah now she apologized later on it's ridiculous that has a GQ call them yeah yeah\nUh she was on CNN the the lead to Julie of law he is apologizing after claiming President Trump has radicalized so many people are so many more people than ISIS ever did ... why did she apologized she meant\nIt she meant it when she said I'm guessing she thought of saying it before she said it and uh and thought that was a good idea and and believed it and still believes it\n\nAnd you just wonder does this help motivate the Republican\nBase when they just keep and being\nYou know it up and we spend a lot of the show yesterday on the\nOn the political divide to go back and forth between the tweets and\nYou know who's to blame for it is a ... in in our opinion just useless discussion to have ... uh it's you know the person that did it we're not going to stop the heated rhetoric is not going to stop it has never stopped in the United states from the beginning\nThe insults are still the same remember we what we forget is social media amplifies\nYou know the the\nCrude and and and rude and\nOf whatever you want to ... of a call them you know a\nPolitical outrageous and provocative statements are and so everybody gets their turn to do it so it may seem like it's more\nBut the fact is politicians used to ... they used to show that each other when it got to the point of personal insults\nWe get to this thing again where well you know we're doing things that have never happened before\nPoliticians aren't doing bills\nAs far as we know why I mean we're not paying attention to every house race in you know now it it could be happening somewhere I'm thinking the viewership for sports is down\nAnd so that might be an idea from\nBattle of the network politicians take ten steps towards turn around but\nIt would be more and it obviously we don't want anybody to actually get hurt but what about tasers\nI don't have a paint balls [laughter]\nWell no but the taser has the thing you know where you're on the ground for a minute\n[laughter]\nI rounded look we might not want to jeopardize your or not I'm just asking a question what does your politicians rising and I I'm just I'm just [laughter]\nWhat\nEight now and it gets to the ... a social media has amplified a everything\nWhat you think politics was clean back in the Eighteen hundreds no oh no it's just we didn't have the media where everybody could get their two cents in we didn't have and as you know you and I've talked about with Twitter\nWhenever I decided to go on social media I have to go with the attitude that this is for entertainment purposes only mhm you can't take it seriously because you have a ton of nut cases out there and a ton of those not cases are in the media\nYeah and so you go in ... you're not going to have an intellectual discussion you know days like yesterday\n\nI Will admit at times I have to [laughter] hold back on the frustration as to where the narrative\nIs going because I Know when you when I really like to talk\nAbout we really like to talk about the\nUh we love to talk about policy we love to talk about issues we love to talk about economics those are the things that really really drive us those are the passions that we have because we we understand we believe that that's what will make the country great or not great\nMhm and it has gotten harder from\nThirty years ago until now when I started to get to that point you and I are determined that is what we're going to do not that we're going to ignore or anything else\nBut you and I've had this discussion we're going to you know we we want to make sure that you know that's what we love doing we're not going to get down into the sewers everybody does it or not everybody but a significant portion of the media does each and every day and it gets to be ridiculous and it gets to be childish\nWell it doesn't serve any purpose really no it doesn't um and and that's that's the the um at times it can\nUsing but but but frankly it's it's useless altogether\nFriend is a ...
