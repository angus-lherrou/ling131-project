to the bill Cunningham show Corey how are you I'm doing great though how are you today doing\nWell you know about a week ago I spent some time with the president a privately it was wonderful you spent like a hundreds or thousands of hours with the guy and I said on the air the other day that uh\nThere there's a differential between what I see in the media sometimes with the president and how he truly is before we get on to so many issues going on especially the mobs versus jobs and all that kind of stuff the idea of the American people a measure of the man himself [noise]\nWell yeah I've spent so much time with a then candidate Trump and now President Trump and a truly cares about other people he's extremely\nMagnanimous and private he is funny he's gracious he's always asking about how my family is doing and what he can do to help me\nThat just who he is and if you listen to the media you know they tell you is the worst human being on the planet help but the truth is he's exceptionally gracious I've seen in so many times helping people that never get the story told because he doesn't want the story told but he's always there to help whenever he can\nWhat why is that because the media ought to be calling balls and strikes you know they ought to be saying well this is what's going right this is what's going wrong media ... Research Center bows out a ... one of my buddies\n... every few months as the media coverage is Ninety two percent negative Ninety five percent negative the media is protected by the U.S constitution only business in America that gets constitutional protection the media should call balls and strikes a lot of good stuff a lot of bad stuff why does the media only report the bad enough that good [noise]\nWhat are they only report the bad and this administration the Obama administration you would think\nThat our economy is growing at four percent and we had more Americans working any other time in our nation's history it conflated those to see the Trump agenda is not what the mainstream media wants to talk about\nI here's a great example just last week I think it was a President Trump did an interview with least offer sixty minutes she interrupted him sixty five times during that interview to put that in comparison\nWhen sixty minutes during an interview with bronco bomb or a couple of years ago they interrupted him more times and they have their own agenda their agenda is to make the president look bad\nNot to give him credit that he deserves for the successes that he's had because they're no longer in the business of reporting the news they're now in the business of making the news and that the big change over the last two decades\nCorey Lewandowski the president or the other night in Montana friend it as mobs versus jobs the only difference is the image of Jay and I think that's ...\nYou know on his part because one look at Brett Kavanaugh along about a trucks that have a Trump sticker on getting burned I look at congressman getting shot I look at the Republican congressman Republican operatives getting beat up and getting stuck in the side with pen\nI look at how you're confronted in airports in restaurants mobs versus jobs and do you think the average American I think forty percent of what the president forty percent oppose him there's twenty percent going back and forth do you think that that that moniker of the president mobs versus jobs is going to stick\nA crime I think it will stick because look the American people see and hear what people like Eric Holder had to say very recently when they're down we kick them and we kick them in the head you know the the cost of violence by the leaders of the Democratic party whether it's a Maxine Waters or other is saying if you\nSee them in a gas station if you see them in a restaurant you go after them you don't give them a break you know that's not\nThe way our country is supposed to be and I didn't support proper Obama but never ever ever did I ever remember Republicans or conservatives for that matter going after members of the previous administration when they're eating dinner at a restaurant we've now seen it with Sarah Huckabee Sanders he was secretary Nielsen ... we've seen with Senator Ted Cruz\nWe've seen what happened to Congressman Steve ... where he almost lost his life because the mob violence say antifa is so out of control here and there you go on their desire is destruction it's not to make our country better this president has created I think\nOver for a million new jobs in the last Twenty one months and that's where we should be doing look even if you don't want\nThis president if he didn't want him to succeed you want him to succeed because you want our country and succeed and that's what the differences that Democrats I hate to say this they hate this president more than they love their country\nOr the other issue the cultural late in his acceptable didn't mean to fame and to make fun of and dismay or the president and the first lady\nYou may recall about a week ago TI who's a rapper that I Will watch nonetheless I saw it and TMZ and I did a video in which a look alike millennia Trump\nWas stripping nude in the oval office performing sex acts in the oval office and it was culturally acceptable to do that I'm sure he might sell a lot of lot of his songs and records from that can you imagine three years ago if a country artist\nHad depicted Michelle Obama stripping naked in the oval office and performing sex acts in the oval office what was the outcry from the media have been if it was Michelle Obama\n... ... it would be front page news for a week on end that wrap that the the country artist would have\nHad his life probably threatened on multiple occasions but look let's go back to just again about a week ago Hillary Clinton gave an interview about her husband and his relationship with Monica Lewinsky and they asked her\nI mean do you think that relationship was inappropriate and less than two weeks ago her answer was\nNo it was appropriate because she was an adult\nHe was the president of the United states leader of the free world Monica Lewinsky was an intern and Hillary Clinton is still justifying her husband's behavior can you imagine for one second that was the\nThe converse if Donald Trump\nHad done that with during the media would be saying oh\nYeah they would give them an excuse right away and I'm sure the media was saying well she's an adult no big deal I mean the double standards amazing [noise]\nIt has always been that way but the American people have seen through it and as you've referenced as it relates to Brett those Ninety two percent\nGod Bless America Corey Lewandowski Trump

all people they just want to watch somebody be destroyed over a thick ideology known as left isn't\nAnd I think it's pathetic and the far reaching ramifications impact the guys like Bill Cosby who

denial sex abuser Bill Clinton runs around here campaigning\nThan it was amazing I I had a situation where he actually raped a woman who told us that Juanita Broderick\nWhen Clinton raped her what what's a bloody lab told her a roommate what happened the roommate solved the blood on her lap saw her pantyhose was torn she actually had four or five corroborating witnesses as the event took place and then they also had the so called uh Arkansas state troopers confirming the fact\nThat the one eight abroad ... was actually raped and then you have while he's in the White House is president sexually groping and molesting Kathleen Willie in the White House and that was well known and corroborated but the media completely ignored both of those events because it didn't fit did it but it did

dollars and giving millions the Democratic party including the Obamas so they sent their own daughters end of the character has been in control of Harvey Weinstein and the media didn't cover that either did they\nKnow they didn't but here's what's interesting about that so they know Harvey their daughters are on touchable but you know whose daughter's aren't bill the daughters of ordinary people there the daughter that you know that you got to be concerned about because Harvey will take advantage of them but the the what the what ... rock Obama telling you is\nI have so much power I

going to be insignificant\nTo him and her but because something may be important in life she decide I'll take him down from what\nWell you know it it was hanging by a thread two weeks ago and now he's on the court and I think the other issue I Want to get your perspective on this Kevin Jackson and the black sphere which is the what's happening now with the Honduran migrants\nComing through a Guatemala into Mexico the right now is three to five thousand strong and they're heading toward the Texas border this is a terrible event for the Democrats\nOver the next two weeks before the election they have the video and the pictures of thousands of migrants whenever I watch MSNBC all I hear about is women and children then I see the video of these migrants coming to urban areas\nIn America and they're almost always young males and the young women tend to be raped or sexually molested the men are drug meals and I'm sure there's good family members among them and Kevin Jackson of you and your wife and your children were in uh we're in Honduras in a bill Cunningham and my wife and kids were in\nAnd we're in Honduras living the horrors of socialistic left wing military hunter regime\nThe first thing I Would want to do would be to get to America I understand that completely but along the process it gives billions of dollars damage Thirteen other gang bangers to provide the passage every time he goes through some other drug infested area Mexico you got to pay\nHomage you gotta pay either sex or money to even pass through and and live by the time you get to the northern part of Mexico according to sixty minutes about two months ago there was hundreds of dead bodies because some men did not want to participate\nAnd becoming drug meals to give drugs into America\nSome women were killed because they did not want to be ritual is typically raped on a regular basis\nThis is a horrible journey I watch MSNBC this is about refugee status of desperate people I watch other news outlets and this is terrible Trump's going to send supposedly\nOur soldiers to the southern border to stop it and all of this playing out during an election that the Democrats supposedly have in the

Brett Kavanaugh having been confirmed for the Supreme Court is very important because I think he is the\nRoad a five or five member majority would be interested in raining in the administrative state\nBy cutting back on the activities and the rules that they are able to make\nCan you give me a concrete example and I think government agencies I think the FCC I think the IRS what you're telling me there's hundreds of government agencies bureaucrats about about one point two million strong new every day made an office is mainly in Washington about are all all over the country\nAnd then they got to do something they just can't sit there and drink coffee all day so they started not enacting rules because they want because they have some generic piece of legislation giving them real making powers and then they issue these three thousand new rules that day that must be complied with how much farmers are causing us\nI think it's causing a lot of harm in the center for businesses of course it creates a lot of regulations that they have to comply with compliance activities are very expensive for business is one of the estimates that I had in the book is that each year\nThe car who really in dollars to comply with government regulations though that ... trillion dollars actually gets passed on to all other Americans who are consumers of the of the products that these businesses produce so\nThat an important factor in fact a trillion dollars this more than the government actually ... uh either from businesses are from individuals each year so this is a very significant thing but it\nCan be turned back towel and it can be reduced give me hold on\nAnd the idea here and described in the book is that the courts can step in and begin to review carefully the legislation under which all of these rules are made and very frequently\nUm the rules are based on laws that were ... years ago sometimes generations ago and they are and perpetrated by the administrative agency to give them the authorities issue all these new rules\nAnd the court can look at that legislation again and say wait a minute you've gone too far the Congress did not give you the authority to make this rule\nAnd there are a number of examples in the book where you can see that the that the agency has gotten well beyond what Congress actually authorize so if\nThe court is willing to step in and take those steps and that's what fortitude is necessary that's why the book is called ... do they have to have the strength\nOf character that go in and make these decisions that will turn down regulations of um of administrative agencies then we can actually begin to reduce the amount of regulation and the rules have come out of Washington\nPeter Wallison let's go back in time does not hot summer in Philadelphia in Seventeen Ninety seven\nArticle one they said the founding fathers said and we believe that the Congress the house in the Senate or the most powerful instruments allergies or government because of the best reflects the will of the people\nIn reality at least for the past fifty years it was perceived Congress AS number one\nIt was received the president is number two and they and the court system is number three in reality number one is not the Congress one might say it's the President's Day is the most powerful number two is the current number three is the Congress the Congress\nIs feckless foolish any relevant and and so when the founding fathers day if they were transported from Seventeen Ninety seven the twenty Eighteen and October twenty eight Jane and they looked at the situation today what when the Congress is foolish in fact\nTo find out more checks to market to seven nine six four or five\n...

I think putting on our ...\nAnd we're going to be like we always do we put on our our substance had which is looking at the issues and basing it on the substance on her\nPolitical had put it on my political had I thought that what came out of\nThe the the campaign from the Republicans and Democrats I thought the best campaign slogan actually came from Trump was jobs not mobs very a very easy to understand\nAnd very quickly on the ... the caravan here because we had a lot to talk about today and uh it it's funny sometimes I just wonder how do people think and this is comes from from people to support Trump but this this was about Providence about to get to Trump but I'm thinking to myself and you are the same thought\nThink people was it was for him\nThis works for him we're moving towards election day and the closer the caravan comes to the U.S border is going to help Republicans and help Trump\nBut I'll probably say it's a conspiracy because this is because that's what I heard this is a conspiracy sources behind it and and they're doing this in order to win the election well then try and spend more money to win the election and have more caravans come in if they believe that that's an effective way to win an election because it's not\nIt's not it it the we set it and it was the timing and everything going on and twenty sixteen but Trump own immigration illegal immigration if you want if he if he is to get back on\nTrack to get funding for the wall this will be part of\nIt is five on you and I were talking about if there's a conspiracy yeah it would be the Trump behind all well [laughter]\nI don't have a billion dollars to make it happen because it's working for him right there is any conspiracy politically that would be called brilliant or affective in terms of a positive for one side of the other they would be him behind the conspiracy because\nThis works for the president and Republicans if you've got five ... this is what we saw a few years ago ... years back when you had an influx not quite like the caravan mob or whatever you want to call it um but but pretty much the same effect right\nThere are about to reach the border and you had people\nYou had Democrats who had rank and file Democrats saying no no no no no no we're spending people on those ... spending money government money on people who aren't citizens and we're not spending enough\nIn in the cities in in our town on our kids and that's the way that went and that was before Trump was president\nAh ... if you think this is a conspiracy let them try it it does not work for the left\nComing up on the show first the one over one thousand and twenty four we will we will get to because still I was with you and I both on vacation very rainy vacation whether I was in New York or whether I was here didn't matter ... it\nJust it rained it was a complete to wash out and in fact the most the the biggest thing that I accomplished was I got three room steam cleaned in my house\nAre brought up the steam cleaner and did a three rooms and have four more to go\nOr so that was really what I did over ... ... you know vacation oh by the way very quickly\nHappy sixty seven wedding anniversary to my parents as sub Saturday oh we'll have the ending was the seven yeah a ...\nA ... a but we'll we'll get to that coming up because I just when I saw that I went when I first\nSaw that I said she she dumber what\nHow dumb she ... you know for doing that and she came out yesterday and said that she did it because the world needs transparency and she was attempting to be transparent to oh I uh also coming up on the show Hillary is just like Mike Myers from Halloween she just won't go away or should I say Michael Meyers\nYeah Michael Meyers Michael Meyers is pretty funny right All right ... you know\nUh the the the jobs not mobs political slogan that came out while we were on vacation and the Democrats platform is what we thought it was going to be which is what the heck's on Kavanaugh to those Democrats upset about the ... a ... death where were you on Benghazi right\n\nWhere were you on ... ... because the criticism of the administration luck none of us know everybody becomes an expert on these things oh here's what happened you'll have no clue what happened and maybe somebody in the CIA knows what happened\nMaybe Trump knows what happens maybe somebody some of them in the house and and uh the house intelligence committee and and the Senate intelligence committee maybe they know none of us know what really happened over there well one thing we do know is the hypocrisy of the Democrats that in essence said\nWhen we found out that Hillary Clinton in the state department lied about Americans being killed in a terrorist attack and lied to the American people about it what did the press have to say this was her best day yes\nBest week ever run Hillary right\nA peta says a cow's milk as a symbol of white supremacist ... car crashes rise in states with that

the corporation commission says number D.C thirty two\nA cultural appropriation ... right right sure I'll throw appropriations she's she's a appropriating a culture and the thing I liked his when he even came up with a one sixty fourth well she could be one sixty fourth or could be won over five hundred and twenty or one\nOver one thousand two hundred and twenty poor\nAnd was like yeah but the one or even if it's the one over sixty four and I don't even know whether this is true or not but somebody pointed out they said well no the average American is one point eight percent Native American so it doesn't even mean what the average American\nIs that that particular point so without question this is ... ... you know cultural appropriation right the the the second thing was you want white privilege white privilege as a white person claiming that they can be whatever they wish to be whatever minority they wish to be that they can be whatever minority they wish to be\nThe other thing was the median jumping on this is it as if this legitimize\n[laughter] yeah that would be like what I Know that that that would be that it was yeah that that ... that was it\nBecause there was some here's what was I think great about the whole scenario I don't know that was planning on the part of the president I don't think it was it was just basic basically it was his rhetoric on his side right\nBut remember back in twenty sixteen we were saying okay when you're on a stage with Hillary and you're you're debating just throw the facts that are you know she lied about bin ... she you know the she broke the law but it came to her email server all these things as\nThrow the facts out and have them backtrack well they ended up back checking Elizabeth and Elizabeth Warren's people basically doing that and then they come back as if it's legitimate right but then they remember they kept changing it that well that of the ... was the Boston Globe\nWay out yeah we made us take care of and we made a mistake again and again it just got to the point of being the most bizarre thing yeah right and I'm\nTo myself wow\nHow bad are seriously now you when I Need to reconsider ... we need to get out of this radio thing and get into political consulting\nOh yeah I Would totally do that and just say you idiot yeah what do you think they're going to work well if you're going to waste your money waste your money on us\nYeah it's all a million dollars and we can be a lot better political consultants for whoever you're using right because remember this means that Elizabeth Warren got together with all of her aides and they sat in a room and said okay here's our plan to counter Trump [laughter] yeah and everybody shook their heads going\nHa ha ha ha ha ha ha that's a great\nGoal was that was that when you think there was one guy or gal in the room that said no no [laughter] they all they all there was an overriding vote as sorry we all voted you were deciding to go with it\nBecause [laughter] we're just a tactic become a good idea and and but this is not this is the mainstream remember when you had the Kavanaugh hearings the first cabinet hearings and it was the first day and remember that\nWhole weekend the Democrats on the committee had decided whether or not they were going to do a full on walk out\nOr you just do the ... thing right and they thought that it struck disruptive thing I you know when Grassley are basically would be the tactic they would use that is what they went with\nAnd it's like they had that meaning they met all weekend about it okay would get up and walk out [laughter] which ultimately\nThey did a during the a committee vote on on on Capitol you know and that you had come out Harris going outside and doing the press thing and all that but it wasn't that wasn't so much the ... that was like the protests after that they are they still voted yet and they still voted\nSo there was an effectively anything you know it it will show about it\nBut they had the meeting that first weekend they had that meaning we'll just get up and walk out this is this is the ... this is a mainstream Democrats\nToday this this is not the protesters and we talked about how the protesters ...\nLead the party they lead the party they lead the call\nFor the party but how many groups how many different causes and different protest groups are there this is why they have no direction because they're in every direction and it's it's\nIt's crazy and then then I guess the the other point was so Elizabeth Warren then does DNA matter quite right does this does is destroying transgender isn't mhm if DNA matters\nBecause remember the the the next thing is as as we all know uh we we've gone through the whole trans racial thing than the left just starting to embrace writer remember you're talking about Elizabeth Warren who was [laughter] before this one of the leading liberal icons [noise] you know socialist\nIcons social justice warrior ... who broke a ton of social justice warrior rules and regulations [laughter] number one you were saying the DNA matters does in this\nSo DNA matters across the board then and then it matters for ah your your sexuality it matters for your gender that writers for your race huh right is is that the is that the whole point or or does it not in okay what's the determining factor of what you are then what is the what is the [laughter]", "show_name": "The Jim Bohannon Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Johnson City", "day": "22"}
