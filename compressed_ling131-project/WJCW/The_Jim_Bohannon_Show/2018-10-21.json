your family\nIs it a heritage order or is it the hair follicle that actually produces there that's the problem\nThat's a great question so it's a genetic abnormality or structure abnormality from the bold hairs like to uh to live so I always tell my patients when you grow hair it's going to let you have a bull that sits in the ground which is your scalp and it has to be oriented in the right direction and a half to have growth factors around it to then grow a shaft\nThat if it were a flower would be a tool that but instead of the ... so it gets composed and the ... which is where things go abnormal you can also have abnormalities of the protein structure that support the hair that keeps it anchored in your scalp\nAnd if you have problems with that you'll grow normal hair but you won't keep it simply because it gets pulled out with regular things such as wearing a hat or brushing your hair and that\nProtein structure or the change that you were saying if people have a disease of the hair is that something that they develop over time or if it's our family one of course you're it's inherited\nYeah so you're you're born with a tendency for the most part if it's inherited some of them can accelerate with time\nAnd get worse however for ones that have anger problems where the supportive tissue that just doesn't keep the hair that's healthy into the scalp those actually improve with age probably because we get crushed ear and our skin gets differ and so you just simply have more peripheral support so it doesn't get yanked out and were able to teach you\nSome basic common sense things to allow you to keep your hair you know no type braids no dreadlocks be careful with hats\nThings like that then there's the other set of hair conditions that are much more common which is where you get an inflammatory disease that comes to your scalp and eats away the little tulip bulbs that are sitting in your skin and if an inflammatory disease eats away those bulbs and its surrounding structures\nYou will no longer be able to grow any here in the future if if it results in a car so if something is inflamed we tried to turn that process off immediately so that you retain your hair full like either unit so eventually your body will hopefully remember how to grow a bold\nWhich then will become hair is that the L O P show when people lose their all of their hair yeah so the term ... means hair loss\nAnd there are multiple reasons to lose hair and so if you have a section of your scalp that just literally bald as if somebody you know shaved it down to the scalp or it's nicely cut out like a circle and it it's in a weird pattern or the interns really shiny\nAnd look very thin or leads very easily or you notice that when you brushed one part of your hair many many more hairs come out of that side than when you brush on other areas\nCome to the dermatologist because these are all very time sensitive diseases and time is of the essence when it comes to the hair clock when it starts to tick because once you destroy the hair follicle her unit and scars shut we cannot grow that hair back\nWell so good to the dermatologist early was get an update on the new treatments that you have four ... is\nThe first thing I like to tell people as they're not alone at something that people feel very embarrassed about often time than men and women will go through all sorts of great lengths to try to hide their thinning hair\nTime is also of the essence because the more we can block those hormone receptors on the ... the more your hair will be able to grow the best things to do our to use over the counter ...\nWhich is available and two percent strength or five percent there's no reason to use two percent when you can use five percent traditionally it's labeled as being marketed for men but it's just as good for women you can use it in a shampoo\nA film or a solution I personally recommend the solution is sometimes a little harder to find in the door that you can order it on line that simply because when you the shampoo you wash it in and it washes out and when you use the phone it oftentimes gets absorbed in the here you have\nAnd so then it doesn't get to the scalp which is where the action is versus it's much easier to use a solution and simply make sure that the liquid gets on your scalp as if you're giving yourself at a medical

happen if you kill somebody from the bulls losing American I mean they know there had to be a bad reaction what did they\nThinking yeah I mean that that's one thing that you know a lot of folks have been sort of scratching their head over that says I mean I've been following foreign affairs for very long time now and I I didn't even recall who this gentleman was before this whole debacle\nI'm One of those I sit here and the nation's capital do a radio show I didn't know his name I've never read one of his articles I mean how bad good to be\nExactly and I mean of course he doesn't have sort of allowed peace to the American people as a whole and I mean\nYou might have a little bit of influence those sort of the elite class in DC but I mean by all means this guy was sort of just just a journalist who had you know no no substantial Mike besides the actual Washington Post so I mean you would imagine this would have to be something sort of that and then in one way that at least you know the president is recognize what the Saudi king said as well\nThat that may have been so sort of broke forces that were acting on behalf of of a different part of the government I mean you know some of the stuff with these different regimes can be sort of our hearts sometimes so again and it will be very interesting to see what actually\nIt was our no pun intended rich house of cards love and and they cited it comes back in November but I don't know which as a guard you're referring to maybe as a double entendre there\n[noise] um what a show if we if we take a deeper look at this so do you think what happens next using the Saudis are they going to come out and in in admit something officially\nI mean this is a bad situation from Saudi Arabia you have a you have people like me that are calling on Donald Trump to pull the U.S ambassador out of Riyadh a you've got people that are telling Trump to send the Saudi ambassador home from Washington I mean this is a bad situation you've got the U.S secretary of state heading over there\nI mean if I were the Saudi royal family and this is this is this is an all out PR disaster\nYeah I mean it really is a big deal and the president has set him so that you know if these allegations do proved to be true that there will be some sort of very harsh punishment a I think what the president has been rights so far and what\nYou've been very unfairly criticized for is that he wants to wait for actually an official response or what the Saudis have to say as well as an ongoing us investigation through the state department\nBut I mean if you sort of pick up any newspaper reading articles right now I mean you're seeing these folks just absolutely blast into into President Trump for what they see is a lot of response which I think is is a little bit bit ridiculous that you know so many things that are saying we should basically just you know throw the entire country of Saudi Arabia under the bus who has arm but\nIt's very you know I I wanted me to the earth complacency say that and I wonder because the ... I used to represent a woman named\nPat ruptures children were kidnapped by her Saudi has been taken back to the kingdom you could imagine despite all the political pressure and the world I as a lobbyist wouldn't get the most I've ... I've seen firsthand the corruption of the Saudi Government\nI'm given that maybe it is time to forcibly rain them in maybe it is time for the United states to restructure that relationship\nAnd maybe go in and change the monarchy and he should we do something like that\nI mean I I I you know I trust what what the president will conclude in terms of his policy solutions but\nI mean I I just I think this whole debacle has been very interesting just because\nYou know we obviously have leverage over the Saudis in terms of the arms deal in terms of the giant arms deal that Trump to go shit it in terms of you know we could sanction different entities that the Saudi but I mean I I think what's been missing from from this whole thing is that a lot of the folks who have really been viciously attacking the president of what they say it's his lack of response\nOr some of the same people who work in the Obama administration and we're journalists were some of the biggest sort of cheerleader\nAnd rainy and I I agree with you I'm not I I'm a I'm with you on all that but I mean I think that as opposed\nTo the American politics on this or a sideshow let me ask you this strategically you full of foreign affairs\nI have long thought that maybe it might be a better idea for the U.S to impose some kind of American puppet dictator on Saudi Arabia and getting rid of the royal family altogether is that is there any wisdom in that\nI I think that there's there's a substantial amount of risk getting that I mean we we saw what happened and we're still seeing the effects of dad associate what happened in Iraq in terms of we try to get rid of you know strong man Saddam Hussein and then we sort of get chaos amongst the ranks so I mean\nThere is a lot of radical you know Sunni Sunni Islam and branches in Saudi Arabia and those groups hold substantial power in addition to the to the actual royal family so I mean I I think something like that you know it it may sound I waste on great reality but that ... it may sound great but the reality is that\nAh that the Saudi royal family at least has been fairly consistent in their policies dad says you know going back us relationship all the way that back to the to the fifties and that you sort of you know you you know you know the devil that's already in there and we don't know what\nWill come after I I mean I really

receive submitted to hurt her or you know to be sampled the habit how do they get a life\nAnd it came back five so I put a perk DNA that we're probably descended from Native American and what they found was that\nAbout twelve billion a bill letters or DNA so you know a piece for you to be a little letter or in our DNA about twelve million of them are probably update of American or a ... now that sounds like a lot\nBut we're there's more than three billion billion with a B or C because our DNA of these letters if you do the math\nAbout ... percent or ... or ...\nOnly harbor you know you're less than one has a possibility of being Native American\nAnd ... and ...\nThat's not very much to take a random like guy from the United states to sort of randomly selected wiped out free she has probably point one point two percent\nNative American DNA and the reason is because when we ... the United states we actually married to a lot of Native Americans don't live here and all of us are probably slightly native if we have\nA ... is our families within the United states for a long time all of us probably have a little bit of American Pie and I saw her story the her mom was Cherokee is false\nShe'll what she ... she has to know that she was lying right she has to know that this is falls why would she entered into\nA test like this because she would know better than anybody that her mom wasn't Cherokee what was your goal in this you have any idea\nI think it's probably sooner and put the story behind her because you know ... it's pretty clear she's going to run for president\nAnd it down with twenty twenty people are going to bring this up and say hey you myth let people about your being made to America to say hey that's all this and so I think that's\nProbably why she did it because the ... ... ... the results simply do not support what you thought you\nKnow what percentage to be a real Native American what percentage would you need to have what did the eight percent ten percent twenty two percent what would you say is a real Native American\nI don't think that there is any particular number because\nUh uh imagine let's say you were adopted ... let's say that I you were an ... but that that they are American family adopted you and you grew up in the Native American tradition where you may not have any be in a state where I grew up in the tradition culture so I think to to identify as predict or culture for for it to say well I\nI grew up in that culture she did not\nWell growing up getting the growing up and like I'm I'm of Italian heritage if I had been adopted and I was raised in an Irish with an Irish family that doesn't mean Irish still Italian in my DNA right\nYeah that certainly that's that's absolutely true that that that your your biological backup will change but what I'm trying to say that it's identify it's pushed her to the city or a particular culture or tradition it's more than just biological\n... there's also a tradition and the history of language and culture or your part of the states and clearly she was not it's not like sheep you know with the ... through any of those sites and so I'm\nNot worth story it's completely fabricated and the and they test the century shows that she was dying I I'm actually surprised that we were released the results I Would have been embarrassed by the\n... I agree I Can't see one of the worst political mistakes in recent memory I Can't imagine any that woman's professor maybe she doesn't know much about politics is a wreath us I think of anything and take her out of the presidential running almost completely okay let me ask you this\nKind of more broadly now with these these DNA business I really where a lot of privacy concerns China is buying the majority of data from ancestry dot com but very high prices is this true in or you're worried about it\n[noise] uh I'm not familiar with that story at all but I I can speak more broadly in terms of privacy and I do think it's gonna be a concert and my concern is that if if our our health data falls to the hands of health insurance companies\nShe shouldn't be doing better in Missouri I over the years I've been involved in a number of strategic efforts to destroy the Missouri Democratic Party and they never seemed to work Missouri shouldn't be an old red state but it's just not it's just not the Democrats seem to always hang on there and I I could never quite figure out in Missouri and always confused\nYeah it's hard I mean Trump won it by almost twenty points in twenty six yeah keep in mind mean St Louis is not as big as it used to be but it's still a big union town and no ... on his roots there and that's going to be a pretty big democratic stronghold that's through Kansas City on the other side is largely the same way so it's about it's all about the suburbs and it's all about turning out\nUh your your base and some of the smaller cities in smaller communities as well but I think if if the Republican base has energized I'd be surprised that Josh Hawley didn't come out on top\nAll right so that's the good news all of that basically is good news the Senate everything's kind of trending our way but if you know the house let's get to the bad news is there any improvement\nSince we last off in the overall health situation for Republicans\nYeah a little bit uh there was a poll out late last week from ABC News showing that among registered voters not likely voters but registered voters which is a little dicey this close to election day or the Democrats hold the generic ballot lead of fifty three to forty two which is pretty significant and if that was the only number in this poll I'd say this isn't really good news for Republicans\nBut in addition to the the general generic ballot they also looked at how folks are planning to vote in what they call the sixty six most competitive house districts and if you go on all those together Republicans have a one point lead forty seven to forty six\nI'm not generally one to love poll that combined a bunch of districts because one could be lopsided another can be razor close so it's hard to know exactly\nWhat this is likely doing but if in fact the sixty six most competitive districts are showing basically a dead heat or maybe even the Republicans up by one they've got a fighting chance most prognosticators like five thirty eight still think there's a great big a chance that the Democrats end up taking the house but I don't think it's as much of a done deal as folks were saying just a couple of weeks ago\nSo we gotta bounce from having a but the odds are it's not the bones that was needed is that basically right and there are there was we have a little bit of a red spark against the blue wave but not probably not enough is that\nYeah it's like I mentioned last week that uh the cabinet news is great news for Republicans in Senate races where Democrats or the incumbents in red states like Missouri like North Dakota like perhaps West Virginia even though I mentioned voted for Kevin uh\nLike Montana places like that but the district for the Democrats are licking their chops over are in blue leaning states in there and suburban areas where it's not as much of a electorate that favors the Republican if you look at where Democrats are hoping to make big gains\nIt's California New Jersey Pennsylvania and to some extent New York so uh if they can get what they want to get done there\nAre thrown out a lot of red meat to the Republican base isn't going to have the same effect in those places as well and more conservative parts of\nWest Virginia going back to the mansion from going back to the mansion ... West Virginia is like Missouri it's some it's another strange state I Can't figure out because it's\nAll Republican in Britain the residential all Republican in so many ways and then you had\nMentioned the only I can figure out is he's kind of like\nThere Robert Byrd maybe they had to hold onto a bird is that I mean what I can\nIt does that mean mentioned a good candidate he looks the part is that the other but I I don't understand how your like being a Democrat in West Virginia\nBut I think it goes back to the old ah adage of well look at those people in Congress they're terrible my guys pretty good about the rest of Congress is terrible and Joe Manchin the guy his family's been around in the state forever he's been around the state forever\nAnd he's managed to remain a popular he uh kinda sticks his toe in where he needs to on conservative issues I think that's why you saw the vote for Kavanaugh as well as some others are all along the way a like a ... when he shot through the cap and trade bill or eight years ago when he was running for the seat on Robert Byrd died so\nHe finds a way to uh in gray she ate himself they're they're they're portraying ah Patrick Morrisey his Republican challenger the carpetbagger I think from New Jersey\nOr by way of Washington he's not a lifelong resident I think that matters more in West Virginia than it might in some other states there is an internal Republican poll showing that it's only mentioned by one but I've yet to see any other scientific independent poll that showed that anywhere close to that\nWell that would be good at that would be that would be great news if that can be enough to let me ask you this all of these rallies Trump is you know holding rally after rally as we close in on election day is is making a difference is wasting his time or what do you think is doing the right thing does he need to do it differently what what are your instincts tell you about the rallies\nMy instincts tell me it's probably not going to make that much of a difference because if the bases motivated the bases motivated and I think what happened with Kevin I was more than likely to motivate the base than anything Trump's going to do at one specific rally for forty five minutes to an hour\nAlso if you look at some of these special elections that Trump is involved himself in over the past couple of years isn't Dorfman hasn't meant that much I'd has on a couple of situations maybe in some primaries but not in the head to head and somebody's house and Senate races certainly down in Alabama but that had some\nAdditional issues but even if you go back to Obama Obama when he was on the ballot he was able to get the the turn out that he wanted but when he would go stumped for Martha Coakley or John corps diner these other people that I turn to the midterms were horrible for Obama no matter how much time you spent the trail and he couldn't get Hillary Clinton across the finish line either\nFor those of you who think that American politics as predictable we know better because Ted Kennedy's successor was a conservative Republican and Jeff Sessions successor was a liberal Democrat and that doesn't tell you all you need to know about the unpredictability of the United states you know God only knows right\nYeah it's you can't a guarantee anything until the votes are counted\nOkay let me ask you this candidate on is done or whatever ... we were getting we got what can we do know is there anything in the last one to three weeks\nLess than three weeks that can be done to spike the base turnout what can we do is get anything done\nWell you need to do two things first of all don't do stupid things and President Trump tweeting out that a Stormy Daniels his horse face and that sort of thing some people might find it funny\nOther people are going to find a patch of land and uh and once again not like him very much and and the way to fight back against that is to vote for whoever the Democratic so the classic the quieter Trump is maybe apart from the rallies is probably the way to go there\nI'm have a vision um have Republicans talk about maybe the things I didn't get done but they definitely could if they had bigger majorities particularly in the Senate\nUm and then I'll talk about the Democrats are kind of helping them out here That's Elizabeth Warren with the with the American Indian heritage and whether she is she is spending and whether she's a fighter or being bullied all that stuff Hillary Clinton jumping in talking about we can't have the ability to

saying look if you elect her she's gonna be a rubber stamp for Nancy Pelosi and all you're going to get our higher taxes are more government involvement in healthcare a and a constant investigations of President Trump's so even though you're not hearing a national drumbeat on this uh\nFrom President Trump or anyone else it is a a factor that Republicans are injecting into their competitive races and we'll see if that's the same effect that uh had eight years ago or not\nSo quick to look ahead on and pushing it thirty seconds in twenty twenty looking ahead do Republicans have a lot more a dream to defend in the Senate yes\nOh yeah they had a really good year they picked up nine seats I think in twenty four teams so ah they'll be on a lot more defense in there this year so\nTwenty twenty this was this was a year to really gain seats in the Senate if we're going to gain them\nYeah twenty swat was a bad year for Republicans in the Senate so they had a chance to make it right this

[noise]\nUh and do you know common the finding is that they already Cal suffocation in eighty four year old is about as common as acting a teenager so the mere finding of so many already ... does not mean that you're going to have to have your valve replaced [noise]\nThat are offered to give you a quick thumbnail of my situation try as an Anchorage cancer starting back about two years ago\nGoodness and that is a very for that so unique accomplishment\nOr other Arabs around just amazing\nYou're up there with Ruth Bader Ginsburg and a three time Franklin also had it for many years when she finally succumb to it but goodness gracious you're doing well\nWell that's that's probably true 'cause most people don't make it a matter of months and yeah you ... and I want to throw a little over twelve years but here's the situation I add up all operation of course radiation therapy or chemotherapy\nAnd in addition to that a a a clinical trial at Johns Hopkins little and I said almost ten years out and it was specifically for pancreatic cancer ... and all that\nUh has apparently made by ten twelve years Shariah will have on you know but there are some downsides after\nYes or is there often are you know we after a whip all you know you're like a large part of your digestive tract has been removed serious serious problems so actually you're comparable to patients sub you must have been a year or so ago\nWho uh is has been doing extremely well in terms of pancreatic cancer you know Whipple procedures you are you part of your most of your pancreas taken on your part of your doing dean them taken out of this whole whole bunch of stuff taken out and stomach\nAnd part of the stomach yeah so eat affects you've had kind of a gastric bypass and many patients who had a whip all have terrible the gesture problems they lose a lot of weight they feel weak and tired\nAnd Italy and they have some nail in it so you require really intensive nutrition support from a nutritional specialist\nAnd do what I managed to do with this guy a I was really happy about it because it wasn't so much about the cancer the cancer seem to be the least of the problems paradoxically it was the you know it's like the operation was a ... a success but the patient died sort of I mean in terms of just wellbeing\nAnd uh we managed to pinpoint the many nutritional deficiencies this guy had we did a very comprehensive nutrition testing we found was Mel absorbing many nutrients we gave them to him a supplemental informs that he could absorb\nAnd um he started to improve in terms of his well being an energy or his just Austrian was super low I think we may have given them some of that and maybe some da Ga a and ultimately a started keeping a kicking up his heels again you know so you know survival is much benefit if you're feeling horrendous\nAnd it will procedure leaves you pretty debilitated so I I Can't tell you specifically what to take\nI can tell you the path to take which is to go to an expert on nutrition and get ... you know comprehensively tested\nAnd see what you're missing because it's in variable after a whip all that you're you know having some critical deficiencies nutrients and that's part of the problem\nYou mention in order to GI problems and insulin reduction is a is a problem too\nYeah ... you're losing part of your insulin reducing capacity 'cause that's what the pancreas does and so it's complicated I mean it's kind of beyond the scope of this call but hey\nI'm sure the good news is that cancer is a bay uh but now we got to pick up the pieces and bring about a more total a optimization of your situation\nAnd that's actually easier than defeating the cancer so we you know look at all the factors work with you on proper diet the right kind of supplementation maybe some hormonal support\nOr you should end up feeling a lot better that's the good news type things we recall let me squeezing a call now from a our final caller who's Mary Ann in New Jersey Hi Maryanne\nBy Dr ... thank you for your help I'm hopefully it said the question I think you know sitting there already go a stimulus problem blah blah blah for the last five or six

don'ts on the plane I mean one of the things that can be problematic because you sit in the plane and you know you read a magazine you know for hours on end do what you want to do is you kind of mean there are certain things tips that probably you can learn from your ah a distributor rehab person\nIs did you need to kind of fixate on objects far away from you not immediately in front of you walk around in the plane a little bit\nUm and ah you know in terms of you know is there medication that you should take maybe two transient leaky pure vertigo at bay\nThat might be advisable although it's you know going to leave you a little drowsy and hung over when you arrive at your destination but you know the way this thing works is it's kind of a threshold phenomenon once it happens it's sort of cascades and you want to keep it from developing\nSo you may want to take a medication like a Dramamine or something even stronger or to prevent it from happening so that you you know feel secure and

visceral reaction you know Republicans are bad and Republicans are evil Democrats are good and if you care about the common man you'll you'll vote Democrat and it it takes I was a Democrat who originally I teased and say it was a birthright\nIn Brooklyn New York you had no choice\nBut when you realized way as you get older and you grow you see that that's not the case that are actually the Republican solutions are far better in the long run than the emotional reaction of hope and change or whatever you come up with but it does I must admit it it really bothers me to see that\nYour daughter doesn't talk to you and it's just a it's a sad maybe let's go to McGill in I'm Sorry ah the gal in Corpus Christi\nHey how are you doing today is a real well\nYou know I'm a I'm a libertarian or I go to college so I'm not Republican and I'm not Democrat and I got to be honest with you you know I've heard it from both sides you know I've been called a racist in a big ... from the left and you know I call it ... you know\nA snowflake you know from the right and I think it's really come down to this country is being torn apart it seems like to me um by their politics it seems that people are kind of unable to sit down and just you know discuss their politics and work towards\nYou know a a better in America you know together and I will have to say I'm not trying to fit your but the Republicans in the right wing or almost just as bad about it is\nYeah I don't see that and so by the way I was thinking I was listening to what you said and he said snowflake and I'm thinking snowflake is not looking like calling someone a racist or a big hit your people and I it and you could be a snowflake and being on the Republican side just means\nYou know things offend you can get upset easily and you can handle things I don't mind being called a snowflake it's not anything like being called a racist\nOr I'm a whole form or anything else the snow's liquid those I even like snowflakes so even your comparison makes [laughter] so you're laughing you agree with it\nBut yeah I mean I understand um you know that is a good point uh I guess I didn't think of it that way but\nYou know also I think a lot of you know from what I see that the problem stem from also a kind of not really being able to hold your candidate accountable\nAnd I think that's one thing that you know Republicans and the right we could do to\nFurther their message and I think it would hope you'll out so much more to try to get your ideas out there of course is just my opinion but a\nCaller earlier had you know commented on the second amendment and I'm very pro Second Amendment you know you have a right wing or is like you said that really already Second Amendment we you know if that's what you agree and you want to ban bump stocks and you want to raise you know the age of Twenty one and that's fine but that's not something you agree with\nA mean old your candidates accountable to that I Would think\nIt's funny you say that because it's funny I have a different view I think that Republicans do turn on their own much more than Democrats to you mayor or remember at the health care vote it was all Democrats not one Republican\nOr Bill Clinton in the impeachment the none of the Democrats would sign on Kavanaugh you have one Democrat who the Trump won by forty points in West

take your calls the six Ninety red\nEye and we put the Joe on hold so Joe you're back with mark\nThanks very we back mark hey I'm so I'm really tired but I'm forty five now she's about to be forty one we drove super tight um\nI mean she was always the one being told hey take your sister with your elbow everywhere I had to go you know my sister when I look back now and I absolutely love that you know and um\nWe're really tight all the way through and I'm a similar I think it was my senior year my parents got divorced and so we got a little you know a state of my dad with mom and and we got a little separation but we never let the distance or I'm\nGetting between us we stayed in contact and uh she became a flight attendant for a while for a flight attendant shooting\nAnd you know she would let me use are passive and we would fly places\nAnd um and then you know slowly as family comes in you know you maybe don't talk as much but we always talk and um\nAnd we always had the same views for the longest time you know maybe a couple of little differences here and there but um she started traveling a lot to Europe and this that and come back and started talking about how you know America does the U.S does this wrong or the u._s. should\nBe more like this country and this and that is so you know it's just kind of like OK okay whatever well um we never really talked about politics until this past election and um and still during the primaries um\nYou know I hadn't made my choice that I think most people you know they had made their choice and I was between crews and Trump\nAnd as she was more of a Bernie Sanders she was\nAll about Bernie Sanders and um she was happy with Hillary and so as it got closer and closer when I actually started leaning orders Trump\nWe we started getting is serious serious debates you know and then I'm In June my son my youngest son was graduating\nAnd she was supposed to come out to the graduation and um\nMy son and her just\nA tremendous tremendous uh a relationship and um two weeks prior to the um to the graduation we had a conversation on a song or like I said what were you get here we're not talking about politics of this is about politics about my son graduation and um\nAnd then the week before the graduation she called\nAnd she said because I'm a Trump supporter she can't come to my house\nAnd we have not spoken since that day I've reached down in ... or a couple of ... and a couple of times you know trying to al ... is a a a relationship with my nephew doing nothing nothing\nI feel so sorry a few I I you know it just breaks my heart and and you have to wonder what what about your son I mean she didn't seem to care about that either that the the fact that you supported Trump was enough to break a bowl the relationship between a brother or sister in ... so much over those years\nIt is incredible what's going on out there and I just uh you know ... cliche that is my heart to even hear the story\nDon't don't give up maybe someday she'll come around the she obviously got I'm fed yeah gentlemen socialism in Europe and what's going on there if you ask most of your opinions I don't think many of them be happy with what's going on I don't know what she saw\nA but ah it it's depressing hang in there my friend okay\nIt'll it'll come around some time just hang in there um I was just thinking of a you know people are funny that way I worked at a at a station ... in uh Los Angeles as I said\nI don't want to see too much about it except one of the hosts had a ... we have this a gal on whose father was a famous I don't want to see what he did but it was it was pretty famous in his in his day\nAnd they didn't talk for a I don't know Twenty years or something and then um one day a host said to me you know mark a her father died and she didn't even know it\nAnd I had to tell her the news and she said I'm a while I never got a chance to say goodbye so they hadn't talked to her I think it was at least Twenty years and you think that\nFinally when he passed on but it was too late to say goodbye to him\nBecause she disowned him all those years before it ever personal reasons so one has to think that\nEventually hope people come around before something serious happens and I always tell my students you can never tell someone you love enough that you love them because life is very short but when you hear the family stories a brother and sister daughter whatever that because of politics\nThey disown their parent\nOr their brother who they know their whole life assuming there's nothing terrible going on in the relationship just over politics and you see that almost always on the on the left hand side\nVery discouraging but are brought up a topic because it does happen and it is something that needs to be talked about like let's go to Amanda in Woodbridge, Virginia you're on with mark", "show_name": "The Jim Bohannon Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Johnson City", "day": "21"}
