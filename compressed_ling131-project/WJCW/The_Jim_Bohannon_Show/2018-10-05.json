get a little serious on your here and turned to reporter uh Melissa rainy day of demonstrations and led to the arrests of hundreds of protesters rallied against the confirmation of President Trump's are battling Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh again here's Melissa rainy [noise]\nFrom New York City [noise] in our nation's capital\nThe hash tag cancel Kavanaugh protests were hard to miss on Thursday with thousands gathering outside the federal courthouse near the U.S Capitol and inside the Senate office building all to rally against\nAt Kavanaugh's nomination to the nation's highest court the demonstrators including celebrities like Amy Schumer he was later detained by authorities\nTo so\nMany of the protests are focusing on the undecided senators that did vote on Kavanaugh including Susan Collins of Maine and Jeff Flake of Arizona but in the midst of the protests I'm moment of celebration after the crowd learned democratic senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota that she would vote against Kavanaugh's confirmation [noise]\nMeanwhile many Republicans appear to be confident the FBI report that is under review will clear the Supreme Court nominee what we know for sure is\nThe FBI report did not corroborate any of the allegations against judge Kevin\nI feel very good about where this nomination is right now a procedural vote on Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation could happen as early as friday on the list of rainy reporting\nOkay Mike Huckabee or how do you feel about the entire Brett Kavanaugh deliberations a high point in American democracy\nNow it's one of the real low points in American democracy and the reason that we're here is because the Democrats refused to accept the results of the twenty sixteen election must be very honest this was not about Brett Kavanaugh\nUh-huh and what he did when he was sixteen years old but it's never been proven even though the allegations were serious and they were ultimately outrageous because not\nOne person not one\nCouldn't validate these accusations being true but he's had his name and his reputation drug through the mud and mosque also keep in mind\nThat these very serious allegations that ranged from a it simply groping are attempting to grow the young lady all the way to being a serial gang rape is which is a pretty serious felony\nNone of this even surfaced until the Democrats through the hearings realized they didn't lay a glove on him to discredit our disqualifying him in the normal course of the errands and that's when Dianne Feinstein reach back into a ball somewhere\nPulled out this letter that she'd been sitting on like a hint sits on an egg\nHatched it and said oh white here's something maybe we can throw this against the wall and it'll stick gym it's been disgusting it's been embarrassing it's been a threat to our republic\nAnd I hope that this never happens again but quite frankly I think the Democrats have very little else in their quiver to shoot and I'm afraid it will happen again\nIt does seem unlikely that in the near future say the next five years or so that we would see another Supreme Court nominee go for the Senate in which the final tally would defer more than say four or five votes from partisan breakdown of the Senate\nAnd that's unfortunate because historically on people recognize that the role of advise and consent which the constitutional function of the Senate in this regard the president makes the nomination\nThe Senate advisors and gives consent but it's still the president's nomination and to quote president Barack Obama elections have consequences and unless you can determine that a judge is simply not qualified to be on the court or he doesn't have enough experience are a navy his ah\nHis judicial writings are against the constitution in some way\nOr Republicans have voted for the nominees of democratic presidents\nAnd vice versa and that's the way it's been you had a job just like a soda my ear Kagan and before that ends for my gosh what are the most liberal justices ever served on the court and I think the vote on her was like Ninety seven to nothing\nUh this is the way it was you said okay we didn't win the election the other party did or this person is is qualified we don't necessarily agree with their physicians but it's this is a qualified person\nWe move forward but Jim I go back to my point this is not about just the Supreme Court since\nNovember twenty sixteen even after Hillary in October of that year gave us all a nice little lecture about how we need to respect the will of the voters recess when she was confident she was going to be a the the winner of the election and how appalling it would be Donald Trump didn't accept the will of the voters\nBut since the election results\nThe Democrats have refused to accept that Donald Trump is the president\nAnd they've done everything they can to stage nothing short of a coup d'etat and try to de legitimize his presidency and every decision he makes and every person he hires\nEnd up points and the policies that he implements and that does represent a threat the pendulum swings back and forth between the left in the right we can survive that\nWe cannot survive if the losing side of an election refuses to accept it and instead goes to the streets and tries to overturn the election\nI Know the previous report we heard mentioned the north Dakota democratic senator Heidi Heitkamp who said she will be a no vote on Kavanaugh the reason she has given is quote his temperament unquote to your reaction to that\n[noise] well that's sort of a phoney and ridiculous excuse he showed through twelve years of being on the second most important part\nOr the appellate court in D.C which handles many of the very big cases not one person has ever said that he lacks the temperament in his career as an appeals court judge not one not one and because he\nHad the audacity to defend himself against these attacks have been everything from a drunk or to a gang rape is\nUh of course he defended himself in his honor you defended it because he has a mother yeah so why he has two daughters yes friends yes college\nAnd he had every right to defend themselves um and somehow that means he watched temperament I wouldn't want someone on the bench that was so robotic that they have no emotion had no passion and didn't understand what right or wrong or all about\nMike Huckabee is our guest will continue with more from Mike and of course the calls for him as well and don't forget the second season of Huckabee is kicking off shortly on TBN be

O. L. I. T. I. C. O. dot com wonderful website if you're at all into politics you really enjoy the information that is a is put forward there\nSo I'm looking before we get down to the election as such let's look at uh the the Kavanaugh situation\nA Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota Democrat so she is definitely a no vote\nOr we've already heard a Claire McCaskill a fairly definitively that she uh\nUh ... is a a no vote a Joe Donnelly of Indiana and other Democrats very trumps state had the first said he was ... and then I think the last word I heard from him was more like a\nMaybe no and then of course we have a a a Joe Manchin of West Virginia we're not sure about him and on the Republican side obviously Susan Collins of Maine Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Jeff Flake of Arizona a dividing the confirmation tea leaves here what do you see Daniel\n[noise] yeah it's a lot more optimistic for capital or because of the FBI report which Democrats are saying uh really it was not comprehensive it to the doctor Christine Blasey Ford and I'm Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd so they're saying that how could they\nEven begin to understand the truth that let's say an area in the main players but a number of those swing Republican senators have said that they thought the FBI report was apprehensive uh and you know they're happy with that although we have not had a vote commitments from those are three main Republican\nA swing or senators and so it's possible that they could pull a healthcare type boat where they advance to debate so you can actually have the confirmation\nVote and then once that actually comes to the final vote than they could vote against Kavanaugh and so that\nUh is unlikely but still a possibility because uh they just don't get along with Trump and they may have come to their own conclusion that a Ford is telling the truth\nAlthough both columns and flake are now saying good things about the FBI report ah I haven't heard a word for Murkowski of you\nAre not much I'm although you can say good things about the FBI report and yet still vote against chow that I Know that's not\nThat doesn't preclude one from the other ... and ah if they had been raised in a lot of concerns about the FBI record than they might uh then they would be under so much pressure from a conservative is in the right or in terms of voting for cabinet that uh\nUh it would uh most uh there's not a fun situation so not a surprise or if they want to vote against Kavanaugh than they can do that without the huge some sort of pressure from a conservative media and also uh the White House\nNow than pivoting to the election\nLet's assume for the moment that the indications are pointing toward a confirmation of Kavanaugh in that case the Democrats would lose so the question is in regard to November six motivation art people disheartened discouraged or are they made mad as hell\nI'm I think the Democrats still have an upper hand an enthusiast them because they they are attracting a lot of ... from\nA state where I have ... and we're not a strong and it looks like a Republican base is rallying to Republican but mostly in a they're in their ... states and so if you energize a lot of Republicans in Texas maybe that's good to prevent\nA better work from a toppling detectors but it's not going to save you a ton of swing\nCongressional seats and so are you really have to find a Republican he's yet I'm In uh in swing states and a safari it uh it seems like Democrats are more eager to vote or for their\nCandidate and to show a kind of given middle finger the Trump that are that this is an election based on a present on the president's performance and um and how he's acting up\nYou know I I think that a lot of it depends on whether you see Trump's name on the ballot I think that the Democrats look at the ballot and they see Trump's name everywhere or it doesn't say Donald Trump or but anything anybody with an R by their name that's close enough will vote against that person\nWhereas Republicans I think look at the ballot and they don't see the president's name anywhere instead they may see a lot of people that they may do you ride as a as rhinos Republicans in name only and uh and so I think those two viewpoints may not be a good news for Republicans\nYeah I'm ... I think all\nTrump has basically said that this is a referendum on him and that as a national election not good for a Republican\nOr any time and the power and the party in\nPower and so all kinds of trying to like the ... election\nUh and not have a from the main issue they want on chronic judicial appointments or do they want that to talk about because a and trust are poor and instill that great

times\nOn a ... through the first African American president uh seem to get more\nRacial based threats a than the uh than otherwise would ah give a white president and so a Trump or has attracted a his share a ah threats and so I think the secret service I was actually stretched\nThin because you have a lot of\nUh you know Trump kids who are running around and like to travel internationally\nOr domestically and so you have a lot more protect these uh than in previous administrations but\nIt seems like they are pretty protests on how they deal with Trump securing a and there's been a change

people will say well you know the free market will correct to\nThis problem is that really in this online space it's not so much a free market anymore and that's really for a couple of reasons Jim or the first one is\nThe barriers to entry are enormous now you know that may seem strange I mean the perception that a lot of people have is you know Jim if you and I want to start a search engine will just start one and we can put it up online and people will find it and uh we'll do great\nIt's just not that simple the barriers to entry are very very difficult and Google has a history\nOf working very very hard to sort of squelch competition\nNow that ended up ... grade me if I'm wrong about that that is an avid competitive practice and I believe that alone would be a slam dunk base for a law suit\nAbsolutely yeah and they have been sued 'em the challenge is that Google essentially a argues\nUm that we do exist in a free market which is what they are going to argue obviously in a legal context but the second part of the problem is not only did they deal with competitors in a very aggressive fashion but\nGym they have gone from being a company in the early to thousands which was all about Silicon Valley it was all about innovation\nThey had very small footprint in Washington D. C. they have gone from that scenario to today being one of the most aggressive lobbying country uh companies\nAre having a lot of former politicians on the payroll\nOf making a lot of campaign contributions and very aggressively working the machinery of government for their benefit and to the detriment of competitors so yeah I think you're exactly right looking at anti trust laws are key\nBecause we do not have a free market that will correct this problem um and the question becomes\nHow should the company be split up\nAnd the question is always this challenge of regulatory capture right that when these decisions get made in Washington D. C. oftentimes that process is influenced by the very people that the regulations or the antitrust action is going to be going against\nBut I think anti trust is a big part of this smashing the power in the grip that Google has in dominating so much of the information space\nNow another factor to consider here would be that uh when uh I guess similar arguments were put forward in an earlier era and the the steel trust and the sugar trust in a host of of the trust that existed around\nThe turn of the century ... deep into the ... century uh nonetheless uh the trust busting did come in ...\nBut those were all domestic concerns that was long before the Internet\nAlong before satellites and host of other things are these days you have to ask very frankly\nIf the United states government and all of its power and majesty has the uh the jurisdiction if you will to go after somebody as big as Facebook I'm In good majors to and it might not be cheap but it it it it would be an option I suppose they could do what they do\nFrom a lot of different places they don't have to be in the territory of the United states\n[noise] yes that's exactly right and we also have to factor in that you know if you're going to go after standard oil you go after standard oil and of course they're going to use all the techniques of lobbying and hiring lawyers but if you're going to go after Google you have the added problem that when people go\nTo look for information on the line about anti trust actions against Google a Google controls that flow of information and and it's important to look at the history here [noise] you know again Google official position is\nWe just give objective search results it's essentially like coming to the library and we've got the digital librarian who's going to get you the best search results but here's the problem we know from history that that's not the case can be twelve years ago you had several Web companies like Yelp\nAnd trip advisor you know they they provide the ranking services and and descriptions of restaurants in travel options and they complained that Google was in the ...\nAlgorithm to their detriment that they were pushing them down in Google Search results and that Google was favoring companies competitors that they themselves had started now\nYou could say hey Google has the right to do that you know and when you can have that debate but here's the problem Google insisted that this was not true that they were giving safe and and and fair search results well\nThe Federal Trade commission and the Obama administration looked at it\nThe European Union looked at this academics at Harvard University and looked at it and all of them said Google is lying they are cooking the books when it comes to commercial search and local search they are manipulating results\nThere's also a body of research done by whip Richard Striner a Harvard a PHD in psychology\nFormer editor in chief of Psychology Today magazine he certainly series a peer reviewed studies for the national Academy of sciences looking into something that he calls search engine manipulation of fat and what does research results show is that Google has the capacity\nAnd he has research shows they use that capacity to actually manipulate search results on very important issues including political issues so when you think about an antitrust action taken against Google you're not only going to be fighting the way that standard oil fought\nA hundred years ago you're now actually fighting an entity that can control what people actually see in terms of their research on this topic\nA lot of power to be sure will come back we'll talk some more ah with our guest in this report to the program Peter Schweitzer the president of big government

that consultant president of the government accountability Institute and now the producer of the documentary the creepy line dot com bust ... dot com ever call from Tim\nWho calls in from Medford, Wisconsin hello to him\nOh Jen bell good to talk to you as always empty you Mr Schweitzer I of course I'm a fan of a lot of the conservative commentators on YouTube as well as Facebook and others that I've seen a lot of them\nAll ... pushed aside you know pushed out of searches\nAnd they've all come up with one of two ideas that I wanted to see your your opinions out of it either bought up at a lot of a hate the idea of regulating the Internet as a public utility because they are very strongly against that but the one that seems to have caught the fire much them\nIs the idea of an Internet bill of rights that thinking that Google Facebook YouTube and the rest of the bar less because of the\nDigital town square and therefore everyone should have equal access to it\nI think that's a I think that's a great point um and and it's really instructive here to look\nBack at how the Internet was organized back in the day and in terms of the regulatory structure there was a law passed in Nineteen Ninety six called the communications decency act see da and inception to thirty of that act\nIt basically split the Internet into two categories\nCategory one is the the the company or the entity and this is what Google and Facebook claim is that you are a quote unquote neutral platforms and basically\nArgument here is that all you really are as a telegraph you as a company or conveying information from point a to point B you're exerting no editorial control your not censoring you're not doing any of that if you are a neutral platform\nYou have no regulation whatsoever and you have no legal liability whatsoever the\nOther category of course is if you are a publisher you're exerting editorial control if you are restricting certain voices from being hurt Well Google and Facebook insist that they are neutral platforms\nBut we also know for a fact and they grudgingly admit this but they do exert editorial control so one of the arguments that people have made Senator Ted Cruz is argue this and others is that we should essentially tell Facebook and Google you have to choose\nIf you are going to insist on being a neutral platform you essentially as you just said the caller said\nYou essentially have to allow all voices to operate equally you cannot exert editorial control if you are going to exert editorial control your now for all intents and purposes is\nGoing to be treated in some respects as a media company\nNow Google and Facebook that is the last thing in the world that they want\nBut I think it goes to the heart of the issue that the caller raises which is you know you have a certain set of light particularly if an entity claims to be a neutral platforms\nAnd I think this is probably the direction that the solution needs to go in addition to the question of breaking up these companies like a gym you and I were talking about earlier in the show\nAbsolutely again uh I don't know that that uh anything in our history as ever prepared us for something quite of this nature is this is an intersection\nOf the traditional issues that face notions of of concentrations of a power economic power and and other power coupled with the uh uh incredible powers that go with the twenty first century the digital age I mean this is a a whole host of a of a different a\nDifferent color here I mean for example the steel trust over a century ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe national debt is now over twenty million dollars what happens next rising inflation drops in the dollars value some experts say another crashes coming

freebie lined dot com documentary and uh well what Janine said I I couldn't repeat all that if my life depended on it but to your response\nYeah I mean she means right oh look what people have to recognize is that Google like any other company in the world has to sell a product\nThe product is not the search engine they don't make money off the search engine product that they sell is you you and the reason they want all that information that Janine is talking about she's actually absolutely right about Android Android tracks everything you do even if you turn off\nThe location it tracks you anyway if you turn on the phone off\nOnce you turn the phone on it all loads the information from where you were and where you went even when the phone was off\nThe reason Google wants all this

something to you and we're giving these companies the power to do a lot\nThough it would seem Zack in Durango, Colorado good evening ...\nJim go as you talk to you you have some longtime listener first time caller and I was wondering if you had any ideas\nOn uh I I personally would love to like try to experience\nSome of the ideas that where I can you know find a source from the Internet where I'm not a force to experience biased coverage I mean even in Google Search I have a lot of biased coverage and I realized that um\nI was wondering if you had any advice or ideas on how to try to try to negate that by it\nOh well that's a great question I mean I actually am going to go old school here when I went to graduate school in the United kingdom at Oxford in Nineteen eighty eight to Nineteen Ninety my favorite thing to do is to read three newspapers\nI read the times which was kind of a center right newspaper I read the guardian which was a left wing paper and I read the telegraph which was a conservative paper I think the point when it comes to information is no source is going to be completely biased free\nI think what we have to get used to is the notion of looking at multiple sources and it's also the way we think about information in the news surveys show that because of the Internet because of social media people expect the news to find that\nWe become kind of passive recipients of the news feeds that we get any information we get what I Would say to people is read multiple sources that are different\nCable news don't watch just one channel watched several channels that have different views and really filter in source information don't count on these large companies to shift to to shift and filter it for you because you are going to get results that reflect their interests and not yours\nAll right fair enough enough said let's go to a village Kennedy Washington next to the hello feel welcome\nThank you for having me on\nI just wanted to thank you for your program that you really expanded my horizon in what I think about the way you for your show my question for the gas is\nYou know anything about\nThe closed door hearing that Ted Cruz had with Google while the case was going on because Google didn't show up when Facebook their little hearing and Ted Cruz was really on\nGlobal working or with China\nWe've got we've got thirty seconds here ah do you think about that\nI don't I doubt I Do think it shows Google's a confidence and even arrogance that one where they had the hearings on Capitol Hill they didn't show up\nWhen Facebook and other companies did and I think that's reflective of the fact that they feel like they're going to get past this storm of attention and controversy and I think they shouldn't we need to push for real change\nSharing up All right we'll wrap on that note and we didn't get to project dragging apply but there's a lot of stuff out there and again this is a documentary the creepy line that

no way to confirm someone to the nation's highest score\nWe had many fears that this was a very limited process that would constrain the FBI from getting all the facts having received a thorough briefing on the documents those fears have been realized\nThat Republican Lindsey Graham told reporters he found the process to be right and proper\nAnd confident the FBI did a good job\nWell Graham is a solid yes vote on confirmation key votes are still being counted most notably the votes of Republicans Lisa Murkowski Susan Collins and Jeff Flake Republicans and hope some Democrats running for reelection in red states would cross party lines and vote with the G O P but they can cross Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota off that list\nIn an interview on Fargo television station WBAI Hi Cathy explained why she's voting no\nI Can't get up in the morning and look at the life experience that I've had and say yes to judge Kavanaugh\nThe other red state Democrat running for reelection is Joe

senators including Susan Collins had to be driven home in a police cruiser or they saw their personal information including their home addresses posted on the Internet including majority leader

couple of things to note here what what is the ignorant ... doing running all over Capitol Hill\nI mean if you are going to go up there and disturb the piece you have no business being there\nNone whatsoever I mean I guarantee you a first of all to get into the Capitol at all is not an easy process I don't understand how these people are even getting in there I mean even with press credentials there's not that easy to do how are these people getting in there and why are they being allowed to the notion\nOf our elected leaders being hassled by people who want to scream at them is nonsense\nOne thing about these demonstrators they seem to ignore something yes they have a right to demonstrate under certain circumstances at certain places and certain times but they seem to ignore is that the rest of us have the right to ignore them\nAnd in many cases it is manifestly worthwhile that we ignore them\nIf in fact they really want to bring about awareness of of harassment and the sexual assault Wheldon fine first of all they would find that we all pretty much agree on that it's not a good thing\nOr and so a lot of ah their complaint that they're they're being ignored not not on that issue there or not but when you try to take the notion\nOf people being sexually assaulted and translate that into a well a lot less just get a guy the guy will do because they're all pigs\nThat kind of mindless nonsense that kind of vacuum headed rabble should be ignored totally completely ignored and if necessary if you go on for example are putting out of the personal

fifty years old and I was abused by my babysitter [noise]\nWhen I was six years old and the initial abuse it went on for several years but the initial ... its vividly clear in my mind it's like one of those you know just one of those moments in your life\nThat stands out\nI actually am a member of that but most of us can only imagine I mean this is something that the rest of us you know we we we we say we empathize with you and we sympathize with yeah but we really don't have any concept right well\nShe says she doesn't know where when how and and I I ... that because at six years old I'm fifty now and I can I can ... you know her ... what what sweater she was wearing\nWearing happened what color the blanket that was on the bed that it happened on all that it's it's vividly clear like it happened yesterday\nSo you know they can they can take it for what it is or they can take it for what it is\nI must confess that I tend to I tend to go down your path and I think most people did as they as they heard the testimony this was something that so traumatized or a ... why would the details not be a vivid in their mind again as I say I'll take\nHer editor words that you ... you know take her editor on cigarette or where the use of a lot of people that hurt yeah well he's a psychologist and she helped a lot of people that got hurt\nBut I Hope it helped a lot of people I really do again just to the state by point I'll take her at her word that she's a victim however if you go to go making accusations against people then the I'm afraid I could no longer be understanding about how the details are are a\nA hazy a or fuzzy I just can't I Can't do that if you're gonna make charges and you'd better have the goods or otherwise we have no reason to believe you and I must confess I find what you had to say\nA lot more persuasive rocky than than what Dr report it to say why would these not be just imprinted into your mind every little detail I\nExactly she's she's not a victim she's a predator\nWell I don't buy it when you know the enemy doesn't actually white she's claiming that he did to her why don't the exact same thing\nDon't know the way she is she is a predator and I don't know the fact that she's not a victim again having never been there uh your your your charges easier for you to make because you you have at least been there for the rest of us of course this is simply something that is so beyond our our line of the experience and understanding that that if he says\nIt's it's a hazy in her mind we can only say well maybe as I say I find your statement more credible than hers in that regard but but again that's that's one side of the equation sympathy okay we feel sympathy or somewhat underwent this but if\nYou're going to turn that into a charge against another human being you've got to be more specific and if you just really honestly crush your heart and hope that I Can't come up with details than your testimony is pretty irrelevant maybe you were maybe you were assaulted\nBut unless you've got some from information do just pick some random guy because all men are pigs again that that's that's the problem I have rocky and I again I'm Sorry for what you underwent let's go to Steve and Andrew North Carolina good evening Steve\nHey let's hope you're well yes are you to\nUm I like to help and that this is a legitimate question is because I'm

supposed to come down to in America is there evidence well we all know we all know that the Democrats we all know all all that you know\nThat you know a a a believe the you know what to believe the accuser yeah\nRight oh that is a line that we all know that's a line of BS from the last you know you believe the liberal accused her you don't leave the Republican accuser funds Republican woman accusing it you don't believe that it's only in the cases that\nAre important to them where you believe the accuser we all know it right\nWell otherwise you consider Bill Clinton a criminal or a number of times over\nRight now can I ask another question you know I just mentioned Amy Schumer because of you know people know who she is but the ... model thing\nDescent you buddy give her eye any ability I I Know this probably maybe we mentioned her just once or twice as being joking but why does anybody give her any time\nCredibility whatsoever I've always well then again if you're talking about the left I say you should give somebody credibility by the substance of their argument well that's the case you'd never hear from anybody on the left so I forget about what I just said there well\nI don't know why she's relevant is she in the current show I don't know I actually don't know I don't know why she's relevant otherwise\nI saw what those who's the boss that runs all the time [laughter] you know I'm just kidding [laughter] and she was in the the one with the ... which is\nYeah yeah yeah and so she was a witch right yeah yeah yeah so I don't know I have no idea if she's in a TV show right now or not\nBut I don't know I think she was in something last year I don't I really I mean she's she's relevant\nTo the situation because she claims that she was sexually assaulted so\nNo I don't know that I'll get it I mean I Know I Know you see that in part of it yeah she'll probably ... to ... yeah yeah I didn't know that she said she was sexually assaulted that's what I didn't know okay that makes that would that would be a connection that you could use to gain you know right into this topic because that's what it's about right okay\nBut I I but pop culture wise I don't know she still is or not I actually don't know well as I said you know we because we hear people coming forward you know the\nYou know saying look I've also been I was sexually assaulted two ... and I stand with her well as we said before whether you were sexually assaulted or not still does not give you any more credibility when a charge is filed\n\nOr you know when the charges filed against someone I don't mean legally but in this case a ... in um in his nomination to the Supreme Court but the\nAllegation itself\nHas to be backed up by evidence your case for no matter how an it's an evil it might have been if you were sexually assaulted has nothing to do with this case right\nAbsolutely nothing because you were sexually assaulted does not give you a better insight as to whether Kavanaugh is guilty or not right none zero right and that is portrayed you know it's one of the one falls that's portrayed\nWell then you well okay then you were late here in ... ... because you are sexually assaulted then or what you think about cabinet carries more weight\nNo it doesn't that's ridiculous I it's ridiculous statement to make or to be promoting in its promoted constantly in this you know only thing that matters is the evidence\nIn every Seattle case in you and I talked about this how long have we talked about this when you know whether it was Trayvon Martin where people were taking sides left and right and we just said look here's the problem you've got that was at the two or three or four minutes span there mhm where he was running away\nAnd then next thing you know uh he was on top of ... that's the only thing that people saw at that point and because of that huge blank space in there that no witnesses are there nobody can say what happened so\nThey went by the physical evidence which was the life the uh the the injuries to Zimmerman's head but exactly we've said and even a juror or a jury member said\nIt's possible that he got away with murder it's just that with the evidence we couldn't prove because he claims that you know he felt his his wife was an imminent danger\nAnd and we rejected at that point and the people uh who would call this show and with certainty say they knew the guilt or innocence site and we had people bringing up the Trayvon Martin was in an age doesn't\nMatter whether he was or was not an angel right or any other time of his life it doesn't matter what Zimmerman headset at any time in his life right all the\nMatter is he said I'm going to tell us your what I write Trayvon Martin right when we have been obviously right would have been which are more said in say ... but\nPeople were definitive in their belief of guilt or innocence and\nBased on a lack of evidence and what they think possibly happen we have rejected that we will always reject that as Americans\nAs far as I'm concerned you're obligated to reject that type of yes mindset absolutely go by the evidence the evidence is what dictates\nEverything the motion is what carries the ah the the cause and and and such protests\nAnd and certainly for the families who suffer are the the loss of a loved one weather's a Trayvon Martin's family or or Michael Brown family you can feel for their loss but also know this this this is possible but many people find it impossible\nTo feel for the last of the family but also believe and see by the evidence the what the evidence shows that the evidence points to that person also being responsible\nNow it didn't necessarily in in the in the Trayvon Martin case you had you know what the physical evidence was was ... and then that's what the jury found and we we don't have\nWe don't have a everything the jury saw\nNo no yeah but in the Michael Brown situation with officer Wilson on the scene I'm you know the the family uh what's the first to commission an autopsy\nAnd that autopsies the one that showed the hands up don't shoot never heritage was alive\nIt's still being used today yes as a rallying cry that never happened\nOr that is unacceptable in America right you know we we talk about the Democrats are always talking about the fascist on the right well if you listen to what we believe ... and what we believe about the presumption of innocence whether it's a criminal trial a civil trial or\nJust public opinion in general or a political trial\nStill it's the same thing you judge these cases you judge cases and you'd and and you judge the guilt or innocence based on the evidence that exist not just an allegation alone and and the thing is\nI'm saying this with passion but I really don't have to because every single Democrat listening right now every single liberal and democratic protesting yesterday and they all know it but they are willing to throw it overboard mhm\nYou know how they know what because we're the first ones many of those who are in a you know who were arrested yesterday a will would demand due process under you know due process under the law ... but the fact is they know it but they will reject it when it comes to their personal politics\nFascism leads the mindset of fascism leads in them when it's what they want\nWhen it comes to how they're going to be treated no you must follow the constitution completely\nBut treating somebody else in the constitution be damned the spirit of the constitution be damned the mindset of the presumption of innocence and that evidence is the only thing that leads and should lead is thrown out the window\nBecause we want what we want\nYou know when it comes down to I was following a case here in Texas where a man had been wrongly found guilty of murder and all that and you have a Nineteen years in prison\nAnd got out in twenty sixteen they wanted to be fully exonerated was working to that end and finally it happened it was full exonerated so that's a total of Twenty one years\nWhere he was either behind bars are having his you know his name essentially associated with a murder that happened that he was not responsible for so I was doing some research just to try and refresh my memory on other cases and there was a man who was accused of rape\nAnd spent decades behind bars um it was rape and assault
