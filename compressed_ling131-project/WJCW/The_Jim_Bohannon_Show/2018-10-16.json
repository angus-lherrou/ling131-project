the government does need to do is regulated a different level than they do now you know the health care lobby in Washington is the largest single lobby that's larger than defense larger than guns larger than tobacco\nIt is the largest lobby and and I'm used to say that there are four key drivers in the healthcare system I used to refer to them is the four pillars to the store right\nAnd you have a Uncle Sam who's supposed to kind of set the ground rules of how we need to operate in a in a consumer base society [noise]\nYou have the health care delivery system itself at hospitals doctors hospitals you know pharmaceutical companies you name it\nThen there's the insurance company which is financing all of this and then the last as you and me that consumers right and that can be the employers that are providing health care to their employees to they're operating it from a consumer perspective\nAnd I used to refer to that is the four legged stool I don't anymore I refer to it as the forehead cannibal lipstick dragon now because it feeds off of itself with the consumer at the bottom of the food chain and until we and it's not like we're going to wake up tomorrow in the healthcare system who is recording record profits right now\nIt's going to wake up and say you know what I think we're just going to stop making as much money as we are going to make [noise]\nAnd it's not likely that the insurance company who now as a result of the Affordable CARE Act as incentivized\nFor healthcare costs to go up because again they are acting the role of finance company and so they're not gonna wake up tomorrow and say you know what I'm I'm tired of this average over two hundred percent stock price increase that we've seen since ... the portable care\nSo I really believe this up to two categories\nUncle Sam and you and me and you and me are little culpable in this not specifically talking about huge him but I'm Talking about the American assume or because when it comes to health care is the one thing we don't ask questions about\nThe average American will spend two hours researching a television before they buy it and fourteen hours researching a car but on average spends less than Fifteen minutes researching health care\nSo we have to become more engaged because the system is set up to work against us but we need Uncle Sam to set speed limits on the highway here\nI can go buy a car that drives two hundred miles an hour but Uncle Sam ... not gonna let me go drive at two hundred miles an hour down the road we need to do the same thing the fact that uh intervene IOUs bag or an IV bag\nCost less than a dollar to produce in the United states but his build on average by hospitals over five hundred and forty two dollars that's a fifty four thousand percent markup\nAt some point we have got capitalism in conflict with care and it's gone awry and unfortunately this is one of those areas where regulation does need to come into play\nYeah it really has to do and anybody who who who is opposed to that they had better stop and consider the backlash that we don't do something about things like that we're going to go a whole hog break complete\nA Medicare for all a socialist healthcare system the public is not going to sit back and get a get taken for a ride like this I think our choices between a little bit of regulation or a tidal wave of regulation\n[noise] well we'd have to because you get two things working against us here so again American consumers don't think about accessing the health care system they think about [noise] accessing their health insurance which pays for the health care system well health insurance now for an average family of five is over twenty thousand dollars in the United states\nSo if you're a family of five making fifty thousand dollars a year\nTwenty thousand that go into health insurance because\nMore and more employers are paying less of that 'cause they can't afford it\nAnd then at the same time over the past ten years but ... ... employees have to meet and participants have to meet has gone up over two hundred and twelve percent\nAnd so when you start to factor in these things it's it's I'm paying a lot of money before I get the value of what I'm spending money on\nBecause if something catastrophic was to happen I'm Still going to have to come out a lot of money to get access\nAnd so something has to shift here and and the wife does is is sounding the horn on the Medicare for all and and the challenge with that is you know it's just taking money out of one pocket and putting it into the into another until we get control of the cost within the healthcare system\nEven Medicare for all would not be as it would be insolvent there would be a little way to pay for it without significant tax burdens and again that's not solving a problem that's just taking the money from one hand and putting it into\nThe I agree I don't I don't think that's a viable option but I think many people will consider it an option\nAnd we need to keep in mind the fact that the people are going to insist on a solution and if it's not a little bit of regulation on the type of price gouging you just outlined then it's going to be the whole hog that you just described no that's not a viable solution but if we wind up stuck with it but that would not be good\nThat's exactly right and that said this is the challenge and this is what what I was I was really concerned this past year when when Republicans failed to do something substantive on healthcare\nAnd this is the challenge and listen I I'm a conservative I called Republicans out on this to say you're not coming in with a real plan of action here all the the government has looked at\nIs focused on the health insurance premiums one is a derivative of the other until we start to look at the cost of health care\nHealth care health insurance premiums will continue to rise there is no way to manage them

I'm not a doctor I'm an analyst of the financial markets specific to healthcare and and\nI you know I I can understand from a perspective of physicians saying things in a hospital that ah ah maybe not be the most of quality that you would like to see I Will tell you the second or ... and I actually agree with you from our own studies and what we're seeing which is that oftentimes\nIn the healthcare world today because of the way to hospitals run from a business perspective [noise]\nAh there is almost a quota like structure to treating people quickly with pills that are not going to generate the highest level of revenue in other departments of a hospital for example\nWe we want to focus on treating the high dollar high reimbursement rate procedures and in one like a\nTurning system of quick get them a pill and get them out the door for anybody that can be treated that way and we now call the doctor visit the seven minute visit that that had never leaves the door not they want to give you a pillow and get you out the door so they can move on to the next\nHopefully larger issues that they can refer within the hospital system to generate more revenue for the hospital system which by the way hospital systems now own a very large portion of the physician community\nAnd average studies are showing that the return on their investment when they're buying a physician's practice is roughly eight to one in the United states and so they need to get a return on investment because doctors or their sales force now\nThat she's referring inside of a hospital system to drive up higher MRI costs more tests are more surgical procedures and it really needs to change\nAll right thank you by the way for your call are it's a very great that they should do I understand that your\nDoctors practicing defensive medicine that that's part of the problem here is it not a you know a\nA oh we're going to hang Mayo operation there oh okay yeah better schedule an MRI because I Want to cover my bud against the malpractice attorneys that's clearly a necessary are ought to be that there have to be some measure of tort reform ear\nIn no question that tort reform needs to needs to come into the conversation that the what we're seeing from a I'm a law suit basis and the health care system is just outrageous a and we've gotten to a place where research study in Washington state should that twenty two percent of all tests are unnecessary in today's\nUm US Economy when it comes to health care and so when you look at that and you say well goodness a a a multibillion dollar system that's a six the U.S economy at twenty two percent of it is wasted because of misuse of tests\nNow I don't buy and that all of that is tort related but it absolutely is a big chunk of it if I'm a doctor and I could risk my practice because I miss diagnosed the common flu and sent you home thinking it was an upper respiratory infection we saw it happen a lot this past year actually\nUh where people got very sick from the flu during this last flu season and show you know their\nX ray the tea scan MRI's these tests\nThings are being tested at um apps ... rate where they weren't before and higher highly oftentimes unnecessary and the result is and and that is a direct impact of a need for truth tort reform\nBut also need to drive profits\nOne eight six six five oh jumbo one eight six six five oh five or six to six on the the ... with our guest set dense and is there anything about Obamacare that's worth keeping\n[noise] well it's a couple of the things that I did like about the the Obamacare legislation I liked the fact that insurance companies a cannot impose preexisting conditions on on people\nTo challenge when you're when you're faced with a diagnosis of an issue or a condition and you can't get health insurance can't get access to help you finance that um and and so if I if I were to isolate the single most beneficial piece of the Affordable CARE Act um it was that\nI Wish I think that there were some other pieces of the Affordable CARE Act that make sense it's just an actual practicality they were just\nDone\nThey were they were implemented poorly I mentioned earlier the M. L. our mandate mandating that insurance companies had to effectively\nEvery dollar they collect spun eighty five cents on claims well that sounds good in theory and and most people can get on board with the fact that we don't want to insurance companies to just who owned the market share to just collecting more premiums and I have to pay amount on planes\nBut the execution of the law is just as important as the law itself and it was not written by people that understand how the system works rather was written by the health care lobby the health insurance la Brea in conjunction with Congress\nAnd so when you don't get independent mind looking at it it can go awry because while that provision could be beneficial there instead it needed to be directed more health care delivery system\nAnd when you focus on the percentage without a dollar amount type to it again or going to see is a massive inflation to ensure that profits continue to rise\nOne eight six six by boat jumbo one eight six six five oh five or six to six K calls then glum from a color into Iowa and a good evening Kay welcome good to have you really high\nIn care um my biggest problem ... ...

P. advisors dot com [noise] we have a call from Chuck in Lewiston, Idaho hello Chuck\nHoliday thank you for taking my call what's on your mind I have I\nI'm old enough to older than you guys so I Want to give you some information years passed a used to be that\nThe income tax people were hurt in a a worker pretty bad after a while so the people who own the business decided what they would do is they would give the\nArab people a health care\nAnd it would go up the employers cost they didn't cuss the employee anything Mm and or the government I guess looks that oh well let's take that too because they take care of everything else so\nAnyhow it used to be a way to pay less income tax by the owner\nOr I'd have to act like let's say your guest about that than a jock thank you for the Gulf and it has a change in tax laws are a big part of the problem\n[noise] not really I mean I I'm not going to necessarily just disagree with what Chuck said but there were a couple of key things that have happened you know when employer market when we started to see employers really rise in the healthcare market space and start to provide that as a benefit to employees is really after World War two when\nWhen all the boys were coming home and and there was a they did actually wage freeze\nA where the government well we'll get a wage freeze that prevented employers from going in and and trying to retain a new employees and so you just healthcare is the model to do that the incentive of the tax advantages still absolutely there the challenges of the ... the tax advantage\nHas been superseded by the cost of health care\nSo no longer is the tax advantage equal to or even as much\nOr even close really to the overall premiums of healthcare system and so in some ways I guess Chuck is right because the government or in the way that they're taxing the system and really driving the cost up by not regulating it appropriately\nIs making that the cost far exceed the benefit of the taxes but employers still get the full tax advantage of writing off\nA the health care expenses and technically for the employee and you know any premiums that they're paying for so long as it's run through what's called a section one twenty five plan fried than all those premiums are pre tax as well\nAll right on that note we will love pause stay on the line we will speak off air again the ... and\nOur guest has tried to put things in some perspective tonight as we muddle our way through this entire health care debate with the no immediate answers inside regrettably again the set is co founder and chief strategist at GDP advisors I've jumbo headed on Westwood One\nWho do I find for [noise]\nI just find from the Austin compose music deserves the hang\nPerform for all of a stagehand you\nMake sure I never missed a Q\nA little quieter that taught me to breathe and the guys\nSpeech debate theater using the performing arts teacher bang boom life lessons that typically aren't taught in the classroom they held high school students learn leadership skills that prepare them to enjoy more satisfying productive lives\nTheir minds and this is having a high school debate coach who would become more confident than they ever dreamed pounding\nThis message presented by the tendency secondary school athletic association and the high school in your community [noise]\nCan we just enjoy that arise [noise]\nMarcia gay harden how did you get any are getting older that are being given to me it's really\nLearn how to help reduce some risks to your brain at brain health nut [noise]\nTried cities talk radio station am nine ten WG cw Johnson City Kingsport Brazil [noise]\nChange of heart MS cofounder dies I'm Elliot Francis published reports claim Saudi Arabia may be ready to admit I'm missing reporter was killed won't inside a diplomatic facility in Turkey welcomes the teeny reports\nVisiting Georgia's hurricane ravaged areas President Trump having jumps dispatched secretary of state Mike Pompeo to Riyadh to try to get to the bottom of the disappearance of ... a joke she\nHe's got instructions to find out what happened was talking about the whole situation with Saudi Arabia that you've been reading about I'm sure very much it's a terrible situation there's no question about is how do I get one bit\nSources say the Saudis are ready to acknowledge 'cause she'll she a dissident turned writer critic of the royal family was indeed killed inside the Saudi constantly in Istanbul the scenario that might be offered up is that of an interrogation that got out of hand ... Washington\nEven a or for that matter truthfully for that matter but I mean of course that's that's not a good excuse but that there are men who are are concerned and\nIt's understandable why they would be concerned that at least could be people who would in any other context be quite willing indeed eager to hire women to give them a chance to move up words but again in some of these these\nThe Asians it is very personal executive assistants work very closely and uh with with upper management and that includes traveling together it includes dinners together\nSo I think you can agree that at the very least it's easy to understand the attitude and certainly that's not the intended effect but this could very well be the attitude for men who were otherwise quite predisposed to giving women a break\nA it was self defense mechanism so I'm curious how you feel about this you think it does actually happening if so is it excusable what do you say to men who want to avoid even the appearance of such a conflict\nOne eight six six five oh jumbo is our number one eight six six five oh five or six to six I can easily see this happening even among men as I say who were not just out to a to a lot higher women in the first place but among men who were were predisposed to hire a woman\nWho's a heart was if you will in the right place in terms of seeing two other women got a shot at these jobs\nNow that doesn't necessarily make the me too movement evil although I Would certainly say that it does heads of some consequences and in recent times that uh that drives the movement very much in the direction opposite of what\nAt least was the original intent the original motivation for this I think maybe two came started out with with a very valid motivation that women don't like to be treated badly\nBut it has morphed into accusations being all that are necessary\nUh in in some cases which hundreds and of course of the cabinet case I Would put forward as a prime example because again it was never shown conclusively with cooperation with what Dr Christine forward had to say was in fact the case\nAnd I would vote again what I said before on this program that if someone in fact is actually sexually harassed or assaulted\nEven though it may be a very painful moment that they were tried to ban it from their mind it would be helpful for them if they want justice to make themselves sit down and write down details time places uh\nPeople involved witnesses of details of the surroundings even down to what people were wearing the color of the law was sort of thing any details\nThe more the better otherwise you wind up not really being a victim but making yourself nothing more than a victim just some thoughts I could easily see the hash tag me too movement turning into hash tag not her and that\nIs not sort of what was ever intended by all of this nor is it a good outcome but it is an understandable outcome and I'm not sure that I have any great answers to this but let's talk to some other people here are Jamie in northern Michigan calls then tonight hello Jamie\nHello Tim thank you for taking my call yes ma'am [noise]\nAh I I have enjoyed a male a companionship and working on for many years in New York City and South Florida back in my my early years\nI took a class or Twenty years to raise a family and now I'm back in the workforce again and ah looking for good employment good jobs\nAnd I definitely when this movement started I could see a big problem coming and I do not at all blame men for\nBeing very apprehensive and I do think that cat is a big issue now I feel it when I'm Out there interviewing and such\nA it's a it's got us in a real tight place and it's it's a real shame because the camaraderie I used to have\nWith men in the workforce a was fun and uh sure there were you know certain things that were maybe a little inappropriate or whatever but you know what my mother taught me how to say no or cut that out or whatever\nAnd do the men always accept that\nYes they did they did\nAnd so I don't understand this whole oh poor me I got you know I followed some guy up the stairs at a party and ended up in in our little tussle on the floor with them laughing you know that to me is not attempted rape I'm Sorry if ah\n[noise] that's what she called that she was overdoing it and um [noise] you know gee if I had a nickle for every man who tried to get out\nIn my pants or whatever\nAnd well yeah okay well yeah I'd be a wealthy woman okay but I take it as a as a\nYou know an attack what's your name attached [noise] uh no it wasn't an attack I knew how to handle it\nAnd now I'm not buying it I'm not saying this whole thing and I think that they're overdoing the situation has really hurt women in in many aspects out one of which the real victims\nOf real you know ... a rape and sexual crime by you know there there are really are doing a disservice to women in general and they have for years actually here\nUh I guess liberal women who are not speaking for all of us anyway\nAs we go to the break let me just ask you this in your attempt to reenter the workplace has anyone been honest it up to say a boy Jamie you really would be perfect for this job but the but quite frankly this job requires that we work closely together and I'm just not comfortable with that if anybody been honest or have you run across that\n[noise] ah well low to the guy who would ever say that out\nWell yeah that's true you can sue you could ...\nI don't know and and nor would I because I Am not you know I I\nI liked that kind of honesty and and that would get it on the table you know so that I ... you know talk about that directly\nUm [noise] but ah ... there you know it's there are men are scared and and they should be when this first came out I said this is a war on on that I mean I could see it from the very get go\nAnd uh you know I I don't feel bad about it at all I I Do feel\nYou know like the opportunities for young women coming up are going to be hurt show that shame well\nIt is I Would agree I Want to thank you for sharing your story Jamie and I appreciate that very much what eight six

together by a financial situation you were making a lot of money jihad money is that what we're saying\nWell no she didn't own a business you have a high paying job or anything like that but we were both tenants in the building\nAnd uh but she she brag about her uh her parents who she said were millionaires uh well actually it was her mother she was in doubt child okay she wanted she wanted a ride over to Montana it's like a desert her mom and um\nAnd that was how ... it started\nAs oil and was was money involved at all here I guess or was there pressure it's out I mean are we talking about just another another relationship or right before\nThe horse you know and uh I just she said she had a trust fund and the only thing she had to do in order to get the money was to stay off of drugs and tells you use your ears old\nUh-huh name some good get her money and she would get ... with the kids and she would buy a house okay we were both\nBoth or did you did you like her I mean the\nWell she was very friendly way rash oil and she had a great sense of humor and everything seemed legit\nOkay but I guess what what was the end result here because so far we're just talking about a relationship but I'm not sure that we're talking about a ... a meat to type of circumstance so they'll go ahead\nYeah yeah well they they get another in Montana and uh she was a retired prisons that ... been working in within\nYou know I'm Twenty years and retired and loving and parents and they were very nice country folk in everything seemed kind of fit in with what she told me\nAlthough it doesn't sound like people who would have a ton of money\nWell lo and it's just the idea that they ... they were so grateful I mean they were in the world or well rag okay you know and\nAnd ... this is all very interesting but at what point does visitor into the the area of a of a I guess a work related sexual harassment I tried to understand exactly how this fits into our conversation John\nWell like having a um I ended up being um charged with a felony conviction on local burglary and the other with two assaults\nOn on one on the on on this woman yes ... let's just go to the chase did you did you do these things no okay that that she was she she accused you of ah doing this\nYes why and but the thing was she accused me of the things because I was breaking up a relationship because I was finding out that anything she told me was ally ... and she was involved in drugs and she was hanging around dangerous people\nOkay and I was trying to protect myself I see and I ... I went to court on average right never\nWent to court or any of these charges to face face meat or a jury or judge she was never there\nAt what was the uh the court outcome where you convicted of anything\nYes I was convicted of everything I ended up losing my job and my hopes for career a I ended up losing my reputation I had a I had a person you want me to build a house there was an arrogance wall there's just lots of different things involved my life was just ...\nIn other words what you're saying is it a ... an accusation that was unsubstantiated was sufficient for all of these things to happen to you\nRight it's advocating and it was so bad that I ended up or having a shift psychiatry us and just like her okay she was involved in the mental health system I was in that time of our relationship\nAnd a few of the law that made the mental health system but employed in it as a patient and the patient as a patient okay there are a good ...\nOkay All right and I'm so she never had to appear in court instead who stayed in state in her place for her was a social worker\nAnd let me get this straight here she this woman has as as it middle stability issues and and your defense attorney could get you off on that basis\nYou know\nIt doesn't sound like I mean I I I'm I'm second guessing obviously I wasn't there but it was surface on the surface sounds as though you didn't have a very good attorney\nExactly I well first of all I had a ten thousand dollar cash only bail and um when you're in that situation um you can't you can't get it attorney you have to sit in jail to wait for a jury trial which takes three months\nWhen women do you what do you mean you can't get an attorney of course you you could get an attorney obviously everybody's entitled to an attorney if they face criminal charges that's part of your Miranda rights you have the right to an attorney if you could not afford one one will be appointed for you was this one a point where you\nWere there was a public defender\nExactly well that was that was an attorney do do do you feel your public defender was a inadequate I mean it it sounds like it must have had an error and they they must have been\nYou know I was kind of I Will have led to believe that in mind of fats at first it was just the yeah\nCall and then and then later yeah that was another charge because I was on probation and they said that there was a burglary or they never was wells off yeah but it was a burglary\nWell let's suffice it to say that that that you would have a serious a circumstance and then again now that we we fully understand that I can understand how you would be\nA leery of uh of any ah entanglements even though this particular case there was one that the u._s. ... had a encouraged All right uh again a

hire and fire people uh I can see where they will be coming from\nIt or\nIt would nobody even someone who chose to go ahead and hire a woman in in one of the circumstances nobody could say that they weren't at least filled with a certain amount of trepidation\nYes I've hired this woman she's very good a perfect as an executive assistant it will require it of course that we will occasionally have

world and in particular Saudi Arabia\nWashington lobbying for him is told Saudi Arabia will no longer represent the kingdom as pressure builds over the disappearance of ... go over ... group has been providing the Saudi embassy with government relations and communications counsel for the fear of one hundred fifty thousand dollars a month\nI once asked Bruce ... of those who don't know who he is he ran for the Senate against Barbara Boxer her first time she ran and it and then I became is that I think they told me is chief surrogates spokesman I Would speak for him when he could make an event\nAnd he ... he was poised to win it was fifty fifty I think the weekend before and then\nI'm just thinking about allowed the Democrats are always there's been in their play book I said that last night they saved this thing against them that he'd gone to some kind of clumsy so if you knew Bruce ... such an innocent guy\nHe didn't go there for anything to do with sex or anything like that it was just a place they were going up in fact he was going on I can say this because it came out with\nOne of the hosts set at KBC where I used to be a host\nAnd a seven Ninety KBC and it was just and I said oh you want to go ... and he said yes and the EU is meant to spring on him the last weekend sound familiar with Diane Feinstein or to try to show concern of voters oh look what he was willing to do to go to a unseemly nightclub to put it that way\nSo yeah I just thought of that now they've always had sooner playbook nothing's new\nBut anyway uh he lost that we can and one of the reasons people said he lost his because if\nRemember a George ... a a H Bush had\nOut of California I think in that election that he lost a to Clinton and he pulled out all funds and then they use all of that to make sure box one but it's fifty fifty before that we can and they pull those dirty tricks\nBut he's a brilliant man and I wanted to ask for surgeons in by the way he worked for Richard Nixon and I I think he said this on the air so like I said he was one of the few that said don't don't resigned don't give this thing up\nYou you you remember some people think Nixon was impeached it wasn't um peachy he withdrew for the sake of the country even though a lot of people thought Richard Nixon was was pretty bad but Bruce that I went with him there and I I tried to convince them not to resign but he said no we're going to do for the sake of the country anyway I asked Bruce once almost beat Barbara Boxer for the U.S Senate from California\nIf he thought God was involved in the founding of our country\nBruce always taught me something whenever he was on and he answered of course\nDid you ever think how young the founders were and how they got almost everything right\nAnd it was it also Providence I Would ask myself that we got George Washington when we needed him so badly remember they wanted to make him king if you know your history and he turned it down and you know set up I'm going to retire or president says okay that's enough\nAnd Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan when we needed the most you wouldn't get any argument for me about golf involvement\nAnd now I think you're going to take somebody that I think I'm Crazy we got Donald Trump with all those personal shortcomings when the country needed him most as long as I say you know Providence I don't know but I wouldn't you wouldn't get any argument for me\nYes see one and I was a strong supporter of his during the general election of course that doesn't say much either considering\nWho he was running against right and I remember many of us thought we would be very satisfied if President Trump would just nominate conservative judges that that was enough especially for the Supreme Court we all are a lot of people I knew thought hey that would work for me that's that's enough right there and I think a lot of people across the country felt that way [noise]\nSo I thought we were way ahead of the game when he appointed a Judge Gorsuch to the U.S Supreme Court but he didn't stop there and I'll just mentioned some of them are things he's done and I mentioned a much bigger list last night ending the bomb a care mandate\nOpening up the Keystone Pipeline remember Obama wouldn't do it and I n war reserves and in countless regulations hurting the economy and the proof is how well the economy is doing\nA significant tax cut lowering our taxes and simplifying the tax forms by the way it was ... and the same one I mentioned who years before his time say we should be able to fill out or a tax returns on

withdrawing from the disastrous Iranian deal I didn't talk much about that last night can imagine we paid them hundreds of billions of dollars under fifty billion under Obama gave them secret cash in

the ones killing our soldiers right now we give them money to aid them to\nHurt us and hurt our people\nThat alone I mean it's incredible eight six six nine to read and I want to know what you think about the Iranian deal is incredible eight six six same number nine o seven thirty three thirty nine meeting with Kim all young to possibly reduce the denuclearization of the ... and then Sheila getting American remains returned from North Korea\nAnd making sure our borders means something I admit that hasn't been solved yet\nWe're gonna talk we didn't last night about the the Marshall people from Honduras up to request asylum that's going to be a winning a situation for him to deal with and I'm saying that obviously sarcastically\nAppointing countless conservative justices lower court's not\nRight you watch federal judges in the you know the ninth district which is a crazy district who gets overturned the most saying things like a you know he was from getting the president can't do is you can't do that as a Muslim ban and all this kinda stuff and they've taken power and their own hands well some porn that he points these lower court judge a federal judges to\nAnd of course the naming now of his second Supreme Court choice another conservative Brett Kavanaugh the list goes on and on\nAnd the American people love that he's not politically correct\nThe American people are tired of all those politicians who spin and spin and spin and are afraid to see what they're really thank you so maybe he does too much but at least you you get people love his honesty or at least he says what he means\nYou can never say that about President Trump that he doesn't say what he means he may say too much\nBut he never says two little I came up with that one he's one of the most conservative presidents in my lifetime he's done a great job and most of the American people get it but it doesn't matter to the left or to Democrats or the comrades in the media\nI'm afraid to tell the left the Democrats and liberal listeners will call me let me know what you think and I said last night I bet it's said softly if the presidential election were held today President Trump would easily be reelected\nHe's kept most of his promises and the American people appreciate that and he is resonating with the American people more than ever\nAnd I don't know if you feel the same way I think each day is becoming more and more presidential he's growing into the job if you remember Harry Truman to replace the FDR and people set off a thing I teach government history too so I Know some of the stuff and they said oh he's going to be awful terrible but they said she grew into the job also\nYou're dreaming by the way if you think he's going to be defeated I just want it tells you cut out there on the other side you will fail to get rid of him but not from lack of trying you start in the day he won that it's so obvious now\nActually we know they started the resistance against them much before election day what it wants to election day came they couldn't believe that this so called bumbling fools had one\nAll right he was so bumbling but he's still one right no matter what the upper lead or of the FBI and the Justice Department may have guaranteed right where we've seen the text between page and struck and all that stuff\nHe won I don't know about you but I was teaching in that time at night and I was almost in tears when I heard he won Pennsylvania which was always seems to me like Republicans fools goal you know we're going to wait at this time going to win Pennsylvania we got it down\nAnd not only did he win but despite their best efforts he won he is still here and he's going to be here for six and a half more years no matter the Mahler persecution I okay\nProsecution so persecution to me no matter the hostile media media no matter the never Trump voters which I can never understand them no matter all the elites and the swamp President Trump is still here\nWhich never should have happened according to them and despite their best efforts to destroy him including getting a special prosecutor appointed and I fault attorney general sessions for that I'm going to talk about that more later he should never have recused himself he played into the Democrats hands\nPoliticians typically talked our adversaries that's not a big deal to talk to them many of talk to the Russians including a bomb and you remember Obama promising off Mike the things would be better when he got re elected not to get you know make more stuff happened\nI've been a big supporter sessions when he was a senator but I'm disappointed in his jobs attorney general and disappointed his lack of oversight Rosenstein but more of that later\nSessions should've made amends by fire Rosenstein especially if he threatened in grad school staffers did you hear that he threatened them as they help their bosses conduct oversight\nAnd justice disappointed by the way is the new FBI direct to almost nonchalant attitude about corruption in his agency that amazes me\nThis is all gotten way out of hand and it was clear to many people by now that Mueller's investigation is a witch hunt in search of a crime\nIf anything there was a soft coup to get rid of President Trump perpetrated by the highest ... or our government at the Justice Department and at the FBI and I'm not sure until all the dust settles and this is my prediction if we won't find President Obama's fingerprints all over the you wait and see\nWe're we're never supposed to find out about the subterfuge because
