later had to walk a few extra blocks CBS is discussing internally whether to evacuate the building there's nothing there but there's a general sense of unease about what may or may not happen what's actually going on\nAnd as the story unfolds both internally decisions are being made whether do we evacuated or not is there a threat\nDo we shipped everything down to DC and pull everyone out of the New York bureau massive decision ultimately the decision was not to do that but I only describe that to give listeners an indication of as we're covering a story we're trying to be adaptive\nA potential threat that is part of the story and that's a different sort of place to be in it's highly unusual people in journalism grow accustomed to lots of unfamiliar and unpredictable and unforeseen circumstances this would certainly fall into all of those categories\nAnd there were a couple of special reports that delayed this presentation I was going to make and we all worked around it and we all went through the day and by mid afternoon\nMidtown Manhattan things that it regained a sense of normality and more was being learned about what these devices were we don't know their origin and we don't know their intent but we know that crude though they were there still explosives and therefore they're serious\nAnd and the story full stop their bombs they're meant to harm or intimidate or terrorize or do something\nTo change the daily routine of either political figures or journalists or both and that's a moment to evaluate and talk about and try to learn more about\nIt's never comfortable for a reporter to be a part of the story\nNever never end and you do everything you can to not be a part of the story but with a circumstance like this you also have to\nHave a serious and probing conversation with a relevant authorities and your own security team about what the threat is and how do you continue to protect your employees while you covered the story\nAnd that's a dimension you don't frequently deal with now\nIn a war torn areas of the world in places where a press freedoms are tenuous and the situation is violent and there is either wild cat or guerilla violence this is not uncommon it's uncommon in America it's uncommon in New York but it was a part of today's experience\nI can recall window this program originated from the CBS bureau in Washington are back in the days of the anthrax scare and I remember how that plays reacted to the courts so we had no idea that any package we received and I am among those in this business who receive a lot of\nOf packages of various types and or or you may see something on it like a publishers name or something but a lot of packages that you cannot absolutely verify the or the sender and that that made us all rather careful for quite a while\nThey made everyone careful for very long while and that anthrax scare at that time when people sort of forget the proximity certainly in DC of these events you at nine eleven anthrax and then a short time later you had the DC Sniper there was a period of time in DC and I remember it vividly of about a year and a half where the sense of\nEither low level of dread or menace or external factors that added to your daily life I stress level and an anxiety level that was not just about you as a journalist but he was just a resident of this general area it felt very heavy at that time and I'll never forget that\nOne of the ... and and it was really held it created\nDifferent mechanisms and ways to evaluate security and a lot of things changed in the city and\nA lot of different companies in terms of badges or security personnel parameters and the like\nWrite a one eight six six by boat jumbo is our number one eight six six five oh five or six to six CBS News the White House correspondent major Garrett is our guest\nLater we'll be talking about his new book Mr Trump's wild ride which is to say the least and entertaining and informative read or write now Steve calls in from Lebanon, Pennsylvania and Steve a good evening and welcome\nThank you thank you Jim ... thank you made her all by calling on a two things I Want to point out the envelopes at a job right and if you look on the front of that ad below\n... right next door the stamps are there's no almost mark symbol labeled on their way you see on every other package or be sent to the u._s. mail\nAre you saying that he was not cancelled the stamps were not canceled\nWhile there are six steps up all around there yeah but that they were not canceled by by the postal service is what you're saying while thing\nWasn't it has its stamp on there All right it doesn't look like ...\nYeah I ... I think major may know more about this go ahead major\nWell it it it doesn't look as if it's been process that your point ... that it looks like he was just dropped off yeah or\nSee exactly and in other words and had stands for no reason because it uh it it was not apparently delivered by the postal service is the way it appears right I mean ordinarily you get mail it it's been it's been process but the postal service of the stamps had been cancelled so they won't be used again\nAnd let me ask the caller what you had to do some that are what do you think about\nThat yeah okay yeah go ahead or if you would Steve how do you what conclusion do you\nThink about that is that it obviously didn't go through the postal service had to go somewhere else or somebody hand delivered it and put it there\nNow that's something that's got to get looked into to my other thing is when there's usually like a bomb scares stopping the media network shows or for video what the problem it's like we see it numerous times now and they report\nNow there are actually show you know what it looks like so how many copy cats are you going to get out of it [noise] with is going on\nAll right interesting thought it has anything about the coverage of the story major Garrett made you worry that the media may have aged copycats\nWell no not in the sense of uh of copy cats in the sense of the caller is referring to\nWhat historically and I and I know a little bit about this 'cause I covered law enforcement for the better part of six years and the very first part of my career I was a police reporter in three different cities\nAnd there was back then and up until very recent history and the preponderance of information that is highly specific\nAnd very detailed on the Internet a sense within law enforcement look the less we publicize the details of these things the fewer copycats will have well most in law enforcement would say largely that cats out of the bag technologically and otherwise on the Web\nSo there's there's a lower threshold about that in general but one thing I Would say about the coverage they and and again I was moving around and doing other things are promoting my book entree and so I didn't see everything continuously but look when you know\nThat the device is no longer a threat to people and you know that it's been isolated and it's a safe place it's being driven some where do you really need\nMinute by minute coverage as the vehicle makes its way through one exit ramp and onto another exit ramp and the sort of idea that we're never going to take the camera off the situation 'cause it's still scary when it's actually not\nI Do think that there's a tendency to saturate people with images that look scary but in actuality are part of a procedure to make things safer not less scary and the media I think in general would be wiser and better off\nDuty amplify that sense if that's even aware of this of the threat when it knows and law enforcement is told them it was a dangerous situation it isn't any longer and the process is playing out now is not only typical but incrementally by movement and by moment\nSafer not less safe we should convey that more accurately I think\nFair enough more to come up with I guess the major Garrett he is of course the CBS News chief White House correspondent and as we're originally and still to talk about his new book Mr Trump's wild ride it as as comprehensive a look at this a two year hunk of recent history as I've seen to date\nAnd we will get to that but certainly this story warrants our immediate attention and

with CBS News chief White House correspondent major Garrett Mr Trump's wild ride is his new book and we have a number of calls which I'll get to the second but one thing I wanted to know right here early on\nIn the campaign season two years ago I made no to the fact that the Republican Party was facing a hostile takeover bid and it appears that you saw that as well there was a rally that occurred\nWhen a house Speaker Paul Ryan attended a Trump rally and he was the fact you rally after the president elect a yellow thank you rally in West Alice Wisconsin just outside of Milwaukee\nAnd Trump arrived refused to campaign with Trump thinking about it for them over the Republican twenty ... vice presidential nominee would not be seen in public with the party's twenty sixteen nominee rioted never attended a Trump rally before\nHe knew he had to show up to try and all their relationship Ryan stood on stage before more than seven thousand jubilant placard waving Trump supporters\nAnd more than a thousand of whom stood in sub freezing temperatures for more than six hours and Ryan said\nI recognize maybe ten people in the crowd I've been doing Republican events practically all my life and I didn't know any of these people these were not Republicans they were Trump voters I Wonder how many other prominent Republicans major Garrett reached the same conclusion at some point\nThey did and they do and you're seeing that play itself out in the mid term elections where whether or not it is helpful or not Donald trumps the dominant issue and he's basically telling Republicans ah I'm In and\nYour race I met and I'm going to defend me I'm going to defend what we've done I'm going to make myself front and center in your race and what's different about that is usually\nThe in party suffered some losses in mid term elections the first time around and some candidates say you know Mr President you're a little hot I'd like to run by race on local issues and to find things on my terms and stay out of it\nAnd sometimes at work sometimes that doesn't but usually the\nPreference of the candidate the incumbent has something to do with what the president does now\nTrump's like nope I'm In I'm fully and I'm going everywhere I'm campaigning this election\nMid term is going to be ... just about as ... as much about me is twenty sixteen was and\nBy doing that he believes he's signaling to Republicans and Republican voters that he's strong and not afraid and they should be strong and not afraid as well and not be downcast and less energized and they might otherwise be and\nIn the last two or three weeks as he suspected and his hunch always tells him that projection of strength that protection of I'm not backing down has a certain positive effect among those who identify with and are believers in\nThe Trump approach and the energy level part of its Kavanaugh but also it's part of the president so deeply personalizing this choice it has in some cases and in some races at the margins improved Republican prospects\nWill soon see if the President Trump does in fact have coattails let's talk to a Maggie who calls in from Alexandria, Virginia tonight for major Garrett author of Mr Trump's wild ride hello Maggie\nThank you for taking my call I'm Sorry I was or their own for a little bit though Catholic I had a question regarding a parent I mean apparently type bumped situation is it possible dish maybe a provocation you know apparently able to Democrats are designed to make Republicans look bad you know\nUh well I don't suppose we can totally keep that out of the the realm of the possible major it's interesting that that\nEither the bomber who was a very uh uh uh adapt or a wanted to make sure that nobody got hurt or must confess that many balls the guy the seven at last count and uh and and none of them went off\nRight so so that's a noble a it's certainly a a a point of conversation certainly makes people wonder and in this climate where\nThere's a sense that a political motives and political actions can run the gamut a nobody knows we're gonna leave that to the professionals who deal with this and one thing we do know and law enforcement already said this out loud because nothing happened to these devices there's lots of evidence to scrutinize\nAnd one thing I Want to mention Steve called at the beginning a show about why we're there there's no processing that uh the New York a law enforcement officials have told my producers and others and CBS that was a career delivery so it looked like it was a uh some of the it was male but it wasn't it was a simple courier delivery straight to that\nTo John Brennan care of CNN so that's why it didn't have the processing stamps of a male facility that had gone through because I never did it was a carrier drop off that would explain that one of the motives behind that nobody knows but law enforcement is on this\nTrust me everyone wants to know the source motives and means by which this happened but\nDevices that can explode or devices that can explode\nAnd that has to be remembered\nSo they went off or not is important but that doesn't deemphasize the threshold importance the original importance that they could have and they represent a threat and the means by which psychologically to change reality and that's a fact\nWhat six six five oh jumble and we'll take more calls you up and I want to get into some of the the real substance in the book Mr Trump's wild ride paid Seventy one\nAnd you make note of the fact that rock Obama ... two days before the election you ride to Trump flew to Washington to meet with Obama and the White House in their private meeting\nObama gave Trump specific advice about building his team a warning Trump that he would get a lot of advice in here for a lot of a leader as many of whom\nWould have agendas that didn't necessarily fit with his go with your gut ... Obama advised\nThere'll be overly swayed by your advisors even those closest to you you won your instincts served you will trust those instincts and pick people who you what and who you trust but it did then he added there's one thing I Want to warn you about stay away from Michael Flynn he's bad news interesting\nYeah and that is as I say in the book those aren't direct quotes I don't have the direct quotes guess what I was in the oval office when President Obama and president elect Trump had that meeting but it has been faithfully and I believe accurately convey to me by various sources you spoke with both parties meeting president elect Trump and President Obama\nAfter the fact and I think that is a very accurate rendering of that conversation\nAnd I explained in the book that it it was important to jump on two levels and hard to read\nOne respect one he was grateful that President Obama took him seriously as a president elect said you won and you're going to fill out your a cabinet and you're White House staff\nAnd you should rely on yourself I'm\nPaying you the respect you've already earned by being in this office with me and I'm telling you as someone who is filled the slots cabinet and otherwise you're going to get all this pressure and you get all these people yanking your chain to try to do things go with what you think you believe in what you think you know and what works for you\nPresident elect Trump appreciated that like wow I'm already being taken seriously and giving ... given ... real practical advice by sitting president on the other hand he gets this Michael Flynn thing\nAnd he wonders well are you sitting up here or what is this about why you just picking this one guy had you know I like him you know he was a surrogate of mine\nI Know you fired him President Obama when he was head of the defense intelligence agency because Michael Flynn thought you weren't being aggressive enough on counterterrorism I didn't think so either so I agree with Flynn not you jump really had a hard time as president elect processing this bit of information and yet as the book unfolds and as we all remember\nThere was a very short and very turbulent time with Michael fled he was bad news and it didn't work out and in retrospect now President Trump looks back on that in the main as a valuable conversation\nBorder cub major Garrett our guest Mr Trump's wild

the general as we're talking with CBS News the White House correspondent major care of your author of Mr Trump's wild ride and then we have a call from Josh in Wichita denied hello Josh\nOh Jim though as as you hear that pleasure talking with you I don't know the things that I was curious about is why early on and there was a almost uh\nAlmost childish reporting on on a silly things like um well for one the or the physical exam a that was an hour long discussion on on how great I'm a ... fitness was versus Trump and\nUh it it almost shirt Olson a display I'm In ... and when the media it'd be better served if they just covered him straight there's plenty of ...\nThe legitimate policy disagreements that that can be lashed out\nAll right and the limited time that we have here let's have a major respond to that did the media a missed their target in in some of that early coverage\nAre you there are major uh\nOh well [laughter] I don't know where he wet either [laughter] but I\nYeah let's let's let's find out if a major law whether it's\n\nA I really hope he is I guess we'll call him back I uh I'm not sure uh [laughter] uh ...\nWhat the disappearance was but we'll we'll try to get an answer for that and uh as time allows though we might get another call in here we'll we'll have to wait and see but again major Garrett\nOf CBS News chief White House correspondent is the author of Mr Trump's wild ride is a a published by all points books and the subtitle D thrill June screams and occasional blackouts of an extraordinary presidency\nAnd uh I Would uh would trust that will have major back on a hearing any second now that would be by by by fervent hope [laughter]\nBut sure we'd ordinarily lose against right like that right in the middle of a of everything\nBut uh uh I Would I Would say that for my own take Josh that or I Would tend to agree that there I think was a certain amount of frivolous coverage\nAnd uh that uh yes it would have been more helpful had there been greater concentration perhaps on a on issues that the things of uh we've got major get back there we lost you for a second sir\nSorry about that I don't know what happened some grumbling got an assist\nEither it's kind of weird anyway the call Josh from Wichita I'd ask you about things like coverage uh uh the relative physical condition the presidents Obama and Trump he felt that there was frivolous early coverage of of the president this president\n... whether he was well or just stand yeah was he was basically yeah right\nYeah and and I said it numerous times in my book came out right around the time that you none of us up it came up this all about the twenty Fifth Amendment I never came across any of that at all reporting I did for the book\nI never believed that that was a serious thought process by anyone who at any serious power or influence or ability to see the president on a day to day or our our basis so I can understand why colors wonder about that and think or what does this come from what's the basis of that\nAnd one of the things up and tell people just because President Trump is different and those differences are so visible and so obvious doesn't make each and every one or even a majority of those differences necessarily or obviously bad they're just different\nAnd one of the things I think and I recommended by media colleagues all the time is take the differences one at a time\nTrying to learn about them and then try to put them in the context of our politics and don't necessarily say just because it's different\nIt and it looked so different to you it's therefore if so facto bat that doesn't serve journalism it doesn't serve the public\nYou know a well that does the electorate type please stay on the line we'll speak unfair but suffice it

Republican congressional leader who in fact was shot by someone\nAs a he attended a a a congressional baseball game practice so we should I think to keep in mind that just which party has had more people engaged in such behavior and which party has been notably absent in the condemnation of some of those things\nAre we're talking with Dr John Hubert he is a clinical forensic psychologist chairman of mainstream of mental health\nAnd here tonight to take a look at just about the kinds of motivations that might be involved here are obviously a doctor Hubert uh we come from a variety of angles that at this stage we we don't know which ones that could be someone who genuinely hates the Democratic party officials\nAnd who set out bombs which were apparently rather inadvertently put together or you could be someone who was trying to make this look like a conservative hit job on liberals and deliberately made packages which did not go off\nAgain uh we don't know at this juncture of that much about the devices and of course the individual involved but\nUh do examine motives here you have to look at it from a variety of directions\nHere he is actually correct and what we do know is either either direction that's coming from whether the whether somebody is truly after the Democrats or somebody who's truly after getting the Democratic voters out either way they're using fear to motivate that\nAnd that is by definition an act of terror because you're terrorizing people to move to action\nOh absolutely no question about that so we can start by saying that the person is a terrorists will pretty much I suppose by definition\nRight that that's what I Would say Yes sir exactly right and that that creates a lot of confusion and a lot of people's mind because you know we all have this thing we want to live we don't want to die\nAnd putting those bombs together and itself is inherently dangerous and what that tells us is that the people or individual who did this was having to overcome their own fear of death versus their own desire for meaning in their lives and that's a pretty scary thing when they're willing to go to that extreme\nIt deep or when you are willing to put together bombs\nIt would be well to remember that dealing with bombs in any way shape or form deep using them handling them making them\nThis is a is tricky work and we're talking about things which cannot always be precisely controlled one slip up sometimes one one a momentary quiver of the hand good made the difference between life and death so that's another factor that has to be weighed in here\nAbsolutely and you know this this was obviously these are not made in a factory and was not made in a laboratory this was may probably in somebody's garage workshop where there's thousands of things that could mess up the balance and maybe that's a good thing maybe that's why they didn't go off or maybe\nThey really weren't Mitt to actually go out they were just myth that scare everybody but either way they're trying to\nCreate a ... a a feeling of terror and violence\nOne eight six six by boat jumbo our number one eight six six five oh five or six to six Dr John Huber I guess they clinical forensic psychologist and David calls in from Creston, Iowa hello David\nHi thanks for taking my call ... or a I wanted to ask the dog you know here in the way this thing is going on with the bombs went off and stuff\nAre these ... these people that are sending their the person that sending that\nReally has a mental problem you know I mean these people are just a a a return I don't think they go offering makes them feel they will go up is because it's kind of like a it gives them a thrill to know that it actually or why they're you know whether it was going to go off or not and like you said it was kind of a terrorist act\nThat are all we need is a copycat to go through that so if somebody else out there just like well look how easy that was you know he would probably want somebody else in the bombing in a like you get started and they dislike causing more problems you know ...\nWhat it is certainly one line of thought to David obviously at this juncture we just don't know I'm sure that the authorities have looked over these bombs very carefully ended up by now they have a pretty good handle on whether or not they were just in that play assembled or if they were deliberately assembled not to go off\nSo again they would know more now than we would in that regard [noise]\nWhat kind of person to a doctor Hubert\nFields so compelled to act in this way or that that ah that they obviously feel that their viewpoints transcend those of others than others other viewpoints or not to be simply counted at the ballot box but uh that his viewpoint is uh to be a triumph of the most uh\nA maneuver he must manipulate others in order to uh uh to emphasize his views over those if anyone else [noise]\nWell what what we actually found out and and what research we've been able to do because most terrorists we catch tend to end up being dead um\n... what we do know is that most of them are not pathological they're not going to show up with some kind of psychosis and things like that typically if they have those types of disorders it's very difficult for them to to put\nEvery team together in the action\nIf you think about this you know geographically all these homes that everywhere that this happened today we're in different places so it takes a took a very coordinated effort to have them all arrive at the same day\nSo that tells me that it's probably not just one person now this was just the radical I have a I don't know any inside information or anything else but it tells me that is probably a coordinated effort with multiple people\nBut regardless what we do know about individuals who who commit terrorist acts as they can to feel very angry and Ellen\nAlienated very disenfranchised they tend the are being driven by ideology either religion or political\nThat and are in this case we would probably say that I'm their political involvement\nAnd whether at politically doesn't give them any power to affect real change they've got one vote and that's not enough for this individual um we tend to see that they have themselves as some kind of idea identity of being a victim of some sort of social injustice\nAnd that they're trying to take action against that injustice that kinda helps and logically or rationalize the effect if they killed somebody why they did it um they also tend to fill a a very specific need to take action instead of just talking about the problem [noise] um\n[noise] they believe that engage in violence against the state is not an immoral action and they can have family and friends who are very sympathetic to the cause although they may not have that much uh involvement as this individual does but there's enough there to keep that Dr motivated\nUh they believe that joining some kind of movement offers them some kind of reward a adventure camaraderie and some kind of sense of identity so those tend to be the main things that for individuals within that situation\nOr to kind

including members of the first family the postal inspection service says it's working with law enforcement the FBI is the lead agency over this investigation as the president has addressed the suspicious packages intercepted around the country\nOr earlier this week and on Wednesday as well they were sent to a variety of people over president's rock Obama and Bill Clinton do former attorney general Eric Holder billionaire George Soros the packaged to see it it was the rest of the former CIA director John Brennan\nAnd also a congresswoman Maxine Waters and former vice president Joe Biden\nAuthorities also intercepted suspicious devices\nFor the Florida office of democratic representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz and California Democratic representative we mentioned Maxine Waters\nAnd uh the San Diego union Tribune evacuated it's building on Wednesday afternoon suspicious package was spotted outside\nSo a a widespread effort it's interesting that a package was sent\nTo the office of the Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman jokes\nAt the same time that that her return address was on the package that was delivered to CNN although it was the address to a former CIA director John Brennan so a a series of a interesting circumstances here and again we're dealing with either a bomber who was very an apt\nTo send a bomb was not one of which went off or are they sent them out\nIn an effort to to not have the go off that in other words did with some kind of a deception\nAnd to distract you we just do do you thoughts thoughts on that Dr Huber\nWell you know that that reminds me of of ah the article I read and actually the journal of terrorism and political violence a background two thousand six two thousand seven where they talk about terrorism as being basically a tool and you can use that\nTo any any constructive manner that you as a terrorists effect and you know not having them go off can be just as effective as having him go off especially when it's\nIn this twenty four hour news cycle where we have news on all our social media new and it's not just that the headline news\nAnd I recognize that we may very well be in the process of being used on the other hand we can't just ignore it began to sweep it under the rug that would be irresponsible so even as we had knowledge of the fact that we are compelled to report on it we can't just pretend it didn't happen at the jury and adult in Alabama now hello Jerry\n... young men although we're fine thank you\nGreat dairy I well you just about a a set of a thing that I was going to say about that Washington shows if my name or Tibet all that return address that have been kicking him a door\nMaybe they are reasonably certain that it did not come from ... view of the fact that she was also the recipient of such a package and nearly the name of the former Democratic national chair was intended to convince the recipient in this case John Brennan are treated seriously and to to open it\nBut yeah you're probably right somebody totally unknown such as yourself perhaps they would have been at the very least knocking\nOr rather addicted lead your door that's true [laughter]\nAt the very least and and and something else too yeah if you look at it\nThat hadn't been able to get a ... going\nThat ain't the women how to many pro nowadays they who\nThey being the Democratic liberal ...\nWell what do you mean they haven't been able to get a movement going they got a pretty large movement going if you hadn't noticed\nWhile while I Do notice that and I probably read it was all nobody noticed that any more\nI Know that they they very much want people to notice that they have a large move but since we have this thing called an election that's coming up\nUh [noise] so I don't think that's the directly responsive to the the problem here although the person who said these bombs or may have tried to have any impact on the election the problem is that the judge or it's hard to tell exactly what was the intended result that Linda in Champaign, Illinois hello Linda\nHi I'm Kim I tried to get in the last hour and I didn't but I I Will say something and I think maybe that Dr ... might want to comment on it and that don't that last hour you had a caller who said that\nThat maybe it was ... um kids kids keep a to get people's mind off of one thing on to something else while I think he wasn't talking about the FBI mind he was talking about the mind that the public in other words create a distraction\nWell he brought up to say that it was happening\nOn a he bought two things one is that the FBI would suddenly drop everything that it was currently doing in Russia over to investigate this is our guest noted quite correctly the FBI\nIs a little bigger than a share of Taylor and and Barney or they've got enough people to walk and chew gum at the same time that would be more attacks that could have a second as regards the public uh we also noted\nThat if it was designed to take attention away from the caravan marching through Mexico that obviously won't work because of the caravan as an ongoing story and it'll be a story long after this has faded from our consciousness so\nI found both houses of the analysis on that particular colors part\nTo be shaky maybe we were talking about a a bomber who just didn't think this through very well but I didn't really there half of that was particularly well thought out\nIt could have been a distraction from something else\nTo I'm not sure what would be is that I'm just saying it's not something you have to think that\nWell I I Do I Do think about it but I'm the leaking you about it right now what exactly uh\nWell this this uh these attempts do that that will take our minds away from something else this thing is in in less than we suddenly discovered something weird like\nOh I don't know the the Saudi prince was behind these bombings or or or bombs or something weird like that this is going to go away in a couple of days I'm going to be right back back in the mid term election campaign and the caravan and all the other stuff out there so you know Linda I'm trying to think of what it was that this will distract from\nAnd I don't know but I always\nJust look at that because these things can happen and it and we have a look back before and seen that that has been ... seemingly detonate\nIt could be out but I did look at all the you know you\nKnow I appreciate your thought I again I I look at it from the standpoint of if it was designed Dr Huber to take our attention off of something\nWhat would it possibly be because it clearly couldn't be the caravan which will be a story long after this bomb thing has gone away it can't be the midterm elections that's Thirteen Days away and we're going to be all elections all the time leading up to that point so maybe Linda's right maybe there was an attempt to describe it is for something\nBut what could it be ah that ah that we're going to forget about it and the next couple of days which is about how long it's going to take us to forget the bombs\nExactly well historically terrorists and terrorism was used to uh oftentimes ah terrorize a culture or a specific population and what that often did was you know is wage that people's fear of a cultural annihilation and and usually\nRoute well and those individuals

about it two days ago George Soros he got his bottom in the mail right\nAnd the other thing was heard about it for all the other day and then all the lemurs ... their head up a whole another six bombs governor mail the very next day and everybody goes round up the cliff\nWell let's face it now if in fact six or seven prominent people receive bombs in the mail that's not the kind of story that you just sleep under the rug it's a story\nAt all I'm not saying sweep thrown to the right I'm saying that the ... they they left that layer long enough to where everybody paid attention and then boom here we go now let's all the lemurs go run off the cliff together\nYeah but I mean I put it this way I I don't know if you you think that we are a lemur we are simply discussing what happened\nUh again we don't know why it happened we don't know who did it we don't know how many people were involved with their ... motivations we don't know if they were simply inept bomb makers or deliberately made them not to go off there's a lot we don't know that makes it difficult to know exactly what the motivation was pet\nThey were obviously not made to go off and no nothing obviously not the only way to do that it is obvious would be the FBI they haven't said yet a Dr Huber\n[noise] there there there is nothing obviously this point because we don't know but if we think about this whole process you know ... water things we can do to to stop this and and I think it's kind of a three pronged approach we have to look at it attack intellectually we have to talk about\nWhat this does that how we react to it we gotta talk about the emotional about it and then we got to do that social component that that emphasizes the fact that that\nThis type of of violence against civilians in our society or just\nUnacceptable period and and that's part of why I think where you're trying to talk about is that you know we don't know enough about what's going on so what we need to do it means to collect information\nAnd you know the FBI is doing that they've got this information you know I can I can talk about how they did the the Austin bomber they kept ball that to their chest and they didn't tell anybody what was going on and they were successful catching the perpetrator and I think\nThis is what they're doing here and I have to commend them for not going out and telling everybody what's going on that but\nYeah I Would totally agree the you're the unfortunate fact of course is that there is a significant\nSubset of the American public\nWhich in many ways does not believe that uh that such a

Missouri hello\nAgain\nI don't care if it's less ... or ... bright orange elements I don't care who you're killing next for whatever reason it's just that of all I remember when you add the Unabomber was table is hurting people killing people\nYeah his bombs went off\nYes they did and I don't care what the bond is the bomb has a potential for exploding and hurting someone\nAnd I I think it's one of the worst cowardly acts that anybody can connect and whoever is getting this club the FBI catch it and I hope they are prosecuted to the full extent of the law\nWell I think it's safe to say that uh if uh if apprehended they will be prosecuted to the pool and extended the law it also would seem from all of the the different bombs we have the packages ah the wrapping Z and the like uh all the different components\nAre so far uh it would seem that they may have left a ton of forensic evidence bus let's not forget\nThat the FBI keeps records of such incidents they could get name if they chose to publicly any number of people with a history of the activity in this ... this direction so my guess would be that they not only\nCould tell us whether the bombs are we're a poorly made or deliberately made not to go off they already know that my guess is they also have a pretty good idea\nOn the on who may have done it\nThat is the same people who fit the profile so we will see but uh that would be my guess that it sounds like a considerable amount of evidence was left we'll see where it leads to a Sean in Wichita the good evening Shaun welcome\nHi Jim first time caller magic joined a snake\nYeah I like to catch your show once in a while when I can um [noise] am I my comment okay this is what I'm thinking\nFirst of all if a true professional assassin\nWas at work here and wanting to take out whoever the Obamas Clinton's whatever\nFirst of all he wouldn't and use the ball and he would have taken him out and left a no clues or few clues as possible because the last thing they want to do is leave include that would lead to they're getting caught\nYet none of the world or under extremely high protection even former presidents have a a rather minimal a secret service details so you're quite right if the goal was to actually kill these people this wasn't exactly the most efficient way to go about it\nAnd I don't know why somebody would send a bomb to Debbie Wasserman Schultz yeah I mean none of these people are factors in the upcoming mid terms now there's something going on here that's real suspicious and there's an idiot at work looking to get caught and he's going to get caught real quick believe me\nI Wonder if in fact they they want to get caught again uh I I don't know maybe I mean do you just can't say that that's not the case it's it's hard to figure as as you noted there are any number of inconsistencies here it's kind of hard to\nDo understand I Would like to think that if I were a bomber and and so totally immoral than I Would engage in such activity at least I Would be focused enough so that when I was through with my my murderous intention that it would be crystal clear to everybody what I was trying to do\nI Would have to think how Navarre and sit back and listen to me all of this discussion taking place that I Would feel the ... failed if I were to engage in such activities I wouldn't want it to be absolutely clear when I was trying to saying\nWell yeah they want to make sure you're bomb went off but if you're bombs aren't detonating I mean [laughter] I don't think these bombs and they could be real bombs\nOn I mean I understand that they are real bombs powder the white powder in the pack your liberties CNN was not any kind of a poisoned but I understand the other were in fact real bombs they just didn't go off\nHuh\nThat actual explosives inside of them\nI uh yes that that's the trend is being used by the the reports is that uh that there were explosives in these Bob's yes\nWell there's some left wing that out there probably at work trying to make it look like the Republicans are behind this and all that\nAnd one thing I didn't consider this morning 'cause it was early this morning when I first heard about this and then the kids were all in all day is that there's a good possibility that\nThat a an actual\nReal psychotic on the left you know send a real bomb Mitt to detonate to a prominent Republican official luck a member of Congress or something right I mean as you look at what's going on over the last two years somebody could actually get maimed or killed\nWell absolutely I mean ... was shot in the almost killed there's no question about that so it could be a left wing lunatic yeah could be a a right wing lunatic again at this juncture we just don't know Stephen ...

again Yes sir I I've been I've been listening\nSince well since when you use to fill in for Larry King Oh yes\nSo um yeah I I really enjoyed um major Garrett says segment they're mainly got me to thinking [noise] to me this is just like one huge chess game\nIt's a a drama that spills out every day to us and uh I Believe it's you know with\nIts like cord injury okay it's this huge worldwide Shakespearean play with Donald Trump in one of the major roles and an international casting characters and all these groups and people that are all\nAll connected on different levels and it's just uh it's amazing to watch where we're living in the maze in times here\nWe are uh certainly uh although it it's hard for me I guess to take that vast overall framework and and bring it down to what we know about these attempted bombings\n[noise] yeah actually say I just think it's all part of the daily outpouring from the drama that's going on it's unfolding and I'm not saying who's involved or anybody's behind it but it's just\nIt's just amazing to watch this thing on his old here and with the you know now with different blame and all these you know all the Trump people didn't know the Clinton people did it\nIt's\nJust interesting times we live in I think\nHistory will uh when it's written it's going to be quite an era\nUh it it certainly will be quite an era and the GED are probably the worst such era that we have seen I'm thinking since ah well the sixties about fifty years ago regularly to a Carl adult in Alabama hello Carl\nPillow first time caller but I just joined us know what I Want\nYou know I'm not a truck driver I Am a security guard or whether they will go right\nWe will become a boat [laughter]\nOkay the reason I called is I'm I'm not sure I'm like you okay yeah I got to give me some evidence before I can tell you who did this or why he did this but I'm thinking that\nThere's a hole in the whole thing that we've got\nPeople who are really enthusiastic and not that well skill that come up with antifa over on the left and we haven't had someone extremely enthusiastic unskilled pop up on the right and that might be this guy\nMaybe yeah I mean it's certainly within the realm of the possible\nYeah and other than that uh\nYou got me get a sense of humor of the reason Debbie Wasserman Schultz keeps getting mentioned in this is the fact that uh her name was on all of the return addresses\nAnd yet she also received one\nOh she also received ... yeah so where do I so I mean well other than that\nI'm going to go back to my little radio I listen to the rest of your program thanks for having me I Love your show\nWhere you were ... girl I thank you very much for that yeah the the show it's a connection or such as it is just a little difficult to fathom I Would agree is Susan in Pittsburgh now good evening Susan welcome\nHi Kim thank you for taking my call it ... more of a question or comment okay ah 'cause I was gone most of the day I heard this morning I'm wandering and it it's just a thought it's not ... it's not an opinion\nDo you think you personally I think that the Saudis could be behind that he think about how many times in his country will try to turn attention to something else to deflect\nAnd I'm Wondering if they are trying to make Americans look as violent as they are\nI don't think so no it doesn't strike me as a kind of thing the Saudis would do they they tend to engage in activities\nWhich would be a little more dramatic ah I I doubt it I mean it it I suppose anything is possible but I I find it hard to believe the Saudis would be engaged in such an activity that was so uh\nSo uh yeah the athlete done I Would have to think the Saudis would at least will come up with a bomb that would go off but again I Can't eliminate what you say I suppose anything as they say is possible top in Medford, Wisconsin your next up hide\nHi Tim how're you doing there ... thank you but\nUm I ... my concern is is I Know everyone can speculate and we have a theory 'cause right now we just don't know but here's my concern I wanted to see what you thought about this and that is ... considering that all the targets of this were democratic leader as prominent people that we see in the news and so forth\nUh my worry is is those that the people that we've seen out there and people who have basically taken over Portland tore up Berkeley that's her thing it is good this the fact that this happened will this be an antithesis for them to you know upper violence even more\nWell then of course don't need an excuse to up their their violets are even more\nA number one and number two they haven't always necessarily been in league with uh the active or mainstream elements of the Democratic party I mean let's face it uh the extreme elements of the Democratic party have ousted some a prominent Democrat so uh\nI don't see that this was necessarily going to be an excuse for them they don't need an excuse\nThe big involved again we don't know but if you look at the only group in this country that is actively engaged in a confrontational illegal actions it would be the antifa movement their cancer and they've got to be cut out\nOh I agree totally I I just I'm just worried that this is going to you that this is gonna be something else that's going to escalate from one thing or another next time a bomb could go up because of my\n... I'm just wondering if it's possible that this was I and I know this is my own speculation some sort of test run where it was set out put out these prominent targets designed not to go out but just to see how far could get to see if it would if it was plausible\nWell maybe except of course for one thing and that is that now everybody's on the alert so if it was a test run it was a test run you couldn't follow up on for several months because everybody now is a\nIs a on the lookout but uh I guess again within the realm of possible uh Louise in Aberdeen South Dakota good evening\nHi either I\nWant to say that I Know that the people the bones and ... them and satellite connection waters yet I'm I'm Hillary beyond simple Eric Holder will keep on our ...\nAnd ... now that we get the sense something that's so nice we're going to get plenty of water I\nDon't know I I Would note of the recipients I don't recall\nUh other than the Joe Biden's comment about uh taking president drop out behind the gym and the wailing on him a which was more tongue in cheek I don't recall law he'll be confrontational comments from Biden or Obama has a lot of things to say about\nAbout the Trump records at a at frankly but falls like are the economic recovery started on his watch but I Do recall a lot of the the confrontational type of of comments from Obama's so\nBut the other as soon as you out Clinton certainly Eric Holder certainly the George Soros has been behind a ton of this uh John Brennan who agreed Maxine Waters big time so you know some of them that is true\nYeah hopefully everything will stop and and get a check their behavior and\nWell I Hope I Hope so too I mean I'll be very honest with you honestly uh Louis I think it's going to take\nSomebody dying before this behavior is checked I mean the shooting of Steve ... didn't stop it and I'm not even sure that would happen and I really am not predicting at it I'm not hoping it but I'm afraid\nThat's why I think that I think it's a group and a coordinated effort and I think people drop them off I don't think it went through the postal service to both of the way if you've got that\nAs as a package of a a

before you can even deliver the package though right this this is just\nOutside the postal service they were just made to look plus you know like I said no cancellation\nYeah that that's not happening in today's\n... we know that much about the package that went to CNN the other is I I Can't address but your arguments are all are are certainly a on point and and again I think the the best part of all would be that the the six first class stamps or that would not be enough\nTo cover the postage on a a a package containing a pipe bomb pipe bombs are are relatively heavy so the again I don't know

something that's kind of small given all the attention lavished on the one point five billion dollar mega millions jackpot\nThere's nowhere in the story or any other source that we've seen that says that authorities say that the or any stores says that the a suspicious package that was sent there the explosive device potentially explosive device\nWas was harmless ... it's just the powder the powder according to a source\nRight at an early in the day the NYPD had bad\nThat the uh the the the ... there was the the the suspected\nPipe bomb and another powder right mhm which was you know whether whether it would be you know I I don't know rice or would they suspected might be right center you know who knows um\nBut it that that turned out to be harmless National Review has the story that both a bomb and the powder are harmless were harmless and we looked at you know who they source for that which was Associated Press an Associated Press nowhere in their says yeah that the that their source says that the bomb was was harmless but we don't know whether the bottom was harmless or not because\nFrom what I've seen and what I read the FBI has not come out and said these were bombed no no these were alive bombs ready to go ...\nUm and and so you know potentially harmful devices these are the phrase is they've been using the authorities have been using but the media's been using because the ... what does the media do inevitably they bring on as they are covering this live they bring on you know somebody who was an explosives expert\nAnd then they look at it except they're not on site looking at it they have no idea what they're looking at really except for what it appears to be\nAnd and so the the the point being is that we have no idea what's going on here so I suppose it is somebody that supports the president and the Republicans\nWhile you just heard the side that you support if that's right that's\nFound out we have no idea what it is but if that's the case and that somebody who just write a less than two weeks before a major election\nYou would just hurt their chances and and by the end and so when you you look at it as we said I mean this is a ... and we've said this all along but there was a rush rush in collusion or a case like this we look at it from the investigator's point of view and if you're an investigator and you're looking at something like this ah and you know some of the questions that you're thinking of\nA based on the fact that you have a lack of information and nobody has said that these were actually live bombs where you say okay uh when we find out if they were you know lie bombs ... well then you know that without question was an attempt to\nKill these people that would end so right you go from you go from it from that point of view trying to figure that out if it was\nThey find out that none of the bombs were active\nThat none of the bombs had any potential of going off then you look you would be looking I Believe that two different things you if you're looking at it from an investigator's point of view which would be\nRight this was a scare tactic to either scare these people or it was political in nature mhm it was meant\nJust a couple of weeks before an election to help drive which is again something that you would have to look at it was to help drive the the motivation here was to help\nDrive an election to a a certain size mhm and at that point you would look at it and say well it is if they did this to help Trump did to help Trump\nAnd then you would look at it from the other side which was okay\nAh this was to set up Trump and make it look suspicious because of the things that Trump has said the provocative things he has said and help change the the uh public discourse to blaming Trump as that's at like I said has that started already without any\nEvidence whatsoever but that's the most incredible thing with the media starts talking about whether it's you know soccer whatever yesterday from CNN going after the you know going after the president going after the right talking about the divisive comments out there will nothing could ... be more divisive\nThan accusing another side or a person\nBlaming them for something\nWhere there is a complete lack of evidence says to the motivation of the person or persons who did a particular deed mhm\nNow see I'm not jumping out of China and assigning at this round\nThing nothing could be nothing could be more divisive so as they sit there on their high horse screaming but your devices they had committed the ultimate sins and divisiveness not\nWell Hillary comes out and says we must be more civil just days after saying there's no way to be civil with the other side that it's not possible she shut the door on that just days ago well\nLook this this is we're we we have the conversation\nBut it's ridiculous and I say it's ridiculous for for this reason uh after steep skull east was shot and you had a man who was a Bernie Sanders supporter\nWho's goal was to assassinate and kill and he uh he did not succeed in doing it thank thank goodness to the Capitol police but his goal was to kill as many Republican members of Congress\nAs possible would you say that that has brought down the divisive rhetoric on the left over the last year\nNo no no\nAnd none of it's going to all of this has to get a political advantage one way or another what you're hearing yesterday is about getting a political advantage because you cannot debate the point that we've just made\nThat the most divisive you have these people sitting in their ivory towers the media elite ivory towers claiming that they care about civility and they are anti divisive\nThat's what they're about and they hate the divisiveness that exist today and then they commit the ultimate sin of divisiveness and that is to blame somebody for potentially you know a a terrorist attack would\nThey complete lack of evidence to back up their claim\nThere is no one but either way there's no way of it\nAnd we may not have it for a long time\nAnd the fact is they don't see that no they don't they don't see that they don't and it's obvious anybody who is a political hack understands how obvious it is\nSo not really much more to talk about I mean it it's we either there's a will there's a again a we've said this many times\nOn topics that we are ignorant about which means topics that we don't have the facts on mhm not much you can say the only\nThing we can report or the the few facts that we do have a total rewrite seven yeah now suspicious packages according to the FBI or they were sent to you know prominent members ah or or uh or backers of the Democrats and so\nThat's all we can say that's it that's all we know about\nThat as soon as they release it more information will you know will pass that along when we know the whole story if we ever know the whole story\nThat we can talk about it\nBut right now without knowing the motivation unless that person comes forward and tells us what the motivation was\nWe can't assign it to anything we have no idea absolutely no idea no idea\nAnd\nSo ... that that's where we stand right when we find out more information we'll give you more information\nBut speculation on these things is useless but the thing is that's the kind of nation that we live in ...
