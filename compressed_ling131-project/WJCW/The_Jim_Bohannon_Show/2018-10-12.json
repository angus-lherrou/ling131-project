Congress the republic part has to do with the structure of the government as a whole the trouble is that\nAs more and more of these decisions are made by an elected officials were losing the Democratic part of our government\nAnd there really isn't any way to uh to allow this kind of a trend to continue if we want to remain as a democracy and when we look at some other places such as England uh recently many of your listeners have heard about the breaks it is\nIs a English the English people voting to leave the EU and the reason they did that was that they felt they were not\nAre

particularly ironic\nGiven the willingness to DVD eagerness on the part of the judiciary ah like ah the bureaucracy unelected unlike the bureaucracy lifetime tenured although sometimes feels like the

shy about a sticking their toe in the waters that's a\nA rather interesting and shall we say selective form of a of a cautionary behavior here this is why they're supposed to be ruling this was where they're supposed to step in and and uh and actors government's homebuyer calling the balls and strikes this is constitutional let us not\nYeah that's right actually there are there the way I look at it in the way I describe it in the book is that they're really two ways that the courts intervene one is looking at whether legislation is constitutional in the sense that it\nComports with the language of the constitution\nAnd the other way is whether the the legislation is ... the structure of the constitution and the way the ... the frame or is designed our government was to separate legislative activities which were done by Congress and Congress alone\nAdministrative activities which were done by the president and the administrative agencies of\nOf the executive branch and the judiciary which is the third part and was to interpret the laws\nBut one of the things I point out in this book that I don't think others have really noticed is that the the frame or is expected that the judiciary would act to make sure that the separation of powers was observed\nAnd that Congress was continuing to make the laws\nNot the the executive branch making the laws but Congress making the laws and the executive branch was only ... acting according to laws and powers that had been granted by Congress the judiciary has failed to do that\nThey tried to do that during the new deal in Nineteen Seventy in Nineteen thirty five to decisions were made by the Supreme Court that\nPointed to cut a couple of decisions of the of the Congress at that time which seemed to give too much power

weight\n[noise] [noise]\nBut back to the gym will have a show with our guests Peter Wallison senior fellow with the American Enterprise Institute and the author of judicial fortitude published by encounter books about as a last chance to rein in the administrative state and the yes to summarize what you were saying before the break intervene if the courts\nWould go down this road uh that would that would solve the problem ah and as we go to some more calls throughout ... quite how it is that we we do ...\nEverybody to do this because quite frankly we're talking about a government structure which seems quite happy with the way things are constitutional or not\nAnd I'm afraid it is very pleasant for Congress to be in that structure they are elected and they have a great deal of power in a lot of a lot of um a\nLot of support from people outside the trouble is that they are not making the tough decisions they have to be forced to make the tough decisions\nAnd the way to do that I think is for the courts to say you ... you cannot pass this kind of authority to an executive agency if you want for example clean water\n'em you can't just say make the water clean you have to decide who is going to have to pay the costs of that and who is going to be allowed to use the water and for what purposes all of those things are the major decisions that have to be made by Congress and to the extent that\nThey are passed on to administrative agency it's not it isn't the way decisions should be made in a democracy and it's easy for Congress in ... to a win their\nConstituents complain about the regulations the congressman says oh well I didn't vote for that\nRight that's the administrative agency exactly why they avoid all accountability\n... deniability as we go to another call here let me ask you about the prospects for this article five\nConstitutional convention of the states you seemed to me that that the the things that could be taken up there aside from term limits as was mentioned by Sharon but other things that might directly address list that is to say to a force on our various elements of government the the these are the rules and ... they will be followed\nThe trouble is I I'm not for a constitutional convention because I I'm afraid that these things can run away we have a wonderful system today if it is made to work properly\nOr if the reason the reason I say this is the last chance to rein in the administrative state is because um it is a chance and it is a good chance and it will work if we only get the court to take\nIf if we only good I Would add will notice we go to that to call it that would be ah ah the fact\nThat a a run away or a convention strikes me as highly unlikely because one ever came out I'm such a convention would not go into the constitution the two thirty eight states ratified it and it's highly unlikely the thirty eight states would go along with anything too weird\n[noise] uh yeah and that it's entirely possible but we don't actually know what kinds of changes might come out and they could change that could change the constitution entirely and be a government that we would not recognize\nWell the early age they went along with it if thirty eight states went along with it yeah\nWell yes I mean yes that is possible and maybe it'll never happen but the the the point is that if we had this convention will be spending a lot more time\nI'm Talking about the convention and arguing about the convention rather than doing this simple thing that we could do by having the court step in and force Congress to do with\nIf if if they would uh I'm not optimistic but uh but we shall see Lowell in Longview, Texas hello\nHello sir and like here you you and your guests have made me happiest I've been in a long time well okay I Am not a fan that man's fanatic I Am an admirer and thank you I like your guest Peter has to find something that most people do in the history of it\nAnd I can ... can there's any body as anybody recognize where I used the words there are certain cabinet came from\n... what was it again\nThe war the very worst bureaucracy bureaus uh-huh and cast\nA vote or do I I I'm not aware of perhaps you are what where does the words come from\nIt came from the French uh-huh mhm\nAnd and then do you have to emphasize that\nHave been handed roles and they didn't know how to govern so if you're a bureau is actually a cabinet or\nI guess I'm missing the significance of this\nPiece of furniture\nI Know it's a piece of furniture but why does that have any bearing other than the sum it up and I'm a logical game of um you know where the word came from I'm not sure how that sets difficulty will\nYou talk about it\nState and what they did was they let they picked a bureau battle there's another ... right now today we use a bureau bureaucracy in a cabin what you're saying essentially is the fact that a bureaucrat can create a new law\nAnd unfortunately in today's world it could use a computer model okay well bottled up\nBy like our guest to comment on this I I'm not sure exactly what the significance of that the origin of the terms is although I'm certainly not in favor of the unelected setting policy of Peter\nWell bureaucracy really it's a combination of two words the bureau that's right and then they eat the thought was not the desk but actually a un agency that a bureau and cry see is me means government\nAnd this is government by the bureau rather than government by the people and that is what we should be leery of and afraid of because that just sort of thing is is it means that we no longer are in control of the laws and regulations that we have to live under\nExact Robert in night yeah go go ahead and then we'll take the call from\nAugust wanted to mention one thing is I'm not sure people understand how many rules there are\nEvery year in the past twenty five years there has been twenty five that there had been three thousand regulations coming out of the government every year that's over a hundred and one thousand regulations just in the last twenty five years so it's out of control\nYeah and certainly everyone has\nSomeone has to step in and rein it in and that can be done\nYes well it it can be if people if people decide do or if they're forced to Robert in Burlington, Vermont hello\nYes good evening or two things one of the other and I use it for about the constitution big you know they they left off and go to the living and changeable a document\nWell or the comments that I made were in regard to those with that viewpoint that to the constitution a is a a document that we can make up as we go along if we don't have to like what's in it it's not a view I happened to share but that there's a lot of people who follow that was All right\nI just thought they would be the fact is is yes it does it change will document the only the voters of the country are allowed to change\nWell no actually the voters of the country don't have any direct say so in changing it there are methods that involve both ah ah usually we abuse the constitution the or the Congress although the these conventions can also be the method are proposing\nA constitutional amendments and then ratification could take place through three quarters of the state legislatures or through a a convention held and three quarters of the states the voters per se do not have a direct say so except insofar as they elect the people who do have a say so a breeder\n[noise] yeah well that that's an exact exactly right that had to have a system with ...\nUm but it's it's a important just to understand we have the ... that the procedures in place the mechanism in place to govern ourselves and we are not allowing it to happen we're allowing the government to slip

North Dakota and the good evening Shaun welcome\nOh well good evening Jim I'm you know I hear a lot of people are against the\nArticle five convention because they're afraid it's going to be a runaway convention the problem is that we have a runaway federal government spends more money than it takes in every day right and uh constantly threatens our individual rights [noise]\nWell we yeah we we have a have sort of gone over the the pros and cons of of that particular subject and I said this about the central to the book that the Peter road I'm not sure that there's much more that we can\nSay about that there are are differing opinions on the advise ability or they're in and uh uh I Would share Peters optimism regarding a the makeup of this court\n... with one the with one copy I've to Peter and that would be that I think that there is a working majority on the court\nPush Congress in this direction provided the rights case is brought a record can't just move on its own are there to your knowledge any cases in the pipeline but could wind up before the court\nYes actually there was one argument on October second of this year\nUm the the ... case it was called I won't go into all the details but it was a question of whether to much authority had been granted by Congress to the attorney general in punishing people who were sexual offenders\nAnd the ... it is a is a very very narrow case but the kind of case where the Supreme Court can and after listening to the argument I think they will\nSay that the that this was a delegation of legislative authority to the executive branch that was unconstitutional that opens a very narrow little niche into which the court can later expand but it would be the first time\nSince Nineteen thirty five\nWhere the court has actually taken that fishing and listening to the arguments in that case it's possible we will have a five to three or six to outcome that does that well\nWe'll five to four or five to four or six to three of them have when I was not an ... when I was not the ... so it would be an aid they the member voting bloc eat them yeah and I say All right Howard in North port Florida good evening Howard\n... good evening jello a couple of points if I may well can we can all it is not a I'm a constitutional convention which I have heard reference it is a convention of the states that is\nA described under article five and ... to describe it as a top official convention is is ...\nWell he would be accurate and so far as its purpose would be to propose amendments to the constitution and again we're getting off into some addicts for one thing because that is exactly what it would be a convention to propose amendments to the constitution and number two that is the central pieces of the book put forward by\nPeter Wallison we've had our discussion on the subject or we agree to disagree on the viability of the advice of building of such an action\nOr in summary with about a a little over another minute to go here are are there other points in the book judicial fortitude that we've not touched on that you would like to mention\nUm I I think actually done a very good job of of raising the major issues I think it's just very important for people to understand that\nFor a government to have legitimacy um people the people who elect that government must believe that they have the ability to influence it and that's where I'm worried that the American people are losing\nLosing the sense that Congress is listening to them I think that maybe the election of Donald Trump\nWas called up populist uprising and I I I Believe it was but one of the reasons was I think that many people did not believe that the government in Washington was under their control\nAnd if we lose that sense if the American people lose that sense well then we become a a\nA country where the laws don't mean anything anymore because there's no moral authority for laws that are made by people who you don't elect\nTo do and and the gross national cynicism ... can be pushed right through the roof if we don't remedy this\nOr if you want to remedy at a great place to start with Peter Wallison book

remarkable\nUh I understand the impulse but I Can't understand the impulse\nWho ever actually sat down and thought about it for more than say twenty seconds\n[noise] well and that's part of it I don't think a lot of them were actually thinking about it you know we were coming off a generation who your shoes doctors box book that said\nYou don't have any empathy to your kids and\nYou know and then Watson did the same thing and it you know we have all these different parenting styles that were basically telling you to be hard and coal and they were the a hundred and eighty degree a\nReaction to that now Dr Benjamin spot the gift that keeps on giving\nExactly and it was still a small minority of these people but what's happened is we've had you know this generation that's grown up with competitive sports but everybody got a trophy when with you know gym class where you pick side and it's always a tie and\nAnd that teaches kids certain things\nAnd these kids are learning first of all that\nAdult fly because kids know once I got more points than the other one\nAnd not only that but the real world does still demand the actual results I mean this is nothing more than setting up kids for failure and anybody who can't see that I I hate to be judgmental but I Will be a talk show host the guy who can't see that as an idiot\n[laughter]\nYou know you could be you could be the voice of reason now that I've spoken to [laughter] why\nAnybody who can't see that is probably looking at their child to say but my kid special\nThey're they're not they're not looking as contributing to this generation\nOr like a kid and I'm like well because they're all above average\nExactly and I were going to be talking a lot about these kids\nAnd what I Want people will remember is there are some amazing kids in each groups I mean there are we got from working in my office that it's just I I won't be a home up because you know I asked for that report next friday they give it to me on Thursday

a helicopter parents determines which I was a million or could you define force lawnmower parents\nWell a\nLot more parents are parents that are so much more a protective of their kids they make a lot more parents looked like like you know kindergarten versus college uh these long more parents\nLiterally mowed down any obstacles any threats of confrontation any chance of failure for their kids which\nYou know a rational adult understands failure for children as a learning opportunity and teach you how to deal with loss and how to how to recover from that and build on your experiences and these kids are\nI'm getting much less of that than the helicopter kid from the helicopter\nSo it's getting worse it's helicopter parents on steroids\nExactly exactly\nWow All right let's let's talk more about that in the company of among others the tonight the dog who calls him from Albany, Oregon at the weather channel and even though and they're good at doing fine thank you\nIn great myself I just got to say the helicopter\nThe warm or parents down by the kind of parents who were glad they have their children grow up poor you know bubbles but that was possible [laughter]\nWell now you know I don't think you're you're ... exaggerating entirely too much they're done I mean there are some practicalities of course involved in that but I ah Dr Huber I I think the the Don May be closer to the literal truth and he'd like to think he is your thoughts Dr\nI I think he's exactly correct in unfortunately what that ... is a a an adult who is dependent upon the world for things and not just the premise that completely entitled they deserve this\nAnd you know I was taught right on day one I don't deserve anything I have to earn stuff to to get anywhere in this world\nWho do I find for\nYour

about it but are are we doing enough about this a tendency of not producing tomorrow's grownups this was a very\nTroublesome century with all kinds of challenges that face the society\nAnd we are assuming we the grown ups that do we are producing a generation prepared to follow and pick up the raids and in some cases pick up the pieces of things that we've broken we expect the next generation to be able to\nSoldier on and maybe they can and maybe they can Dr John Huber is our guest piece of Austin, Texas based clinical forensic psychologist he chairs made ... mental health\nDot org and we're looking at helicopter parents now in some cases transforming into law and bored parents how long would you say the helicopter slash law on board parenting\nA trend has has gone on now how many years\nRoughly I Would say probably ...\nI started seeing at the university probably you're up for years about about Thirteen twenty Thirteen so\nUh it started about Eighteen years before that I Would say you know when when those parents taught those kids to be that way and I started my career as a school psychologist so in in the early nineties I started seeing my kids my kids would have problems in school in our classrooms\nAnd I would do my psychological assess that and say okay here's what we need to do to help this child learn\nAnd by the time I was through\nBeing that I I was burnt out on being a school psychologist the parents were caught man I go well you know I just want them to pass I wanted to have a high GPA and right you know I'm like well we want them to learn and they're like no no no you don't understand I just walk you know yeah ... and\nOur care that they do something we'll put them in a in a building that has books that maybe by us most of the some of that knowledge will sort of better their little heads [noise] gosh that's so that's just a salary so I guess the point I'm making your as we go to another call would be that uh it's been around long enough\nThat there are now such people who have been dumped out into the cold cruel world yeah and uh I don't know are they are they all living in their parents' basements unable to cope are they speaking out to those safe spaces or\nHave they acquired overnight a sudden resilience that was not taught to the during the formative years\nYou know that that's interesting and it's interesting jam 'cause my practice down here it's it's me and another another psychologist and the people to work with us but we're the main people and\nWe have an actual contract with a company that that's what they do is they get these kids that they're actually calling failure to launch kids you're just like the movie\nBut you know and we've had a forty year old who was sitting there was Seventy year old parents who won't get up out of the bedroom and off the computer games and and play station\nAnd won't go out and get a job and and socialize and uh we test them do psychological tests and see whether there's a a mental health reason or cognitive reason for why they're failing and it's a surprising number of adults that\nHave come to the system that there's not a whole lot I mean it's not like the thousand kids who go through you know the local high school every every day but\nIt's surprisingly a large number a and I I sit down with their their parents say okay what we need to do is you know cut off the Internet you know do you guys use it all know we we have cable ... will cut off the Internet part of it\nYou know [laughter] and they're like but but then he'll be upset\nOh my heavens yes maybe he will [laughter] that that's a credit but we in other words we have produced a generation of parents who are apparently qualified to be parents only in the sense that they can reproduce in other words they they have the same parenting skills as an amoeba\nHere you're inside is an astounding and I love that\nYeah yeah and how sad thank\nYou uh we got a call from Linda in northeastern Ohio joins us tonight the good evening Lyndon welcome to the gym ... with Dr John Huber hello\nHello hello lender\nYeah I'm listening to your conversation about kids dealing with kids and now I was on Facebook on my cell phone on one of the guys come on he said he's a teacher and he goes I gotta ... kids that are really really upset\nThey were upset whenever Donald Trump wine they were crying and carry on and then he gets now they're really upset because Kavanaugh is confirmed for judge and he says I just don't know what to do with and they're also upset\nWondering if they're really upset I mean I I work with those but I mean they oughta your they ought to do what it'd be grown up with do okay let's organized will up will become politically active will elect people to whom we agree\nI think she was they might have been younger students in school but the thing about it is I think I told him I ... a lot of places where the problem with these kids they don't how to problem solve number two they don't know anything about elections you know somebody and he said she had the process\nThey used to teach civics them in such as the owner of the more I yeah I I gather that they do that's also part of the problem yeah but but what you just said was very telling Linda they don't know how to problem solve come off ... hill is the point of raising a kid if you do at the end of the day\nProduced someone who can problem solve I mean\nRight All right that's true why have them\nI mean no seriously why have a kid I you can't just be doing it out of cruelty let's producer a human being who will ... failed miserably who will flop in life and and do all we can to to handicap nobody says that there is what they're doing\nThe guy the guy said it made it sound like the kids have no future now that well Republicans are running the country or\n... again I mean it's it's if you want to have that view that you're perfect right as an American so do something about uh do suck your thumb right away in order to Oregon I it's I mean I I ...

David the sunset beach North Carolina welcome\nI think she's taking my call sure I think\nUh I think uh uh my take at least is the divorce rate in this country when I went to school I graduated in sixty eight and a\nIt was still disappointed at school too with teachers and that's disappeared and uh\nI I I really don't understand that I have two daughters in their forties and uh they try to get along with the kids are young my grandkids\nAnd uh and talking to them all the time and I don't I don't know it's just they know what life's all about\nAnd yet these people that are raising their kids are knowing how tough the world is that uh they're going to wind up [noise] I don't know\nWell they really are a good way to to wrap up the segment I suppose a day but Dr Huber where are we we going here sometimes it's difficult for me to conceive of the notion of ah\nOf let's say the leadership of this country a mid century big turned over to the children of lawnmower and helicopter parents about ...\nI Believe that that our children the younger kids are seeing what's happening in front of them and and they have a different attitude and they're kind of step after the plate\nSo to speak I think the pendulum is swinging backwards and I've said this before you know this country survived Elvis and it was going to tear us apart I think we were going to get through this\nWell ah one can certainly hope so I like it optimistic note please stay on the line and we will speak briefly off their doctor John Huber our guest is a clinical forensic psychologist based in Austin, Texas he chairs\nMainstream mental health dot org and we're looking at this phenomenon of helicopter parents have even words lawnmower parents this is Westwood One\nThing she children's research hospital we're fighting against childhood cancer every day at\nThe heart of this battle our donors most of us want to make them different in a life that either saint Jude dead miraculous or\nThe fact that no one has to pay it's a place where everyone is treated as an equal\nEverybody is welcome here and it doesn't matter the religion or what part of the world you're from all that is taken away it just gives you some hope\nIs just a nice feeling to put your energy into something that really does genuinely make a difference in a child's mind\nYou know ...\nIf we have the ability to help\nHim win you know there was any doubt\nFinding cures saving children the children's research off they don't find out how you can help at ... dot org\nWanna debating on thought going as\nMost valuable player and six World Series animals I like the total hall of fame how low on\nThe high quality of Jackie Robinson\nThan you dot com [noise]\nTried cities talk radio station am nine ten Eugene cw Johnson City things for Bristol [noise]\nStorm cleanup market woes I'm only a princess search and rescue crew spent much of Thursday making their way through hard hit areas in the Florida Panhandle in the wake of what is known tropical storm Michael correspondent Brian ton report\nFlorida governor Rick Scott says officials are assessing how long recovery will take with damage reports still coming in\nThis hurricane was an absolute monster and the damage that students wake is still yet to be fully understood the focus is search and rescue\nBut those efforts are being hampered by impassable rose something we discovered as we try to make our way into Mexico beach down trees and power lines are making it nearly impossible for first responders to reach certain areas storms claimed\nTo get the power back up some parts are already restored it there is no water in parts of the Panama City beach area things like power and water are going to take days or in the worst case they will take a couple of weeks but there are still thousands of people\nA boat power and water and to kind of give you a perspective as to how severe it was\nAll we all do that do waffle house there theme is that they stay open a in a hurricane well not in this particular hurricane in the Panama City beach area I spoke with about\nForty executives from ... house this evening that are staying in my hotel they lose them all in that try to get a waffle houses in the Panama City beach area up and going to provide to these people they're going to be going to Panama City tomorrow and working as diligent as they can to get their restaurant cleaned up so\nThat kind of those people who are familiar with hurricanes just how severe that it\n... I Would certainly think so uh\nThe uh the scope of of of the problem but obviously a overwhelming a lot of resources I'm Wondering about uh\nUh if if you will I suppose a or we could call it the second responders what'd you get past the immediate local or a policeman and EMTs into like I'm thinking about the groups like the red cross like a female or are they in the evidence\nThey are more and more of 'em are headed this way too from other parts of the country there are people from Texas there are people from Montana even California that ...\nAre headed this way it seems like it's taking them a little bit longer or just because of how difficult it is\nTo get into this area right now specifically Panama City but Destin area right now is almost like a waiting room for people to get into Panama City that makes any sense I've run it just so many people in fact everyone I've approached has some high you're trying to get to Panama City or the opposite left Panama City and it's waiting it out\nBut to get down there so yeah there that help is on the way not already you\nKnow like a stay dry or stay safe and get some rest Clayton All right Jim\nThank thank you sir Clayton level in Destin, Florida tonight as a Michael May have broken up on the weather map some of the satellite photos but the the after effects pretty severe and again there's this one estimate from the Boston based Kevin Clark and company\nAn insurance company that produces models for catastrophes estimated that uh Michael caused about eight billion dollars in insured losses not including the losses covered by the national flood insurance program\nThere is another deaths from the storm to report\nA you would think\nThat as Michael roared through southwest Georgia that Sarah Radley would be safe and her grandparents home they may have worried about falling trees but uh that's not what happened a a freak accident saw the winds of Michael lift the a\nCarport next to their home into the air and slam it back down on the house one of the legs tour through the roof and fatally struck eleven year old Sarah Rodney so a rabbit I should say so\nAgain there's just no accounting for the the terrible of vagaries of of the uh the sort of a tragedy you are you do the best you can and sometimes major just reaches out and and uh swamps down the loved ones so certainly our\nThoughts and prayers go out to the family of a eleven year old Sarah Redmond one of the fatalities which there were fortunately not a lot\nUh from the storm but again a tragic circumstance [noise] All right we'll continue our thoughts here\nOn that and uh also I Want to continue our look at helicopter parents more and more parents who are just a moment but ah to another problem that could affect many of you directly it does me I Know a leg cramps for cramps hate those just hate him but if you get them you know how painful and disruptive they can be\nMuscle cramps can jolt you out of a south sleep interrupt your daily life\nSo I'd like you to listen carefully because I recently learned about pharaoh works relief it as a non greasy foam that's proven to relieve muscle cramps fast and reduce muscle ... plus with daily use federal works relief can even prevent muscle crabs before they start\nTheir works relief only takes ... minutes to apply it absorbs quickly added works people love the results you've probably seen a doctor drew Pinsky on TV talking about their works relief well many of my radio colleagues were talking about their works relief as well now with the holiday season just around the corner if\nYou know someone who suffers with muscle cramps or muscle ...

their swiveling hips and their Greece back here and the like yeah yes we did survive and that's very true but I was just ... and of course the purpose of that song was to point out that the to a certain extent\nEvery generation of the parents abused their kids with a rather skeptical why\nBut the today we've got we've got a reason to view the or the parents with a skeptic alive\nOkay by the way we're and my mother was like well our phone for a little bit come on TV\nYes well I I Believe this way I can I can recall vividly my days of of watching the king and uh yes at the time it did seem rather bizarre but uh you know we pretty much turned out I think okay so thanks for sharing that added the quarterly in Idaho you're on the program good evening\nOr get any gym you know your monologue was the spot on and we've talked before a I'm a six year old high school teacher and I've been teaching her coaching seems like all my life\nAnd a lot of this I feel stems out of the great society and the hippies and the free love and you know I've watched it through the seventies and eighties and nineties and on into day\nBut what I see a lot of it and I have a little bit of a saying that for several generations now you've had kids having kids\nWho have no parenting skills no ability to to you know raise kids correctly frequently the kids are conceived in an intoxicated have with the first question being uh how'd that happen the second question being are you sure it's mine\nAnd these parents gay actually they don't have the skill I see it every day\nUh you know they want to be their friend they want to be the buddies they wanna you know they don't want to be a parent whether like you said they discipline the kids when they do things wrong they show the kids right from wrong I talked to my kids in class all the time about going out and getting a job and if you make your\nYour boss is going to worry whether you like your boss or not you're not\nYou but your boss better like you hey if you don't like your boss you're going out the door and you know I talked about\nEffort and behavior and the expectations and if you don't meet the expectations there's going to be consequences and they're meant to be uncomfortable and I have read you know I have two groups of people ... won\nThe kids and parents who liked me because I Am that way\nAnd the other group ...

a woman who is a great grandmother who I admired but a surrogate mother mind so to speak\nAnd she ... she would say what those parents what it does parents aren't doing the right thing and so uh I just want the doctor and know that I had people come into my class to parents\nWhen I first started teaching down in Florida\nAnd they would walk in and they had the kids paper to kid couldn't deliver to whatever the first thing they look at me like it was like a a rookie baseball manager with a Joe ... the great empire\nThe veteran empire and they would look at me as a we're not helicopter parents

G of Kanye West ... it's the fact that he's in a room with Trump complimenting them and it ends there and so at that particular point and we said this for the longest time before a lot of other shows were saying it\nAnd that the\nUh the liberal elite and the liberal black leadership in this country a believes in the bigoted\nAnd racist idea that all blacks must think alike and if you don't think alike you are not truly black\nYeah that's it yeah\nThey don't have to go much further than that and that's what you were seen uh yesterday\n... look I'm [laughter]\nAnd the more attention you give a Kanye West he's he's always out for publicity he's making the headlines and it's not even about a tour or a song\nWhen does he not made\nHeadlines the ... the whole point is is that's why he does kid rock was an afterthought\nMhm he was there yesterday apparently there's a question right yeah reported it and didn't like the answer\nWell and at some point what where do you what age do you drop\nKid [laughter]\nI I'm just asking questions I like the guy\n\nBut you can't call them rock because we already have raw [laughter] see\n[laughter] it started out I never thought about that when I was a kid [laughter] starts out well meaning and then how do I have a career at sixty yes exactly\nYou know kid rock ... not so much anymore\nOr so it it it it it could be has a kid rock I'm not sure if you have\n... I think that's what's on the air and one time\nYou know I was in when he first found out was like oh come on in the nineties and ... and then I uh I uh was behind the music to the biography of his life ... and you see how hard he worked to get where he got ... that he had not right and you see how awkward and I went\nOh you know\nI have a completely different opinion of him and it was just you know your little prejudices you every kid rock\n... having a kid and stuff\nBut uh but uh for um\nYou know yesterday again this is not I'm not going to spend five hours\nAre going over the economic and political philosophy of Kanye West hold on let me tell the staff had guys or cancel all that stuff that I wrote down for the next ... exactly\nUh but because because you don't need to go that far all you need to do is he likes Trump therefore to the left he's not a black he's not truly black mhm\nWell they said this about me a lot of say no meal yeah you know and and that's but that's the backward thinking that's that's\nThat's right that's the bigotry and in tolerance of the left today it's the racist mindset\n\nTo the point where you know coming up with the analogy the Trump is the master and Tanya is the slave ... you're going to really try to convince America of that you're going to\nYou're going to try to convince a millennials up is that right there on the west in his mind views himself as a slave really now\nBut this is this is the what's great is that they're actually proving ... right in there\nFrom their behavior this is Ben and it so maybe we will spend some time
