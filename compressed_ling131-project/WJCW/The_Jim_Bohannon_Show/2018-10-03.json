says here's what's going to happen\nWe'll get an FBI report soon it will be made available to each senator and all the senators will be allowed to look at it that's the way the reports are always handled\nThe top Senate Democrat Charles Schumer says that's not enough\nThere's a growing consensus in the Senate the when the FBI's investigation is complete the findings should be released publically with any personal information redacted\nBut having said that or why not nationalize it on the fact that the economy is perking along perfectly I mean or what ever happened to a James Carville statements victim it's the economy stupid\nThat is a great question and I think that there are many people particularly in a a center right of the Republican Party who would endorse that belief\nThere is an argument in some quarters and I'm not a put enough time on the scales either way but there's an argument in some quarters that when the economy is going well\nThat is not always a motivating factor for people to actually get to a vote the argument essentially as the dissatisfaction as a more powerful motivating factor than satisfaction\nAnd that therefore you have to raise the stakes in some fashion to get Republican voters who are\nMore reluctant to ... or or less energized to get to the polls I don't think anyone in either party gyms disputes the factor contest the fact that Democrats are fired up\nBut if you go in President Obama's old phrase that they are very much at animated by opposition to President Trump I'm very intense and their desire to deliver a rebuke to him in these midterm elections\nYeah I I've been arguing myself that that ah it depends on on how you see President Trump on the ballot\nAnd the Democrats the President Trump everywhere are on the ballot or they they don't see his name of course but anywhere they see the letter are that that close enough\nI may not be Donald Trump but I can vote against this Republican and that Republican and met Republican over there [noise] uh and uh whereas Republicans look at the ballot and they don't see Donald Trump they they see a lot of people who in many cases there may consider to be a rhinos Republicans in name only or otherwise uh unworthy of their vote\nAnd that is coupled with the fact that there was recently a a poll taken this was by the Republican National committee no less\nWhich said that fifty seven percent of Republicans\nFelt that it was impossible for Democrats to obtain control of either house of Congress and a boy that's a about Ninety light years away from the truth is very possible in fact maybe even likely at this stage of the game\nYes absolutely I agree one hundred percent this is something that has come up in my conversations with Republican sources a concern that Republican voters or to some degree complacent they are so supportive of President Trump in many cases that they don't\nThink that really there is a a plurality of people who are\nOn the Trump or who wish to vote against the Republican Party\nThat isn't what the experts think in other words the experts think there is definitely enough\nAnd enthusiasm and intensity and the Democratic side trip ... at least the house of representatives in peril from a Republican perspective and and just to your point about rhinos briefly a gym and conversations that I've had with Steve Bannon he\nHas mentioned that one of the challenges is to get the Trump base to vote in some cases for candidates they would consider writing it which I Know that seems perhaps in in Congress at Poynter in Congress or viewpoint for Steve Bannon to take given that he's so identified with the\nPopulist nationalist movement\nBut he does believe that when it comes to these midterm elections\nWell there certainly is one word that ought to provide\nA basis for Republican unity and that word of course was the I word impeachment I don't doubt for one minute the Democrats are hardly unified and a lot of friends or just look at some of the fractures primaries they've had but I think if Nancy Pelosi gets a two Eighteen to to Seventeen margin in the house\nOne vote I think that they'll vote articles of impeachment against President Trump before April arrives now granted\nImpeachment is one thing and conviction as another and there's no way on this earth that they'll ever get sixty seven votes and the Senate to convict and removing from office but nonetheless it cast the Paul ... a change over a presidency and I would think that that alone might be enough to get Republicans to turn out to vote\nYes and and that spans here in a severe that a shared I think by many people are on the on the right in the broadest definition of that term the idea that President Trump could be impeached in fact is likely to be impeached if Democrats take the ...\nCould possibly be a significant motivating factor for Republican voters in other words loyalty to the president might bring Republican voters insufficient number to balance ... or to neutralize\nThis expected surge all democratic enthusiasm and voter intense\nOf course we often see surges of enthusiasm you look back to the Iraq Obama elections of a ... and and twenty twelve\nAnd a in both cases Obama was able to get people who ordinarily don't turn out to vote very much uh to go out and actually vote the young people since Eighteen to Twenty one year olds got the right to vote they have consistently year after year after year after year been the group the least likely to vote\nAnd he could do it Obama could do it\nWhen his name was on the ballot the runaway than in twenty Jenny he said well you know my name's not on the ballot but please vote for the Democrats and they didn't and the Tea Party revolution resulted and the Republicans got control of the house twenty twelve\nObama's name is back on the ballot they turn out for him and he wins reelection and then ... says hey we could really use your vote here and ah his name was not on the ballot this time the Republicans keep the house and they take the Senate\nOr and then of course again in a in ... sixteen Obama's name was not on the ballot\nAnd uh the baggage that Hillary Clinton brought to the table plus the appeal of Donald Trump to an awful lot of voters\nWho felt that uh they had not been taken seriously a lead to the Trump victory and of course the Democrats were not able to take either the house or the Senate in twenty sixteen so again that proves Obama didn't have coat tails\nAnd I'm curious to see if Trump has coat tails yeah\nI think it's a great question and it's pretty well made point Jim\nThere are precedents on on other prominent politicians have personal magnetism and President Obama actively had not for his supporters President Trump clearly has a for his supporters and the issue of whether that can be transferred I think it's a fascinating one\nYou've described you about a phenomenon for the well we'll see how that works\nWith Trump one

have Joe calling in from ... Missouri hello Joe\nI show I I like hearing both of you and I think you guys got it\nI Want to mention the height I think the attack against Rocco bottle I I think that\nIf you look at the midterm elections that are happening they will be mark and go back and look at what happened the last election\nAnd there was a a sick feeling that so many of that ad about the eight years that we were living\nThat we would have voted for anybody who wasn't connected for him and there are some Republican states up for grabs including into that at that shouldn't be that close and one of them that you'll see a lot but I I truly believe it Claire McCaskill there she will not make it now that the cabinet things happen\nBut I Do believe that I was writing or anything I Would add Brock Coe bomb as record and picture and everything and everything I Would attack I think that what they need to attack and I think that would be very successful for anyone\nInteresting thought a Joe and I would the editor both gripped by the way that the attorney general of Missouri a Josh Hawley who was running against a Claire McCaskill's Senate reelection bid\nAs or shall we say not reform quite as vigorously or as well as many thought that he would and that has become a real dog five but again it's such a\nA completely red state in many regards and clear I guess remains the only state wide elected Democrat if I'm not mistaken [noise] ah so ah nah your thoughts about a a nationalizing the race if you will with the pictures of Obama man who was not been on a ballot now for six\nYears well I appreciate your question on on him call in and he would not in fact get much support for his viewpoint in this poll that we're talking about one of the things that I think gives this pool credibility is that it does ... ... some results that wouldn't be certainly aligned with Steve Bannon's own personal view is\nOne of those is that a test the popularity of a number of Democrats and former President Obama is by some distance the most popular all of them at Nancy Pelosi for example vastly less popular\nHillary Clinton vastly less popular so I I'm sure a joke clearly has strong feelings on the Obama presidency but at this particular poll if we're talking about would not vindicate his view that placing President Obama front and center would aid Republicans in a search for victims\nStandage White House columnist with the hill newspaper the hill dot com great reading by the way if you're into politics and that will come back we'll take a look at some more about this

on turning out the or frankly rather a on again off again the electorate that supported bronco bomb but most of the city was like yes I think\nThat abortion can clearly be a motivating factor for both sides you were mentioning before the break gym the battle over Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd ... or wrongly that has something that a liberal activist I think are very concerned about as it specifically pertains\nTo the abortion issue I'm clearly if they're where I'm a democratic heist that's a separate issue from a Supreme Court nomination but the whole issue of abortion can be an animation a motivating factor and be\nAnd that one follow up on that ah which will be the whole Kavanaugh issue and it now appears maybe finally possibly that there will be a definitive vote before this election\nAnd I've heard various theories put forward as to what this will do to either side I've heard some uh uh put forward the theory that uh if the Republicans don't get Kavanaugh confirmed that uh they can get some good by the the midterm elections are more I thought would be the opposite I mean are we really\nAren't we made a stronger stuff my thought would be well let's go to the rampart let's fight back not ah oh I'm going to go off in a corner and ... my ... out\nBut I'm curious your thoughts about what a confirmation of a of Kavanaugh before the election over that matter even his his uh ... the refusal to confirm but for the issue to be settled a before this election what do you think the impact might be on either party\nDepends in my view on high is settled if it is settled with Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation to me that seems to be ... to the advantage of the Republican Party\nThe president would then have put obviously to Supreme Court justices on the court and then Gorsuch as well as Mr ... and in addition it would be I think evidence to for example a Christian conservative she might have been\nAs somewhat skeptical of President Trump's rather colorful personal life\nThat they sort of swallowed those reservations in the sense because issues like the cork ritual important to them ... confirmed I think that would probably help Republicans the the argument abide if he is not confirmed could ... depressed Republican turnout revolves around the concept that\nConservative voters could think the Republican Party wasn't standing up enough for them in other words the only way Brett Kavanaugh won't be confirmed is a ... at least one or two Republican senators to vote for them\nAnd the fear in Republican circles is that that would be seen by conservative voters as buckling to have the ... essentially I'm not saying I agree with us from opinion columnist but it would be seen in Republican circles or in conservative circles as buckling to the mall but not standing up for those values significantly and\nRobert calls in from Burlington, Vermont on the boat handed show with Niles adage of the hill newspaper good evening Robert\nYes go there the ...

I think for\nThose of us who are still about history we're talking school\nSome of the history of this country recognize words coming right now is a battle almost as important as the battles the revolutionary war really differences the question is what Ben Franklin was asking for other king what are you going to have a ...\nAnd like you said you go read public if you can keep it ... right now we've battle against charities like king was that site\nRight now where to fight the battle charity\nFor ... for the masses I'd say a year that we can just you know match loading no rules get rid of the constitution were traveling for the soul is very country ... are constitutionally bullet to assure liberty a rise\nAll right with that our guest to respond to what you said you're a course I don't think the constitution is a going away anytime soon but there certainly are those who would like to follow it and others who would\nFollow the more I suppose a ... of the uh uh shall we say living constitution view which I have always ah\nSummarized as a where I agree with the constitution let's follow it to the letter it up I don't didn't let sort of make it up as we go along so I think that there are genuine concerns expressed by Robert there that even if we uh we keep the uh the semblance of the document it would be I think helpful and I think that a bread Kevin\nA confirmation that would be helpful Bush in that direction of actually following what it says your thoughts\nYes I think I was slightly distracted by the fact or the sent the wrong way but the fact that Robert who's calling from Vermont I don't I don't normally anticipate such fervently conservative views coming in Vermont color\nBut you know being serious I mean obviously the idea that look this country is divided in two camps that see these issues very fundamentally differently I think that has an effect in terms of\nBringing people into the political process people think correctly in my view that these battles are very important\nAs I say I'm not I'm not an opinion columnist or I'm not going to say whether I agree with Robert are the people who take a ... in my personal views but the point here is that\nThere are clearly really fundamental battles going on in this nation at the moment of ... a deeply critical issues uh by which people have extremely passionate views\nAnd they're looking at a let's say the Democrats for the moment here of course we we note the differences in the Republican Party between those who follow more of the the populist nationalist conservatism of Donald Trump\nAnd others who are often dismissed as a rhinos\nThe terms been used a variety of times in recent years sometimes just a a more moderate Republicans in these days I suppose the traditional conservative could wind up being called a rhino because certainly nationalist\nAnd populist conservatism is not the same as the traditional conservatism of the Democratic side I never hear the term but I certainly hear the concept\nOr if there are rhinos then there are those out there who are ... Democrats in name only in the view of some some of suffered at the uh the hands of a\nA primary voters within the Democratic party and others have been very fearful of that I think that Dianne Feinstein herself a for reelection was not endorsed by her party because Feinstein now coming from my point of view this as hard to swallow but she was abused by viewed by these people as not\nQuite liberal enough uh certainly uh Andrew Cuomo the governor of New York at a a spirited if the unsuccessful challenge from actress Cynthia Nixon who was a it was just about as far left as you could go in many regards and certainly acquitted herself or\nThat poorly or so I think a lot of Democrats are running kind of frightened right now\nYes and there's a lot of energy on the left of the Democratic party\nIn addition to the races that you mentioned gym the one where the laugh really warm in pretty dramatic circumstances was the heist primary which Alexandria okay she'll Cortez won defeating Joe Crowley in New York\n...

there is left for him to do by executive order you give the Democrats either house of Congress and they will be if the president\nSubmits a resolution saying the sun rises in the east it would not get through a democratically controlled Senate or a democratically controlled house ah I'm not sure ah as far as I'm concerned uh the entire a Trump agenda is is dead until the ... elections\nI think that's probably true I think that for Democrats all the political incentives are lined up toward opposing President Trump to the maximum extent possible I don't really see any significant reason why Democrats from their own perspective would support President Trump\nYeah people have talked about the idea that he could reach across the aisle there was a pretty face when he was talking\nAnd quite friendly or fashion about Chuck and Nancy charge or nothing to say that's that was pretty short lived I'm not sure I see that ah atmosphere or ... or reach coming back again pretty quickly even if Democrats do take the house in November\nYeah uh it it does seem to me ah that that's a that's pretty much it and a again a while I certainly would agree that the president cannot be thrilled with the Republican control of Congress but that doesn't mean that that\nIt will it couldn't get worse at from the presidential point of view it could and certainly would get worse under the control of the Democrats are your thoughts at this time but do you ah have a crystal ball Nile [laughter]\nMy record of predictions is sometimes good and sometimes not so good I if I have to put money on it I think the Democrats will narrowly take the house because I think the energy and the upside is so intense I Would expect Republicans to hold on to the ...\nYeah I Would tend to think that as well it just strikes me that the math on the Senate\nIs such that of those ah thirty three seats up uh twenty five are held by Democrats including the two independents who vote\nAs a a Democrats and gender those

Wilson combined in his views\nAre at one in the same time uh and opposition to imperialism or and they desire to see all sorts of a A People's become independent show\nIn a in Eastern Europe the the independence of the independence of old the checks the the uh Hungarians oh there's a lot to Wilson\nAnd at the same time he he really was as you say a a a visionary uh in in the area of of trying to think of the world as being\nA governed under a single set of rules which has been a tremendous inspiration for uh\nThe last few presidents in the United states and for the the European Union ... both sides can can ah justifiably playing him\nIt's interesting to note the tug Z influences the polls on an nationalism\nThey don't just come from international viewpoint so United Nations or or a regional groupings like the European Union and of course today there's no other regional Ruben quite as a larger as powerful as that one\nBut at the same time that there are pressures on the nation state do if you will\nJoin a larger amalgam Asians if you will there also a pressures to split up to a nation state every every country other seems that it has its own little group that uh that wants to split the country apart and of course Czechoslovakia\nWith the fall of the Soviet Union became two separate countries you've got Scotland and\nOther portions of Great Britain that or a talking or at some times of pretty close to the independence the Basque separatists movement in Spain and that's just a handful in the nearly two hundred countries in the world I'll bet you you could find groups like that in at least half of them\nAnd so it seems to be nationalism has been attacked both from if you will above and below\n... that's exactly right and uh I I think people often often miss that this is actually what's what's important about nationalism the ... you could almost say that the two natural extremes\nI'm On the one hand I kind of a universal empire like the Roman empire or or or or or the Babylonian Empire dreaming of taking over the entire world\nUm that that that's one extreme in at the other extreme you have a the ancient a political order of everybody living in in little clans and tribes where every clan\nEvery group of family is is independent and can go to war against the others\nUm these these two extremes are are one of them the the the world is clans is a is a world of an ceasing competition and violence and ah empire is a world in which a there's an attempt to bring peace and prosperity to the whole world but but\nBut by conquering it in and forcing a single point of view on on everybody and uh the idea of the the national states are which is an idea that comes down to us actually from from the Bible rather than from Greek or Rome and sources\nUm it's it's an idea that seeks\nThe midpoint the place exactly in the middle between those two extremes\nAnd it so it it seeks to allow on the one hand or a sphere of internal domestic peace and Trent tranquility\nAnd on the other on the other hand self determination that each each nation will have its its own religious and national unconstitutional traditions each nation will be an experiment in what it means for human beings to live and so it'll it'll be different from from all of the others\nAnd that means exactly as you say that it's always attacked from above by imperialists and from below by tribal is to want to break it up and turn it into tiny little pieces\nBoat problem of course uh we have today is a lot of countries especially a third world countries\nAh were founded based not on anything that approach they a rational look at the constituent parts but simply on\nHow far this or that European explore managed to to go and so you have of course uh Iraq for example\nAre put together as a chunk of bill Ottoman Empire that included a a Shia and Sunni and an element of Kurds just for for a for good measure and the ... these are our our loyalties go far deeper I think until maybe refund years than the Iraqi national consciousness\nUh maybe there's no better example no more no more virulent example the Nigeria\nWhere a British explores managed to to cover territory that included an awful lot of very hostile clans and where tens of thousands of people killed each other over the years so\nSo certainly some nation states don't seem to be a very well constituted they seemed to be a victim of borders that or shall we say we're a rather arbitrarily chosen\n[noise] yeah I ... I I I definitely agree with your your examples I Would I Would just say that uh I I I think it's important to me it's important to try to understand what a what a nation is in Iraq is not a nation\nOr because as a nation and we have a a long history in in in western political thought of of people are important thinkers trying to understand what a nation is\nAnd as you say a country like Iraq or a or Syria or Yugoslavia or Nigeria or the Congo all of these are examples of states or the ... somebody gave them a national flag you know they they were the vampires that constructed them\nA arbitrarily with in an arbitrary borders they got a national flag and the national anthem but uh nobody was was looking to try to understand where the border would have to be in order for\nUh to create a cohesive\nUh country cook cohesive is said Jon Stewart mills word and all it means is that that the people living in the country has to feel and mutual loyalty that holds them together and ah and and and and makes them want to fight together against against their enemies\nSo if you if you look at a place like Yugoslavia or Iraq you'll see that they simply is no internal cohesion because of the borders were not drawn on the basis of trying to figure out where the nations\nAre in fact actually just the opposite if if you want it to take Syria and and Iraq and divide divide those lands are into a into a cohesive nations you you could do it\nBut the the imperial powers ah Britain and France when they drew the borders they were they were interested in almost the opposite they they wanted divided populations to make it\nEasy too easy for them to rule as outsiders\nAnd so uh we're I I Would say that an important principle if if you are looking at the world's are trying to get to independent nations\nThat can be self determining can chart there aren't course is uh to understand that some countries have a have borders that really reflect I'm an overwhelming majority of of one kind of national\nGroup right and when when I went when I was speaking of of a national group I'm not talking about biology or race I'm Talking about a a a an inherited\nA tradition characterized by language or religion and the history of mutual loyalty which is which which which allows the nation to to pursue projects together and to hold together and to a place like Iraq or Yugoslavia\nExactly the opposite it's it's a people who have more reason to fear their their neighbors then to think that there are a single coherent\nUnity together with them and if we go to America\nI think it's very important to to understand that the uh ... that we've been seeing in recent years and in recent weeks\nIn the United states is a ... is is a a a frightening\nUm a disintegration of the mutual loyalty that has traditionally held Americans together allowing them to see themselves as as one nation\nAnd that's probably the thing that's most uh most urgent for Americans today is to regain their nationalism which means they're national unity\nTo come stay with us one eight six six Bible jumbo our guest is Iran has only he's the author of the virtue of nationalism it as an unapologetic defense

... six six five oh jumbo when eight six six five oh five or six to six\nYou're Rob has only have written the virtue of nationalism ended it takes a look at a number of uh of of case studies\nOr is there are a favorite example as we go to a call here that that that comes up in your book the virtue of nationalism that that perhaps with which we're not all that familiar but what you feel makes the case emphatically for the nation state at least at this point in the in history\nOf the classic example is a is England which had declared independence or from from\nA Holy Roman empire and from the pope\nIn Fifteen thirty four that was be the example that all the rest of the nation states imitated the the the English felt that they had not only their own unique religious traditions but it constitutional tradition of freedom that was superior to anything in in France or Germany or Europe\nAnd the uh the idea of ... Henry the eighth apparently reflected a very broad sentiment that they thought that they could go it alone and be better off than taking orders from some foreign empire\nOne eight six six five oh jumbo we have Judy call again from a Ozark, Missouri hello Judy into welcome to the jumbo Anna Joe\nThank you I'm so glad you have this generally not and I have a question [noise] years ago I was doing some research for a paper I was writing\nAnd I came across an international organization that can't remember exactly who it was but the point of it was is the reason they wanted to do international treaties it superseded the sovereignty of each individual country\nWhich because individual countries are truly motion when they make these deals and it can cause all kinds of problems so if they intercede with their higher level than they don't have to worry about these vested interests in the sovereignty of the country how do you address\nThat because it's it's all over the place\n\nUh All right I I think go ahead go ahead yeah I I think\nIt is all over the place I mean a ... one of the\nReally striking things emphasized in in in the book is that\nFor most of its history the United states has has been very clearly committed to the idea of the United states has an independent nation and was an example to many others and uh the beginning especially after the fall of the Berlin Wall\nEverytime at Nineteen eighty nine\nWhen when the threat of communism lifted there were plenty of voices um you know ... ... people like like a Irving Kristol and Jeane Kirkpatrick who said All right we won the war let's let's bring the boys home\nAnd what was adopted instead is this conception of of a new world order President Bush\nAt the time if you remember it said that that uh we were going to replace a thousand generations of failure with with a new world order in which the the uh the uh which the law of nations would replace the law the junk\nAnd this concept I think up until ... plus or minus up until President Trump widow a whole generation of presidents who thought that one single rules for the entire world was was the ideal and the the the goal to go to and I think it's caused\nLots of heartache in trouble\nAlthough it would certainly do you have a follow up to that Judy or\nNo it was just the way they were still receiving the sovereignty and I didn't know how to how the case they persist that individual countries will go after their own\nInterests and that that it can't be run like that it was basically they just the whole idea so how do you read about it because there must be some way that the countries get along\nWe always obviously we're not talking here about a call for for total it or not\nIt's all a disagreement uh dissension are we a\nDr ... ... if you say independence right and if you say America's going to be independent the u._k. is going to be independent France is going to be independent and so on\nThen the the point is that there isn't anybody can force those countries to agree\nThere they're going to a compete with one another and they will um solve their problems by mutual agreement and if they don't solve their problems by mutual agreement then then they might end up going to war but that's that's a world that was familiar to us from from the last four hundred years\nThe question isn't you know is that the ideal the perfect world nobody thinks that's perfect world the question is is that better when people are are are free\nTo make their own decisions then a world in which you have some empire which pressures all the disagreements and and uh maybe brings peace but at the expense of\nLiberty at the expense of different countries being free ... to have their own traditions\nSo ah the United kingdom right now is is trying to leave Europe because they don't want a a effectively they they they don't want to German run organization\nDictating law in in the u._k. and you can see it's hard to do it's hard for them to come to an agreement so that the the UK may leave without any with without a negotiated agreement because\nAgreements between mature independent people don't always happen\nAnd I I think that this really does have a lot to do with maturity whether whether you ... you know the answer to have some\nBody which is going to simply imposed the answers or we're going to wait until the British and the Germans can reach an agreement that may take some time\nThere are enough All right Richard your call Judy what eight six six five oh jumbo one eight six six five oh five four six to six or John in Burlington, Vermont good evening\nBelieving I have a couple of comments or questions or one of them are for your guest or in terms of the countries of let's say China or Iran and North Korea which of those do you think best exemplifies his theory\n[noise]\nAre you asking me yes so he has he the questions are addressed you yes\nWell I I I think the questions that we should look for in a world of independent nations they're not all going to be nations that you like\nTo me that that that that's what independence means when you celebrate the fourth of July in the United states if Americans still do celebrate\nWhat you're saying is our country can chart its own course and the ... you can't you're not going to have England or China or Russia or anybody else dictate what we do know the theory of a world like that is is that different nations will have different forms of government some of them were not going to like\nYou you you read a lot in in the American press these days about uh about a Hungary Poland Israel Italy criticizing these countries and saying well that that they're not they're not being government the way we want them to be governed\nBut that's exactly the point the point is that if if Americans going to be a nation state and national state and it doesn't want others to to interfere in its elections and to tell us what to do their part partly it has to allow other countries the freedom to determine their own\nCourse and so there's a certain ah humility in that saying we don't necessarily have the the answers that we can dictate to every other country in the world invading Iraq\nI I think it's the best we've got I mean we keep having um\nUh we keep having these these um dictators rise\nI I'm I'm thinking of ... for example Napoleon Bonaparte uh and uh of course we have the example of Hitler but Napoleon is probably a more interesting example because Napoleon saw himself\nAs a as carrying forward the ideas of enlightenment and what he wanted to do was to bring freedom and equality to all the countries of Europe and to Egypt and to the rest of the planet\nAnd so he set up to conquer a the world in order to bring these liberal ideas to the world by force and ended up killing we don't really know three four five million people are before that\nThat adventure ended and so I I I I think that that the natural tendency to just say\nOh well I've got the right ideas let me just be in charge I I think unfortunately we are going to keep seeing historically attempts like that and I think that people who are a balanced and just should want to say no let's let's not attempt to force one set of ideas on everybody\nGrowing up ah more to come we'll be back in the moment\nFrom a barrier missing a horror in theory or through a deer damaging\nWe've

of the virtue of nationalism there's so much to cover in the book and I'd like you to just address maybe a couple of points that we haven't gotten to that you think are very important\nSure okay go ahead\nOh I said well if you were to pick a couple that I didn't get to do is to say that things that are absent from the discussion that you'd like to be sure already polluted\nWell I think I I think that right now it it it's really good idea to emphasize um uh to to to look at the question of tolerance or I I think probably\nMost of your listeners like me would would be real happy if they were living in a society that was\nA bit more tolerant of opposing views are than than what it is that we're seeing these days\nAnd then the question is where does that come from um I I I think often often people just a a a film that you know that that\nIt's kind of like a universal thing that people just\nJust think oh well what what's a reasonable person a reasonable person is somebody who tolerates other people's points of view and and and is willing to listen to them and to accept as you said that diversity in society but I I I think it isn't true I think society it go through um\nSometimes it's very rapid changes from being tolerant to intolerant I'm as we're seeing right now and what what intolerance is it it it's it's about it's not just about people being being selfish and nasty intolerance is about thinking that there's\nThat there's absolutely obviously one reasonable answer\nAnd it makes me angry when when other people come up with a different answer and you start you start calling them names and he started saying well those people who don't agree with me they're they're a deplorable or they're they're they're ignorant they're on and light there there is a liberal always word there in in in circulation right now\nAnd a big part of the the message of of nationalism is I see it is\nThat we we need to emphasize tolerating other other countries other forms of government that are not to our liking and that when we become that kind of tolerant person that'll help us with tolerating within our own societies\nUm people who who disagree with us I I think that's something that is desperately needed right now\nOkay are there are there are limits to that for example should the world is set by and watch the poll pot or a kill millions in Cambodia\nI think that I think there are obvious limit I mean it it's very hard to find somebody who\nWho will say well if there if there's a genocide going on and hundreds of thousands or millions of people are are are are being killed than you you're you're a neighboring country\nOr and and you have an armed forces you you you're capable of just going in quickly knocking over the the monsters who are perpetrating this

personally hate to see it put to the test so that we would say after maybe a couple of articles of impeachment voted against the president and\nIn a few other things that could potentially happen in the Democratic control of Congress or the uh we'll we'll see you know just how much gridlock can actually be put in place\nThere's not that much more that the president can do through executive orders he's done I think a good job and executive orders but uh fortunately we don't live in a country where presidents can rule by decree there are limits\nAnd Donald Trump is pretty much hit the wall there maybe a few more things but I'm not sure what they would even be a much of what he needs to be done needs to be done legislatively granted it would be helpful if they could have been done legislatively before now [noise]\nBut they haven't been\nMaybe they would or would not be done legislatively under a Republican controlled Congress I Would be the last to claim that Congress has been a picture of cooperation with their president but uh again there is a there are various levels of gridlock\nSo I'm just curious if your thoughts about that because the immigrants are counting on Republicans not casting a vote and I'm also curious\nHow the Kavanaugh nomination will affect your vote that is to say\nWill his confirmation or rejection whatever it turns out to be I think it'll be

eight six six five oh five or six to six\nI've never missed an election\nAnd I was really won't be missing this one I can guarantee you that ah there's always a good reason to vote again if you can't vote for somebody to vote against somebody there's always a good reason to vote and I'm curious what your thoughts about that starting with a call from John in Lewiston, Maine good evening John\nHey I just go ahead for for gave us the tip of crafts do they vote the guy and the judge and a don't worry about what they do because they're gonna ... gonna go off forever hell is the way these Democrats operate\nOf course and all it's not in fact let's not forget the fact that they may need some democratic votes we don't know yet about every Republican\nThing you know perhaps they're all lock step with each other like\nNot now Sara Lee not necessarily I think Joe Manchin of West Virginia\nA than the others even even uh Donnelly of Indiana Joe Donnelly who said he was going to be a no vote and then the change that I'll be a maybe a boat\nA Claire McCaskill probably a no vote not necessarily Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota I I Can't I don't think you can say that all Democratic senators are automatically know boats by any stretch of imagination if you had to put money on it my money would be on a on Joe Manchin hoping to save his seat in West Virginia by voting for Kavanaugh\nWell if our Republican congressmen would vote for him all ... states Suzanne Collins on the fence and a couple other one we wouldn't even have to worry about those Democrats\nThat well that's true but of course and the other side of the coin in Maine for example Susan Collins is about as conservative as senator is you're going to get the choice was pretty much in Maine between\nEight yes it admitted rhino but who will still vote for certain Republican financial ideas and she's not an out now socialist\nOr I Am a Democrat who is pretty much an out and on social is another word a conservative Republican I wouldn't have a snowball's chance in Miami Beach in Maine\nRight that's true you know what I voted for to thank all of that now because I liked her at all it was because the first thing that ran against her was even worse at her\nIt was ... you know the first Atlantic ... with a straight a socialist Democrat I had no choice but to vote for her but I Would prefer to vote for someone that was like a page and our place\nIn in a in a in a a Republican primary in may and I I'm hard pressed to believe that no conservative ran at all\n[noise] she was her and another girl and the other girl was straight Democrat there was\nNo no that's an a general election I'm Talking about in the primary when it's Republican against Republican there I don't know if you know conservative Republican bother to run against Susan Collins\nWell they make it through the primary\nWell I mean again but that that was your chance if it doesn't make it through the primary then uh you know [laughter] I guess you know that's that's tough view oh it was but I mean it later at least if somebody Rand you had the option of flying for that\nIn ... Maine as liberals and in northern part at Maine is a Republican in not liberal so we got the southern part of may votes for liberals and ended up north but we voted arc this president arc that guy and all of age it's therapeutic some Maine split counted middle when it comes to that\nThe bottom part of course voted for her like that because there was a liberal bell south of ... there's conservatives talk more population down south so you got or for liberal arts down south and All right well\nAgain you know you you you do the best you can but uh [noise] uh let me ask you this are you voting on November the ...\nAh yes well good for you it's a very important people vote\nI vote always and when I go down the ticket I poked straight Republican because our or do you know I don't believe in what the Democrats leave it and even if I don't know who it is it's right he's still getting Republican or a vote the whole the whole ticket Republican all without\nA ... a Democrat ever\nAh I I I Will I Will not close the door and the possibility but these days I I don't know who would possibly be though I uh I share your your feelings in that regard one eight six six five oh Jim ... is our number one eight six six five oh five or six to six on the go ahead and Joe\nAnd uh let us talk to a David ... from Cedar Rapids Iowa this evening good evening David\nHello yeah my my opinion about the whole cabinet thing is that uh actually at the Republicans are going to get ... you know it was nominated you know it\nCan mean you'll probably get confirmed I agree\nYeah and then the Democrats are going to try to black and look at how far it gets or an animal and let's get a day another\nOr how how ... how can they do they actually confirmed had and how do they block and before that and now they're talking about they might try to beat you wants to be sworn in but then once the vote occurs how could they possibly keep him for being sworn in\nAt ... they'll probably come up with some\nWell lean and identity oddly curious to know what that could possibly be other than kidnapping him\nWell I mean well the thing is is that they'll they'll try started thing I mean it's getting to the point where they are ... Democrats actually fired around that can ...\nWell ... ... as the girl there's been an unfortunate viewpoint I Would agree on the part of far too many Democrats many of whom are running scared from

suspicious on below I'm actually a friend says Republicans and Democrats are blaming each other for trying to slow down the confirmation process for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh but the Kenyon reports from Capitol Hill\nAnd FBI investigation is underway to look into sexual assault allegations against the nominee Democrats went the findings to be made public majority leader Mitch McConnell cost is just another attempt by the Democrats sand and the gears the goalposts keep getting moved the Senate's democratic leader Chuck Schumer cutting let that one down\nThe goal of the man to complain about a one week away for an FBI hearing when he held up a nominee for the Supreme Court and kept the seat vacant for ten months is that the FBI\nHas until the end of the week to complete its investigation and men says McConnell the Senate will vote Lindy Kenyan capital here\nOn below but dress to President Trump apparently contained the substance suspected to be the deadly poison rice and appeared to be connected to similar owns a little sense of the Pentagon Tuesday was two pieces of mail delivered to the Pentagon mail room also tested positive for the poison the oval ups were not passed on to the White House were Pentagon officials\nYeah yeah right right and and it's I think the you know what you're saying here really is that I mean it goes back to that buzzfeed um the the editor at at at buzzfeed saying this is how we see are you know are journalists now\nAh and for the foreseeable future basically as active as is this what he was saying that was the message and that's exactly what you're seeing right now since saying\nWell we got a ton of things to ah to talk about the background check could be completed today was interesting the story that said you know or discuss this in our personal meaning or where the lawyers for Dr Ford are are\nAre saying look she hasn't been you know you haven't interviewed her yet yeah and I saw store yesterday saying the FBI may not interviewer because she's already been interviewed right what we keep ... and\nWe even because again because when you're talking about the FBI everybody thinks about an investigation this is not an investigation right so all they are looking for is\nWitnesses and any new information\nWhat other witnesses are there are a you know are out there what\nWere the allegations that were made right ... what were the allegations that\nWere made again here or in you know that that uh you know in the hearing\nThat caused because it was after the hearing okay we need to add the FBI do for their background check okay what's\nThe new news out there and I started thinking I said why wouldn't they interview and I'm like oh it's not an investigation into background checks they already know what you said\nNone of them now I don't know I mean they may interviewer but I I was thinking well why wouldn't they and I went oh she's already\nBeen interview as any interview\nBy the Judiciary Committee and so what they're looking at is okay what other information is is out there what other witnesses are out there what did she say at this hearing right and we will go talk to those people because she's the one making the allegations she's the one that testified under oath we don't need to interview well\nShe made her statement in fact she made her today was right to the Senate\nIf there were any thing or that she anything else you wanted to introduce introduced\nTo this scenario to this a process kick it actually she can do right now she could what she could still do it right and uh she and she had the opportunity to do it last Thursday but the great point you just made she still has the opportunity it's still open\nRight and so what they don't have is they didn't have we didn't have witnesses making statements\nSo she's the one making the allegation so they're checking out her story mhm and if she doesn't updated with the Judiciary Committee the FBI maybe looking at this and saying well there's ... look to see the allegations she made ears and people she mentioned we talked to those people we give you a report\nWell because here's what the people said we don't need to interview her her statement is on record we need to interview all the other people that she made the allegations against or claimed that they were witnesses she has made her statement right we have that and if she wishes to change it she can go back to the she can write a letter to to the Judiciary Committee\nStating a here's more information and then the FBI can go check that but they're not doing a here's the point\nThey're not doing a background check on Dr for no they're not\nThey're doing the background check a on the allegations that she made against Kavanaugh that we've\nTalked in recent days about the the possibility of her perjuring herself\nBy telling a different story to the FBI but really when you think about it and you're back away from the whole thing and you look at the the entire forest and not just the the you know the trees here than you or ... you very quickly come to the conclusion that there's likely zero political will to go after her for perjury\nUnless she came out and said everything I said was false\nAnd my testimony right and I I admit that I was lying about that they they would then but but any kind of you know variants in a story to the FBI likely is not going to be pursued a by the chairman a Grassley or\nBy anyone in the house I Know I I I you you see Grassley saying they want to investigate the fact that her boyfriend said something is something else because she was asked to specific question have you ever helped anybody and uh you know to pounce on them about you know how to take a a polygraph test and she said no and her boyfriend\nIs said yes but I view that as putting pressure on her credibility politically in order to get the votes look once the votes on\nWhat I Want to vote is made if he is if he is confirmed it's done it's over yeah rights ... this is this won't even be a topic next week we'll be back on we'll be back on the Russian collusion\nYeah yeah yeah it is not a ... and and and I guess\nThis is it is it the whole I on the ball thing this has to be is the process is is really to determine you know or whether the those handful of senators actually uh believe he should be said it or not and that that's it that's actually the only question here\nThe media and the and the left in the media and social media want you to believe it's about Kavanaugh and you know and and you must think\nThat he is you know a rapist or whatever they want to label him as now that's how you build political pressure\nBut actually just what a\nFive weeks out from the mid term election\nIt's it is it's different because they're going to look at the polls it's the polls that build that pressure and I mean the polls on the candidates themselves not whether they believe you brought us to pull the other night of while it when you introduced the facts to the case\nMore people believe in fact it was a majority yeah ... you see that\nYeah fifty fifty seven percent than a change what they think and then when asked will if the FBI comes back with their report because once ... once they were told that the three witnesses to cooperate and witnesses that she named\nThan cooperated they said oh OK than than he should be confirmed and then write the fifty seven percent then they said well if the FBI does the background check and\nFinds out no new information was sixty percent of Americans believe that he should be confirmed a at a you know at that point of course you're gonna forty percent of America as we said you know roughly it's forty percent Republican forty percent Democrats and the rest of her into the other twenty percent is roughly independence and that's what you're trying to\nUh you know that that's who you're trying to convince those in the middle ... those are the senators were looking out as well right and so uh that will that that you know who knows that that poll probably was looked at by a lot of those\nAre a lot of those or a senator so I'm a you know I I think the whole thing of the doctor for commit perjury ... on that will remain a you know will remain an issue I don't know whether they would\nI doubt I'd be surprised if they if they come from him this weekend mhm I think it's all done yet either go to another and then they\nAnd they will do anything they they move on they move on to the uh the the the next thing they move on to promoting the fact or if I was the Republicans I Would promote the fact that you know we you know the ... the we you know the Supreme Court you know we've got we've got the Supreme Court ... going up to the the uh\nElection and that would be promoting math to irks me NAFTA or whatever it is now us MCA [laughter] yeah I'd I'd be promoting the the the the trade deal and Republicans you know uh you know we're going to be voting on a that before the term I'd be talking about all the positives\nAnd that I'd be talking about also what your political enemy spouses and you would reflect on what has happened you know in the campaign and I think that's what they would focus on at that point uh I just don't think that they would look backwards who knows I mean whether they could have a a a separate committee a\nYou know continuing investigation as to whether she did commit perjury and and and not make it high profile because there would be no hearings it would just be an investigation and down the road\nA as a warning shot to anybody who might do it to a a you know a future nominee with you know ... come in and and commit perjury if they could prove it probably was perjury right you know they might they might do that as long as it was low key\nTo add a you're not going to hearings on that or a big to do on that because once they confirmed him the battle is over we must callers could well they shouldn't go after every Democrat no the winner is you can you get him a on the Supreme Court yep after that that's the victory that's the super bowl\nYeah that's it uh and and I think Republicans to uh you you also campaigned on look ah\nThis this this kind of battle may not be behind us necessarily while it is specifically with Kavanaugh there's a real possibility that this president whether in this term or maybe in his second term would not would have the opportunity to see another\nJustice and\nThat's a big deal we know how now we know what levels the ... ... to which the left is willing

Danley thanks so much we appreciate it a nice sometimes to us yesterday and ah we had talked about briefly last week I mean the cabinet thing has just dominated the news\nBut it's when you and I actually on the air because there were so many of the things going on and we're just having a conversation on it when we went oh\nDes and ah the the the president a ...\nOn Twitter and this goes back to what is the twenty first ...\nI met with the department of justice concerning the classification of various on redacted documents they agreed to release them but stated that doing so may have a perceived negative impact on the Russia probe Trump wrote on Twitter\nAlso a key allies asked us not to release or for the inspector general\nHas been asked to review these documents on an expedited basis I Believe he will move quickly on this and hopefully other things which she is looking at in the end I can always to classify it proves necessary speed is very important to me and every one\nSo the story came out and it just sort of died down and and you and I and this has to maybe it was probably the very beginning of of of last week\nAnd\nWe said a few days have gone by and the cabinet thing was just huge and we just went\nWait a minute inspector general\nIf the if he allies are saying you know that you know we believe that some of the information is too sensitive well then you go back to your director of national intelligence ... and you may go back to the department of justice and you say okay what do you think\nShould were released this or you talk you talk to a palm pale\nRight\nFormer CIA director who's now\nSecretary of state and you and you say okay the you know should we release is how will this affect what we're doing you know because what they came out was it was Great Britain that said they didn't want information coming out and Christopher Steele apparently where it was one report and Christopher Steele is is the former British or\nA spy who was part of the Democrats colluding with the Russians to change the outcome of the ... to Christopher Steele\nA a boat just to lay it out again the DNC and Hillary Clinton camp a campaign gave money to the law firm ... who gave it to the opposition research firm I'm fusion GPS who then gave the money to Christopher Steele who got the information\nUh from people he claims inside the Kremlin the unverified dirt on Donald Trump and we know it was done with that on verified dirt so that's where the Christopher Steele you know the whole thing comes comes in a to this uh and so\nAnd one of the key players there at fusion GPS or was married to still is married but at the time her husband was a high ranking a department of justice of racial Bruce Bruce or and\nThen we know what they used you know the the Pfizer warned and all that ... well so we wanted well wait a minute says makes sense you you don't give it to the inspector general the inspector general only looks at corruption and\nA\nAnd by the way that's almost a replay of what happened I think maybe it was a ... a week ago Monday arrives down we brought it up yeah because there were just other things and we just started going over it and we went we don't understand why would you give it to the inspector general of the inspector general ... you know you get this information at some redacted you're looking at it\nAnd and and ah all of a sudden oh the light bulb goes off it would\nBe an internal matter which would be in a scenario like this if it is a fact that people at the Justice Department are under in the Obama administration\nWere more working to get information and use that false information that dossier\nOr to get a warrant knowingly using it to get a slice of war then that would be corruption that would be abuse of power that would be a massive", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Jim Bohannon Show", "city": "Johnson City", "day": "03"}
