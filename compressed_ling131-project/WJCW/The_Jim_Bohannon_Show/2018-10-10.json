Rex Tillerson was secretary of state\nFor going in her own way for sort of seeming to either off the costs are based on her own uh ideas rather than going along with at least what Tillerson seemed to be voting or when it came to Syria or North Korea in particular so in that sense it was a bit more independent and maybe some people have like\nA bite or you know I just I don't think it's new most important position the world but she's a you know a a sort of charisma addict politician or it was one of the few women obviously at the top of the Trump Administration so she gets a lot of attention\n[noise] also I Believe I'm if I'm not mistaken that ah the UN ambassador a sits in a cabinet meetings although if they do of course technically had a department of government\nYeah it's yeah it's it's technically a cabinet position that's true\nYeah one eight six six five oh jumbo is our number one eight six six five oh five or six to six Benjamin Friedman I guess senior fellow at ... at the fence priorities their website is their name defense priorities dot org\nAnd uh uh let me have your thoughts are if you could about uh the transitions from secretaries of State Tillerson to a Pompeo uh about any any changes the fat signaled and about uh the methods by which they have conducted foreign policy\nSo that is a method by which they conducted foreign policy are ... are a little bit nebulous\nUh in that um I don't know much not much has been written or has come out about how management practices that change under pump a oh except for the fact that he's been a little bit more of the cheerleader for uh the state department personnel on and has got some credit for that after\nTillerson or want it to slash the budget and so forth was not\nToo popular with his employees but uh in in substantive policy terms uh Tillerson and this administration wound up being one of the biggest dog's a he was an advocate of or at least a\n[noise] some of the time of an advocate of hard on the sea and uh [noise] getting along with uh North Korea is ultimately\nOccurred uh and he was reluctant or to get out of the Iran deal a President Trump cited that as a reason for firing him so a\nPale was is more of a down the line hawk\nOr who fits into the sort of neoconservative camp but at the very hawkish a pro war side of the Republican Party like ground ball and Haley I think fits pretty well in that in that group is well she's maybe a little more fond of allies but other than that I mean she's quite similar those two\nYeah that that by the way he brings up an interesting thought as well I remember when John Bolton was first ah tapped to serve this administration and I I uh invented an imaginary conversations in the oval office in which President Trump is sitting there with his top advisors say you know we\nWere vastly over extended with us troops around the world in Europe or fifty thousand I've been in Korea and the like we need to start pulling back\nHow do you feel about that John Bolton and it just [laughter]\nI mean it just struck me as this was kind of like the odd couple pairing in that regard and as it is true on on a lot of issues it makes you wonder just exactly where Donald Trump is I Know that he has\nShown that in some instances a great job we say versatility of conviction about various issues but but I'm not sure the extent to which this president could be considered Neal conservative\nNo I did I have a lot of words that um but that's probably not one uh yeah I think it\nIs he's come around a one way or the other or whether it's because of conviction or just personnel decisions or whatever a tool ah being much more amenable or to people who are were labeled that way and and probably neoconservatives not the right word\nOr for people maybe like Tom pay or salt and who are just a very aggressive and willing to use military force or maybe more than most people and particularly a eager I think\nTo get into conflict with Iran uh so uh that's a big theme of the Trump Administration this president talked about ending some wars\nReportedly wanted to get troops out of Afghanistan wanted to get troops out of Syria obviously not of the things that happened and we re committed uh in in the case here I live in a it's a and come up with any reason to keep troops there so or\nWhatever is in the president's a heart or brain uh on these matters in in substantive turns it seems like he's a made a move towards the more hawkish way of the party\nWill call me when Bill Kristol is named the UN ambassador we'll continue with Benjamin

gym will have a show at one eight six six five oh jumbo one eight six six five oh five or six to six as we continue our discussion about\nTo be a resignation of Nikki Haley abrupt at least in terms of its public announcement although the president says he's known about this now for several months and this will not take effect until the end of the year but they're coming as it does or just a few weeks before\nThe midterm elections the timing certainly is to say the least uh interesting\nPeter ... joins us a call ... political strategist contributor for the Washington Examiner and Peter good to have you with us tonight\nGreat treated you and\nYour your take on this were you surprised as apparently everybody else except for the president\nYou know I was surprised I I honestly didn't see it coming but I Do think that the president surprised um you know I think ... alien the president while they had had certainly there cause like\nI think they do have a good relationship I think Trump obviously as we can tell the speech today is very very proud of the early or work as an eye on 'em and you know from Nikki addition I think resigning now kind of makes sense\n[noise] one eight six six five oh jumbo one eight six six five oh five four six to six the timing of course in relation to the midterms with a a some a degree of instability certainly for the first half of the of the first term of the Trump Administration more than\nThan the average administration in terms of turnover and of course continue speculation about names like\nJeff Sessions the attorney general in as a deputy Rod Rosenstein uh it it does seem as though this could have waited until November seventh\nYeah you know it does seem that way it is my only gas is potentially they see this as\nSomething to basically kind of ride the cabin I'll Wait out because think about this you know the cabinet wave is definitely going to galvanize Republican voters\nBut we have four weeks until the mid term election so I think that if we can basically all because we can try more the media by talking about you know who's going to replace the alien ... says they talk about her record that's going to keep I think the Democrats away from essentially getting too are putting a cap and I will still are Republicans to turn out you know especially the base\nWas taught to Randy calling from Springfield, Missouri grieving Randy\nYes sir and you're on the radio on your mind reading\nA yeah earlier this year uh she's she said she told Donald Trump that she was going to resign by the end of the year that she was done\nRight five or six months ago so I don't know what the big hubbub is\nWill the hub of I guess would be that the the ... does not need any more signs of instability and it could have waited until after the election I think that's the main thing that I see why why announce it now uh granted it's not a major factor I'm sure the casting a vote by most people but\nBut politics is made up of a little factor is this going to wait it I just it seems rather odd but uh that they had to announce it now in the middle of a one of the more important midterm election campaigns in us history that would be be my feeling a\nLeader yeah I I understand that yeah it it all makes sense now that you've said that\nUh well I mean then that's the thing to me it it it doesn't make sense ah that's that's why I'm I'm I'm having trouble understanding that the uh Peter was or anything about this well at least based on what we know what do you think about this that that couldn't have waited\nSure you know I'm not saying that it couldn't have waited ... again I think at this point you know\nEight ten twelve hours after it was announced it is really just rank speculation I mean as far as kind of what you call it a civility I I Will say that people certainly don't like the turnover at the top not that the turnover is excessively unprecedented but it is that it\nIt's higher than average age is higher than average but I think the fact that she's willing to stay on for a few more months it's not like she's like hey I'm resigning next week you know is that an Anthony Kennedy resignation do it's a lot different than I Am\nA ... your take if you could give us a on on the Trump foreign policy uh today that as we noted a bit with our our previous discussion with the been Friedman uh it it does seem like the president who campaigned pretty much as a very uh\nUh anti neo conservative has at times or move more in that direction the not the least of which our\nOur uh moves in Syria and of course the naming of John Bolton to the the inner a White House circle because it's a little hard on this as of course on a number of other issues to depend on as president down in in terms of just what it is he he believes\nYeah you know I Do agree with you on that I I Will say though that if you are going to try and present down you can pin down by the people that are out and so we've seen especially the neo Conway grow and the uh\nMore anti global is weighing that Steve Bannon wing type the White House diminish um as far as their influence so you could essentially seek out a precursor to what the policy will be by who the personnel are\nOne eight six six five oh jumbo when eight six six five oh five or six to six are wondering about\nA possible names that we can uh mentioned in terms of a replacement of course ah\nAh the president himself has floated one named of is said to be on the list of a five or a short list names the former White House advisor Dina Powell the president praised us ... Germany Richard Grinnell as a person who would do a great job although he likes him where he is as a passenger to Germany\nOr any other thoughts that you have as regards ah ah\nThe possible direction this might or might signal\nWill will Tina ... is obviously the main in head of the fact that he says is that she is on the shortlist and denounce her name would ideally say that she's a leading candidate I mean other people that he didn't mention is the current ambassador Russia is John has been acting under secretary for public policy and public affairs Heather Nauert\nSo those are two other people you know we don't know who the entire shortlist is although Rick Cornell is currently on that short\nBut has always can change 'em so you know it's certainly something that you know I think he's been expecting and I think he's just kind of waiting to announce it for a little while to get the suspension because I don't think he I essentially you need to basically close these days that I think he does and he's got a pretty much decide you have to try the court in these days as you and I both know\nWell that's true yeah ... that's that's one aspect of of this job that he certainly does seem to have a pet I Will continue aren't as good at it yeah\nBitter about various columnist political strategist contributor for the Washington Examiner and we're at one eight six six five oh jumbo one eight six six five oh five or six to six we'll be back in just a moment\nThe national debt is now over twenty million dollars what happens next rising inflation drops in the dollars some experts say another crashes coming you can fight this not with stocks or bonds but we've gold and silver coins and an IRA from Augusta precious metals\nCoal eight five five eight five eight five eight oh seven and learn how an IRA backed by physical gold and silver can hedge against inflation calling us too precious metals right now and he's five five eight five eight five eight oh seven and get a free golden eye or a guy called eight five five eight five eight five eight oh seven\n... attention all authors page publishing is looking for authors have you written a book and want to get it published he's publishing we'll get your book into bookstores and Brazil on line at Amazon apple I do in other outlets\nThey handle all aspects of the publishing process for you printing ... publicity copyright an editing got eight hundred fines or one thirty six eighty nine now for your free author ... should get that seat under advisor or one thirty six eighty nine for your free\nAuthor submission get again eight hundred bonds or one thirty six eighty nine ...\nNo matter\nHow modern your family might be if you're pedaling rent that rock and a gas engine vehicle you're living in the past [noise]\nAround the electric vehicle has arrived in celebration electric cars are more fun to drive and more affordable than ever electric cars are here again to the president learn more and plug into the present dot com or something like a group of America\n[noise]\nOn video from a barrier messing up the horror interior to adhere to\nRecovered it talked to farmers we know one thing or two because we've seen a thing or two we\nAre\nAnd you're right my name is ... ... [noise]\n\nWhat about the jumbo had show as we are looking at the departure of Nikki Haley as the United states ambassador to the United nations effective at the end of the year and the columnist political strategist a contributor to the Washington Examiner Peter ... is our guest\nThis hour does come this announcement one day after it I'll just ask your thoughts on any connection\nOne day after the citizens for responsibility and ethics in Washington requested that Haley being investigated by the state department inspector general for potential ethics violations\nA sliding Haley's twenty Seventeen financial disclosures they say she and her husband accepted seven flights on luxury private aircraft from three South Carolina businessmen Haley says the flights qualified for an exception based on a personal relationship\nWith the the giver are your thoughts on how that may have played a role here if at all\nWell I I I personally believe Nikki Haley on that but it doesn't really matter if you do because her actual letter of resignation with tendered on October third which has six days ago people say oh you know they just back they did or something it was actually ... and it's been proven to have been under six days ago\nIt was just announced a you know within the past twenty four hours because they need some time you know with the law that says do it obviously they're not going out with Nikki Haley was deciding right is that the status of that wouldn't have gotten so well so they waited do it a few days\nSince we have you here we might as well wrap up on a look ahead or just a less than five weeks to the mid term elections arguably one of the most important ones in the in recent memory your thoughts on the Democratic prospects for taking either house of Congress\nYou know I think the Democrats have a pretty decent shot at taking the house um just because of how the races play out obviously all four hundred and thirty five seats are up for grabs however that it um ... seats that are up for grabs are currently held by Democrats or one by Trump or most of those by double digits including West Virginia by forty three points\nSo a lot of states are opportunities for Republicans pick up a I Would take like a head I think if the Democrats take the house I think the Republicans slowly maintain that ... the seats in the Senate and we're going to spend the next two years taking out a lot of regulation and can vary a lot of judges because probably not a lot of legislation is going to get out\nAnd they're going to spend the whole time is trying to impeach the president very unsuccessfully\nYeah absolutely I mean I I don't think it would take more than ... seat majority of due to impeach the president in the house but of course that they would never in a million years get sixty seven votes to convict in the Senate so it's not like a Donald Trump would be going anywhere or for that matter of Brett Kavanaugh\nBut right out and\nYou know which it strikes me as really an overreach the notion that I don't believe that it would be constitutionally permissible or even assuming that you place credibility of the story from Dr ... board I don't think you would be\nA constitutionally permissible to impeach him for something that happened thirty five years before he took office\nYeah I mean ... years old they\nBring it on because it's just going to really anger the average American\nI think when people see Republicans tried to get stuff done and Democrats just try to do anything they can with investigations and subpoena powers and\nDoing everything it can really bogged down the Trump Administration like you really think that if the Democrats it investigation and they found nothing for Russia or any of anything else that they're doing that they really say All right well we'll give up this game and just got very like normal come on we already know what they're going to do we saw what they would do with cab and I will give him an edge\nWait till they added mile so I said bring it on and they're going to get at the polls and twenty twenty\nWell certain I Would hope that you are correct in that regard I'm not sure that the the the majority or at least of all of this where there was a significant portion of the population out there that I think that anything that was against Trump they would they would be for uh I also ah there's also\nSee the population that any anti trunks there again yeah yeah it was a very large very very motivated base of that and I think your average just\nFlyover country type of America and uh they're gonna just probably look at the eye and look at any radical leftists but after twenty twenty like what could they could have Joe Biden every day but depending on who they put out that they put up\nThe radical left as well as the war on our Cory Booker Bernie Sanders people are also vote down ballot generally how they vote for the presidential party so we can take back the house if they lost it as such we pick up more seats in both houses of Congress and Keith presidency I think it's a real possibility I think it'll happen at a crystal ball but nothing was either\nYeah it is tough for me to imagine what happens in the next two years if in fact the Democrats capture either house probably the house of representatives if if either a\nI'm not sure of what is left with this administration to do in terms of executive orders I mean most of that it would seem to me was addressing the first two years what's left that he knew all these oh\nSure I mean they can do it what's the regulatory efforts as they can and frankly because the Senate has you know advice and consent hours he can basically just push through a ton of judges and here's the legislation is great legislation can be overturned it's a lot harder to\nBasically an stack up at ... uh I'm not saying quarterback but I'm saying pill you know empty seats and make sure that that's the priority that voters though that that's what we're doing to leave a legacy same thing with the deregulatory efforts there was a lot longer than any tax reform package or anything else\nI'm not that they're not all Orton but they're really critical especially Democrats take back the house to do what we can and those are big things\nFor the really big things I have to ... this year is\nYeah I have to wonder if in the next ten years we're going to see another Supreme Court nominee receive more than the four votes let's say from the party a not in the White House I mean it seems like this has become so it's a totally partisan thing\nYeah I really think it will be that way and I think frankly I think Republicans that if there was a Democrat president I think Republicans would do anything that can I mean let's say God Forbid something happens Clarence Thomas like let's say I mean you know\nI I don't know Clarence Thomas has health but he doesn't look like America runner to me and he's Seventy years old almost Seventy ... let's say you know something happens and and\nFive years when he's Seventy three Seventy four Seventy five a Democrat could appoint someone I can see Republicans doing anything they could to obstruct that so I think it will be coming out the game it's going to depend on Senate majorities enough the political seat now\nVery good to stay on the line we'll speak briefly off air

[noise]\nHurricane Michael ambassador resigns pancakes hurricane Michael is expected to come ashore on the Florida Panhandle is a category for storm meteorologist Tom said her\nLandfall should be between three and six PM right now the track and the national Hurricane Center habit of land fall as the three but it it is possible still laugh for we can't worry about three or four because it's bringing with it a major hurricane status that is going to move by quickly this is not going to be like Harvey is not going to be like Florence and drop a lot of rainfall\nBut what we'll do is bring more of a punch and more of an impact than Florence ever did it landfall\nAs you know but what happens is it clear as all the shells everyone panics at this ... this is a system gets taken out of whack that for no reason that I can take place for the people who really need it\nYeah uh and that raises of course the big issue of what you can do beforehand and and we're talking here of course about\nPreparation before the fact as a general rule one of the kinds of things that people should have in their home and I suppose that would include something I guess it could be called a goat kids write something you you're grabbing run\nAbsolutely like now the panhandle I was just up there and that even a month and a half ago\nEven if all kinds of free but when you got to go pack you've got to have resources to get out of town and know where you're going to go you got to have at least three places choice one choice to choice three now what's important about the choices that where you gonna do\nYou have to leave where would the people that no way you're going to do and everyone knows\nOptions one suing three so everyone is split up\nThis way if option and one there is no damage or an area that people can go to people will know that you're there so\nThis way people do not search for you when you're fine safe and years you know\nJust hanging out and having a a margarita somewhere some hotel that you planned on going rather than than thinking that way you are is in danger because they can't get a hold of you because communications is down the second thing is\nTechnology and communications that is the one thing\nThat people misunderstand or what it is when people think that you're in jeopardy\nTheir mind start thinking it falls to the most dangerous things happen to you and your family sudden how you're going to panic and you're going to try to find what happened and maybe even put yourself in danger or others to find\nA ... and now of course families if you have something that the strike suddenly like like a tornado for example obviously with a hurricane you're going to have days of of warning and they do take occasional weird turns but for the most part this is the kind of thing you see come and get tornado of course could drop out of the sky on ... minutes notice\nAnd uh I guess what's the important family you know we families don't spend all day together a mom and dad may be at work or or at home or kids probably in school and the it is very possible to be separated under circumstances where are the homeless say has gone wild\nMy whole neighborhood destroyed where where our mom were are dead and so this I guess this preparation includes a lot more than just a a ... of friends and a and a family or let's say at some distance aunts and uncles this sort of thing the immediate nuclear family has to know exactly what these places are to go and and a and\nB order a priority right\nAbsolutely because that's the way you know where you're going to go so let's say we have to you know we're in the market\nAnd we have to evacuate if the storm is coming from the directions we back away at area number one which will be the land the area that you know the east coast of Florida so this way where on that side of the state you know while you're traveling you know\nWhat happens is the need occasional can go down especially when the storms in the outer bands\nKnockout technology like cell towers you could be in a dead zone family is trying to get a hold of you they don't know when you when you want at least if they know that you are definitely headed towards option number one they could at least leave work for you and call\nThat hotel or call that a couple of\nAll that and so that's an important factor is when you're out of reach\nPeople should have already know what the plan is way you're going to go as well as those\nWho are coming in your direction because they have to evacuate so you know that family is coming to your direction see your plays or within your area evacuated an area that is under you know I'm evacuation routes\nAnd ... this may be a little weird but then again maybe not maybe it's just prudent I'm Wondering about the possibility of some relatively slow weekend\nOf a mom and dad saying you know we're we're going to a pack a picnic lunch\nAnd we're going to actually go to our various options in case we ever have to evacuate the home and the will make a will make a a kind of a fun day out of a drill a maybe we'll even taken to a tourist attraction or something on the way but we are going to rehearse where we go or is that are going too far\nBut not allowed at all I mean that is very hurt and and the ability to know where you're going to be so when you make reservations or you're going to that specific place April ... no not only where it is but how to actually get there in the best route especially if you're taking any kind of\nOdd ball side road route you want to know how you're going to get as a let's say\nIt's a certain major highway that takes you directly there\nBut you decided hey why don't we take the side wrote people your family should know\nThat you will be taking

Jim I a in reverse order just experiences that I had one we had the most recent hurricane at the at the east coast\nAnd this has nothing to do with technology itself being taken out the amount of traffic using technology so overwhelmed that are all computer systems on the east coast were affected to the effect that that there were times when you could not go further than\nGoing to a website\nAnd then you could not interact because there was just too much traffic\nPrevious to that one New Year's Eve I was sending out a happy New Year's messages\nAnd a quarter after twelve by suddenly started getting notices that my messages had failed okay the phone tried to reset and then it wouldn't work of about four hours later I started getting messages from people why are you sending me so many messages\nEvery time my phone and tried to reset it just piled up in the queue at the local a cell tower cell tower was still functioning but it was overloaded with messages and then it started sending them out and I had to spend the next day\nGoing through my phone and canceling every message I set out so would stop sending them in an emergency I can just imagine your cell tower works\nBut there's so much traffic that your messages take two days to get out and buy that and how much good does it do to tell someone that where you're going because you're nowhere near where you you were when you set the message yeah ... ...\nWell that is correct but let's say the big event to play that takes place that's causing this problem is a seven day event and you got your messages to daily two days later\nYou're still out in a in the wilderness and you still needs to communicate even if you are messages get there a day later two days later it doesn't matter how many days later the important thing is eventually if your messages get\nThrough and the people on the other side now now that you're fine that you just took another route and you're at your location that's good enough for that because now they don't have to spend the next four or five days thinking about what happened to you\nKnow I ... thanks Randy appreciate your thoughts when it's six six by boat jumbo our number one eight six six five oh five\nOr six to six or in terms of ah of things that are easily overlooked uh one thing of course when there's a sudden disaster like a tornado or something and people think oh I've got to grab certain things I got to grab the are the important papers got to grab the wedding pictures\nAre there are are are granted where the tornado probably ... that there is no time at all but let's say it's a rapidly rising flood\nThere there have to be some order of priorities here or perhaps maybe even a grouping of things\nMaybe ah ah I don't know putting putting certain important documents in in a certain a portable box or just sort of brainstorming here but but clearly when time is the essence and people want to rescue certain things they shouldn't jeopardize their lives to do it what advice do you have\nEveryone has they print or ... days I'm sure\nDon't know if anyone does and and most printers ... scanners so\nEveryone should be scanning their documents putting it on a thumb drive that very inexpensive\nA sixteen gate thumb drive against can pretty much all of your pictures let's say you needed a sixty four gay or something of that type that not very expensive there under thirty to forty dollars that you know as you can scan all your documents\nAnd make sure that you know you want to have copies of your life says\nCopies of your passport copies of everything that is needed so you can recoup your life so this way when you go to the MB when you go to the state department and or you go\nAny place you have at least the documents with the numbers the code numbers don't those accounts et cetera so this way you can recapture your life\nBack from wherever you are because you have at least a digital scans documents on your possession you know putting it on the cloud\n... you know there for those that wonder whether or not their security out there at the Pentagon and the White House and you can talk about other important celebrities who had their files hacked\nThere's no such thing as security anyone that things that they're as there is so ...\nYou know most important documents scanned and ... percent in a cloud in a um thumb drive format that only when it's plugged in sort of computer that that day that can be accessed\nOne eight six six five oh Jim bode let's go to Jim ... who is in central Oregon the tonight and hello Jim\n...

[laughter]\nLeisure with\nUs on the jumbo headed showed one eight six six five oh jumbo what eight six six five oh five or six to six ads will be co big disaster preparedness expert our guest is website emergency prepping a Billy in a better job each Michigan joins what's this evening hello Billy\nYeah good evening yeah I'd like to tell you by the program we're down there in ... county um the emergency manager as organized about twenty or twenty five uh busted in a county it's called a simple emergency response the third\nAnd we've all been drain over a period of about five years so that if they had an emergency that was overwhelming the resources in the emergency manager could activate their people\nTo help out in many different ways it might be the local achievement do your ... your neighbors and make it you know they're All right ah it might be helping with a trivia\nMight be helping the fire department to do while I'm whatever that would be it is today a twenty twenty five votes throughout the county different areas that are already being paid for such a big that would be over\nSome sort of an emergency they're overwhelmed resort not only that but also to be a that was just\nSomething that was dinner at my county well very interesting and you have\nTo go back to have a hard at the glove than first date equipment and that type of thing with pages and radios so they got back to the data obviously if you're trapped your house you're not going to be a bill that will will know that you didn't respond to check on you\nFair enough I like our guest to comment about that to me the most important thing to me the ability said was the word training or certainly if you've been trained to help out I'm sure that you could be a valuable additional resource but I I Am fearful of people who suddenly you have the impulse to help but they they don't know what they're doing\nI mean all emergencies our local when you think about it let's think about your home town who you're going to have come down from\nYou know a thousand miles away to help you out how are they going to even get her out where are they going to stay all those resources every emergency is local the more the low so people are informed of their own resources\nAnd they learn in the management\nThey participate in their elections making sure that their systems are up to date in accessing just like in there doing there in the state of Florida we all know that this is happening all over the state and because of that there are systems in place\nThe ... because we've been having so many of these situations\nThat people haven't gone to sleep so far away from the last incident that no one knows what to do so\nIn places around the country that real emergencies have not happened a long time away that is more important to really know what's happening in your community so this way in case there is something\nAll emergencies are in your local area your local district\nPeople helping people within their vicinity those other people that are going to care more value than people traveling from a great distance as much as they care they need resources and the ability to access your area and if those people show up from great distances\nThere skepticism of how much can they help as well it who are these people\nRight now that are in the time we have left here about a bit of a half I'm Wondering about things I didn't bring up that you'd like to emphasize\nI mean we know that food is important canned goods have a very good shelf life you should stock up on\nYou know you're you know your goal pack I mean they're telling people to evacuate you should have enough resources to where you're going you at least have a few days the resources whether it's water whether it's soups\nCanned goods already pre cuts they don't have to utilize utensils that other stuff that you ... you don't have the space to carry all these things you just need those dry food you know your beef jerky that kinda stuff\nYour medicines are important make sure your medicines are with you and if you have to you know if you need refills if you're located if your medicines are located on the chain store and you have a ... failed in there you can go to another area of that same Shane and pick up your medicine is\nSo there's lots of little things such as that you know grandparents parents that are elderly people that are especially children making sure that they have their you know the toys\nThat special food there's nothing worse than a child that constantly cranky and ... because they don't have their favorite toy or their favorite food that they want to eat and stuff and emergency rations you're not going to have a good time what a crying baby or a toddler without their without the proper you know toys et cetera so these\nAre the little things when you relocate fair to show you that these kinds of things with you All right\nStay on line will speak off there after they called again and

... built along the seashore as close as they\nAre there is of course always a demand for for a a beach front property and it just something that the people are people like and there's there's a

could get lucky and Charlotte calls in from a op Alabama hello Charlotte\n[noise] good evening I just wanted to comment that I live for thirty two years on the Gulf Coast in Fort Walton Beach and uh that's just a little bit east to wear this coming ashore\nOr ... years ago um the dilemma that we used to face was that when you evacuated the area\nOr most people wanted to go north to get away from the storm\nA two lane highway you might call it a highway that went north to Alabama and uh that was the evacuation site now they have a\nChange just there are a larger lanes and you have to go around Eglin air force base to to get away from the Gulf Coast I'm In my daughter uh lives in Fort Walton Beach evacuated this morning split Pascagoula\nAre not other daughter lives there is a they boarded up there has sitting there reading that\nUm I rode out quite a few a little bit and uh remember one that I stood in my front yard as ... I went over\nAnd I look could look up through the metal that are enormous hurricane and it was an awesome sight and you could hear a pin drop\nNot a cloud in the sky\nNow like sky right there and then all of a sudden they have a bad mood day in and it was all back over it starting over again you know but it uh it is quite an experience and it can be extremely dangerous\nFor certainly a number of them that we went through we were either a ... really the one side or the other of the storm and it didn't go to like ... too badly\nMutt um are they the idea of evacuation is is so important if it's going to be close enough at your home is is in danger get ...\nWords to the wise folks words to the wise journal or the the voice of a a reads the news has been there and experience [laughter]\nYeah

eight six six five oh Jim bode acumen shields Michigan ...\nJim I Want to say I love the panhandle of Florida but when you go along the beach there you could see the devastation from previous storm some of them were really bad like you'll see one big condo building and then lock the fence beach and\nAnyway my I have a couple ideas that's beach front living just basically started with air conditioning in the fifth fifth or like at Seventy year old for them at a used to be there was just\nTrying to read a motel on the beach and then those were bought out on the building but\nI have an idea if they could start buying out some of these ads the ads that disasters by all these people I have relatives on the east side of Florida they had storm surge twice about a year and a half and they're all they're flooring cover up but\nI think they should put more RV\nParks there already are a number of them along the beach so people can get their RV that can pull on the near the beach or on the beach then when they come in for months of the hurricane season they can just say we got another one prominent everybody leave him back when we got power and it follows clear but I\nI did my idea it's just the start Bradley fighting these people out when they have a big thing the insurers are the fate because they weren't the people in by standing the a hurricane insurance stuff like that and if they bought 'em out\nAnd it's hard to do with the condo buildings that are like Thirteen Stuart mill but\nThe whole you know fly out as many as they can and leave the insurance for the kind of buildings and stuff like that and then put in more out of the park because they can withstand that they send everybody away they can with the power outage hit the people going back and it's all\nIn All right well I Do indeed that's an interesting thought I'm not sure what the the cost would be for all of that but it certainly intriguing I thank you for sharing that Kim what eight six six by boat

Bek it on our faces and addressing the RV left everything and we just drove straight to have it with an insane event\nBut it got so bad you couldn't see anything um it was like the worst snowstorm you've ever seen but it was lack\nOh dear wow well it was more of a gray I guess it was it was it was probably the most terrifying event that I'd ever been through even to this day wow\nWell that's a

[noise]\nWas ... years back to ... and early fall on red eye radio [noise]\nAnd I'm Gary McNamara longer they're hardly a six six Ninety or red eye meteorologist Tom hale joins us right now\nTo get a get caught up on hurricane Michael good morning Tom\nGood morning I'm running how're you guys doing doing well ah what do we know about\nMichael uh in the current conditions and what do we expect over the next uh twelve to twenty four hours\nWell I I Wish I could say that this is going to be a pretty picture but it it's not\nUm I Am encouraged by a number of the reports that have indicated a lot of people have evacuated Panama City uh also uh down all the way through saint saint Joe an app\nAppalachian coal and and that southern point a then of course from their up to Tallahassee now folks in Tallahassee I\nSome of them have been boarding up and all that but what we can expect is really simple right now it is a category three\nHurricane that means sustained winds at a hundred and twenty five miles an hour and for those of you who are kind of geeky can write this down the minimum pressure is nine forty seven nine forty seven Mila bars and it's moving to the north it at\nTwelve miles an hour right now it is two hundred and twenty miles to the south southwest of Panama City now\nIt's in the northern direction so for it to actually hit\nThe target which right now is estimated between Panama City and the tip of Appalachia cola or it's going to have to make a little bit of a right turn and so in simple terms what people are going to expect is in some significant\nOr whether that they have not seen in their lifetime um\nWell it's not totally fair to say that well no I I guess it really is um because I expected in the next advice\nTreat to go up five or six miles an hour if it goes up six miles an hour it'll qualify as a category for hurricane and a category for hurricane hitting this coast according to the national weather service outta Tallahassee would be the strongest hurricane on record to hit the Florida Panhandle coastline\nYeah\nSo yeah and and that's ... that's the the strongest down yet on record yeah we we talked earlier that you know ... down the coast a little bit into the category five hitting in sixty nine\nThat just you know the state of that that that part so you have an idea of what wins\nAnd and and that's the point when you talk about you know you get to a category of for hurricane you're talking about winds over a hundred and thirty one miles an hour as a little different than maybe you're a hurricane one where you may have eighty mile an hour winds arena five mile an hour winds it's a completely different ball game is right\nExactly and when we get to the category three it changes we call it a major hurricane a category one and two are not major hurricanes but they're still I mean we saw a category to Florence\nA it was a category three briefly but we saw Florence come in and you know we did coverage here on right on the radio for four days with Lawrence\nAnd that puppy just hung along the coastline and this is not going to be the case here by tomorrow or as this moves its way out of here it's wins will be affecting the\nFlorida and south and North Carolina shoreline and in fact the last time there was a storm of that kind of situation that came through was Kate in Nineteen eighty five and Kate's case\nKate at the same time it's wins wrapping around the giant Winfield were causing storms and um\nAnd tornados along the Carolinas and the Carolinas have got a\nPretty good chance of of multiple tornadoes associated with this and and\nYou know anyone in this entire area of the Big Bend and the panhandle uh are are going to basically relate to a cake which happened to be in Nineteen eighty five um but this is gonna blow Kate out all the water\nTom in terms of the the the danger coming ashore because I think a lot of people may be who are looking at\nYou know the I coming ashore but I mean the where the danger and the potentially life threatening situation start what is that timeline where is that window and and what should we expect during that time line\nOkay when it comes to the timeline on what you should expect 'em by tomorrow morning it's still should be offshore and it will be properly ... bill a category three but\nDarn close to a category for it I wouldn't be shocked if in the next ... in in a in one hour from now I may be upgraded but by Wednesday evening it should be on shore", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Jim Bohannon Show", "city": "Johnson City", "day": "10"}
