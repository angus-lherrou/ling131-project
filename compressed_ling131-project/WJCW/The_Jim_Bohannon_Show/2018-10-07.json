now faces a lot more hostility but on the other hand\nThere's a lot more allies in the media entities like ah my network Newsmax a Fox News and others\nBut yeah that's right you know technology and times have changed and\nIt's provided pluses and minuses for both Reagan and Trump you know unless we said during Reagan's time no such thing as the Internet Al Gore hadn't invented it yet you know and then as a result you know there was no social media Reagan than have fifty million people on any given day\nRiding fifty million you know sometimes conflicting things about him and um he he had to deal with a hostile media but the media was a ... was relatively well contained because uh you know\nThat it just consist of several channels and\nAh today President Trump the media environment both helps and hurts and obviously it helps him from the standpoint to be able to wake up in the morning and with a couple from reached fifty million people in the matter of a few seconds with an unfiltered messages on and so he can get his message out without it being filtered\nHowever I'm with the technology is everyone on the planet to has a little screen in front of becoming a worldwide publisher\nA Trump asked to deal with a phenomenal amount of noise and he also has to deal with a I'm a I'm a mass media that has determined to become the enemy of Donald Trump now some respects he created that environment but\nBut still I think the situation of such now that the media has gotten personal or its dislike of Trump and we're seeing that play out today\nHe'd occurs to me that there are other comparisons and others similarities one is let's take a look at the mid term of Nineteen eighty six term congressional elections in eighty six which you lived through and were part of and then the two thousand he he knew terms I see a lot of similarities because they need six\nYou had a booming economy or at least an economy that was really starting to bloom at that time\nBut you still had you still had some concerns in tough times for Republicans because of Iran Contra now you have a booming economy but for reasons of Trump's other problems in a whole lot of factors\nDo you see the parallel on my way off base with this or do you see the parallels between eighty six in the present both are unusual and that they're they're probably probably to the only mid term elections in us history where the incumbent party will lose seats despite a booming economy\nYeah you know history if go back to look at the numbers are in the off year cycles a and I ran one of the national party committees and during an on your cycle but in the off year cycle the party that holds the White House are generally always lose a seat sets its like gravity it that's the situation I think you've picked Nineteen eighty six\nFor good reasons because your sense of trying to level out the economy and show ... an economic circumstances that are relatively the same um Reagan didn't suffer badly and he'll say six\nA mid term so I'm a where he suffered terribly so um is in the eighty two terms uh and and and that of course was a result of the uh economy that\nWas just it will be better for you to do our point though you're exactly right through our point eighty two is was to be expected\nBecause you had you know half the mills in the city of Pittsburgh closed down and unemployment's are deemed there's some places was running at Thirteen fourteen percent industrial states so of course you lose a lot of needs in eighty two it almost goes without saying\nBut eighty six different story very different story\nA likely so certainly President Trump hope so we it talks about a red wave I personally don't believe will see any kind of a red wave I think we're going to see a blue wave and I hope that Republicans maintain control the house but it's it's not going to be easy it just isn't a\nUm there are too many seats that around the tossup column um and even with the it doesn't seem it seems like President Trump is getting some rising approval ratings but he's not getting the kind of bounce a that Reagan got when he was you know chugging along with a GDP is over\nSeven percent and ... and some of the\nNext time John you are a good enough we want your predictions our viewers and listeners need to know if you had the best the life of your first born or your dog one prediction would you make house and Senate tell us\nI think that a hill we're not going to see good results for Republicans I think he is President Trump's likely to lose the house because there's\nToo many things so you think we actually lose the house you think it was\nUnfortunately I Do and um uh it's just a fact of life that there's a lot of energy on the Democrats I particularly in the suburbs and with a women and independence and I think it's going to harm him a sufficiently enough that he'll probably lose enough seats in the house to lose the majority\nInteresting now you know I have to give a tip of the

anything about the ... ridge murder mystery we will never quit on the rich family the city of Washington in this country we will solve the murder of Seth\nAnd more coming very soon joining a gym adult frequent contributor to this show and star reporter for the Washington Examiner\nJim welcome back story of what we're talking talking segment three here about the the masterful way in which Trump uses immigration and he's he does what he always does he pivots he changes the subject\nAnd now we seem to be back to that sixteen campaign just in time for the Eighteen campaign you might remember and sixteen he effectively used the Nixon when I called the Nixon sixty eight law and order campaign\nNow he's focused on murders from caused by illegal aliens but say you're\nRight I think what he's definitely trying to do is to pick the Democrats as being weak on immigration and weak on law and order and crime more generally\nAnd through those issues he hopes to rally the Republican base to show up at the polls in November I mean mid term elections really do depend a lot on who's voters whose base voters are engaged in energized are willing to turn out and its\nIt clear that the Democrats are relatively fired up there they're pretty enthused about getting it to go in and vote against Trump and vote against Republican so the challenge the Trump faces is can he get his own people both regular rank and file Republicans\nAnd the the disproportionately blue collar but sort of Trump fans who don't normally show up for the midterms and vote Republican people who didn't maybe show up and vote for Mitt Romney and twenty twelve can he get some of those people\nTo show up and vote when he himself has not on the ballot\nTrump is skillfully like if you talk about immigration and law enforcement and the murders and all of that and you can't talk about it consistently Trump kind of let this issue after the sixteen campaign and his only bringing it up now and election season which may be smart in between he has focused on the economy\nHad he continued to talking about immigration theme and all the crimes of the illegal aliens had he done this for the last eight months you might have been ... by now but I think what he's doing and bringing it up right now at the end of August you strategically wise you agree\n[noise] well I think there was also just he had trouble getting any legislation on this issue passed through Congress I mean they've gotten some modest amounts of money for the border wall but not really anything close to what they need to really fulfill Trump's campaign promise\nA you know I think Trump tried to challenge Congress to pass something ... on DACA in exchange for some legal immigration reform since ... border security money and while they got close a couple of times uh talks always seemed to fall apart\nA you know and so there are a number of immigration related issues where you know they did some things through executive action and even just Trump's reputation had an initial impact on on illegal entry to spread a you know I I think he's bringing it up now\nBoth because it's a campaign issue that motivates his base\nAnd I think also you're seeing Democrats\nUh you know taking a going to the other extreme on the issue when they're talking about things like abolishing ice and released seeming as if they don't support necessarily any kind of effective interior enforcement of immigration laws maybe using immigration laws occasionally to get\nSomebody out of the country who is guilty of of other things but they don't really seem to want to enforce those laws and the interior\nPer se and Trump is is highlighting that at this point\n[noise] so it's it's interesting the other advantages this issue is it kind of draws attention away from Trump's failure to fund the wall which you point out as a big that's a potential liability with his base but he shifts the focus to this so it kinda serves the dual purpose\nGoing back to the wall for a minute on immigration do you think that Trump will fight over the wall with the budget bill this fall how how intensify you think we'll see\nI definitely think he's going to fight I think he is running out of opportunities to really funded assuming that the midterms go ... you know more or less well for the Democrats\nIt's going to be tough for him to have a better shot at funding it uh you know in in the first term at least to send me but there is a shock and awe you know if he doesn't get it done while he's got the house still so I think there's going to be some degree of fight the question is will listen to people both on Capitol Hill and inside the White House are going to\nTell his wives elements shutdown it'd be really bad ...\nSure about that are you sure about that does that maybe that's exactly what he needs particularly if we think the election is going against Republican\nWell I'm not necessarily sure how it would play it but I Know that that's the advice that he was going to get it centered would play badly a and you know and in in many cases these shutdowns have been blamed on Republicans earlier this year uh I think they won some shutdown fights over immigration so that might embolden\nNo no not at all\nAnd I think that is you know now whether it reflects politically or not is another question you know but it's certainly his approval\nAnd his approval on the economy people are you know people can attack and all they want and or or be shot by it but they cannot deny it [noise]\nYou know they're stealing from\nYou know there is a translation of the economic numbers\nNow the Democratic party can withstand a lot of shocks and it has over the years but you must have missed the one thing you cannot withstand is a situation where where a Republican Republicans would say start winning thirty to fifty percent of the black votes if that were developed her now\nThat it's not going to happen right away because the Republican Party has such a bad image generally but here's the important point here think creates cross pressure on voters\nWho are you know might not turn out Dan because there are costs pressured by their happiness or their situation and then they're generally Democrats that'll hurt the Democrats almost as much as as the factions [noise]\nSee I I'm ... years ago I worked for a woman you may remember ELC him in a Republican in Pittsburgh unfamiliar to any kind I worked for all the human Republican politics up there you may have dealt with him over the years\nAnd one of the things I did as a teenager was tried to recruit blacks end of the Republican Party in Allegheny county it was difficult but we were encouraged by is very difficult and we didn't succeed\nBut we were encouraged by the fact that blacks were socially conservative\nThey're they're strong on guns are strong on abortion they're strong on God there's drawing and\nReligion in many ways they have the a lot of the attributes that the Tea Party but yet as you suggest because of these old time images Republicans always end up with a six to ten percent of the vote and it's a disaster but that could be changing you know the bases well deja attribute over there\nYes but the point of the matter is when the Republicans kinda act like they're not dealing with aliens in the black community and and whatever or you know dealing with a message to arms length which is how they treat them how it comes across then they'll start winning boats\nJack Kemp knew how to do it\nBut most Republicans act like oh my God if I've got a you know low statement when we're not going to get their votes because they don't cry and they're you know and this is\nI you know that's just one and it is they need to make the effort I've always thought that I never understood why Trump has no problem solve this in his campaign and those residency go out\nAnd spend more time in the African American community and churches at least they're places he could avoid demonstrations or whatever and have\nIt and make appeals\nYou know I you know and because of concerns are telling him here's what the ... you know there's bad the consultants tell them he was with the ... are telling their say Mr President\nYou can't stir up the black vote because once you do that we're still only gonna get twenty percent you're going to start them up turnout increases we still lose a four to one we can't do that those during the ... all we can do is suppress the vote that's been the stupid Republican mentality for many years right I saw that campaign Santorum in Philadelphia that mentality rice stupid\nYes yes exactly\nAnd so what Republicans are law what they've done for many years instead of making inroads in the black community they suppress turnout because they're afraid they say well if it's spikes up a little but we still lose four to ... all we can do is the president\nYou know what I saw in Philadelphia is this is what Republicans did for many years I watch Republican candidates pay black ministers to keep the walk home I saw suppression tactics over the years that you know Democrats do bad things on their side do both parties do this kind of stuff\nBut I was always yes I always just found an apartment that my party there that\nYes well that ... that's what I mean ... ... yeah how are you going to get votes if you don't want them you know you have to make an effort they ah um and uh and be able to connect\nYou know African American voters Hispanic voters and white no more in common than they have differences so you know you you know and you should be able to respect that and speak to it [noise] but when you can't\nJust show up at the last minute and do it it's something they've got to be important constituency and with all frankly all and gerrymandering\nThat's going on in our history just at our districts as well in elections as they did not necessary in many cases for Republicans to appeal that African\nAmericans they put them all in one district we we follow the I don't know the country we want them all in one district that may be the undoing the Republican Party may have missed his future with that because you have to get the organ American but we could swamp every in every election\nRight well let me let me just give an example if the Republicans having different brand really I've seen enough data and I'm old enough to know that I think it's a different to them and they can that something could get black votes or African American boats Hispanic votes all\nBut like in the south a lot of black young Republicans singled out excuse me what voters are not aligning with the Democratic party they're staying independent they don't like the plantation white mentality of the Democratic party frankly has had\nTo go to African American voters which is you know you you know ...\nYou know you do what we say and you take what you can get and whatever and they were open but who's going to talk\nTo you know it is you know you say that plantation mentality Nancy Pelosi in the house you know many black Republicans in the house so do I have a lot of friends in the house\nThey say all of them to a person hates Nancy Pelosi they hate Nancy Pelosi they say she's racist they say she missed treats them and many of their friends who are Republicans but yet the black caucus feels compelled to hang with the Democratic party I never know why they hang with the party the party mistreat them\nBecause the party is willing to buy all leaders of interests or\nSlap a oh that is why\nThey have to do it they don't bother with the voters I'd buy the interest groups I think they can do\nAnd it's an example of that show give our our ...\nWell I mean uh and in Tampa would be you know they'll you know for instance or do to you know they'll go and and deal with the local officials\nAlready officials and they keep everybody in line because they brought the money and resources and their job is to make sure that they keep the bloated lot\nI get a vote I get it you know I never I never really thought of this if you're a black caucus member you really can't raise that much money and you're dependent on the Democratic leadership to feed you and therefore\nYou love me and a and a line\nThat try and that's how but that's how it's done in the Congress in behind closed doors\nLaw\nUh of course Republicans we do the same thing on the other side but where do you see this going I mean do you see Trump\nRecord or in the Arab world where among other things to do is more successful independent candidates a grassroots ...\nWe've had one level and then you're going to go away we'll just take some time because the\nBoth parties are so polarized things up but it's hard to be heard that's one thing the other thing is if Trump goes back to his themes and he's got some problems are now you know because of the problems that is on\nAverage I Wish we could do more

told you that eating a lot of junk food\nIncreases your risk of cancer well that would seem to be the does story of the months if not of the year but this was proven in a large study how large\nForeign Seventy one thousand four Ninety five adults from a steady called the European perspective investigation into cancer nutrition\nLasting from Nineteen Ninety two to twenty fourteen with average follow up of Fifteen Years\nAnd they looked at the relationship between diet quality and the risk of cancer and the headline here is eating foods with low nutritional quality ratings linked to cancer risk\nAnd\nSo it would seem to me that's kind of into it it they had to be too big study to prove this or what they found was that the overall risk of cancer\nWas seven percent higher than people who ate a poor quality diet I'm kind of surprised that the small magnitude of increased risk right we'll take that away by be doubled tripled no only seven percent increased risk\nSpecifically cancers of the cold and rectum or the stomach in Suffolk is lung cancer for men and liver and post menopausal breast cancer for women were all associated with poor quality diet so they're having something that's kind of we know\nRight this one eating processed meats tied to breast cancer risk now you notice\nWe're not talking about meat consumption actually\nMany people who invaded against animal protein\nOr had been disappointed by studies that show that there is not necessarily a risk associated with eating non processed meats\nOr some of the previous studies of aggregated processed meats heat of the equation when we look at meat consumption but when we separate out processed meats for me it's just not meat per se that's causing the higher risk of breast cancer it's processed meats like hotdogs bacon and him\nWomen who ate the most processed meats heading nine percent increased risk of breast cancer compared with those would frequently aid such\nFoods so\nThe breast cancer linked to meet but specifically process made and this one controversial\nRecommendation pregnancy is eat fish we got to be careful when you eat fish because fish can be a source of PCB Z and mercury

credibility by the substance of their argument would that's the case you'd never hear from anybody on the Web so I I forget about what I just said there well\nI don't know why she's relevant is she in

last year I don't I really I mean she's\nShe's relevant to the situation because she claims that she was sexually assaulted so\nNo I I Know that I'll get it I mean I Know I Know that she got in part of it yeah ... okay\nYeah yeah\nDidn't know that she said she was sexually assaulted that's what I didn't know okay that makes that would that would be a connection that you could use to gain you know right into this topic because that's what it's about\nBut I I but pop culture wise I don't know she still is or not I actually don't well\nAs I said you know we because we hear people coming forward you know the you know saying look I've also been I was sexually assaulted to them and I stand with her well as we said before whether you were sexually assaulted or not still does not give you any more credibility\nWhen a charge is filed or you know when the charges filed against someone I don't mean legally but in this case\nA ... in um in his nomination to the Supreme Court that the allegation itself\nHas to be backed up by\nEvidence your case for no matter how Amos an evil it might have been if you were sexually assaulted has nothing to do\nWith this case right absolutely nothing because you are sexually assaulted does not give you a better insight as to whether Kavanaugh is guilty or not right none zero right and that is portrayed\nYou know it's one of the one false would that's portrayed well then you well okay then you were late here in ... because you are sexually assaulted then or what you think about cabinet carries more weight\nNo it doesn't that's ridiculous I it's ridiculous statement to make or to be promoting in its promoted constantly in this you know only thing that matters is the evidence\nIn every Seattle case in you and I talked about this how long have we talked about this when you know whether it was Trayvon Martin where people were taking sides left and right and we just said look here's the problem you've got that was at the two or three or four minutes span there ... where he was running away and then next thing you know\nOr he was on top of ... that's the only thing that people saw at that point and because of that huge blank space in there that no witnesses are there nobody can say what happened so\nThey went by the physical evidence which was the life the uh the the injuries to Zimmerman's head but exactly we've said and even a juror or a jury member said it's possible that he got away with murder it's just that with the evidence we couldn't prove because he claims\nThat you know he felt his his wife was an imminent danger\nAnd and we rejected at that point and the people uh who would call this show and with certainty said they knew the guilt or innocence site and we had people bring it up yeah the Trayvon Martin was in an age doesn't matter whether he was or was not an angel\nRight or any other time of his life it doesn't matter what Zimmerman headset at any time in his life right\nAll the matter is he said I'm going to be honest with you I write Trayvon Martin right with that and that would have been obviously right would have been which of course they didn't\nSay right but people were definitive in their belief of guilt or innocence and\nBased on a lack of evidence and what they think possibly happen we have rejected that we will always reject that as Americans\nI as far as I'm concerned you're obligated to reject that type of yes mindset absolutely go by the evidence the evidence is what dictates everything\nThe motion is what carries the uh the the cause and and and such protests\nAnd and certainly for the families who suffer are the the loss of a loved one weather's a Trayvon Martin's family or or Michael Brown family you can feel for their loss but also know this this this is possible but many people find it impossible\nTo feel for the last of the family but also believe and see by the evidence see what the evidence shows that the evidence points to that person also being responsible\nNow it didn't necessarily in in the in the Trayvon Martin case you had you know what the physical evidence was was ... and then that's what the jury found and we ... we don't have\nWe don't have a everything the jury saw no no yeah but in the Michael Brown situation\nWith officer ... Wilson on the scene I'm you know the the family\nAh what's the first to commission an autopsy then that autopsies the one that showed the hands up don't shoot never narrative was alive\nIt's still being used today yes as a rallying cry that never happened\nOr that is unacceptable in America right you know we we talk about the Democrats are always talking about the fascist on the right well if you listen to what we believe ... and what we believe about the presumption of innocence whether it's a criminal trial a civil trial or\nJust the public opinion in general or a political trial\nStill it's the same thing you judge these cases you judge cases and you'd and and you judge the guilt or innocence based on the evidence that exist not just an allegation alone and and the thing is\nI'm saying this with passion but I really don't have to because every single Democrat listening right now every single liberal and democratic protesting yesterday and they all know it but they are willing to throw it overboard mhm\nYou know how they do it because we're the first ones many of those who are in a you know who were arrested yesterday a will would demand due process under you know due process under the law ... but the fact is they know it but they will reject it when it comes to their personal politics\nFascism leads the mindset of fascism leads in them when it's what they want\nWhen it comes to how they're going to be treated no you must follow the constitution completely\nBut treating somebody else a constitution be damned the spirit of the constitution be damned the mindset of the presumption of innocence and that evidence is the only thing that leads and should lead is thrown out the window\nBecause we want what we want\nYou know when it comes down to I was following a case here in Texas where a man had been wrongly found guilty of murder and all that and you have a Nineteen years in prison\nAnd got out and twenty sixteen they wanted to be fully exonerated and was working to that end and finally it happened it was fully exonerated so that's a total of Twenty one years\nWhere he was either behind bars are having is you know his name essentially associated with a murder that happened that he was not responsible for so I was doing some research just to try and refresh my memory on other cases and there was a man who was accused of rape\nAnd spent decades behind bars um it was raping assaults and something else\nUh I think a aggravated assault and rape or in a third charge that I Can't remember but he was behind bars for thirty one years before he was ... it was proven that he was not\nThe person responsible now mistakes happen in the justice system or we don't have we have the DNA technology now or that can prove that it wasn't a you know or their DNA at the scene or whatever it is\nBut you think about you know the the label that goes with being falsely accused\nAnd there's a great burden that comes with that for a reason now sometimes it's that the work done in the investigation wasn't wasn't right sometimes it's an overzealous prosecutor on the ... in the legal setting\nLooking to get a political win but\nSometimes witnesses get it wrong well and and in one case in in the murder case it was it was a couple of jailhouse\nWitnesses that helped to seal the deal and you you look at that and and you

Grassley Sunday a letter to the lawyers of a doctor for did said I'm\nA I'm writing in response to your letter dated October second you said Dr Ford is was yesterday said you said Dr Ford is going to turn over her documents\nTo the FBI but my request to view was not for the documents to be turned over to the FBI actually to provide the documents the Senate Judiciary committee response on behalf of the clients\nIs a non secular the constitution charges the Senate with the ... and the president and his nomination senators have a constitutional obligation to investigate and evaluate independently the president's nominees are obligation as unrelated to anything be FBI does\nThat's why we just don't vote on nominees after the president loans us\nOr the FBI background investigation we have to make our own assessment the U.S Senate does not control the FBI if you have an objection of all the FBI conduct its investigations take it up with director rate\nBut don't raise that objection is a reason not to respond to this committee's demand for relevant evidence the FBI's investigative decisions art art concern\nEven at the FBI never interviewed Dr ... interviews or ten times this committee as a constitutional obligation to investigate Dr Ford's allegations at that's what we've been doing since we became aware of or allegations it's not even clear to me what purpose turning over the over those materials\nTo the FBI would accomplish the FBI would simply turn that over ... over\nTo watch yet as we just said that's got stopped\nThat's the only purpose the FBI serves that's always that's probably stop the last caller is well they're well they're they're political what the investigation political the the ... the the FBI only facilitates the interviews they conduct the interviews because they have the resources and the training and that's it's that simple right\nAnd and so it doesn't make it again this this is where her lawyers are bringing up something that isn't even relevant\nTo the investigation to begin with because for the million time there is no FBI investigation the only investigation that's been going on is the Senate Judiciary investigation what because it it just shows you how\nAre the the lawyers for Dr ...\nEither completely clueless or they didn't want those notes to come out\nBecause had they been given to the FBI again assumed the FBI decided to respond to them and take those notes those therapists notes they would have been part of the report\nThey wouldn't they wouldn't have seen the light of day beyond the eyes of a hundred people\nOr it's not even and by the way emerges from my phone because I just happened to go into it or into the Mollie Hemingway was on it it's not even clear what purpose turning those materials over to the FBI would accomplish the FBI would simply turn that evidence over to the Senate\nAnd that is precisely the outcome that I think with this request is to get the information right you have claimed repeatedly that the evidence I've requested supports Dr Ford's allegations against judge Kavanaugh\nShe even provided some of the evidence to\nGive me a second here as I have to go to a a to a a national media indeed if the evidence or supported your clients allegation you surely would produce it as quickly as you could\nBut you have repeatedly refused to produce this evidence to the Senate in doing so you are preventing the Senate from considering the evidence most crucial to Dr Ford's allegation\nI don't know what other imprint we should draw from your refusal but that the withheld evidence does not support Dr Ford's allegation and quite the way you will have claimed ooh that's a challenge is not\nRight I urge you once again now for the third time in writing to turn over the therapy notes polygraph materials and communications with the uh with the Washington Post a Dr Ford\nHas relied upon as evidence in addition to the evidence I requested in my Tobar second letter in light of recently uncovered information this is interesting here 'cause that was the key of\nLook at the uh the last sentence with recently uncovered information please turn over records and descriptions of direct or indirect\nContact with senators or their staffs particularly the offices of senators Feinstein and Hirono other than a year communications with me and my staff member my step in preparation for the September twenty seventh hearing\nThe alleged witnesses identified by Dr Ford Leland Kaiser mark judge and Patrick Smith and a WBUR mirrors Julie sweat Nick or their representatives sincerely Chuck Grassley that letter said yesterday ...\nSo it was like I said in the last caller brought up was she was willing to turn them over to the FBI\nAnd our and our point was ... when I'm when I said no it's like because our point does it go directly to the Senate to begin with yeah there there is no investigation they wouldn't be in bed they simply take it and give it to the Senate Judiciary committee\nAnd if it ended up in the report we wouldn't see that the the only senators was set\nThe only the centers would see it and there for a goal is if she has this slam dunk evidence mhm and she wants to the people who said she wants to people to see it so then the people can decide", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Jim Bohannon Show", "city": "Johnson City", "day":
