us auto tariffs America's second largest trading partner wasn't excluded when the U.S and Mexico reached a preliminary deal when all is to revamp NAFTA and\nThe Trump Administration had given Canada until midnight Sunday to sign on or facing schools you're from the pack in the past President Trump has railed against the tree deal blame game for the loss of American manufacturing jobs we have the worst trade deal ever made in history here Crawford Washington\nMass burial is now being prepared for more than three hundred bodies on an Indonesian sort of hit hard by a powerful earthquake and tsunami toll of more than eight hundred dead for friday's disaster mostly from pullout is expected to grow as there is cut off by damage or reached\nRemember it wasn't that the president said he would get a free trade agreement done what he said was he will get a free trade agreement that will get rid of the trade deficit\nYes\nNow I Know the president will be out and he will be selling this irrespective of what is in the free trade agreement and the people that love the president will say he did exactly what he said he was going to do I'm fine with that as long as it heads in reality he doesn't do what he initially said he was going to do\nWell you know [noise]\nI I'm just fine with everything if they'll just get behind us\nYou know the the the moving of what we'll do this much more of a here and and this much less over here it really isn't because there's there's been no promise the only thing I've seen in terms of the measurement of the dairy agreement\nIs that it will mirror that of the the agreement that Canada just reached with Iran\nAnd other other countries other parts of the world so I have no idea what that means for the U.S\nI don't know how to quantify that and it's it again [laughter] there was no um target right there was nothing\nWhere they said look we must get this much increase or the dairy farmers of of the U.S you know we're this is what we're working on this is who were working on behalf\nSo\nI don't there was never this this I guess\nLine or or goals for them to reach the administration in fact just a few days ago they were saying yeah we're way too far apart to be reaching a deal before the deadline\nAnd ... and here we are a few days later so we have no idea what it means and how much of an increase for those dairy farmers in terms of being able to sell the count Canada that is\nYou know what I didn't hear mentioned it all ... in ... article but right now it's early on and maybe in the maybe tomorrow nothing on the soft ...\nNo I didn't see anything on that and so the only two things I did see a lot dairy and automobiles that\nSo I I guess my ... and by the way when we say win or lose we're not talking about win or lose by our standards because women lewd by our standards with trading with Canada should be free trade across the board no tariffs no limits or anything if Canada puts tariffs on that's wrong if the United states put tariffs on\nA you know uh uh the batters wrong but is that where we made the compromise on soft timber and that's why you didn't hear the administration come out\nAnd talk about you know the the the soft timber than we upset okay when I remember they were going after the soft timber industry claiming that the government subsidizes it in Canada right\nUh and with the duties and whatever put on soft timber as we know a construction in the United states will become has and will become more expensive which will hurt the bottom line of the GDP\nSo I you know look there's a there's a ton of things here and you just mentioned something that just a couple of days ago we're way far off we're not going to have a deal well the president knew that he had to have Canada and the dealer was a no go in Congress wasn't going to go anywhere right\nSo he was under that he was under that pressure to come up with some kind of deal otherwise it wouldn't go through when he had to get it done now because they want it done before December first when the Mexican president does out right so we're right at that sixty day deadline it's got to be done now so there was pressure on the administration\nDid the administration crumble on parts that they wanted I guess we shall see it was interesting that ah run a couple of articles in the last couple of weeks from Canada where they said you know what the Canadian government decided to do\nWhich is not going to respond to Trump on anything he can sit there and script would just be quiet say nothing\nDon't give him a target back don't say anything and so if you if you think the Canadians have been quiet lately because of it\nThat was their whole purpose let's just be quiet but Canada knew that they they look they understood candidates stood that look one of the things that we have against the United states in this deal is Trump has\nTo get it done he's got to get it done by a certain time period otherwise you know the Congress is not going to pass a trade deal that separate from Mexico and therefore that's the pressure they had on the administration I guess we shall see\nWell yeah ... here's what I don't fear right now I don't fear any um any\nPromotion of of a a massive I guess concession by Canada by\nThe administration you know because the dairies tiny ... and that's that's the whole thing is that the
