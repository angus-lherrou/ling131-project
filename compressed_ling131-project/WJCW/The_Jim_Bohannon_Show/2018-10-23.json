I think their seat partnerships and deals now with Japan South Korea you you're not start seeing high value added section jobs\nCome back to the United states I think that's one I think you'll see a massive pushed by President Trump or infrastructure I think on national security it's more focused on getting allies it really throw in some money into the kill to town of\nYou know help with their own and it's a we don't have to have a\n... dollar a you know defense budget and I think that's like on on construction is you know people call that deregulation but it's actually much deeper than that it's really taking apart brick by brick this law violence of the federal government is built up over the last forty or fifty years I think so that's why judge is like\nA justice Gorsuch injustice cabin are so important that they understand this whole thing about deconstructing the ministry of state I think that you know President Trump with his other a hundred and forty federal judges will start to to put more of that in there and I think that's a program\nThat you're with President Trump is aimed at the very early days are really accomplish ... wants to accomplish\nI wanted to come in Trump we eat was he's out there doing it but you behind the scenes and with Trump in that you took an issue that I care deeply and you know talk radio does globalism what's happened to all these people NAFTA left behind\nBut it was never sexy if you will you know what I mean these other things are always in front of it and somehow or another you guys were able to make that part and parcel even against other Republicans\nThat is something that was a breakthrough in the campaign\nWas it down here's what it is that\nYou know people's emptiness ban and why are you still remember in Santa Monica ... and ... why these guys are ... like I said why some here's what's happening here in this kind of global elites that felt very comfortable managing American decline\nOkay what what they're deplorable ... they don't want to accept America that ... they weren't America return for a former greatness and that's what they are backing Donald Trump until they say that that's what they're under control\nAnd that's how they see Trump you know ... when he said sects I think people in their hearts knew something was wrong and then when they saw trunk how can articulate Harry\nReid asked us to make it work for us we're gonna we're going to engage China in this economic or they've been they've been worth it for ... years were engaged in that when you start where he hides and edited manufacturing jobs back from China remember all of this\nYou know that the elites told the little guy dom that this was off says it it was the second one semi dynamics is just the oil markets work that all the jobs had to had to be shipped overseas and you had to be comfortable flipping burgers at Burger King\nOkay and Trump said that's not right and I I don't accept that is in the agency that this was allowed to happen in I Donald Trump will be the leader that turns it around and that's it that's why working class people over the particles in the middle class really support President Trump\nAbsolutely why have you here just with this one chance if you would I'm a Catholic I Know you're a devout Catholic probably more devout and I I Would have to concede\nRant I'd love to live it deserve a Catholic right okay a devout Catholic I Know that ... you know that they're they're they're they're out saying that organism merger and every day so I fire I aspire to be a devout Catholic but I ...\nHey I Try with Pope Francis but I Can't get there and you you've you've given that there was something that is a towel here with France is though that I Want listeners to hear that Steve that uh he is the vicar of Christ but you know you know I ...

kicking them out because they're so is at risk if they are protecting the border and doing what the Trump administration's doing can you imagine\nAnd then I have another from the former John McCain advisor comparing what's going on and this to slave auction\nSo I think the American people are watching this they see this gathering of these caravans they're not sure who's egging it on is it allegedly Soros or people like that but somebody's helping to fund an organized this\nAnd Democrats in the media are saying boy this is an October surprise\nThis will serve as well because the American people will see Trump overreact and the military and all that stuff and there'll be a revolt will you when you say no this is exactly what I Want stopped just the sheer temerity this whole thing\nAnd this is going on more subtly every day for the last twenty twenty five years not on mass like this unbelievable numbers what's the number if you think it's appropriate as the one guy play to just let people in\nHow many how many millions how many tens of millions\nI what's good escape in Burlington, Vermont to start off the jumbo hand and show ... skip welcome to the show\nThings

simple lifestyle before they hit to the U.S border\n... or ...\n... out the boom box the supersonic boom box [laughter] hours\nThe supersonic cells in it\nThe military has and that's the only way you're going to start one loyal before they hit\nThe ball that's interesting I don't know if that's violets if of un or whatever it thank you skip I'm not sure about that sort of technique I get what he's saying but you would be roundly I mean if you gave a hearing issued if somebody did something like that a wall of noise\nNow I think Trump's going to cost the military the problem is how much in the military do you need if you have ten thousand people I've seen police actions put fencing around the people and hold them in detain them that way until they can take them out one of the time but that was only a few hundred people\nYou have twenty thousand people I don't think you can do that in the military gets into a situation where they might have to fire or be overrun\nThat's going to be problematic let's go to Charlie in Cedar Rapids Iowa hey Charlie good evening\nAre you doing I'm good Charlie yeah I'm just saying no a library dogs ... so I got was just a thing go right okay so\nThese cable your your charger for a walk across illegally and they got to go to a trial\nAnd then they disappear I break the law I got to go through your child so sure I or go to jail for a couple of days I have the boat while and I are monitored before\nI go to trial okay so you would stop them what\nMakes what makes use paypal so much better than the average burgers\nWell because the Democrat Party has put them ahead of the average American citizen the way I see\nSo Charlie you would sanction the military stopping him right\nOh yeah I mean I made sure his style there today and yet which enrolled in the wall street and you go to war\nI agreed the problem is going to be Charlie I'm told it's going to take a massive amount of military to do that thanks Charlie said I'm completely on board with that but I'm looking at the reality of\nIt and I think\nGiven what went on in Mexico and all that forming seat they'll just keep at it until they penetrate it somehow or another vast numbers go round one way or another you dealing with a lot of stuff there but certainly I agree with and we're not talking about Bannon adds to the military firing on maybe tear gas and the like yeah you could do that\nBut this is a difficult thing if the\nReach a massive twenty thousand people which they might or more\nYou are going to need a human wall to prevent that and to move with it and to push back and I think to make a rest to try to curtail some of it and cut down on it\nIs the way to go but that's the issue and Trump is uniquely positioned to do something about this I let's go to bill in delta California hate bill we're still to how close to the border as\nA not California Colorado oh Colorado okay bill go right ahead in their claim is it they're leaving their native country because of the gangs and crime and Noel enforcement mhm\nOr experience or experiences that crime rates are the lowest in areas where the people on the most guns right so\nLet's give him weapons and little training and then since they know where the gangs are on the criminals are sending them back to clean up and the country\nWell I hear you built they don't want to do that though in fact a lot of them are burning American flags there's all kinds of stuff like that going on they don't want to do that they want to penetrate here so what do we do to stop\nThe being the case it just proves they're going they're lying\nYeah it does thank you it it does without a doubt I agree with you at least some of them are now the media will try to portray this but you've seen this I told you a guy in bed for Univision tonight on Univision said\nHe's noticing people from places like Bangladesh that are in there I'm not saying that this is the lion share of people but you know what happens when there's chaos that's what's being provoked here organized chaos anything can happen then\nSo if they make it toward the border which I think they will the dilemma is what level of force do you use in order to stop this Democrats are hoping\nThat somehow or another you use that level of force that America will be revolt it I think America will not particularly if the military can push back on this\nWithout anyone losing their life or anything like that\nBut this is going to be an ongoing problem this is going to continue and continue and continue until we put up enough of a barrier ha a wall\nTo stop this but this is why Trump was elected Democrats in the media are nuts they think this is the October surprise that this is going to cut in their favor I don't see it in that way at all or let's go to Dan in Trenton New Jersey hey Dan good evening\nHey everything in a similar or to be a ... like I said on human trafficking Daniel ... on Google it was a caption says caution to your

[noise]\nOn the campaign trail you must explanation I mean President Trump has campaigned on behalf of former rival Ted Cruz\nIn front of a packed arena Sen Cruz introduced his one time opponents the presidential nomination [noise]\nTrump\nOr from the significance of the mid term election\nIs whether we continue the shores roast the voltage\nWhether we live the route of Democrats mom taking a giant red and blue and destroy our country and our economy early voting in Texas is under way I'm quite ...\nBoth families have been devastated by this and Arnold thing was we just wanted to reach out to the family show support or we made a post that just said\nA if anybody who would like to um help the ... family um we would be happy to act as the conduit and United contact us whether even if it was just words of support or if it was monetary or people tried to say that because we did this and we were advocating for some type of legal Defense Fund\nThat um they were trying to get into a racial issue\nI I Know Marty revise and you can you see now though given your party where it is and I know you talk moving way I get so much\n... response today in Philadelphia to your dilemma here\nThat this obviously they're going to do this they don't want to hear the rationale reasonable and this of it and you're good natured toward all this or even your wife they don't want to hear that you have to be right down the line on this or you're going to be kicked out despite your military service and your service to the Democratic party\nWell that's exactly what happens um the people who knew who know me do this to be not true but the people who perpetrated this upon me or did not know me at all I I actually don't know any of the people who started this who started\nCirculating the post and none of them called me none of them called to say hey mark what does this mean to you can we sit down to have a conversation about this all that was was he is a racist he's against the NFL players taking a knee and he's supporting a white cop who was in an incident involving a young African American male\nAnd yeah that was an air and they want to hear it listeners should know as a result of this you started to question and I asked you why still stay with\nThe Democratic party and you talked about being raised in it as many people listening right now might be\nAnd as I used to recognize that I you tell me a little bit different but I when I filled in Pittsburgh radio these where the true Democrats you know back to the JFK Harry Truman Democrats when the party stood for the little guy clearly tough national defense proud of America\nEthnic maybe you know that sort of thing the ethnic groups in a place like Pittsburgh\nIt's clear to me they abandon that I don't know how they're going to win elections abandoning all those people\nWill have questioned that myself lately and what I'm finding as I can send you to search and and trying to read into this and I'm seeing that\nPittsburgh itself a is a very progressive city and I and I as we said earlier I think ... when ... when I thought about Pittsburgh is being progressive it was always with the text centers the medical community ... like that bring it we have a Google here we go for a little bird here um that to me as progressive\nBut somehow along the way after the twenty sixteen election uh there was a group a leftover from I Would say the Bernie Sanders camp that became the standard bearers of\nProgressive democratic politics in Pittsburgh and somehow along the way it's also starting to melt into the Democratic socialist of America and they have started to gain sort of a foothold here in Pittsburgh and\nGain a voice that um unfortunately people are listening to and they're rushing to judgment and a lot of cases are not stopping to think that maybe we're doing ourselves more harm than we are good\nSo you've been approached by that by that movement of the name of it of people that are Democrats that the other party has left them that movement is that what movement mark\nIt it was the hash tag walk away\nWalk away which and got a lot of people to be successful and I don't say that capillary because I could tell how dear it is to you again\nThere are still elements in the Democratic party but they're being weeded out of people like you who might see it a little bit differently than I on some issues here and there but are credibly patriotic Americans and humanitarian Americans you and your wife in that situation\nAnd essentially it's getting tighter and tighter you\nReally have to walk on line if you're that person if you speak up on those Democrat Party values those are now so they're what the Republican Party used to be I guess the people and he hears socialist in places like Pittsburgh and it's not the people that used to call me\nNow and I've gotten a lot of phone calls from people who um have said to me that they agree with my stance they uh they applaud\nThe fact that I'm taking a stance on just being patriotic um and I've I've set so look I put my life on the line in the Gulf War I served my country I think I have the right to stand for the flag\nAs much as anyone else has the the rights of taking me I'm ... and I don't have a problem with that if they want to go ahead and do that they can go right ahead and do it and I won't criticize you\nJust don't criticize me for not wanting to participate in that type of activity because of what I've been through 'em and I think if we stop and we just say to each other let's take a look at what our core values are and what we believe in\nThen maybe we wouldn't be so quick to rush to judgment and condemn us for being patriotic or supporting a family friend or even in many cases supporting police officers which I think unfortunately has just gotten out of control in this country right now\nExactly right a mark thank you so much I really enjoyed talking with you twice today where do people find you if they want to catch up with you and we want to see where you come out to the other side independent you change parties\nYou try to fight to it's going to be a real uphill fight I mean if in Pittsburgh you're saying you're seeing significant gains by the socialist and all that it's only going to ratchet up after these midterms\nSo that's a tough avenue\nTo face and I would say where I Am in the Philadelphia area we have a similar situation toward yours were Democrats could have run a woman who was a veteran a military veteran instead they're running a guy who was a socialist Scott Wallace who's up with a couple of hundred million dollars\nAnd they're making those type of choices versus people against people who\nAre not only patriots but winners I Would think for the Democrat Party guys like you or I Would be a much different opponent if I'm running the Republican Party so strategically I'm Glad of what they're doing but as an American I resented deeply we need guys like even the political process\nWell I appreciate it and there are some people out here such as a congressman Conor Lamb who I'm sure you've heard a run on a special election is running again I'm again military guy marine\nI'm somewhat conservative or moderate I Would\nSay goodbye very articulate um and he is what I Would like to see more of the Democrats I'm\nNot going to the table

you were telling your telling a story of leaving out the the the\n... and I'm not I mean it ... let me be clear it doesn't really even matter what they say or don't say here because here's the point when a woman does this when they go through this that's why the wall Street Journal interviewed her should they not have investigated this whole matter that claim as they did not\nObviously there's not much of a late for an investigation that you say that she ... with her friends shopping\nTo get a rape kit that means it's in the hands of the police at this point it's obviously being investigated it at least at that level correct\nUh well the Hudson County people the prosecutor has said they're not going to prosecute now here's the issue do Hudson County is very corrupt it's Murphy administration and the judges there and the wall Street Journal the woman stand by their story that there is evidence there\nMy point is what's the lesson of Kavanaugh what were we told that you have to move forward with this in a job interview right\nWell I mean it's ... whether you're kinda sounded like the other side now let's get the guy whether he's guilty\nOr not I'm not saying that she had a guy no no no no I'm not but they did not do anything in this that's what the argument is that Murphy administration did not investigate and that's why they're being investigated now what does that tell you why is the legislature ... anybody\nTo investigate their own you know that so we all know that that's why it shouldn't go to the police but I was waiting for the end of the story and I still want to know what the evidence and if there is why it's really a rushed it I thought\nThat is how well the ... the Hudson County people that said they're not going to prosecute All right thank you mark thanks very much for that I'm Glad for the year the challenge I Want you to take a look at that Katie Brennan\nAnd see whether there's a double standard or not here I think there is and so does the wall Street Journal\nAnd we'll see why the legislature now both sides going to investigate the Murphy administration and what they did not do based upon their policies and based upon what

and rip supper burns NAFTA right there and said that's it\nYou're not going to stop this you're going to force me to have to do it you're not a partner we're not doing afterwards you are not doing all

they're shot oh you can just imagine then and I'm not condoning it I don't want to do that\nBut they must be stopped they must be told no you're not calling the tune here you're not breaking into the country you're not setting the rules you don't belong here you have to go through this process\nDespite what's going on in your country to get into our country that's where the election of twenty six

healthcare Republicans want you to die all that sort of stuff that's all there talks that they can't talk about the economy they don't want to say these caravans are exactly what it would look like if they're in charge again and what they'll allow him but they would do with the presidency and everything else\nPeople have already been overrun in many states listening to me right now I've been there

down that escalator by the way the Trump Administration I Can't tell yet where they'll land but Hollywood's tonight is going crazy and that's always a good sign\nNew York times reporting and they may be trying to do this to ratchet up support on the Democrats' side even more for the midterms but it seems to me that the Trump Administration is looking at the you know how they've cut regulations and one of the ultimate regulations they're looking at rolling back\nThe Obama era initiatives around transgendered and protections in other words this idea of gender fluidity this idea of use whatever bathroom you what used in schools in showers and everything else it's going into this\nNow if they land\nWhere they say the only thing that is determined is what you're ... are at birth\nWell I wouldn't be fully on board if they land that that's what his operative but if you go through and you change your biology so to speak sexually then yes you can hold yourself out to be because you are a

we cannot let this happen call your representatives Senate switchboard operator or contact\nSo\nI think this could be reasonably that Trump is reinforcing that legal definition of a person sex to be based upon biology not personal mythology\nAnd if you go through all that which is a lot and you change it I Would recognize that who what\nBut we we got to get away from this idea of liquidity and

media [laughter] at you know at at at the same time but the fact is the media has gone guy got over okay she'll Cortez and the media has gone ...\nUh uh over a Robert Francis Beto O'Rourke\n... it is the media we played it yesterday on this week this week is a new show and Stephanopoulos goes to the reporter out there in the reporter talks is talking to him as if he's a rock star by saying you're really a rock star\nOh no I'm not no no no you really really you really really are\nYou know that's not that's not reporting in any\nWay a political reporter should never be in that type of discussion you know do you know to begin with but the fact is because the media is guy got over ... in Cortez they are the ones that have annoying to them as the new leaders in the new faces because the new face\nStopped at the media pays attention to especially the new young ones and you know they're looking for new young blood because they look at it and they say Hillary can't when we don't want Bernie remember a case of protest came out\nJust over the weekend and wouldn't endorse Bernie Sanders who she endorsed back in in uh in in twenty sixteen so a Hillary as we know everybody\nWell I won't say everybody there are some Democrats would like her to come back but most Democrats don't want her to come back into now you've got the you know the new you know a young guns that are out there and it uh you know ... stadium I don't really care whether we get\nYou know Obama's endorsement and I really don't need Obama's endorsement as if look you're the old news and then a case for protest coming out in St Bernie Sanders nine door summit twenty sixteen we'll wait to see what happens you know come or twenty twenty wow yeah\nAnd and you look at it and you say who will be the uh\nYou know who will be the person who will be the uh you know the nominee for the Democrats are in twenty twenty we've got a great show I had coming up uh early voting I started yesterday in Texas has already been done in other states even before taxes that NBC story out there saying that the GOP assault doing the Democrats\nIn the early voting in a bunch of different states will get to ah that\nAh the um ... ... ... ... ... ... what else or there was something else I had\n\nWhile you have to oh yeah yeah because I mentioned uh uh twenty twenty and the Democrats are we told you so Cory bookers plan to give out more cash mhm we talked about this yesterday that what you're going to see from the Democrats is free everything for twenty twenty ...\nFree everything but we don't believe in the constitution and we hate America\nThat's the new that is the new narrative we don't believe in the constitution we don't believe in due process we don't believe in the first amendment we don't believe in the the the second amendment we don't believe that there should be a Senate we don't believe that there should be a a a a a a electoral college we don't believe\nIn the constitution of the United states but we wish to give you everything they got up to six thousand dollars Camilla Harris now Cory Booker talking about\nFifty thousand dollars\n\nThat can be used or by the young poor in this country to buy a house or to get a college education so now they're up to fifty thousand dollars remember back in twenty sixteen to show you that Eric and I are on the cutting edge\nOf where the left is going uh we dated look why don't you just come out we need somebody to come out to be the first one to say what is going to give everybody a hundred thousand dollars well they're not up\nTo a hundred thousand yet but two years after we said that and it was two years right about now mhm 'cause we told Hillary look if you want to get if if you're looking for that last you know to we push hundred thousand everybody just just go all the way yeah Cory Booker not up to fifty thousand dollars\n... that's the other problem we discussed yesterday was Hillary you know with a with everything you know the the big free and and and all the money you don't forget the free will also\nPay you were going to pay you know the government's gonna pay you so you get everything for free and we're going to give you money\nWell if you're Hillary there's no way you can't be a moderate in your approach no if she's thinking of running you better take some numbers down they're gonna have to be bigger than what's out there now\nWhen you well you know it was just the six thousand really just got blown out of the water\nAnd they just out and ... ... it's been that in a couple of days I now we're up to fifty thousand right and that's not enough you can't buy a house for fifty grand art bunkers got fifty thousand who's got ... got a hundred thousand a hundred thousand Eric on a hundred thousand\nWhy don't we just
