case the president and first lady I pay their respects at the Pittsburgh synagogue were eleven worshipers were gunned down and visited others who are wounded at a local hospital Pennsylvania attorney general Josh Shapiro says now is not the time for President Trump to come to Pittsburgh\nSadly I think that the president's presence there today a and and and those protesters who came out in the street to follow the president's visit distract from the real issue and that is the eleven Pittsburgh or the eleventh Pennsylvania's eleven Americans\nWho have to be buried today and in the days ahead the focus should be on them\nThe president wants to drop the constitutional right to become an American citizen when born in the U.S to illegal immigrants Senator Graham says he will introduce a bill to end birthright citizenship\nLeft representatives of the Democratic party are embracing and it's very disturbing\nAnd it's um you know what to express it by the far left base who are willing to engage\nIn extreme on civil behavior following the dictates of Maxine Waters\nTelling 'em at a speech telling people who are listening to her and the Democratic base hearing or that or people who are holding office cabinet members in the Trump Administration should not be allowed\nTo engage in their life they shouldn't be allowed to go to public places to dying or tear gas up their cars they should be um basically told in no uncertain terms as Maxine Waters says quote there\nNot welcome here which I assume she remains the country\nYeah ...\nAnd so this is it's it's more than rhetoric because we see these groups like in the fall um we see other groups engaging and not just on civil conduct but\nWill conduct that harms a criminal that harms person and property and we're talking about collateral damage I'm just in the last few days or these caravans that are proceeding towards our border\nAllegedly from Honduras um which appear in and there's now a documentation that would indicate\nUm that they're not spontaneous they're not organic if they're in fact part of an engineered left wing um event and now there's\nBeen deaths um there's been a altercations with the Mexican authorities were gunshots had been exchanged there's Molotov cocktails there's destruction of gays there's more collateral damage so I think um\nIt's it's it's quite serious um idiots something that I'm reflects the philosophy that's distinctly anti American\nWell I wouldn't disagree and there's another term for this or that I have heard applied to people a lot more outside of a military setting a besides collateral damage that would be the end justifies the means\nWell that's exactly right and we're Machiavelli formulated that when he was in ... saying\nMonarchs he still had a sense that somehow you know the means should be analyzed for their ethical content but the modern and like a book I guess you'd call it a political strategist but still a philosopher\nThat so many Democrats ... of follow and are devoted to carry did that end justifies the means to all of a much darker and much more dangerous level and that's solid Lenski who road rules gr radicals\nSolids key was someone that when Hillary Clinton was in undergraduate school at Wellesley she wrote her\nSenior thesis fine Saleh ... a former President Obama used him for his community organizing teaching\nAnd saw the loose get devoted an entire chapter to this concept that chapter was titled of means and and those and centrally in that chapter a Lewinsky embrace the idea\nThat right and wrong should basically be not considered at all especially when in the world of politics and that's consistent with the rest of his his book and\nWhat he said is that politics are like war in in that battle we've heard Democrats compare it to warm the candidates this war concept the end justifies almost any me\nSo what he's basically saying is to jettison ethics\nAnd it's interesting his book rules for radicals I mean people don't believe this until they get it in their hands\nBut he dedicated the book to elusive for now there are people that excuse that and say look you will just putting his tongue and his cheek he wanted to poke at\nThe right but the fact is that ... did an interview with playboy magazine and in the interview he said his desire is in the afterlife to go to hell he said because he thinks most of his friends would be there [laughter]\nYou know we're starting to agree with this man I [laughter]\nAnd he said it would be more interesting in hell so I think you lose supper is consistent with this notion of eliminating right or wrong it just to achieve a political ad\nAnd this of course is antithetical to the principles that under gr western civilization and then there's the Judeo Christian principles the notion that life has a purpose\nAnd that people are hard wired with a conscience and they're good is better run evil and these notions are when when they were eliminated it creates great danger and those those are the kinds of things that we've seen I mean\nWe're overdue for a break here which we're going to take and we will come back and we'll talk some

mean\nIt just seems to be so many things that are starting to come up boiling point ... one major concern I ate a possibilian almost like a whore for sending our military down at a button and then it got people there and again and again and\nI'm I'm really concerned about that and I don't like that and that\nWas going to get treated that way all of these things because I Know I just hoping I find that\nWell it was the I'm not sure that I Would sure quite those apocalyptic views or follow the president is sending troops to the Mexican border we don't expect any bands of liberals to go out into and oppose with armed forces are going to do their best to stem the tide northward that I'm not sure\nHow a fifty two hundred of them are going to to stop all those people in terms of of treason woman or a specific definitions for treason\nAnd I'm a I'm not sure anyone has committed treason yet a James Hirsch when your thoughts\nAs well as your first uh as far as the caravan I Believe as I said that it was engineered I think the purpose of the caravan which they have them arrive at the border and to cause embarrassment and damage\nTo the president and his administration and two Republicans by having something untoward occur if you have to remember with an I mentioned this all of these attacks that have been against the president\nFor all for all these two years if if we look at them all the one that got the most traction\nWas when they said he is separating families at the border that got a lot of traction so this is our hope that that will repeat but I I Am optimistic as you are Jim I think first of all are we now I think are up to\nAt least a couple of thousand or several thousand troops I think our military\nOr the capabilities of our military even compared to Mexico and Guatemala and that is so much more sophisticated and I think they're going to find a way to what's left of the Caribbean you know the Mexican government reportedly is offering them understand Mexico they're trying to slow them down\nAll the rules of amnesty by the way say that when you you leave a country you must you must take that embassy in the first country you reach so there's not even by international standards which I'd always except uh all of these people who kept on coming to the United states have already bypass the their option for amnesty\n... exactly and this is a lawless bunches you if you recall the president was attacked for suggesting that there may be criminals and there may be terrorists among\nThe these people in the caravan ... well now that they have exchanged gunfire and they have had Molotov cocktails\nAnd they have destroyed property and committed are something I think it's very clear the percentage of what's right\nUm but it's so I think a group of them are going to make it to the border and the people that are backing goes uh obviously there's there's logistics and transportation there's a trucks\nThat are carrying them otherwise they could make it in time so some of them are going to make it before the terms because that's that's the October\nSurprise so it makes perfect sense as far as the justice people being brought to justice or we can only hope and pray that John Huber the U.S attorney has been assigned\n'em to look at the wrong doings and the Justice Department the FBI and the inspector general\nAre um subsequent report is going to calm ... of the the you know behavior and the FBI or rice a page Peter Struck et cetera\nOne would hope finally at Road Home there's a lot of\nPeople that have lost their jobs and there are a lot of people were there's grounds to indict them\nAnd I think I Do believe that the president has quite a bit of power that he is restraining himself or music until after the midterms right including the classification of the Pfizer application that has been postponed\nYeah we have a call from Steve in Chatham county North Carolina good evening Steve\n... gym but I always enjoy your show\nThank you Lewis and um\nI agree absolutely everything guests to just said my thought the sun just pause it this is there is going to be in group I Do go to Mexico is doing everything they possibly can when they're bending over backwards obviously\nWe're going to have to get some concessions to them or as as\nYou know because they're doing that for us but my soul is\nLess more from the Israelis um that govern our big they might be used rubber bullets and tear gas does\nNot use live five\nWell certainly there's no need a for lethal force accepted the very last resort there are all kinds of ways to to quell a if you will crowd disturbances and that's a lot of this would be\nSadly the jumbo they you know some of these people walking up here and I assume videos they literally have automatic weapons and you know\nWithin the caravan\nYes have you not seeing the latest videos\nI missed that I guess but anyway All right all of it wouldn't surprise me so we'll assume that that's correct\nI Wonder if these people actually hostages so that these gangs can get their people I'm into our country\nI I was that our guest to answer that I suspect that most of us just want to come up here and grab whatever is available or be it a jobs for those were the work ethic or a or freebies for those without\nA granted good condition for bad back in their home countries but one thing I Would add to those who are upset about being separated from their children\nIf in fact you had a husband and wife who happened to bring their kids to work and work was holding up a bank the kids would be separated from their parents once they were apprehended they're breaking the law entering this country if you do not wish to be separated from your kids don't break into our country or this this whole nonsense of\nOf ah wringing our hands about this just started to really freaked me out a James\nI perfectly understand is ... ... is is right there to bring this up they did have for sure they have firearms this group and the bass a proportion of them are young men that fighting age and\nIt does appear that they want to use the women and children ah it as a kind of thought that they would if and when they arrive at the border they would stick them in fraud and to try you know if if the military were to use water cannons for example um I think they want\nAltercation and injury this was a so it's a delicate situation but here's the big picture\nWe simply have to stop the if they were to get into this country\nThere would be an endless number of caravans and ah it appears as though the people

appreciate that um my question is Charlottesville what I call a fiasco\nTrump said that there was good people on both sides that was actually true but it might have been the wrong thing to say it their all time but my question was and and I have never heard anybody say this about that lady that got killed in that are\nIn a march um why work the police there to keep the vehicles out of the way we're the people were marching I Do understand that that that falls on a lease for love or what you're thinking ordered\nUm I well I as I recall there was a vehicle that sort of came out of nowhere surprised the police and really the only uh there really was it a way to stop it happened so quickly\nBut I I get your point about the president's statement\nBut we'd there were in fact people that were not white supremacist they were not there to cause any kind of criminal activity they were there to protest the political correct removal of historical\nStature and the soul to sleep but that that the president said he didn't say there's all good people here he didn't say that these\nNeo Nazis are good people what he said is there I Believe there were some good people or some of the people are good people on both sides um and it's typical of the way the media as an arm of the Democratic party has operated\nThey basically what used to be called newsrooms are now opposition research center and the news that has chosen\nAnd the news that is crap dude has won this litmus test does it harm the president and that's what they're choosing and that's what worry I mean when you say CNN is twenty four seven MSNBC is twenty four seven all the broadcast networks pretty much all of their coverage\nAnd they've done studies even Harvard says Ninety percent negative I'm so that we so we no

Brian\nHi there this is sort of what we all wanna obviously a superior returns and lower risk although we're generally told well you can have superior returns and more risk or you can have a a less risk and a lower returns how do you get both\nWell it's really a myth of Wall Street that you have to take on more risk in order to get more return Wall Street sales people use this to sell people a mortgage obligations and risky securities but the truth is that if you keep your losses small you make more\nOver the long run than if you are taking big risks\nOf\nReally ... the other words there is I don't know what category of a of of stocks or a category of investments maybe it's a a bonds are or who knows what\nUh maybe you can tell us but no one the one that that if I just look at the category I automatically going to get this uh this muscular portfolio is that a fact\nWhile there's two things one is that people learned in the\nNineteen seventies Nineteen eighties to be diversified to not have one hundred percent of your money in the S P five hundred which crashes about every ten years on the average and you don't want to have all of your money in cash either because that's guaranteed to go down as inflation goes up so instead of just trying to spread\nOver all the bases you you need diversification but you also need momentum what the economists and researchers have found it just in the last few years and the twenty first century is that you can\nHave a portfolio and slightly shift at month by month away from the things that are going down and shifted toward the things that are going up this is called asset rotation\nYou're just rotating your portfolio you just have to check at once a month you don't have to watch computer screens all day long just a simple checkup is all you need to keep your four one K. or IRA or whatever you may have from crashing\nYou do this\nYes most of my personal wealth from my dot com businesses is invested in muscular portfolios I go to my website muscular portfolios dot com the tables there tell you what\nOf the exchange traded funds and index funds are the most likely to go up the most in the next thirty days so I guess by those once a month I stay away from the ATF that are likely to go down in the next thirty days everything\nWhat was that last thing that you stay away from the walk through like do they go down\nWe stay away from index funds that are likely to go down in the last thirty days and so now as investors we have a fantastic opportunity because it's maybe one tenth of one percent the hold these very low cost index funds this has never been so cheap and history\nOne eight six six by boat jumbo is our number one eight six six five oh five or six to six in terms of how you go about doing this uh oh what a what stocks or do you pick six I assume that it is a stocks which you presumably invest correctly\nIs that correct well that's a fallacy people think that the only thing that goes up our stocks really the world now is a place where you can get very cheap exposure to real estate you can get very cheap exposure to commodities you can get ... are precious metals and\nThere's a very simple rule that the economists have proven over hundreds of studies\nWhich most investors and individuals are not aware of and the rule is just whatever went up the most in the past three to twelve months it's statistically more likely than chance to go up for one more month that's all we know we're not predicting next year\nWe're not saying what the market is going to do tomorrow but for people who are poor ones on part one case in Iraq as\nThey may not be able to trade their portfolios\nAnd then once a month their plan may restrict them to only trading once a month this is perfect for them because they need to know this is how markets crash\nThat's as some people have hunter starts going down then it goes down more and then all of a sudden you're down fifty percent like we saw in the global financial crisis people don't want to see their life savings be cut in half that's very bad for their wealth\nAccumulation very bad for their retirement people need to learn how these low risk portfolios are put together\nNow that this will be five hundred is that a lot more important to use and say the the Dow industrial\n[noise] no the mosquitoes for polio is\nNever have any holding and the U.S and the five hundred you do have exposure to large kept stocks\nIf that's what's going up you have exposure small kept stocks if that's what's going up but there's way too much attention paid to the U.S and the five hundred it's just a number it's just a five hundred stocks that people in the standard and Poor's think will go up the most in the coming year they're usually right but yes in the five hundred is very crashed problems at it drops\nForty percent are more every Eighteen years on the average people are not ready for this because we've had this almost ten year bull market people have forgotten how fast the market and go down\nYeah and some of course get a reminded the hard way of saying what it was more to come by in Livingston our guest use a consumer advocates entrepreneur and the author of muscular portfolios and he has a website that may muscular portfolios dot com\nAnd published by been Bella Books so is your are worried about a a a flabby\nPortfolio one

having showed one eight six six five oh jumbo when eight six six five five or six to\nSix [laughter] we're talking with Brian Livingston was written muscular portfolios the investing revolution for superior returns with lower risk so I was a good idea to me it is a published by been Bella Books and there's a website muscular portfolios dot com [noise] you're on the page three hundred ten\nOr you don't run across the statement like this very often in a financial advice book\nNo wealth management strategy is worth a hill of beans with causes arguments between you and your family members who you're talking about maybe a suddenly being responsible for managing your elderly mothers brokerage account after she develops a say a ...\nWhich by the way strikes home for me except the Bible that didn't really have that much to uh to worry about managing but uh what is your advice to people in that circumstance\nWell my own mother was in that situation she was having strokes she was falling into dementia she spent the last three and a half years of her life and various nursing homes she made me the trustee of a bond portfolio that she had built up\nBy buying houses renting them at the students and finally when she couldn't take care of those houses anymore he sold them before the housing crisis so she got full value but she couldn't really take care of herself anymore she needed someone to take care of her\nBusiness affairs and take care of her health care needs what we don't want to be having fights with their brothers and sisters are fights with our inlaws over how do we manage the family's assets with a muscular portfolio the computer formula\nAlways tells you exactly what to do you don't have to know anything you don't have to invest in your book\nThere are laws real estate deal and swap land the index funds that have just become available in the last few years are very highly liquid it's very easy to buy and sell them they don't charge you\nVery big fees it can be as little as a penny to get in and out of an index fund these days that's not true and the past you used to have to pay two percent of your trade just to sell one thing and buying the thing now it can be as little as a penny and you don't have to worry could I Do they should I Do that\nComputer formula just tells you exactly what is the best investments for you that's not\nWhat about bonds they figure into this\nThe global asset classes that we have available to us now with index funds include bonds and include stocks it includes real estate and it includes commodities so you can find\nIn the Thirteen different global asset classes that experts divide the world up into you can have\nUs bonds you can have foreign bond sometimes they're paying a lot more than the U.S bonds vanguard for example has a foreign bond fund\nThat is head against currency changes so you don't have to worry is the dollar going to go up as the dollar going to go down you just never think about that kind of thing is taking care of for you so when you need to have\nMore bonds and your portfolio you will automatically move toward that kind of index fund when the market for example is crashing in the U.S and the five hundred when the some people have hunters doing great your portfolio will automatically rotate more towards equities whether they're us stocks are there non us stocks it's very easy\nWhat about the futures to rebut is all these are these new to me newfangled things that I don't fully understand\nWell you see a lot of these risky futures options which really should take someone who's an expert to handle that kind of thing the\nNew kinds of index funds that just track all market really take care of all of that for you for example let's say during the global financial crisis we were in two thousand eight two thousand nine and stocks were down fifty percent\nThe fact is that treasury bonds were up precious metals were up and commodities were up so it just by\nMoving your portfolio into the index funds that had bonds and precious metals and commodities\nYou could actually go up while the market was crashing in two thousand two thousand nine having a commodities fond of course means that somebody out there is using computers to bet on commodities going up in price or commodities going down in price but you the investor don't need ever\nThink about anything like that it's all had it for you automatically that is the way it should be I don't think anybody should try to become an expert in the energy market or that precious metals market just let\nThe computer program tell you which ones are going up\nYou mentioned overweight and oh nine and our recent a little low so that you'll pick up their what lessons did we the investing public learn from that a a mini crash of ah ten years ago and what lessons did you learn\nWell in two thousand eight thousand I and it was\nThe worst crash since the great depression and it led to this horrible recession which we're just getting out of now the fact is that they asked me if I've hundred\nCrashes thirty percent or more every ten years and it has a severe crash a forty percent or more every Eighteen years that's what people need to remember it's not that the market goes up and up and up it goes down and it goes down like taking an elevator down whereas the bull market was like climbing the stairs up\nWe've had this bull market for almost ten years and the bear market is probably going to be only one year or maybe one and a half years like in two thousand seven to two thousand nine this is the lesson we can take away from this is you can't just\nHave diversification you can't just by three or four things I think you're safe those three or four things can all go down south heinous ally crashing just like they did during the great recession only by looking at your portfolio once a month and giving it a little tune up giving it a little checkup where you push\nOut these things that are doing well and you bring in the things that are doing better\nAll right Brian living student and the book is a muscular portfolios this was Westwood One\n[noise] see she's children's research hospital we're fighting against childhood cancer every day at the heart of this battle\nOr donors most of us want to make some difference in the lives of others seem to dead miraculous
