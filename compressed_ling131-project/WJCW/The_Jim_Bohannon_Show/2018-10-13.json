being ... uh does it a global entrepreneurship entrepreneur port each year and they found that millennial entrepreneurs have launched about twice as many businesses as baby boomers\nAnd they're still in the process of doing it and of course boomers are retired by and large are retiring so I think that they're in part of this is because of the interest in tech based businesses\nA financial tech at

is trying not to spoil but there were a elements within within ... organization that we're we're helping the tax case along a for reasons that that we get to in the book\nYeah so uh again or we don't always hear ah everything that ah that is in fact uh the truth uh before we take a call here let me ask the same question to Brad Schwartz the biggest head slapping moment the biggest I'll be darned I wouldn't have thought that moment in researching Scarface and be untouchable\nWell you know one of the a primary\nThe reasons that the two of us got together to do this book was we had read a lot of um nonfiction works about Capone and the ... bone era that uh we're really disparaging of Eliot Ness they're sort of this great\nA pop culture myth that is the product of the TV series is Robert Stack that many people are familiar with Kevin Costner film or from Nineteen eighty seven started giving him credit for single handedly getting component and a lot of folks seemed to have felt the need\nTo set the record straight um by by\nDenying ness any any credit for any meaningful role in that case and so we sort of um we had done enough research to know that that was not the full story but um we knew that NASA had written this memoir a co written this memoir near the end of his life describing the ... case\nOf that people often talk about as being exaggerated as being mostly fictional is being messes attempt\nOr near the end of his life to grab some of the glory that that was denied him in life\nUm and so I had having read all that I sort of assume that the book\nI Would turn out to be to be mostly fictitious and we were able to verify just about a ... all of the the major incidents described in the book drew outside sources including stuff that then frankly I I thought was was totally made up\nSo if NASA claimed that he did it a a chances are that he did it and his his role in the in the components ... turns out to be a more significant than than people give him credit for lately if I may wildly\nWhat really happened was this ah ah his co author ... who was a sports writer took all of this material they that nest provided a brief him and more of that mess wrote and voluminous scrapbooks have been kept with all the clippings in articles in it\nAnd what he did was he called all of these events all of these sort of exploit and rather than\nPresenting them chronologically he assemble them in what he thought was the best dramatic form so what you have is the ... is a narrative this is the book the untouchable which is quite inaccurate in terms of chronology\nAnd that and made a lot of people including bread and may think that it probably the book was really a\nIf not predominantly false largely falls or inflated but what we discovered was that individually if you put these these blocks in the correct order if you flip the jets a puzzle pieces in the in the correct place\nIt was pretty legit all the way through\nLike a that's a rather interesting Internet itself we have David calling us from San Francisco the boy had to do with our guess max alum columns and Brad Schwartz good evening David\n[noise] oh yeah Hi uh a gym next and Brad hey I wanted to ask a windows old jade gr Hoover biographies written in the early nineties and one of them mentioned admire landscape didn't just do money laundering in New York City but through all of them are families\nSo your book is war about Chicago right yes okay well so one of the things that that comes up in this book is is that ... is plunging huge amounts of money into Wall Street\nSo he's using organized crime money to buy stocks and bonds and he was calculating that it was two point five percent of their gross or excuse me two point five percent of\nWall Street sales were organized crime through ... and so two point five and ten years' time they would have had twenty five percent of Wall Street in ten Twenty years and they would have had half a Wall Street\nShe'll buddy eighties and nineties\nBasically Wall Street was totally captured by organized crime moody and so I'm Wondering did the Chicago Board of trade have the same problem because can you imagine commodity prices being run by organized for him I Do I take\nThat one yeah yeah not I'm not to the extent that that that I'm aware of certainly um there was a great\nAmount of conflict in Chicago during the early Nineteen thirties sort of one components at the peak of his prominence or between him and the legitimate business community in the city because they are we're very aware that he was\nA becoming the cities face I'm becoming the a sort of the unofficial mascot of Chicago and this reputation that the city was developing more so than any city in the United states that time\nUh for for crime for violence or for a lawlessness a was really hurting the the legitimate business community and so they were out in order to preserve their\nA bottom lines in many cases they were funding\nTheir own investigators they were supporting the work that that Eliot Ness and other other a federal uh agents were doing to get rid of Capone and they were they were going directly to president Herbert Hoover\nTo ask him to to intervene directly um to to put component jail so this um this this antagonism between um the the really the the old money in Chicago the financial power um and the new money are represented by by compound and these these upstart\nA mobsters I'm a made for a lot of the battle as we call it in the subtitle of the book the battle for Chicago\nAh once compound was out of the way um and he had his departure as the most famous of the mobsters um had had created this narrative that that organized crime had kind of been defeated in some sense or the people who followed him a were much more cautious where much a quieter\nAbout what they were doing um and and much more willing to work with\nA legitimate industry and and you know for example frankly in I'm In the liquor business after liquor becomes a legal or\nThe gangs don't get out of the booze business they just open up a legitimate or a breweries so uh as as we talk a little bit about near the end of the book um by the twenty first century a lot of the sort of descendents of the Chicago Outfit\nUm had gone legit and had become indistinguishable from any other business interests in the

New York and forced him to move I find it ironic\nI spent three years in Chicago is that indeed quite a an ethic or a locale and what's interesting about Chicago if you build\nFashion the city of the little pie wages if you will uh as as people uh\nMoved out into the suburbs they tend to stay in the same pie which that that had a had started the met is to say uh the uh the Irish section saying in southwestern Chicago led to Irish suburbs in the area and so on and so forth there is not a substantial\nItalian community and I guess what I find remarkable if in fact this was a ethnic\nOr hatred or I'm not sure that that to Chicago will be the most uh hospitable place for an Italian guy running away from the Irish Mob well one of the\nInteresting things that sort of we I guess we we certainly didn't discovered this this was known but it was or something and we had to change our thinking about\nWas that did the ethnic lines in these gang wars were not as clear cut as as we tend to think you know it was very much a geographical struggle a component his gang on the south side his rivals uh the north side gang you can guess which side of the city they controlled a but we have this perception that that gang war was Italian versus Irish when in fact\nI'm the north side gangsters or you know bugs Moran was actually a French Canadian or one of his top allies was a poll in other words a tally in 'em and component one of his great strengths as a leader in in one of the way she was able to to accrue power\nIn the city was that he did not display the level of ethnic prejudice that to other other people have the period a dead so are people in his or you know one of his top\nA associates when really the co partners in the uh the the racket or that he ran a was Jewish um yeah other than a Welsh men was another one of his top people I was not a by any stretch of the imagination of slowly Italian gang it actually became a much more um\nA homogenous a Hodges the Italian after Capone or a is taken up by the federal government and frightened that comes into power but it was it was a much more multiethnic situation\nSeem to think but for a while they were what equal opportunity bugs absolutely\nAbsolutely I mean Capone would would deal with anybody who could make some money for them uh and you know in in any in any ethnic or a group um as long as you can control the territory on the south side was a big some of the big\nStruggles were between ah the Italians and the civilians who are basically usually kind of lumped together but with some of the real violence that took place was between between a civilian and Italian factions one\nEight six six five oh jumbo our number one eight six six five oh five four six to six with the ... or ... columns the coauthors

there was some are certainly it is true that compound opens the first uh released soup kitchen in Chicago after the onset of the depression this is in Nineteen thirty\nNine he feeds a lot of people and he wins a lot of goodwill from it although he doesn't run the soup kitchen for very long and it was just the one not not multiple soup kitchens is sometimes claimed\nA but one of the one of the things we found out in our research and one of my favorite kind of little discoveries about the book\nWas that the way that they stopped the soup kitchen with food was that they would send components in his enforces around to grocery stores and essentially strong arm people into donating a food for the soup kitchen that then could punt would pass office his own sort of\nA ... so he gets the credit for for all this charity and and does you know some good to to a certain a from a certain viewpoint but you always have to question his methods and I think the thing you always have to keep in mind that compound\nOr is that he's he's a totally self interested individual he seems to be ... or the kind of person who liked uh personally enjoyed making people feel good um but it was because that was the feeling that that that he that that made him a pleased with himself and so\nHe offers to help solve the Lindbergh kidnapping but only if they'll let him get out of jail you know he's there he's

seemed quite ascendant in this country we of or co authors of Scarface the untouchable max alum Collins and Brad Schwartz and Tom ... calls in from Sharon, Pennsylvania grieving Tom and welcome\nYeah interesting program Jim odd I I grew up in this area which is a among the Ohio Pennsylvania border very close to Youngstown, Ohio\nA which had the name of little Chicago because of the fact that the Cleveland of action and the Pittsburgh notes affection for fighting for this area had a lot of bootleg and going on a as I understand to join a ...\nA hit out for a while and the township than I'm calling from [noise]\nBut uh I was watching a up and I grew up by the way in the sixties or watching uh the untouchable but I was watching a documentary out of Cleveland a few years ago on PBS and uh some reporters in some uh uh\nOther people that are put together the documentary pointed out that that ness moved there after Chicago he became the public safety director of Cleveland, Ohio and uh\nWas there for a few years in that position he tried running for mayor but was defeated\nBut he developed a bad case of alcoholism and I was kind of ironic when you think that ah when you think of the uh TV show the untouchable you always see I'm there with that acts of breaking up the barrels of of of whiskey and in in like a gin\nUp but the point of getting at is that he died penniless um he couldn't even afford a headstone for him and that book that was written he objected to the way it was put together but he needed the money so he turned over the rights for that book\nBut the other part I I find it ironic that is that you have fought Al Capone who uh you know ... died in prison a ... at a young age Nelly ness who died penniless\nA at a ... of alcoholism at a relatively young age as you pointed out\nIt just seems ironic to me that you know there's these two are in Hollywood made them into two titans are and yet when you look at their their lives or you know they weren't as glamorous as a a lot of people would put together\nIt was really so see my parents were was component when he died in prison or out of prison\n... not in prison or\nHe died in his ... palatial Miami home or in Miami Beach yes but\nAgain I guess the the the they're they're ending endings plural we're we're not uh certainly uh uh on a par with the the peak of their fame\nWell you know it's hard with some ... some of like no there's no question he was that low ebb at that point I think it probably overstated that they died of alcoholism I think he definitely was a drinker and probably had what we might call a drinking problem but this is\nA you know not what killed him his his heart killed him is the bad heart condition they'd had since he was a was a kid and\nThere's reason to believe for example on that show came on and he became famous again that he would have had a pretty good third act but he didn't get to have a third at him because he died so\nSo so young or I should say if it's okay for me to do that when we we put this book together we originally sat down on we were going to do\nA cradle to the grave dual biography of these two gentlemen and uh and we got to the point where we ... we had to focus on Chicago because it was such a big important dramatic story\nWell are are ... fortunately our our editor asked us if we could tell the rest of the story and right now ... and I are working on a follow up by a man called uh the touchable and the butcher which has to do with\nPrimarily with Eliot Ness in in Cleveland when he was it ... as your caller said public

is up this evening Hi Maggie\nHi thank you for taking my call me\nI have a couple of comments here All right first look what Mitch Linda was saying about turkey the territory of turkey it was known as Asia Minor it was it it became Christianized but\nThey'll get a lot of the letters that Paul wrote that they were moved to places on turkey\nBut to actually the Turkish people actually today we're not there yet they weren't near the border of China they were living with other nationalities through into a bar or some other ones and they came riding in in the ninth and tenth century ... century until the end of toning peninsula\nYou see the actual Turkish people today they were not not there yet in a in a Turkish Antonio peninsula you know\nNot they're not yet this was different different groups here different groups of people at all to do\nBut a couple a couple of cases here in St what would happen if um the ISIS actually took over a poses philosophy so to speak\nSome time ago it was reported that in the territories in Iraq I think controlled by ISIS\nThere's this um ISIS website which countries as a slave exchange it gives the names\nThe prices up three thousand ... women and pushing women into the names of their owners and the price they're offered for of\nCourse yeah there's been this was a shopping list yeah slave exchange flea markets receive\nIt was reported I saw this report want a maybe a year and a half ago or so yes see the idea that mindset is different\nMany various people around maybe in the middle east or South Asia would see nothing wrong with this so you you do you do ... with the the infidel such as women Christian women you know whoever you know is not Muslim you know you see\nThat there are a lot of evidence on this planet\nYes although all around everywhere yes [noise] I guess the other thing is more for immediate there or maybe five or six I forget exactly Saudi Arabia and young women were demonstrating peacefully for more rights for women there no I'm being held in detention and if they're said to be headed\nBy the Saudi Arabian government see any kind of demonstration or is seen as criminal you know and you you're dealt with by being beheaded if you're a peaceful demonstrators civil rights worker activist you'd already kind\nOf and and the course of the case of the the murder of this or\nA ... a reporter yes Saudi a diplomatic facility yes there's a lot I mean this is one area where I have to say that the President Trump is is really way off base when it comes to his love of the Saudis you've got a lot of dealings with no actual level\nOr the the the the Saudi royal family as it should have a dark ages as we can December ... ... they have on occasion allied themselves with us officially and things like the uh the war on terror or like the the first Gulf War\nThe altar who they are and what they represent\nSee Saudi Arabia has a small population of maybe twenty million people maybe eight million for workers include it why would they need one hundred ten billion dollars worth of weaponry you know people that seem think what's behind this do they need all that weaponry Ehrlich armaments you know necessarily for what exactly do\nWell of course of the ... they would probably say these days it would be to uh to join in the uh the uh United front against ah the ah the Iranians\nThe really bad ads are I mean you can argue whether the\nA valid answer or not but uh that would that would probably say\nThey might say something or other yeah suits them yeah mhm but\nYou but your your points are are are well taken that uh\nUh it again it's an area of the world about which we do a very little and uh we we should we should know bore because he hasn't even if it's depressing we should we should

we're observing but you know what I Want to talk about is the Turkish government of today is not there is government when I was there no no absolutely\nNot uh they they were completely different um in fact the way I understand the constitution is written in such a way\nThat a sort of most ... law cannot be instituted now that's the way it was written yes yeah air to one is trying to change it now\nAnd as he tried to change it officially unofficially I guess it's largely changed\nYeah yeah it's and that's a shame because when I was there I mean I got along with a Turkish papal fantastic insects is hey I have several Turkish friends and what I get a kick out of most of the restaurants when I walked in the first time a greater to miner named native language they look like I had two heads\nBecause they never had an American do that to them but you know it's a shame that a country with the history that it has and the inroads it is late into modern technology and how they have developed or cities\nIn the last uh forty years uh is going to is they're trying to pull back into the dark ages and I think that's a darn shame and I don't know why the people of the country are

just one battle and it's not over the next battles in a couple of weeks\nWell it's a couple of things the um the\nThe whole idea of of this there are two parts of this the political part of it and the question is is a greater motivator a greater motivator for the right or greater motivator for the Web or a greater motivator for the center\nYou know the left a you know says there uh since Saturday evening while we're more motor ... motivated now well that's what the press will have you believe we'll see about that\nUm will look at early voter turnout as we always do but really even with the right guy no I Know the motivation on the right there we know that so that's not going to go away\nUh the motivation in the middle that's the question that's where you win the election and so you look at the undecideds and how many of the key races right now are undecided\nOr have a great number of undecideds are certainly to the extent that they can throw that election one way or the other that group going one way or the other end thrown out\nIs is is the key so beyond that\nThe win at the highest court\nRemains to be seen\nBecause we have to go back to chief justice Roberts twice mhm rewriting Obamacare for the from the bench it is a victory in that the left did not get their way and their attempt to destroy the process I'm certainly\nThey\nThey distorted the process will see what happens to it next time there is a a an opening on the high court and if this president is still president\nUh how that goes but ultimately\nNow you're going to have to wait and see what what Kavanaugh's does on the bench what effect the ultimately has and that won't be seen for years and so the when there is that\nIt's an odds game as we have been saying for for many years going back to Andrew Breitbart and and his comments to us during the twenty twelve race and\nTalking about how important the Supreme Court was when we asked the question why should we support or should conservative support\nA moderate like Romney at the time for\nFor president and his answer was SCOTUS Andrew Breitbart the answer was very clear and it is an odds game because you can support a John Roberts Neil Gorsuch\nOr Brett Kavanaugh then through all of it you still may not get those decisions you think you're going to get its always intriguing but sometimes it's disappointing and how they decide and we'll again we won't be able to see that effect or if that's going to happen\nFor many years ultimately on the court there there will be\nCases where his decision will be key in those cases but we'll see how he decided to an end what his thinking is in those opinions as they come across\nRight I mean if what what it's about ... if you look at his judicial history I Would say that\nAre most likely I'll agree with eighty percent of what he may be eighty five to Ninety I don't know ... between eighty and Ninety percent all agree I'm a ... with him you know we we talk about\nA true construction of some and by the way when we talked about remember what was that the or was it the location device\nSo the location of ice on the cars are about ... what was the case that everybody has a cell tower two was\nThe ... where everybody where everybody said we're we're especially the never Trump first came out and said she said oh you did you see he sided with all the liberals\nExcuse me you didn't get your judge ... and then we had to point out as many other people did no uh actually on that particular case it was the liberals on the court uh and and the Gorsuch that actually used the Scalia ruling\nOr you know Scalia was probably the ... the the most construction is judge of\nOf my lifetime paying attention to what the Supreme Court has a has a has has done Clarence Thomas always is not always a construction is right Clarence Thomas will\nA judge based on at times based on what he views as a conservative win for the day right that's not what I'm looking for I'm never looked for that I Want that's up for the legislature to decide to meet is these are all constitutional issues I Want judges look at the constitution said does it say that\nNo well that's not up to me to put that in\nDon't bend the constitution or straight from the constitution in order to fit your political agenda\nRight so I'd say ... I'd say if I look at a a a a Clarence Thomas he's probably got a a a Scully it was almost Ninety nine probably Ninety nine percent\nJust doing it off the top of my head Clarence Thomas probably somewhere between Ninety and Ninety five percent ... depending on depending on the year [laughter] yeah and and what I'm hoping is that\nYou have a a you know you have a cabin on that uh would get to the Ninety percent level at least the for me on on the on on the important\nCases I'll be very pleased if it's greater than that but again nobody expected Roberts to rewrite\nObamacare right do you ... and and then you look at some of his other cases you're like Oh absolutely right absolutely right absolutely right absolutely right so\nI'm a again this to me was about\nThe greatest thing that came out of this besides getting a ... Supreme Court justice that isn't a a roof gator ... Ruth Bader Ginsburg is the fact that you and I talked about that the left has\nMade it very clear what they want\nA but I don't think that the Republican Party a I think a lot of\nConservatives knew this was this was a a part of who they were I don't think a lot of the moderates in the Republican\nParty thought they they were uh\nI I Will say some of the moderates that were never Trump or some of the conservatives that were never Trump per se\nBut to see it in action and to see\nThem look to see the debate points that they were bringing up to see what they want it done to see that they rejected the mindset of due process the mindset of a a presumption of innocence this stereotyping\nBut at the convenience all women are to believed unless you're there was those type of woman over there by the way to one of the stories of saw is that now Democrats are starting to blame white women for cabinet are being put in well wait a minute I thought women were always right\nRight and then I then they started a blaming Ivan Eddie\nAnd the case that he will wait a minute thought the woman was women were always right right yeah yeah but that case said too many holes well that's the whole point that the\n... so now we're just in a comparison of holes in the case right you are stating that and so they're all over the place and when it comes down to is they're just trying to fit in argument to fit their narrative at the moment in order to get the judge in that will fulfill their liberal desires and a judge that will legislate for them\nThey're all over the place on their opinions\nAs\nTheir opinions don't and their opinions on their goalpost move all over the place\nRight so to me it was the fact that you were able to see\nThe left and them and not just the far left\nWhat you saw because we normally get calls where people will say well that's not the mainstream of the Democratic party what you saw\nOver the last two weeks was the mainstream of the Democratic party in Washington DC the leadership of the Democratic party that reject due process under the law\nReject a presumption of innocence\nAnd we'll slander and defame somebody's character\nWithout evidence to do so\nAnd I think a lot of I'll tell you I had a conversation with independent Bob yesterday boy he was renting it was New Bern in my ear\nAh because ah as you said you know and and I've talked about independent bought for years and used to vote for Democrats he sort of tell me how I can ever vote for democratic ... I've ever when I'm being told what white males thanks as always Ron and white men are always evil and women are always to be bullied because everybody knows that's not true right\n\nThat's where they are so we'll get to that or by the way last year it was getting rid of the electoral college by the lab we told you the next thing would be getting rid of the Senate they got there\nOf all this now own [laughter] is Han BC reporter who said you know basically it's time to get rid of the Senate\nYMCA dot net slash more\n[noise] I think she's children's research hospital we're fighting against childhood cancer every day at\nThe heart of this battle or our donors most of us want to make some type of difference in the lives of others saint she does miraculous or\nThe fact that no one has to pay its place where everyone history does this and he [noise]\nEverybody is welcome here and it doesn't matter your religion or what part of the world you're from all that is taken away it just gives you some hope [noise]\nIt's just a nice feeling to put your energy into something that really does genuine we make a difference in a child's mind [noise]\nThere's just no ...\nIf we have the ability to help\nAnd when you have the responsibility now\nFinding cures saving children\nSeem to children's research off they don't find out how you can help at ... dot org\n[noise] any given moment [noise] kind of way I mean America maybe taking a very bad\nAt the ballot mental milestone but for too many parents of ab ...

org\n\nSo there you go read I radio [noise]\nAnd ... certain hunting I'm Jerry McNamara eight six six Ninety or right I just\nDon't want to note here ... uh and and let me point out something that that I just you know I I look at conservative media and I just say stop it\nAnd whether it was the you know in a drudge you know we know he's conservative but you basically just lift things but\nHe had the Taylor Swift story as the number one story half the day yesterday yeah and it's the number one story right now on Fox yeah All right nobody cares what she thinks no ethical nobody cared opening Taylor Swift things why do the editors at Fox News\nBelieve that she deserves the Taylor Swift comes out in support of tendency Democrats who cares ... before she said she won't speak on ... not ... who care somebody cares nobody cares what she thinks\nThere's so many things that we can be doing as a as as as a media that are important and I'm not saying you don't put the you don't have the story somewhere\nYou know 'cause you could you get your story but it's been the number one story now for a few hours sitting there on as we go into a Monday with everything that's going on\nRight right Taylor Swift is a story that they they put up there even though ... story and you know him supporting Donald Trump is a Side Story it's notable and it's different because you have\nA a mega hip hop star supporting Republican president who was hated by pretty much everybody else in his community and in in his profession so that's notable because\nIt's not what it would have spent it's unique in that new news just things that are unique and different right and and ... and\nThe thing is that\nUltimately though the the endorsement\nDoesn't really do anything not sometimes you'll see a you know these mega endorsements come on a come on board for an Obama but that wasn't what\nGot Obama to the White House the endorsements don't do anything except show that those celebrities are getting on the bandwagon\nUp most often but you're not it doesn't matter who the celebrity is\nThat's not the influence with the with the people that's not the the real influence with real Americans they really don't care what celebrities have to say politically unless those celebrities are getting involved in politics\nAnd they're going to run for office that's that's the difference I just just a that was just a side comment there'd be this I just saw it and would wind up cycle can let me when I woke up well you know it's funny when it when it when I went to sleep last night it was there when I when I woke up to come in the show was there and I'm like\nAll right enough in our pre show meeting we were talking about it because Sunday we always I always measure of the day by the number of over the top\nBreaking news headlines and sometimes it's breaking news on an event on something that happened uh and it's actual breaking news often it's breaking news breaking news Trump tweets that no that's not breaking news\nThe\nThe number of stories on Sunday dwindled down to just nothing I mean it was it was really well it was down to Taylor Swift endorses Democrats\nThat's what it was down to because here's what happened on Saturday you had your vote\nKavanaugh confirmed\nThe life is going to wind about it they're going to whine about it a little more on Sunday Morning and then as we predicted or as we told you it's really not a prediction because they are too predictable on the left all the protestors go home and it's over you know you you still have some talking members of the house talking about in ...\nNot going to happen it's not going to happen because you're not going to move on it when when you know you want to well if you want to open the store if you want to go down that road\nGo for it I'm sure you'll have some radicals on the left on Capitol Hill that will keep talking about it but it's not going to happen for a reason because there's nothing there it's the reason the confirmation vote went through and he was ultimately confirmed\nYou're not going to have them well we can move and we can do this it's those stories are given the same credibility that the Van Jones story was given when when when Van Jones is rolling up his sleeves and working in a grassroots effort to change the minds of the electric cars no\nThat didn't happen in fact Hillary\nHad a net loss of life doors and Trump had a net gain after the election after the election because these people don't live in reality they don't look at the facts in anything\nThey don't they don't care about the process they want you to believe that that the process is that they slap on their Superman tape and they're going to be a hero in a moment\nAnd it doesn't happen that way you had a situation in the cabinet or confirmation process that was wild it was distorted if you look at it the President Trump was the one that really made that happen in terms of extending it out", "year": "2018",
