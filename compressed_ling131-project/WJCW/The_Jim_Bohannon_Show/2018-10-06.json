Congress\nIt seems to me that Congress in many cases is in ...\nBy a very deliberate action that it has in many instances unconstitutionally abdicated its authority for example to the three letter agencies essentially allow an unelected bureaucrats the\nFDA as the the FCC and blah blah blah to write laws after passing some broad general overall mandate\nOr just one example that ... that the Congress hates hot potatoes\nAnd the that they feel the best way toward increasing their own tenure in office is to pass those hot potatoes onto others my argument would be they don't have the right to do so they were elected to handle hot potatoes well how do you speak of the people but it just seems to me that often\nThat in the moment is not only allowed by Congress it is embraced by Congress\nYes but\nTo the extent that Congress passes broadly worded statues about the environment and\nFor example leaves it to the environmental protection agency to fill in the details about clean water or clean air that's within the rights of Congress to set up an independent agency and allow the agency to\nAdminister the law day to day they have the expertise and the knowledge\nNow to a point out to a point I Would have to say only up to a point that they they go way overboard\nWell but that's the question then of course if Congress thinks the agency does go overboard either passing foolish regulations or infringing of the rights of property owners for example Congress has the power to pass a new law I don't much like the current\nAffects of democracy I don't think much of the current president I don't think much of the current Congress but you know that's what we signed up for if you don't like\nWhat your Congress is doing or not doing voted in some other folks that were going to be doing in five weeks if you don't like your president pick another president I Do not think the Supreme Court records generally ought to be saving\nUs from ourselves and I guess your brief against regulatory power at the federal level\nWhen you have these agencies\nFilling in the gaps and they interested to see if you will of statutes I respect your disagreement and they're all sorts of agency rulings I disagree with but Congress in the first instance\nHas the power to change any of those regulations and if they don't do so it seems to me you're a complaint is with Congress you shouldn't be rushing\nTo the court to solve the problem and of course by the way I mean I think the humming conservative court with Brett Kavanaugh on it will significantly cut back on the regular federal regulatory power I think that's the real holy grail a for moving concern\nI Would do not ... not roe v way not others don't want to go back to the ... the way to know what I'm saying\nBut but the problem with allowing the court\nTo vent substituted judgment for these regulatory agencies ear just place in the power in the hands of other elected representatives why don't you trust Congress more\nI Do not trust Congress to do their job and that that is the issue to me is to hand over far too much power to the unelected regrets that's my only point I think Congress should be forced to in fact right laws even if it's on popular and that there should be a limited to just how much do you ...\nYou ... how do you force them to do that you pick better congressman and better senator\nI still believe that there are there in fact uh could be a waves of reading the constitution that simply says that the Congress has such powers of the suggest that they can pass it off to\nDo the FDA the FCC or the Rotary Club of ... Illinois I just don't believe in is within their authority but be that as it may that's one area that I Would note another I Would I Would bring ever met his I think it's a very core of what you're talking about here\nAnd that is the fact that are not a few justices of the Supreme Court and not a few Americans are very happy with the idea of life time tenured unelected legislators as long as they get their way I don't think process matters to those people\nI completely agree and such is the challenge of my book I Try to separate out\nThe outcomes from the process because for example I Am a big believer\nIn extremely liberal abortion rights I think in the tragic choice between the rights of the fetus and the rights of the woman I as the legislature would support the rights of the woman I just think that that victory for a whole bunch of reasons we could talk about but that victory ought to be achieved\nIn the legislatures not at the court I feel similarly about gun control recording two thousand eight in the Heller case declared that you have a constitutional right\nTo ... to own a handgun in your home I think that cases ridiculous are you if you want to if you want to achieve that victory when it at the D.C city council winning in state legislatures widowed in Congress and there are other case for example campaign finance regulations if you don't like the idea\nOf campaign finance regulation because you think that money equals speech which is a position that the majority position of of the Supreme Court\nLast night that was ... mine's zip right when you know it was five for five or okay I was where I learned it was led\nBy Justice Kennedy with chief justice Roberts close behind a project of the current chief justice is to deregulate campaign finance entirely and I think the positions hypocritical if you preach respect\nFor legislatures and the Democratic process\nAs chief justice Roberts did so eloquently and two thousand Fifteen in the same sex marriage case a burger fail why doesn't that apply for campaign finance regulation his argument would be but its conclusion already because the first amendment says otherwise but as Elana Kagan's pointed out\nYou're just weaponize in the first amendment and listen\nWe we could you and I could debate this for an entire semester right this is what law schools are students debate it's what constitutional scholars debate but the rest of my book and I'm no scholar I'm just a journalist with a law degree\nWho worked at Newsweek for Twenty years is that on balance we've lost sight of why we have a democracy and I was struck by\nBoth in two thousand sixteen when ... when Justice Scalia died\nAs well as during the first round the Kavanaugh hearings there were lots of questions about abortion and presidential

five or six to six we're\nTalking with David Kaplan me former legal affairs editor at Newsweek Magazine the author of the most dangerous branch inside the Supreme Court's assault on the constitution\nAs you uh take a look at a recent additions to the courts are are any of them are a notable in terms of how they impact vis a\nVis a danger that you see are you start with Gorsuch or go all the way back to a ... or or a Roberts or as far back as you want to go but if any of these justices jumped out at you I assume Anthony Kennedy will be on the list\nWell I think Justice Kennedy was the worst defender he at least wasn't hypocritical because only rarely did he talk about differing or other branches he was usually quite\nProud to substitute his judgment for what other branches or for or for what the people had decided themselves I actually think that of the current eight justices Steven briar has\nShown the most difference um to other institutions he has voted for example to uphold more acts of Congress than any of the other justices and just a few weeks ago Lana Kagan's speaking out at\nUCLA law school talked about how an eight member court remember the court now has an even number of justices because Kennedy has off of it just like I had an even number of justices after Scalia died when the Republicans refused to consider Merrick Garland and uh\nThe court at eight justices for a year and a half\nKagan noted that an even numbered court was necessarily more\nMinimalist more modest more humble because\nYou needed in effect a super majority you needed five of eight justices five to three minimum to do anything and she I think was suggesting I Hope that maybe the court going forward will be that way now a cynic would say she hopes that because\nThe liberals now don't have control of the court assuming Kavanaugh's confirmed\nThat the conservatives will be indecisive control but I also think that Kagan in her writing and in her teaching over the years remember she was at Harvard law school for a long time she wasn't even a judge he's the only member the quarter wasn't a judge before becoming adjusted his I think Kagan displayed I'm a restraint\nUnlike many of the other justices you mentioned Gorsuch I don't think you'll you've seen any of that on the part of of Gorsuch you certainly haven't seen it from Thomas who was explicitly taken the position that if a court decision was wrong from yesteryear\nIt should be overturned he has very little regard for president\nAnd I can I ask you about precedent an established law if I could because uh uh ... we have an in recent years heard a lot about for example with roe versus Wade that it's a stab leash law and it occurs to me that in the case for example of a let's say plus ... versus Ferguson\nA goodness knows that was a ... law for fifty eight years and it was lousy law when it was made and it was lousy law when it was finally overturned by brown versus board of education for the life of me as a layperson in a non lawyer I've never understood the ... that people seem to have for establishing law\nBecause you because you can't prove\nThat a rule is unwise by citing the exception yes plus she was wrong in state in separate uh separate but equal was was okay\nWhat's wrong in Eighteen Ninety six and brown v board in Nineteen fifty for reversing that was one of the weather it's one of the great moments in the history of the court but by citing that singular example that's singularly important example it doesn't undo the reason why we\nRegard precedent is important to key reasons why because people rely on court decision society rules on what the court does in any number of areas social issues like abortion but also business decision concerning labor taxes and so forth there has to be ... if you ...\nYou can have a court that changes its mind when membership\nChanges there'll be no stability in the society so that's one reason the other reason is the court\nJustifiably so doesn't want the public to think that the law simply dependent on the staffing of the court and\nA court will change its mines where it will change its mind when the Republicans take over from the Democrats the Democrats take over from the Republicans that white Anglo American law dating back hundreds of years long before there was the United states regards precedent as important and fundamentally\nConstitutional law tends to be conservative not conservative in the partisan sense but it tends to be gradual is in ... and Mentalist and and that in a nutshell is why that does that help\nYeah it it it does a but but again I I and the the rest of us I understand that if the court has ruled a so be it a although I guess what what bothers me the most about the notion of settled law is the longer a decision has been around\nThe more reverence should be attached to it that somehow the fact that for example plus ... versus burgers or the ... schools are are are are are just fine or that somehow or buy a Nineteen fifty let's say it it it had more uh validity than it did in the in say Eighteen mighty cigarettes\nYou're ... you're asking about the exception and there was a lot of experience out in society between Eighteen Ninety six and Nineteen fifty more war that separate but equal didn't work schools were not equal\n... horrible things took place during Jim Crow in the years before flashy and American society was hurt and torn apart um throughout a leading up to brown against the board but even remember brown v board didn't wasn't the thunder bowl\nThere were many decades of litigation strategic incremental is litigation by the great Thurgood Marshall who eventually became a justice that's classy but in other areas the reason why if the decision\nHas lasted a long time or in the case of row when it was upheld about Twenty years later in the case decision Nineteen Ninety to\nWhy the reliance interest this ability interests of society militate in favor of leaving a decision alone\nI've told you I'm I'm a liberal by political persuasion I think as I argue in the book I think roe was was was not a good decision not because of the outcome but because the court should not have gotten involved the court should have said that's up for state legislatures in Congress that German but I Would not argue\nNow that road should be overturned\nI don't think you should the court should lightly\nUpset the reliance interests and the the the fabric of society that's grown up\nLet me to make sure that I ended up having to do I think that's a bad idea and it\nUndercuts the courts legitimacy if to Trump's nominees can wind up changing fifty years of history on\nLet me make sure that I understand this or that you you don't feel that role was a wise decision in the first place but now that it's been around a while it would still not be wise to correct that but it would be ... words in other words having a certain amount of tenure if you will\nA

oversight of administrative agencies\nAnd the court is going to consider whether the sex offender registration a notification act is unconstitutional excessive delegation of legislative power to the attorney general the number of an interesting cases so\nI Would love to hear from all of you tonight and a one eight six six five oh jumbo one eight six six five oh five or six to six\nTo offer your thoughts about what we've been through granted it's not officially finally over but probably all but the shouting or in this case the voting and there'll be shouting after that I'm just wondering what you think we should have learned have we learned that uh we should be more sensitive\nTo those who say they were sexually assaulted\nI have no problem with that I Hope that if we do learn that we also learned\nThat while it is All right if you have been sexually assaulted to suffer lapses of memory perhaps or you're trying to block of very unpleasant circumstance from your mind and that's fine I tend to uh I Would tend to be very sympathetic him in regard botch\nBut if you go down the road further to making accusations against somebody else than you'd better have the goods to back it up otherwise there's no reason to hear from you and if in fact you really feel like that there is something that happened to you that deserves justice\nThan it is incumbent upon you to sit down and force yourself to write down details it happened on the night of such and such it happened at such and such a location such and such people were in the room name them give times anything that you possibly can and write them down if you're going to try to make a case out of something\nThen you need the ammunition to make such a charge credible a and I think we've seen a classic example of how not to do that and again I have not been there I'm sure there may be all kinds of reasons why one would tend to block something from your mind but if your blood from your mind\nThan you'd better just leave it as a bad memory because you have robbed yourself of the very weapons you need to make it into a a federal case if you will in this case literally so\nOne eight six six five oh jumbo when eight six six five oh five or six to six we go to Mike who is in western Maryland denied good evening Mike\nHey Jim thanks for taking my call yes or\nNo we're talking about death row inmates and dementia at ours my immediate reaction was we will not have that problem if we would put in ... and and express lane which is similar to what they have in Texas it seems like the death row population is the longest lived segment of the population\nI Would argue that the keeping people on death row for decades the Internet itself a form of cruel and unusual punishment\nAnd I agree with you there should be a basis for some appeal but you and I both know that passed a couple of appeals and passed a couple or three years a sitting up there everything that follows the nothing more than stupid lawyer tricks\nTo ask you a question and that they ever sat down and had a drink with someone at that time on death row\nNo I Do my knowledge I've never even interviewed a person who had done time\nI have a neighbor that I have a neighbor lives right around the corner\nFor two years at Pennsylvania prison he was convicted of felony DUI style one was hurt badly not killed it two years in prison and when he first ... the only place that role for him for a sale on death row\nAnd he told me the story that context there\nThey would ask LA would say how many\nThat's all they would say meaning how many did you kill a horde reply [laughter] and kill anybody on air for drunk driving they just laugh at him\nWow uh that that that's interesting that that uh that they would put someone on quote death row unquote or who was not a up to be executed I I've never heard of that before\nThat's that's the only place like first entered that parental ...\nWow that's a that is bizarre\nA in any event he is out now or what was his thought I'm curious to before we move on I'm I'm curious as to his thoughts regarding the attitudes\nOf those he knew on death row where they uh resigned to their faiths were they a morose and the depressed or how did he describes his fellow inmates the ones who were supposed to be on death row\nWill now we really did not discuss that but the next time I have a beer with al ... will talk about that\nYeah you can report back in I I appreciate that very much Mike into thank you that that's an interesting situation that the people in my line of work are always looking for interesting people to to talk to\nSomebody was on death row because they had no place else to put them that's a that's bizarre one eight six six five oh jumbo one eight six six five oh five or six to six and um\nThis will put a assuming that it all goes as it apparently will this would mean that Brett Kavanaugh will of missed a week of the new term or a week and I'm not sure what all that includes the arguments that may have been hurt I don't I don't know what the schedule has been for the quote past week unquote\nAh but I Would uh swimming has been uh getting ready for example clerks and the like uh obviously wasn't in in a position to hire anybody my guess is he has talked to any number of people and said if this goes through I may need you to hit the deck running\nMy guess would be the nominee will be sworn in quickly but he will have a symbol of what might be considered a shadow staff that is to say I'll need you pretty fast if this goes through\nA so I'm thinking that you'll be hitting the deck running there'll be wrong but that's my guess one eight six six five oh jumbo let's go to a gym in Columbia falls Montana\nThe state with the two senators who played a big role in all of this of course Heidi Heitkamp who was voted no in a state where she's losing badly for her for a seat in the U.S Senate and of course the Steve Danes the other senator who was a a walking his daughter down the aisle good evenings him\nA good evening Jim both thanks for the call or taking my call a Mr gains is one heck of a good man I met him personally and actually did a little barbeque several years ago for him [noise] good honest hardworking conservative man\nAnd he's helped us veterans also a a like a a well because it's on the radio all say caster but I have another name for him\nBabies who were born prematurely when we start to [noise] to consist of acting more than half a million baby you can email each year you can help too many volunteers like\nMy baby\nMaybe for coming challenge to\nOur strong\nNinety One\n[noise]\nMeasure with us on the ... one eight six six five oh jumbo when eight six six five oh five four six to six were looking at\nThe beginning of the red Kevin our time on the Supreme Court yeah that's a just a little bit premature but it does seem pretty likely this past day was the big question mark and he's like it's possible but it is a probably a very high level of sort of do now\nThat are within the next few hours we're going to see the swearing in of Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S Supreme Court All right we've got a call from Archie in em is in Indiana on the jumbo Hannah George good evening\nEvening yeah Yes sir regarding idea about down alternate means by enforcing the death penalty I understand that because of the difficulty in getting a chemical weights on ... and what state has done that\nAnd they have decided to revert back to the gas chamber except instead of using lethal ass cyanide they had children to use a non lethal gas that does not support right\nIn other words what just simply simply suffocating people to death\nNow they're putting nitrogen into the gas chamber and since we breathe nitrogen you don't choking deaths bought it just won't last asleep and your brain shuts down and all the systems shut down and eventually don't wake up\nA that's a curious I I was aware that did that in fact you would go to sleep you would of course if you were breathing pure nitrogen and yes the air we breathe is about Seventy nine percent nitrogen now that's very true but without any oxygen in that atmosphere I Would have to think that far from just going to sleep that you would tend to go\n[laughter] and eventually I Would think rather painfully you would suffocate I could be wrong but uh I\nI don't know that would be interesting to know which state as well as\nI can recall that issue it had to do with the fact that the recovery has refused to sell the chemicals to this day because they were there were anti death penalty and I want to say Florida but I don't think that's right in any event I made a statement\nSaying they were being say it because that chemical or being misused by state\nYes but I mean I mean we are so ridiculous on the subject I mean the idea that you have to swab the arm of those about to be executed I mean ... we were afraid they're going to get an infection\nI think not [laughter]\nAh but ah yeah I certainly see what you're saying that that's interesting I don't know exactly what would happen if you breathe only nitrogen my guess would be that it wouldn't be as painless as a perhaps describe but in any case ah thanks for the call arch you would go to dawn and Kalispell, Montana [noise] ah good evening done and welcome\nAnd thank you for taking my call sure and\nI mean there's some people that say go back to the real well for hanging yes we can only I'm about\nTwenty years ago and watching Washington state they had a guy that ran out all these appeals and in Washington state to hang on hang in state\nAnd then he ate everybody's food all the food he can get when you put on a tremendous amount of weight then they couldn't have an because what he said it would be taught to take him and that would be cruel and unusual\nYeah I I recall I recall that that that story and a ... and again you know\nWho cares would have to be my ... but but I was the reaction OK you chose to to try and eat your way out of the problem well guess what you're about to lose your head that would be my answer and they have that advantage so my mic\nYeah 'cause they did it and they'll say oh it'll be painful when you put the chemical in the I don't think they cared about painful and they killed somebody\nI don't think they did either\nYou know I think it should be done and over with and not forty years on death row\nWell absolutely again I argue that that ended at all that time on death row in it of itself is cruel and unusual and I ... that's how I see it at dawn thank you for your thoughts\nOne eight six six five oh jumbo one eight six six five oh five four six to six Brett Kavanaugh\nIs just on the verge\nOf getting a new job to Steve in ... North Carolina\nGood evening hey no shame but I'm cannot go back to the government the hub hub debate last night he care no I don't care going okay\nHey it did he tell you that he is in some other pretty recognizable people\nOr\nOr a button and a little mutt for the is it article Bob the convention the states\nThe will of the article five convention of states movement is under way I've spoken to people from that uh I Would have brought it up but I was unaware that Mike Huckabee was involved in the movement\n... yeah the the petition ...\nYeah you're that's a that's the move but we're talking about yes you guys all guarded by the U.S constitution to call a constitutional convention yes a baby or anything I didn't know about was that Mike Huckabee was involved though it sounds like something with which you would be a ...\nYes I Know ah I just wonder uh I kind of wonder\nIf it's about you about it in the shop to let you would be willing to participate with\nWe've we've had our people from the movement now on at least two maybe three occasions I support the notion wholeheartedly and which maybe it's time we had someone else on\nSo yeah\nAnd the main reason I Would just notes that you brought it up Steve many of the amendments that we need\nThat would never get through Congress and that's the way that all twenty seven amendments that we've adopted had big gun with a two thirds vote of each house of Congress\nBut when you're talking about amendments that would say Congress may pass no law that applies to the public doesn't equally apply to Congress or that no budget from Congress no pay for members of Congress or term limits\nThese are all proposals that would never get past even a simple majority of Congress much less two thirds of Mets why a lot of the things that need to be done which directly involve the the U.S Congress will have to go through such a a constitutional convention there's no other way they can be adopted\nAlso yeah you're right it it it\n... shuts down your pay shuts down that's what happens to us folks out here in in the real world um\nYou your job closes for weight you don't get paid full week so I think that would\nThat work at a stop a lot of a government shutdown that budget speech at all I needed that their salaries within ... hours so\nAnd it needs to be coupled with a a balanced budget amendment with teeth in it so in other words we are forced to do something to this country just dearly hates to do and that is make choices\nI mean we make twice was all the time we make choices all the time when we're dealing with their personal finance but when it's that the federal level hey let's put it on the gross national credit card and keep printing money\nSo a short answer being ah yeah I support such an article by convention or will come back to take some more calls we were just a second but on a friday evening of course this is the time that we check in with our good friend mighty John Marshall of money music dot com\n[noise] my every one this is my job in the record guy without money music minute but girl groups in the sixties all have collectible records such as the Dixie comes\nWho hit number one of the billboard charts with ... better known drove will like the personal some run up to versions but it was the Nixon comes who made it a wedding day ants what's the record worth the answers right after this\nOne a day for tennis you ready to play a is everything All right this site is ... electric dean knows that allergy congestion can get in a way of enjoying the moment [laughter] go ahead in Pakistan the celebrity helps the brain through congestion\nMan and he's going to be but he may be a better judge you may be a better a better justice just because of what has happened here and what has been in full view of the public\nOr it's entirely possible I I uh we we will find out and of course Supreme Court justices do have a habit of sometimes the surprising is\nA few people who saw the confirmation for example of John Roberts says the chief justice would have guessed that he would be the deciding vote on the other question of whether or not Obamacare was attacks and therefore constitutional so ah as I say you just often do not know and um\nWell that's that's what make our life exciting that's why you should be ah obviously always listening to the gym ...

tweet correct\nRight but they didn't correct in the tweet that incorrect to say why they deleted it or why was incorrect they it and here's the the I guess if you call it a correction\nBut a a tweet that came later after they deleted it we'd deleted a tweet that did not accurately reflect the context context of Lindsey Graham's quote in the blow video clip and that's all they put\nA I I bet you\nThat a month from now I'll hear of that we will get\nDepending on you know what happens with the type of thing but I bet\nWe will get emails and commute different communications from people on

report from the White House the background check on Kavanaugh\nA which the Senate will see a tomorrow no cooperation of sexual misconduct allegations\nOr into the report from the the source report by the way by the way somebody wrote me the other day and it was really great they said what do you mean when you say sourced report\nAnd that's a legit question I'm Glad that that they not an official statement from you know whatever it's done in the British or right it's not it's not a person and and I explained a missing sources say and it means nobody will go on the record and tell you what it is so they use the source\nOf it that's what a source story is where you don't have a name you just simply say sources in the White House say\nUh but uh they report a again a Wall Street journal had it was where I saw a purse or that uh the uh a\nBackground check on cabin on no cooperation of sexual misconduct allegations was the cloture vote still are set for friday yes okay except for friday\nAnd ah they could have a now some reports saying a a a a broad vote could come as soon as Saturday\nBut I think uh at least a couple of organizations were reporting that ah it's more likely that it would have either late Saturday or Sunday they could actually do a vote on Sunday I'm guessing they're going to want to get this done as soon as possible so I Would look if I were\nIf [laughter] if I were Chuck Todd I Would not miss work on Saturday [laughter]\nSo the the entire ah I I think this entire thing it's it's interesting because if the confirmation happens the cloture vote will on friday will tell them essentially the headcount\nWill tell them if they've got the fifty and with fifty they can the vice president could be the the fifty one to break the tie if they've got fifty on friday they're not going to wait a moment I think if they get to that fifty or plus I think they're going to do that vote on Saturday\nSo we'll we'll see if that happens but if you've got

whole get in your face or as they call it going direct approach\nAnd you you can't you can't have that\nIf you want to have a group if you want to go out and protest if you want to have a voice no problem\nBut running up to senators in a hallway right now is likely not going to be tolerated by Capitol Hill security\nUh you know that I was telling you are in our pre show meeting about uh ice or that the uh the uh apparently\nIt's the the union and the ice union is asking the mayor of Portland, Oregon to give up control the city's police department\nSent letters Wednesday morning requesting federal and state investigations over his handling of the Occupy ice protest uh this uh summer you remember they lasted for weeks for sea ice office in the city to shut down the national ice council union that represents ice officers says the mayor\nFueled the confrontations by expressing support for the protesters and in public and private statements made clear to police it they were to stand down ignoring some nine one one calls from agency employees being managed by protesters\nCouncil told attorney general Jeff Sessions that Mr wheelers directives violated those employees civil rights\nLeaving them without protections he is required to provide in separate letter to the Oregon attorney general the ice council attorney said the mayor broke state laws against official misconduct by telling police to ignore ongoing crimes among the protestors\nSo I mean that's that's the point where it's getting you know right now mhm that ... you know that the the belief is ice believes in\nAnd and they're going to have to you know the uh of course ... you know make their points solve it I mean they're asking ah the the the the mayor to what to do it we'll see you you know we'll see where this this whole thing goes but that's what they believe is happening that now you got politicians stating\nWell look if you disagree with me on us at a particular issue\nWell then we're not going to protect you\nWere going to remove right the police were going to tell the police to stand on we're going to tell them no you protect those protesters you don't protect these protesters were going to protect your you're going to protect those protesters and those people that are actually committing crimes against other government entities\nAnd are in in in timid dating and uh uh ...\nUh uh the people's trespassing doing the wrong thing and we're going to tell them to stand down and we're going to tell them not to do their job you ask words going that's where it's going

well ... well the entire point is is is to make sure there's not a leak bought a here's the question if you don't leak it out if you don't make it public\nDo you end up\nHanding it right or another

six Ninety red ideas are currently and ah I'm Gary McNamara\nSo uh a couple of stories here uh this from a NPR amid Kavanaugh's confirmation battle democratic enthusiasm edge evaporates\n... uh\nJust over a ... a month away from my bridges directly from NPR up on the critical elections across the country\nThe wide democratic enthusiasm advantage that has defined twenty Eighteen campaign at this point has disappeared\nAccording to a new NPR PBS NewsHour Marist Poll in July there was a ten point gap between the number of Democrats and Republicans saying the ... a November election we're very we're very important\nNow that's down to two points a statistical tie\n\nDemocrats advantage on which party's candidates are more likely to support has been cut in half since the last month\n\nOr the

I guess the early part of the momentum for the modern day Tea Party\nIn two thousand nine you know as you as a around it a\nTax day in two thousand nine and then into the summer when the rally started happening and everything else\nI still even at its height I still can't say that it was this\nKind of one directional motivating passion because there were a number of things being kind of been worked out and the Tea Party along the way and then then it you know you had some Tea Party candidates and everything else\nBut at its height at its peak\nI Can't say for certain that it was this kind of motivation across the board I think it was big but\nThis is what this is different\nBecause of the culture that's being created by the left and the media on the left\nThis is this is different than an objection to high taxes and and things that are very real here this is a a behavior\nA pattern of behavior by the left that's being very clearly demonstrated over and over again and I remember a other\nIntense times that were based on a particular issue and uh for example after the twenty sixteen election\nWhen when uh a W was talking about uh you know the bridge loan mhm uh\nAnd you had and and and even before that right before the election or you had the the the passion when they talked about a bailout and you know in ... but that wasn't\nUnification there were people there was an intensity there that existed\nMcCain fined gold you and I were working together or not McCain Feingold became Kennedy right right uh the immigration bill and that was a that was a that is when they you know blue the phones out of the ... of Capitol Hill you remember that one I read\nThat was on a specific topic yeah I the ...\nSame thing ... right that's yet are short lived yeah sure sure like this this is different because it is about Kavanaugh ... but it isn't just about Kavanaugh right this this this isn't about this isn't really about Trump\nAnd and reading right here it says but rather than a Wall Street journal or interesting that they write this the same day that you know ... ... the same week that you know you and I are having the same thought going while those the never conservatives the capping off fight isn't about Trump we're all deplorable now", "show_name": "The Jim Bohannon Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Johnson City", "day": "06"}
