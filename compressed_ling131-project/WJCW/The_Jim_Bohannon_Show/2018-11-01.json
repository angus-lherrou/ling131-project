stop a group of illegal immigrants from entering the country he told reporters at the White House today but he is not using the issue to try to score political points\nNot fear mongering at all immigration is a very important subject the Democrats have less immigration there are countries get out of control with horrible not allow\nYou know Seventy vote forget that we need democratic votes to save the immigration laws avid given us any votes the additional\nHave said that\nLet's see if you're kind of off the beaten path with what you would put in your top one or two I mean I like a lot of the Hershey stuff they're not in here almost anywhere and I think they make a great products\nBut three of the top five are all with peanut butter in them or peanuts or a peanut their evidence and\nYou know with the all the stuff that's going on and some of the correct with peanut allergies and the like that's amazing isn't it\nSo eight five five eight six six fifty Jim bode that'll get you to me down to your down oh one other thing about Halloween I'm looking at a\nPiece and I've said this for years you know Halloween used to be a kids' holiday and I think it's still should be a kids' holiday but\nAny number of millennials may be a guy wrote a piece recently it's become so popular among adults don't refuse to grow up so they're the ones that are\nProposing it shouldn't be an adult holiday and that's where the trouble comes in with some of the costuming and all that adults and trying to top each other versus the half decent costume go out with your kid and have fun isn't it this you should be a low key holiday in other words you didn't have all these preparations all these worries all these cultural appropriation\nThat you might do with a costume and here's another thing here in Philadelphia I don't know where\nYou are and I wanted to ask this about Halloween did you ever keep your kid home on the day at Halloween\nBecause in Philadelphia I'm looking at any number of public schools and apparently these are Latino parents that might be evangelical or something they keep their kids home\nBecause they're afraid is going to be a Halloween parade or kids are going to wear Halloween costumes now you have every right to do that as a parent but the school as a centrally dropped Halloween celebrations I used to be a nice thing now you have a team of ACLU lawyers and then some on the right\nThere if you're doing any then you've got to worry about the allergy and saying anything related then you have the food police with Halloween the one shining group out of this the one good ID I saw this year in Halloween\nThat jumps out of me have you seen this the ... people have put these gigantic candy converters out there what they are are a um big vending machine a huge vending machine I think there's only one but maybe there's a couple of more\nA ... and this was released in Terry town in New York it allows people to trade in substandard candy they don't want addict candy converter you put it in a ... whatever it is a the the machine takes it and gives you back receipts peanut butter cops\nI'm not sure if it's the larger the chintzy size or whatever nudge genius for your product\nSo what are some of the worst things you've ever gotten on your Halloween you can remember that and what are you giving away the night while also talk this hour though too about President Trump clearly sending a message making immigration at all levels of legal immigration the issue what's wrong with this it's a legitimate issue\nThe other side says it just plays into fears to join the other side's in his to the Koch brothers now conservatives get all the baggage of the Koch brothers they're kind of like the conservative Soros baggage\nAnd yet these guys are the Paul Ryan type of Republicans Paul Ryan and the president feuding over this immigration stuff and we'll get to the with a great guess and I\nWill get to the fourteenth amendment and what it really means versus what apparently Democrats and Paul Ryan wanted to end the Koch brothers want it to mean so all that's going on as we turned toward the midterms and you may be feeling oh my God the midterms ever be here when is this going to end\nIt is the most consequential midterms that I've seen it truly is what's gonna happen if Nancy Pelosi and it may not be blows he takes over and Maxine Waters in these others is two years of fighting that will make the last two years look mild\nAnd there's a story out there today and I talked to Andy McCarthy who's my ... the national review guy does he think there's any credibility to this it appears that a lot of people are starting to believe\nThat robbery mowers already subpoenaed the president of the United states around the so called Russian collusion or one other item then I'll start to take calls with your your ... your Dana from Philadelphia talk radio twelve\nThan I think the greatest on Halloween the greatest horror movie ever because it's not the stupid gory tight yeah there's some Gore in there but it's more than that is in the news because the steps for The Exorcist remember those steps in Washington\nAnd they look like

he said to me I'm thinking of quitting ... now the Republicans have control of Congress and the first time in forty years\nBecause the economy should explode\nAnd it did in year two thousand before the election I spent over a hundred hours investigating to find out if it was true or not what he had to say\nIt was proved to write so since two thousand eight sixteen election of Donald Trump the stock market started to explode because both houses and the presidency was in the hands of Republicans\nAnd this is the fact that one reason why it's done so well is because of them when Democrats or control of government welfare gross but when Republican ... control the economy booms\nWell that's exactly right thank you we've seen it before but people like Reagan and we see it now with Trump and

Central America\nRepublicans want strong borders no crime no chaos and know caravans [noise]\nAre but they were some concern that there was a not for proper constitutional authority for enacting such a statute that was a bit of a stretch under the powers of the thirteenth amendment and so one of the principal reasons we get the fourteenth amendment is to both\nUm validate that act and also put it into the constitution so it couldn't be changed or when when political winds change the dynamic in Washington DC in Congress\nAnd that's right and to a doctor people have seen the Lincoln film whether it's accurate or not that he did the Emancipation Proclamation but he needed to kind of fire because he was smart enough to realize things like that can go away whereas the amendment will not go away easily\nRight and everybody at the time understood that what they were doing with the fourteenth amendment was caught a following that civil rights act of Eighteen fifty six and like I said it was very clear anybody born in the United states and not subject to any foreign power are citizens\nThey made a change in the language and the fourteenth amendment because they had gotten into some problems with recognizing that the Indian tribes were not foreign powers they were domestic powers\nAnd so they switched the language around a little bit to handle that situation and he when he born in the United states and subject to its jurisdiction are citizens it meant the same thing it was just more broad now to cover Indian tribes as well as foreign nations\nAnd what's come up now listeners two are probably savvy to this or they will be hearing this the drunk part of this is they said well the Supreme Court has ruled is that the other particularly this case of these legal immigrants who were Chinese and their child right and that's the one that's going to be the most cited\nThat's the one most cited as the only well it's the only Supreme Court decision going the other way there are two Supreme Court decision to only my way or earlier before that case but Eighteen Ninety eight one can mark a United States versus long Kmart or to Chinese immigrants they had become lawful permanent resident here to use our modern language\nLegally dom asylum in this country to use the phrase and use at the time that meant that they had\nThey were essentially a green card holders you know we didn't have green cards at the time but that's what their status\nMatt um and they had they had demonstrated their commitment to this country the only reason they weren't already citizens as we ... we we\nAre in a signed a fairly notorious treaty with the emperor and China that didn't recognize their ability to leave a the Chinese emperors feudal lord ship over them um but we had let them do everything shy of becoming citizen they were clearly\n... here in the United states\nSo the notion that the holding in that case actually I'm\nA stand for the proposition that anybody born here no matter the circumstance people born to temporary visitors or who have overstayed their visas or the worst people who have never been in this country lawfully in the first place are automatically citizens that their cases holding doesn't stand for that proposition that all\nKnow exactly right in um you'll give us in a moment I thought it was fascinating I guess it speculative a little bit of how it's evolved how we got to this point one of the things is justice Brennan\nWho was very very liberal very much progress of a driving force I guess in the Warren Court in his notes in uh Nineteen fifty two case that I've seen here he he apparently wrote something along these lines but it wasn't the holding of the court and it was that was it was\nIt was an infamous case Nineteen eighty two is called ... versus do and that's where\nA justice Brennan for the court\nHeld that a Texas had to provide free public education to illegal immigrants\nUh and then he dropped a foot noted says the fact that they're illegal doesn't make them any different than the people who are born here to those illegal immigrants and they're clearly citizens well I mean that that was not an issue in that case it's just a throwaway footnote it's not a holding and yet somehow people say oh that his ratified the\nBroad reading of the old one Kmart and it's\nAmazing how you told us something the other day that I've written I've told several people about how did we get to the point though we're in actuality we allow this with this kind of ... what do you think happened\nWell you know I I mean I've been debating this with people for Fifteen Years and I said look if one can mark means what you say it does then we would have expected to see uh the children of illegal immigrants were others being treated as citizens are fairly shortly after that case came down and Eighteen Ninety eight\nAnd yet and yet in the Nineteen twenties or Congress passes a law that give citizenship to Native Americans um that wouldn't have been necessary if they already had citizenship under the constitution\nWe have a whole guest worker program in the Nineteen twenties that ends with the great depression and those those guest workers from foreign countries are repatriated back to their home countries sometimes forcibly which\nIs a which is a you know dark chapter and all that but but\nThey had kids while they were here and not nobody raised the claim that their children were citizens certainly somebody would have raised that claim if if if this notion had been in place the same was true Thirty years later with the ... program and the Nineteen fifties early sixties nobody raised the claim of child citizenship when those folks\nAre when the program ended in those folks were sent back home so what what I've been able to discover is that there was a change in the regulations for applications for a passport\nThat occurred in Nineteen sixty seven prior to that if you were born in the United states you filled out a one forum\nFor an application for a passport if you were born abroad you feel about a different form on the on the forum for people who were born in the United states you had to say where you were born and if that was what one can mark stood for that that was enough to make you a citizen the passport form wouldnt have needed any additional information and yet\nIt goes on at length and asks about your parents status where where they Thomas filed wherever they born all of which to show whether you were truly fully subject to the jury and\nUh that none of that was it was necessary at one Kmart stands for what the ... the the the\nBirthright citizenship crowd thinks that does\nThat change the Nineteen sixty\nSeven when they when they deleted that part of the farm [laughter] I I there's there's no explanation I've been able to come up with on why there is no change in the law Congress there's no executive order there's no court decision they just change the regulation and I'm I'm convinced it was well maybe we want to get rid of all that extraneous stuff so we can fit the forest\nOne page or something I don't know I\nMake tremendous sense I think we've cracked the case and
