{"month": "10", "state": "TN", "station": "WJCW", "content": "When I took over we hit the ground running wave raised a record money we put over five hundred staff on the ground and twenty eight states we train twenty five thousand field organizers said five times more than we did in twenty sixteen to turn out are about and today I'm here in Arizona campaigning for a landmark as Peter said\nWhich will be one of the battleground at a districts in the country to determine who holds the majority and so if you want Nancy Pelosi back in the the leadership you're going to vote Democrat and get that and she said I'm going to shut it down and I'm going to raise taxes\nIf you put a Republican back in the leadership you're going to keep this historic comeback going for our country and that's why people like Lee and Marquez Peterson and what a great leadership is I mean she is the head of the Tucson Hispanic Chamber she's a businesswoman or she will be such a great way in Congress and represent Arizona I thought well\nYou know I saw something today Rona that said that the the the for all of the stuff that's going on with the Democrats and you know the way the the victim and fatality and all of these kinds of things and trying to bring in all these people of color they're struggling and a lot of ways with Latino voters I talked to a dreamer last night or are we talked for a good hour\nAnd he said you know minus the dreamer thing and he thinks oddly enough that he believes Trump is actually the one who's going to end up getting dark and stuff actually done he said you don't mind is that the that a lot of Latino voters they don't look at the Democrats the way that I think they think that they should in all\n[noise] no and I think Hispanic voters Latino voters they recognize that unemployment\nIn the Hispanic community is that the lowest that had been in history people who own small businesses which so many people have come to this country especially in the span of community own small business as they are seeing growth on their businesses are able to hire more people because of deregulation because of a booming economy and that's coming because of Republican\nPolicies and Democrats you know the president has reached out to Democrats he's willing to work with them they have just rip off him at every level\nThe only way you're going to get bipartisanship in Washington now it's actually reject the resistant obstruct play but that the Democrats have been running for two years and when they lose using that playbook they will have to come to Washington to work with President Trump and then I think we will get immigration\nReform and and deal with the dreamers at all the things that so many people what taking care of from their leaders and the and the nation's capital\nSo we look around the country and the gym you know from the the battleground here in Arizona with Mitch Sally and cinema and taking over flake seat to what's going on with with crews and ... you wrote hide camp who's just pretty much over and done but\nWhat are some other races we should be watching that may surprise some people\nYou know because again the whole number of things the polls that that kind of a lot of people now step back and say I don't really believe all those polls look what happened on you know in November of two years ago with Trump so we can't buy under those what are some races where maybe it doesn't look good but the reality is on the ground you're hearing something different\n[noise] well I think Minnesota's state to watch right now that Senate seat there you've got Karin Housley running against enough methods so that's going to be a really interesting race she the\nWife of a former NFL hockey an NHL Hockey player and it's a state that President Trump only lost by forty five thousand votes so there are some house seats their New Jersey Bob here again running against Menendez\nThere's a lot of races across the country that I'm looking at that\nThere could be some prizes that surprises but most importantly we have to like Martha ... at the Senate we have to re elected to the to be your governor and we have to elect Leah Marquez Peterson and Wendy Rogers and Debbie Lesko and these great representative in Arizona\nYou know it's it is as I sit here and talk to you who you are you the truth of the Republican National committee and people would say to me you know you'll have somebody like Ron on why don't you have somebody on the on the Democratic side I started off or doing all the time that I've asked me I've asked I send them to come on a hundred times you want a vast everybody from the Democratic side\nI've got my bookers working on come on I'll give you a platform I'm not even all asked you questions you could throw it out there I'm not here to spend it and the reality is that they don't want to do it and it it boggles my mind\nWill because they're running as one thing because the end they'll govern as another and send them as the classic example I mean Arizona is really need to go look at her record and some of the things she's right on and that\nAnd and what she's writing it now she's running at the moderate ... are going to watch where I work with Republicans no she well she absolutely well she just wants to help them keep the majority and and that's the game they playing all across the country will run it one thing and then we'll go to Washington and do whatever Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi tell us to do and that's\nThe most important thing otherwise they come on you're shall and they share\nWhat they're writing on and they talk about their records and they take the tough questions but if she comes died in fighting back I'd love to ask her why [laughter]\nYeah well I doubt that's going to happen interesting we've tried everything and and again not just\nYou know ... you're not just an Arizona nationwide we've we've read everything with and none of them seem to want to come on and talk and I'm always one for talking and I think it's great when we can sit there and have a conversation and doesn't have to be a debate and\nYou get your eyes out your ... your message out there and and your voice out there I'll let it happen but a lotta times I get frustrated because they won't come on and people say why don't you I drive they don't want to uh run amok

world today as well including of course the midterm elections now old so close so let's talk first with Ron in Springfield, Missouri hello Ron\nHello Jim it's good to talk to you in jail as a wonder ... does do touch on the booth path that they had to fight lacking forty six forty seven and Germany\nAll right for those who do we do is it's basically a the ss concentrates on these war criminals\nUm and not the resistance and all and all of that kind of stuff\nThat the problem with with writing a broad base book on World War two this was the third World War two and a killing serious weighty killing a rising sun where we do with the Japanese war crimes um but nobody there and got away nobody was helping the Japanese\nAre killing ... and now killing the ss is that there's so much material and so much new material because the Israeli government helped us with this book and opened up files\nMassage files which is why we were able to do is step by step on the Eichmann kidnapping by the uh Israeli agents when we take you through that\nBy minute and the reason we're able to do that is because we got\nThe primary source material from the Israeli government so I I concentrate on that kind of stuff to bring the reader brand new things that are really I think important to know\nYep uh for the record what Ron was talking about that would be the resistance or are you will the semi guerilla warfare that occurred in Germany that after the ... which is a good story but it's not the story\nIt's not this story and and the resistance to be honest in Germany was very very slight yeah I mean and uh the Americans thought it was going to be a lot more and in the Soviet sectors they just shot everybody so much resist not\nNot not a great deal though now in regard to uh\nUh the Adolf Eichmann the situation yeah what what was the biggest surprise you learned about that we know of course of the Israelis tracked him to Argentina and eventually they they uh they captured ... and brought him out of the country and of course he'll that the trial in Israel\nFor the broad outlines had been out there what was the biggest had slap are the biggest\nWow I never would have thought that moment that you got in talking with the Israelis about this\nWell he didn't have any money Eichmann was broke and and the Israelis were stunned because as I mentioned Odessa out a lot of money\nAnd was able to funnel goal to a lot of the says people but I meant parents didn't have any um he had his family over there and his wife over there yet uh in in Argentina is as sons has two sons and they were like normal people um he worked in a Mercedes Benz factory and weighing the SARS\nUm and he never ever thought he was going to get caught because he had gotten away he had established residency you there for a dozen years I'm tooling around and you know finally the Israelis got him a because his son was dating a Jewish girl\nIn Argentina and the Jewish girl's father locked in\nOn it I meant and and said that you know figured it out and then the father contacted a one of the heroes and the book a prosecutor in Germany with the information that's how they got onto him so um there's a lot of those little things that people have no idea what how does it happen and\nHow did the angel of debt Joseph mangled ... really die and we put you right there he died he had a heart attack\nWhen he was swimming off the coast of Brazil and they pulled his body are buried in the grave where there was NO NAME on it and again they got the the people who help angle and that's how they find the grave yeah\nA Nick calls in Decatur, Illinois for Bill O'Reilly on the bow Hannah Joe hello Nick\nHi Andrew go a long time listener\nUh I wanted to ask bill or what he where he thinks a\nNot pardon the pun but where the less ... what will the less ... less if they lose the\nMidterms and you know of like a red wave or red suit on me and it's they've losing losing the federal courts the Supreme Court and you know at some point in people towards the federal courts and where does he think where does that leave them\nOr the press yeah so\nThe press very powerful a press that is a in some ... with the far left progressive movement that's not going to change\nI'm On the election front I think that uh if you look at real clear politics which is a good website to go if you want facts and not speculation it looks like the Republicans will pick up two Senate seats\nUm it's impossible to predict the house anybody who says they can is lying to you\nBecause each house races unique and it depends on money the Kennedys having money how they come across [noise]\nUm I don't believe that there's going to be any landslide or anything like that but I couldn't predict what's gonna happen in the house the Senate I'm fairly confident we'll stay in Republican and it's\nToo many democratic seats that are being defended twenty five of the thirty three right\nAnd and and there's a there's a backlash I really believe there's a backlash after the cabinet stuff\nThat people independent voters independent voters which always make the difference they didn't like that exposition they did not like it and um you know the Democratic senators they took their shot I think it failed and I think they're going to pay a price in three weeks\nIt'll be interesting to see goodness knows certainly uh you have a lot of people who are motivated by the the Kavanaugh hearings I'm Wondering since anger is often a prime motivator since the Democrats lost\nI'm Wondering if they are perhaps not even more motivated Republicans of course we're angry at the treatment of Kavanaugh but they won\nYou say I think that there's a growing feeling that the presumption of innocence in this country is uh in in jeopardy and I think that will motivate I'm conservative Republicans to get out\nI also think the Democrats are going to have a hard time motivating black Americans in Hispanic Americans to go to the polls\nI don't think they had a a horse and the Kavanaugh saying um I think that uh the Democrats are counting on this anti Trump wave\nBut at the economy is booming for every one that takes a lot of the edge off that anti Trump stuff so um you know again it's impossible to predict\nThere is anger but there's also you know let me give you an example Jim and is it pretty vivid example of what I'm Talking about here with the rise of evil in this country after Kavanaugh is confirmed and the day that he was confirmed\nA writer for the cold there program put out a tweet that said okay well maybe he got the Supreme Court job but at least we ruined his life\nYeah okay that by the way the bill is done in ...

before his confirmation cabinet wrote an op ed piece for the wall Street Journal and which he wrote\nAt times my testimony both in my opening statement in response to questions\nReflected by overwhelming frustrations that being wrongly accused without corroboration of horrible conduct completely contrary to my record and character my statement and that's where it's also reflected my deep distressed at the unfairness of how this allegation has been handled unquote\nWell let's see how the liberal establishment accepts that apology in regard to the judicial temperament of one Brett

college level you you put on a show that really gets me in so\nMany different directions at night my comments and I was going to\nBe I just wonder how bloody October is going to end up to be because of the way that Democrats wait for the last minute start sleeping on the wall and seeing what sticks\nWell as we speak of course we are a just a wrapping up the or the night of October the sixteenth a and heading into October the seventeenth so if there's going to be an October surprise fill you raise a very good point uh we just have a few days and wish to do that what do you think\nOf it well Twenty one days it seems like a whole long time that could be three lifetimes\nIn the political war it's just a war and I just don't understand how Trump to survive as well as the as I just don't know who is backing Trump to the point where every time he turns around he comes out smelling like a rose what steps in them and\nWell I I don't know that he always comes out smelling like a rose but uh but often enough and I certainly agree with you that uh uh the traditional a viewpoint of course the conventional wisdom on such things especially with an opponent that is apparently willing to do or say virtually anything\nOr that there will be some kind of last minute surprise the point obviously have an October surprise is that you don't really have time to respond so we'll see it it wouldn't surprise me\nI have to uh honestly look at at Robert Mueller member Robert Mueller and have talked about him quite a while uh [laughter] I always said that that would go away and not with a bang but a whimper uh but uh at the moment you know we haven't heard from him in a in a heck of a long time is Mahler going to have something did he ever have anything\nAh I I think we can certainly put to rest any thoughts about some kind of a a Trump campaign collusion with the Russians which of course was his rationale for even having an investigation and the first place\nBut the uh fill in the kennel work I think that you are you raise a very good point when is the other shoe going to drop and who will drop it what do you think\nWell I'm thinking of the documents disclosed I made the Twenty one twenty pages of their release Trump releases mowers done\nWell I I Would I Would have to think that the mother a ought to be done in one way or the other uh because he clearly has that has come up with nothing he is indicted a handful of people\nWho may have in fact trends grass but it has nothing to do with the Trump campaign or ... with the Russians he's invited a few Russians who of course we'll never see the inside of a U.S courtroom\nUh basically he has a\nHas come up as far as I can see with nothing uh so I don't know anybody else have thoughts or be feel free to join in but of course Phil also noted quite correctly three weeks from tonight\nIs election night three weeks and by the way a will be having complete coverage of course over many of these same stations and that we

it this way the right to always does three to six percent better than the prediction is\nNinety eight percent it's not a hundred percent always like in Israel that terrorists labor was getting away same thing because the media is extremely left in America that Ninety six percent or something like that the same thing goes is true in Israel and ... there's no question we're going to win what what\nCabin on they don't have Eric Eric's I think his name is on his blog then you have a bread Stevens from the New York times used to ride in the wall Street Journal and other no Trump or know
