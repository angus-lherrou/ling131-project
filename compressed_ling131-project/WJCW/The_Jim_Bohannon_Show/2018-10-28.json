{"month": "10", "state": "TN", "station": "WJCW", "content": "Why is it that comes to ... seems to be more common as we age\nYeah there are several reasons one is as we age we tend to be on medication as they get older that they may not be on\nWhen they're younger the other thing that I ... I meant to touch upon and thanks for the mind thing they is more sedentary lifestyle so if you're not as physically active that also has adverse effects on your digestion so you know if we're less active as we age people's particularly spending a lot of time sitting\nThat can lead to more difficulties with comes to a patient so how do we help these people yeah so I approach things multiple area we always talk about the importance of diet scanning dietary fiber and we'd really like people to get in the range of\nTwenty eight to thirty grams of day\nMost people in in the United states probably get twelve to Fifteen grams a day so not as much fiber it I'd have to yeah it's a struggle\nBut with a conscious effort that can happen the other thing is making sure that they are staying hydrated and choosing fluid that such as water\nThat are going to help with your digestion and data things that asked more as a diabetic and make you urinate such as like caffeinated beverage it make you you're in a more so little caffeine is good it can stimulate your belt\nBut a lot of caffeine will have a direct effect and ill urine eat more and there will be less flew to fail a vote for your digestive system so the first thing is to talk about diet and hydration\nAnd then I talked about sleep wake cycle because our colon is that most active in the morning when we wake up just like we have our sleep wake cycles as part of our circadian rhythms\nAre about to have a similar read them and you're colon is that it's most after it in the morning and that's why most people have about living in the morning\nWhat can be done to accentuate that eating a meal do not skip breakfast breakfast is the most important meal for people who are struggling with cell problem another reason why breakfast is so important yes and that's how we talk about that and\nA medication in general really usually start with\nAn over the counter lax attached such as just plain old magnesium salts can be very helpful but you can get over the counter and\nThen we might talk about the occasional use is necessary\nFor the stimulant lax it as like physical at all for it uh the is seven and I'm a depending on what somebody's needs are so we kind of step it up but the first thing I really like to get at is giant physical activity staying hydrated\nAnd if you don't certainly are uncomfortable but what can happen if you don't address on it comes to patient\nYes certainly you're uncomfortable and a lot of people experienced pain and bloating and\nSometimes even nuts yeah an upper GI symptoms people who have reflux have reflux symptoms can get worse if you're comes to a patient is poorly controls in so that can lead to a lot of distress\nBut as you touched upon there can be problems with the public for like hammer riots or which can be painful they can believe that they can also get from both which is a very painful conditioning requires surgery\nThere can also be from straining the development and you know Fisher's which again can be it can be a very painful it will cry advises yeah a little cracks\nHere in the canal which can be very very uncomfortable and can take weeks to eat and sometimes a couple months here we have to worry about training and stuff like like in ... in the women\nWho are either the bladder the rectum actually come outside the body\nDoesn't mean that necessarily come outside the ... county outside the body and the worst case scenario that they're all her around that sometimes things can fill that too many and still be inside the body but you know current problems with pressure or feeling of incomplete brought it and the the type of thing\nSo I Know that sounds very good you know so that things to do before you may need to try to do this or other medications are twenty to thirty grams of fiber per day critical\nHydrate exercise and don't skip breakfast absolutely All right we've been talking about chronic comes to a patient with Mayo

though but doesn't it makes sense okay obviously no you know the lower the price of steel the better the U.S is in the aggregate in the higher US GDP goes I mean I think everybody even Bernie Sanders would agree with that\nBut the maybe Bernie would have been burned he's nuts but but it may be net and below sea what but the issue is doesn't it make sense some time because there's so much dislocation that continues to be associated with the laws of ...\nThe jobs doesn't make sense politics aside all the ... the ... doesn't it make sense to throw a bone to Pennsylvania\nOhio Wisconsin Illinois you know they deserve a bone for all of this litigation\n... we would not be if we agree that it should be thrown at them it should not be by engineering that in the NAFTA deal here's why here's\nWhy does a lot of what is your job a lot of the jobs that have been lost in steel and aluminum have been lost\nBecause of innovation in the industry where this is not the sort of Nineteen sixties where people were sort of in the factories Oregon the we now have new machinery and out of the nation that has really created and taking over those\nJobs are in other words I think our own automation you you would refined the current debate in suggested ... many of the jobs and still have been lost by our own automation not because of the Japanese Mexicans or anything else\nCorrect exactly exactly so ... what I say we need to do is find new ways one first of all it's training we make sure that all individuals are receiving training that they need to play into these new\nFields that are going to because even within automation and within innovation there are people who still need to over ... new machinery but we also when we look at tax reform this is why we praise tax reform so good so well is because it allows for the economy to move up and to create new jobs in these new industries\nCreating terrorists to try to punish other countries are for just producing steel is not the right path forward and does not actually throw a ball and to Pennsylvania and Ohio\nOkay so what else steal what else to me what other concerns you have with what Trump is doing oh says he knows he continues to negotiate his new U.S and see what other concerns\nYeah it's a sort of concerns come from the the Mexican side from the U.S sort of the things that they're trying to engineer so they're trying to engineer engineer\nOr some of their minimum wage or into the deal that in order for the U.S to consumer goods from certain companies those companies have to have a certain minimum wage now it's important for people to have a good wages\nBut what is a concern is that now we have a government imposing on private companies how to manage their companies and manage a theory employees what that can actually create is a trickle effect for than these Mexican company\nSo rising the prices on their goods and ... when they exported to the U.S us consumers\nAre going to continue to see those prices rise so we think both on the U.S side the Canada Mexico side impose you know private companies\nUp requirements on wages is not the best free\nMarket of but we think even if you have free trade more\nConsumers war us consumers are going to buy their product and that should allow that company to grow and the employees to see better wages\nLet me ask you this okay so when we look into this now it would seem to me that what Trump may do particularly with steel and aluminum is demagogue the issue but at the end of the day he may be closer to your position in the final agreement than where he is now right in other words Donald Trump maybe he's more concerned with the image and I've had I\nI I had this thought all along as he deals with trade in the Pacific is the deal is with Mexico and Canada deals with the Europeans that a lot of talk about uh raising tariffs and increased protectionism may be more rhetorical than substance at the end of the day do you agree\nSide there's a lot of agreement with what you said I Do think he views it as a tactic\nRight as a saying look at what I'm going to do you have to come to the negotiation table you have to come to a new agreement and in the past it has been difficult to come to the table to do that so we are encouraged again by the stuff that he has taken to begin these negotiations to come to sort of a framework\nWe're hoping that at the end of the day this is a NAFTA agreement that really includes all those free market\nPrinciples however if that is not the end result then it's going to be

but it's not from the ridiculous to the sublime okay American education so many things you know\nWhen you look at the cost\nI don't have parents every day from all over the country they're spending a fortune in states becoming the number one thing at the dinner table worrying about how to spend forty fifty sixty Seventy thousand dollars a year to send a child to college\nJust a four year college is becoming a three hundred thousand dollar proposition I have friends that have kids who do they've got two kids in one Seventy two thousand dollars a year he ...\nHe did do I know violence and the question becomes what are they getting for all this you now have these two please left is dominated campus is worse than ever\nAnd now somebody told me and do they have a ah what was the phrase it say um the chancellor vice chancellor for diversity and under that there are managers of diversity and then under that their diversity experts it turned into a circus has it not\nOh yes there is no question about it and there is a rather direct link between the enormous cost increases in higher education\nAnd the left wing orientation of campuses one of them is that administration and being left wing go together at Harvard University ...\nForty percent for administration fans only about twenty eight percent for actual teaching [noise] the ads Cal Tech which is not an ideological university if five percent of the budget for administration and sold any food as much\nAnd all those administrators are being paid fancy sour is they have huge numbers of assistance and they're not doing any good education in my opinion they're harming it\nAnd that is one big cost\nAnother of course another factor of course is as university has gotten more left wing State University is\nTend to get less money for the state legislatures especially Republicans said legislatures and\nIt made a movie in the state legislators were probably to persuade the universities have become less left wing but they haven't done that they just raised their tuition and therefore college is more expensive at all the state university isn't as well there are a number of other factors like a mansion but they do\nIn fact there is a big change in thirty or Thirty years ago I graduated from the University of Pittsburgh undergrad she had a I don't know if you're familiar with that\nLeft wing of course I Need history but it was I knew was left wing of course but I'll tell you there was always a tradition\nOf free speech never once did I feel you can't speak as you can't write this you can't say that she can't do that everyone was always encouraged to wonderful environment everyone was always encouraged the guy in Thirty years massive change\nRight and that may have been your university experiences well not always certainly has been not the same today let me ask you this you and maybe as well as anyone in the country are better for the answer this question if you're a young conservative\nMan on a a major college campus today talk to me about the seniors in insecurities and threats that young man's feels\nWell keep quiet about her conservatism you probably won't have very much trouble is but if you try to be evil uncle you could get into quite a lot of trouble with your professors and as a matter of fact you can\nGet into a certain amount of trouble with your fellow students too heavy and let us ration wouldn't back you up yet it is scary but there is no question about it and it's gotten worse absolutely every year you know it's gotten worse every year since I got my PHD in Nineteen Seventy seven\nYeah I think that's probably right that if you look at the five democratic held seeds that Republicans think they have a good shot at\nOther looking very strong in North Dakota now they've there's at least one pulled out there showing Kevin Cramer I'm sixteen points on Heidi Heitkamp now uh this whole fiasco with her a listing sexual assault survivors without asking them and some of them weren't even survivors they they they claim they were never assaulted\nHas just really blown up in her face is she's tried to regain some momentum following her vote against Brett Kavanaugh or in Indiana Mike Braun is up by four points in one poll he's down by one and another either way the momentum seems to be\nOn his side are Republicans still have hopes and a couple of other places as well but it's it's proving to be pretty challenging the Democrats not giving up the lead in Montana although it as close a and in Florida bill Nelson's probably got the edge to\nSo Florida it let's sort of Florida are saying is that pretty is that trending that's trending out of reach I'm seeing Nelson moving beyond the margin of error is that most polls are showing him north of for now it's\nEither the last poll I saw was right out for there's been others where he was either in five or six in one even as far as eight points ahead ah I've seen a couple of polls with Rick Scott up one but if you if you mash them altogether looks like a probably bill Nelson's race to lose right now though and this is still very competitive\nSo there is a major development in that race in the last two weeks we will see I think ultimately a there's two major statewide races that are run for Senate which is that one one for governor and I think the governor of race has the most oxygen right now so it's the Gillum dissent is race\nWhich seems to be a Gillum and the lead by a small to healthy margin uh that's probably going to end up driving in influencing the Senate races well\nYou know it's funny Republicans have two decent candidates particularly in the sand is in the in the governor's race but Rick Scott certainly is a sitting governor he's won two races I mean this is this is a two decent candidates I think and yet we're losing\n[noise] that's that's an interesting way to look at it yeah Rick Scott won twice in Florida which is obviously a huge day those are major accomplishments but both of them were\nWere pretty tough victories including one over Charlie Crist rebranded Democrat and a twenty four teams so this was never going to be a cakewalk and Bill Nelson does a pretty good job of staying fairly quiet and uh and then telling\nFolks in Florida that he's doing a good job for them uh uh because he's he's not in the spotlight very much and so folks are tend to believe that and and so there's not a lot of negatives for Bill Nelson as what I'm trying to science of wrecks God's trying to battle against that\nAre in the other rice basically what happened in the in the gubernatorial primary in Florida is is the more conservative and the more liberal candidates won the primary as opposed to the moderates\nOdds truth and and so you you've got the about the two poles going up against each other now and we'll see where the metal comes out right now they seem to be a favoring Andrew Gillum who's a who's definitely a liberal and someone say bordering on social is but uh the right now he's got to live in\nNew Jersey and is it you know I'm seeing an end as elitist shrinking is that just the natural ebb and flow you get closer to the election I'm seeing four and five when I see a pulmonary ... by four maybe I'm tempted to put national money into New Jersey and you think that's foolish\nAll the Democrats are at least some of the special interest groups it's just funny to look at some of these polls like I think the one you're looking at is ah it's cut down to five point\nDominant as fifty one ... sex that tells me if it's fifty one forty six that they're they're pushing people to to to make a decision so if you you took away the leaders\nAh I think that number would be quite a bit smaller because people in the Jersey don't like Bob Menendez he's got a lot of baggage but it's you know we're trying to year and that's a Butte trending state and so the instinct for most voters there to go with the Democrat\nUm it's it's very interesting though but my general rule of thumb is especially this late in the game as even if it's close if you've never seen a poll with the other guy had the guy in that leads probably the guy in the way it\nMakes sense as if we can be bumping into this time for the Republican Party to close its final office pack up shop and just take down to ... New Jersey I think it might be time maybe it's time for that any way\nMontana what's going on in Montana why Montana shouldn't be a red state explained to me why ... why do we use in Montana what's the problem up there\nThat's a fascinating one because John tester kind of like Claire McCaskill in Missouri has not tried to you know win over the moderates by voting for Brett Kavanaugh voting for\nA tax cuts or anything like that he's he's voted like a Democrat and I don't know if he's getting some respect for that he's in the run a lot of ads talking about how you know he's one of them he's a rancher and I think there was one of them where he was a there was a commercial or a video of him you know shooting animals or that\nHe was going to send the processing plant it's hard I mean that's about as red say that this is right there right so\nThat's probably what I mean I just I I I've been expose some of that over the years in Montana and I I just don't see why were we raised after ... there are some things wrong we gotta go we can do they need their consoles involved in those races or something something very wrong in Montana\nWell that that might be a I mean Jon Tester is one two very close race has already this would be a third term\nUh and ultimately well Matt Rosendale as a favorite of conservatives any certainly within striking distance although again he hasn't led also go by that rule of thumb but he's within three to five points in most of these polls\nAre but ultimately what happened here as Donald Trump stole the most likely challenger to Jon Tester this year when he made Ryan Zinke ... secretary and so while that Rosendale or maybe if I conservative I think he was playing being Montana\nInteresting I forgot all about zinc he All right let's take a look McCaskill of Missouri she's going to win again and she says she's going to win again\nIt's tough it's hard to say I have not seen her in the lead in a long time either and so we're going to I'm going to use that ... and the opposite direction this is a state that went by almost twenty points\nFor Donald Trump it is a state that does not real happy with Republicans right now after the governor Greitens a fair and they just shot down a right to work ballot initiative back in August by a very wide margin so\nThere might be some blowback to Trump going on there are ... has a play that's about as carefully as he can maybe careful wasn't the right way to go but he's either tied or slightly ahead and every poll I've seen and Claire McCaskill have not seen her at or near fifty percent\nA in a while so I'm just this last week she had to deal with some fallout over undercover videos from project Vera toss which suggested that she's far more liberal than she is letting out to Missouri voters\nBut I'm ultimately you know it's going to come down to turn out as the Republican base has fired up as the Democrats are going\nTo be taught to heart mountain to cry on their own it but I ended up and they were obviously a month ago\nSomething he writes another state where we need better consult somebody's going wrong in Missouri All right let's look over in the house side now okay the Senate ... overall prediction of the Senate and they were going to be plus one or two or what ... what do you think\nA Dean Heller is looking better in Nevada Arizona I think it's still a big concern for Republicans that's probably the biggest likelihood of a switch from Republican to Democrat I think North Dakota barring a major shift there's likely to go to the Republicans and I got to think they pick up either in Missouri or Indiana so that would be a\nPlus plus three we can do plus three now I'm going to say it's ... I think it's probably gonna be a net of ... swan I think the Democrats probably get at least one of those for\nAbout ... and then the Republicans will get a two or three out of that North Dakota Indiana and Missouri ... what we need to do time in the Senate 'cause we haven't done that in recent weeks the house it friction officers in the house\nYeah the right now a lot of folks are saying it's right on the the dividing line that Democrats have pretty much solidified Fifteen to twenty pick up seats and they need twenty three to win back the majority could go anywhere from about thirty to thirty five maybe even forty F ever really good night\nButton and a lot of these races individually or Illinois a there are for competitive races there all of them trending a little more towards the Republican now some of them with an outright lead even a couple of outside the margin of error I think California is going to be big trouble Pennsylvania is still going to be big trouble New Jersey's going to be big trouble\nI'm In the experts are putting about an eighty percent chance for a democratic takeover of the house I think that's probably right the Republicans need a perfect storm to keep it and in in this environment is probably unlikely\nUsed to find a question do you see a new or you presuming Speaker Pelosi or do you see in December Revolution in their ranks now\nI don't think so I think at least initially she's going to be the speaker she's made some comments lately that uh well she wants to be speaker she's got other things she wants to do like write books and some other things so I think she'll she'll take the gamble just to think that she was vindicated herself and then\nUm and then perhaps a hand it off either after one term of Democrats can maintain control and twenty twenty or if she decides to step down even well Greg ... will\nBe running as that I think you're right as always thank you so much of a tough year next week and everything you want to take them into ... call us seven three seven nine five five three six or seven three seven nine five five three six for taking your emails\nJak bourbon twenty six teenage email Jack Bergman twenty sixteen and she now remember even when we're not on the air you can hear us and see us read all about us to jak burger and radio the gum and of course always in radio America does to see you next week\nTried cities talk radio station am nine WG cw\n[noise]\nSpecial report deadly Pittsburgh shooting I'm Evan Hannah twenty nine criminal charges against\n... custody after a shootout with a SWAT Team police say the suspected gunman shout at all Jews must diocese stormed the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh during Saturday services killing eleven worshipers and wounding six other people including for police officers before he was arrested\nThe first of two vigils to honor and mourn victims of the attack was held a few hours ago in Pittsburgh\nAn imbalance in the micro biome and the bike or by him the very bacteria than having her intestines may be in part responsible for our metabolism separate safely clear why splendor causes insulin resistance but that would be highly ...\nA hundred productive if you're on a low carb diets to help regulate your\nInsulin so the the latest nail in the coffin for artificial sweeteners which in some studies suggest may actually cause weight gain as opposed to weight loss when substituted\nFor sugar cane would you uh oh we have a caller\nWe have Steven from New Jersey Welcome Stephen how are you\nA very good to get\nWhat's your question oh well my question that's a good thing yeah oh that's a good that's a good question what's your question I had a biopsy of white\nOf ah in my mouth 'cause I had something called local place you go down to or lesion I've had it for about seven months to a couple of entities\nImmunologist as well as a cancer in the dock that everyone says it there's nothing wrong with the fact that I have this lesion yeah and they can't seem to they can't seem to a\nClear it up I I Am a controlled diabetic on medication though it's oh\nYeah yeah and I wanted to know if there was any kind of a vitamins or any kind of things that you were in jest\nWell okay so uh ...

T. S. D.\nAnd the problem has been taken up in a bay news articles and in fact many uh movies in popular culture and so it's well known that the TST as prevalent among military veterans\nSo what they discovered is that there's an unusual contributing factor to P. T. S. D.\nWhich is the use of energy drinks energy drinks are huge in the military\nBecause obviously a alertness is at a premium and sometimes the hours are long you can imagine a a a a troops in the field a or a fighter pilots on missions and they have to maintain alertness during long periods of monotony\nAnd sometimes we sleep deprivation [noise] so they actually encourage energy drinks they deliver pallets of energy drinks to troops on bases and troops who\nWere deployed and so they did a survey and they found that a sixty percent of soldiers in this study a reported continuing consume two or more energy drinks per day in the in the post deployment period a more than Seventy five percent of soldiers consumed energy drinks\nBut the surprised with the people kept drinking him long after the point you cause their hook it there's tons of caffeine in there and um they have names like rip it are often referred to overseas as quote crack it provides\nImmediate jolt service members look for it as like physical and cognitive performance\nAnd so they did a study and study a sound that I'm\nA key finding was the mental health problems I depression anxiety ... GST and alcohol misuse were strongly associate with high levels of energy drink use\n'em 'cause these these energy drinks they just jangle your nerves are the data from the study also suggested energy drink uses strongly associate with aggressive behaviors\nAnd aggressive behaviors they say can be problematic because of the link to risky behaviors and unhealthy habits relationship problems intend to harm others and suicidal behaviors and oh by the way the big\nTake home message and this is important this is important energy drink use was associated with\nReady for this fatigue\nIs that because the people were fatigued and then they use the energy drinks to alleviate fatigue the more energy drinks people used the more fatigued there were\nSo um they say this finding standard contracts with the marketing of energy drinks as a way to increase energy reduced fatigue\nUm news outlets in lawsuits have challenged whether such claims are valid but our findings these are the study authors call into question the often cited rationale for using energy drinks\nWhich is due alleviate fatigue they ultimately it's like you know using a plastic you know to buy things with you know if you expand your credit you end up\nWith a negative balance and negative balanced and cash the analogy negative balance in energy you just keep pushing down pushing down pushing down an accelerator and ultimately\nYou're going to be depleted\nSo they say energy drinks may lead to an increase in mental health problems aggression and fatigue\nAnd uh this is an issue that needs to be addressed in the military but also think of our young people because they just loved\nJug ah those energy drinks that I'm ultimately\nMay undermine their physical and mental health eight seven seven Seventy six eight

CNN the one side to CNN yes the one that was sent to to CNN was um\nUh the powder was harmless and but when you read the actual Associated Press story and you and I are looking each other's said man you've got to parse everything these days yeah you've got to be very careful ... ... it says the powder the outer right will Souder along with the bomb right that was in it it was a ... there's ...\nThere's nowhere in the story or any other source that we've seen that says that authorities say that the or any stores says that the a suspicious package\nThat was sent there the explosive device potentially explosive device was was harmless ... it's just the powder the powder according to a source\nRight at an early in the day the NYPD had bad\nThat the uh the the the ... there was the the the suspected\nPipe bomb and another powder right mhm which was you know whether whether it would be you know I I don't know rice\nWould they suspected it might be right center you know who knows and um\nBut it that that turned out to be harmless National Review has the story that both Obama and the powder are harmless were\nHarmless and we looked at you know who they source for that which was Associated Press an Associated Press nowhere in their says yeah that the that their sources of the bomb was was harmless but we don't know whether the bottom was harmless or not because from\nWhat I've seen and what I read the FBI has not come out and said these were bomb no no these were lie bombed ready to go off the suspicious\nIn nature um and and so you know potentially harmful devices these are the phrase is they've been using the authorities have been using but the media's been using because the ... what is the media do inevitably they bring on as they are covering this live they bring on you know somebody who was an explosives expert\nAnd then they look at it except they're not on site looking at it they have no idea what they're looking at really except for what it appears to be\nAnd and so the the the point being is that we have no idea what's going on here so I suppose it is somebody that supports the president\nAnd the Republicans\nWhile you just heard the side that you support if that's right that's\nFound out we have no idea what it is but if that's the case and that somebody who just write a less than two weeks before a major election\nYou just hurt their chances\nAnd and by the end and so when you you look at it as we said I mean this is a ... and we've said this all along but there was a rush Russian collusion or a case like this we look at it from the investigator's point of view and if you're an investigator and you're looking at something like this ah and you know some of the questions that you're thinking of\nA based on the fact that you have a lack of information and nobody has said that these were actually lie bombs where you say okay\nUh when we find out if they were\nYou know live bombs ... well then you know that without question was an attempt to\nKill these people that would end so right you go from it from you go from it from that point of view trying to figure that out\nIf it was they find out that none of the bombs were active\nThat none of the bombs had any potential of going off\nThen you look you would be looking I Believe that two different things you if you're looking at it from an investigator's point of view which would be All right this was a scare tactic to either scare these people or it was political in nature mhm it was meant just a couple of weeks before an election\nTo help drive which is again something that you would have to look at it was to help drive the motivation here was to help\nDrive an election to a a certain size ... and at that point you would look at it and say well if they did this to\nHelp Trump did to help Trump and then you would look at it from the other side which was okay\nAh this was to set up Trump and make it look suspicious because of the things that Trump has said the provocative things he has said and help change the the uh public discourse to blaming Trump as that's at like I said it has that started already without any\nEvidence whatsoever but that's the most incredible thing with the media starts talking about whether it's you know soccer whatever yesterday from CNN going after the you know going after the president going after the right talking about the divisive comments out there was nothing could both\nBe more divisive than accusing another side or a person blaming them for something where there is a complete lack of evidence says to the motivation of the person or persons who did a particular deed mhm\nThey don't they don't they're not jumping in China and the signing on to something nothing could be nothing could be more device them so as they sit there on their high horse\nScreaming that your devices they had committed the ultimate sins and divisiveness anyway not\nWell Hillary comes out and says we must be more civil just days after saying there's no way to be civil with the other side that it's not possible she shut the door on that just days ago\nWell look this this is we're\nWe we have the conversation but it's ridiculous and I say it's ridiculous for for this reason uh after steep skull east was shot and you had a man who was a Bernie Sanders supporter\nWho's goal was to assassinate and kill and he uh he did not succeed in doing it thank thank goodness to the Capitol police but his goal was to kill as many Republican members of Congress as possible\nWould you say that that has brought down the divisive rhetoric\nOn the left over the last year\nAnd none of it's going to all of this has to get a political advantage one way or another what you're hearing yesterday is about getting a political advantage because you cannot debate the point that we've just made\nThat the most divisive you have these people sitting in their ivory towers immediate elite ivory towers claiming that they care
