doctor ten or comments made by the top ... regarding the relative a quick pace of Michael in Florence of course as we recall was guilty of loitering\nOut why is it the storms of vary in terms of the pace at which they move\nWhile you can even think of hurricane sort of like a leaf and a stream and that if uh you know the the leaf is is moving in a very slow meandering stream that that's sort of a certain it or not moving very quickly like Florence and they were sort of links\nOver the place and that given period of time whereas a leaf in a fast moving stream like um like Michael will move very very quickly through an area\nWould it be safe to assume that a a faster moving storm is more likely to bring with the wind damage as opposed to the water damage in comparison with the Florence where the wind might be less but the water damage more or or can you even make that generalization\nHundred percent phenomenal\nReason we invented things like same day delivery and ... and the same jar we

question that President Donald Trump issued a major disaster declaration to allow federal resources flow quickly to the impact of communities\nI spoke with the president earlier today and he has committed to make every federal resources available to help the recovery hurricane Michael is the worst storm that the Florida Panhandle has ever seen one of the worst power storms to ever make landfall in the United states\nWe heard of significant impacts that tend to air force base in many communities along the coast where it's hurting one hundred percent of our focus on search and rescue and recovery but we need every family to help with this listen to local officials do not take a risk be safe\nWe also need people to be very safe with generators\nDo not put a running generator in your home it is not safe to knock it out on the roads until you're told to just say we need the roads to be open for first responders and search and rescue to do their jobs and save lives is not safe to leave your house don't leave it\nIf you and your family made it through the storm safe for the worst thing you can do now is the act foolishly and put yourself in your family in danger or keep law enforcement and rescue workers from saving lives\nOr law enforcement and first responders or heroes are leaving their families to help others we cannot thank them enough as I said earlier today and we're deploying a massive wave of response will be sending help from air land and sea\nThis includes thousands have responders for power restoration medical search and rescue law enforcement food and water distribution and every other critical resource\nI was briefed by the U.S coast guard today and they are pre positions and tapping my bill was critical critical assets in resources along with our thousands of rescue workers local law enforcement has nearly Eighteen hundred personnel ready to deploy\nSo let's all stay safe stay alert to weather updates and watch the storm closely through the night\nFlorida governor Rick Scott a news conference earlier this day after Michael made landfall Michael has been a weakening of the charges across south western Georgia\nWith still damaging winds and rain has dropped from my walks formidable category for storm to a bottom to your category one storm if you've ever been through one of the storms by the way\nBottom cheer means a storm that is still worse than anything you've ever seen unless you've been in a tornado\nA a a bottom tear a storm like this you're talking about when that that can rip down trees because immense damage it's just not quite as powerful as the upper levels here\nA workout you said the storm flooding is still occurring along the Florida Gulf Coast\nAnd a Muslim is heading now northeast crossing into south and central Georgia on into South Carolina and North Carolina in the coming hours we were one eight six six by boat jumbo one eight six six\nFive oh five or six to six with Dr Brian ... assistant professor at the department of atmospheric and environmental sciences at the University of Albany\nState University of New York\nAnd that we're looking at a this storm and others of of the like\nThe uh the storms that we tend to get to in a in this country ah how do they compare with let's say the or the or the Thai food that hit a a western Asia you mentioned there are more of a border there but in terms of intensity do they tend to be stronger here or there or does it simply very\nThey do tend to be stronger or the storms that do hit the Philippines and Taiwan and China and Japan are on average uh just because they're simply more them and and if you have more than he does have a greater chance of them had him and then the land\nThere's of course that old line from Mark Twain everybody talks about the weather but nobody does anything about it\nIn point of fact are we uh since we seem to be able to understand an awful lot about these storms are we in any kind of a position to do something about them that is to say to to modify them to weaken them to change their direction anything of that nature\nUm I don't I don't know if we ... we certainly don't understand sort of enough in terms of the science of how to go about doing that um I Know there have been attempts in the past to for instance or tried to uh put silver iodide in the cloud cedar and hurt\nHurricanes and um that that didn't really have much another fact uh and was inconclusive I'm so I'm\nAt the atmosphere is you know a huge a big thing and there's only so much one can do to you know kind of control it or do weather modification\nThe story I told before this happened I think about half a century ago and I'm not sure anybody would ever able to determine cause and effect but it's scared I daylights out of the people there were I heard\nAnd it was off the coast of Jacksonville, Florida\nAnd they they cloud seeding vi a bit when I think one particular side or something to see what would happen well or something did happen and what happened was the caves graders shore and go out and said well damaging as I say I don't think anybody ever figured out\nIf the relatively meager amount of uh of silver iodide that a plane could put it into a hurricane really did that but I think it scared people away from trying it ever again but\nBut I I don't think most people as we go to a call here I'm not sure that most people really are able to think about the uh\nThe immense power of one of these stores we look at the course of the satellite pictures of things you know big as as several states and the like but I I'm not sure we understand we had a guy the other night call and it's just that we might drop a huge explosion in the middle of the storm and and I told him I said ignoring for the moment radiation just ignoring radiation\nIf we dropped every nuclear weapon in our arsenal every single one my guess is that it would have a minimal impact on the storm but besides they're just so huge I'd just like your your thoughts about that not that I'm advocating this wide you\nWrite and uh that that would not be a good idea I'm I'm hurricanes in terms of the amount of energy they produce is um you know any more than enough to power every household in every car I'm running into us at once\nI'm it's just a huge amount of energy and the day when you're talking about you know trying to alter that I'm In in any significant way it's just that we we just don't have the capability to do that\nWe can tap into it I mean if we're going to suffer the damage it'd be nice if we'd get some some kind of a of benefit from it too but [noise] I guess that's not really really likely either at this time yeah\nYeah that is that this fight I think it I think that these are things you just you

[noise]\n\n\n\nWas about ... [noise] Michael has pretty much left Florida behind but not without at least one casualty of a a a reporting\nNow that the ban in Greensboro Florida was trapped in his home after a tree crashed through the roof of that house and that person has died we're talking with Peter logical professor Dr Bryan tang and was Charlotte who calls him from Durham North Carolina a good evening Charlotte welcome\nMain thanks so much appreciate your taking my call in and uh this is a subject which really\nClose to my heart given that that that North Carolina is still reeling in Iraq and from a horrible damage from Florence had many thousands of people still displaced from their homes but can you said a Pearl of West than I Am sure I Would think that your your gas I'm\nWith no doubt to foreign\n... al ... who was head of the geology department here at Duke University\n[noise] scares me for decades and he has tried and tried to get the powers that day in North Carolina to uh you know put some controls in place where people\nBut they lose their hunger right there on the ocean front that they so glad to be on that that they had to be some restrictions and that if they absolutely insisted on building back their their insurance wouldn't cover it or something because our beaches are\nAre ... quickly eroding and you know if you are hit by water these horrible disasters God Forbid time after time what in the world is wrong with the that you want to do it again\nWell you are the people who were flooded out this year and a very surprised and there was a surprise this years they were last year a doctor Jay\nI'm certainly are I I think your guest brings up a a sorry your caller brings up some really good points um again it's it's a very complex issue at various state by state\nUm I I think a given that we've chosen to build on\nThese and strips of sand or out in the ocean the barrier islands and ah over time if he if he was sort of look at um\nThe geology of these a barrier island to stay they shift they move they they break up they disappeared reappear and once you put a structure on that and you can you try to sort of keep it with a place um it can change kind of landscape and and the protections are in sort of adjacent regions\nSo that that's certainly one thing that uh is is um something we have to balance with regards to development versus kind of allowing these natural barriers and he's now for protection such as wetlands and barrier islands to kind of evolve on naturally\nLet's talk to Mindy in Naples, Florida good evening ... welcome\nThank you um I learned in high school that the earth's axis or kill thing which made me wonder whether or not hurricanes are hitting harder in certain areas like Hurricane Sandy in the northeast\nAnd harder perhaps uh in the Gulf area in Louisiana\nUh because of the the uh over time the earth\nAtmospheres the weather is we're going to change in different parts of the world because\nSome parts of the ice caps would melt and uh the fees would rise 'em and all this is a is essentially a yes climate change but also because the earth excesses art tilting\nAll right Dr tagging what about that\nSo the the um the main consequence of the tilt of the earth is to give us our seasons um if the ... if there wasn't wasn't tilted\nWe we wouldn't have or you know summer winters and fall and spring so uh the the tilt of the earth does change of very very slowly over time but\nWe're we're really talking about you know hundreds of thousands of years so um it's not something that is a a main factor in terms of patrolling into whether the the issue bring up about climate change is certainly a much\nA bigger issue a much more complex issue and are still a lot of debate going on about how that might affect hurricanes in the future\n[noise] All right stay on the line and we will speak unfair again our guest is Dr Bryan tagging an assistant professor of the department of atmospheric and environmental sciences at the university at Albany State University of New York is research focuses\nOn the tropical cyclone formation intensification and interactions with the climate system and again stay tuned

something like that so if you compare it going way back yes historically there but we've come off\nWhen you can get below four percent on the thirty year fixed rate mortgage so we got spoiled I guess the fed kept interest rates pretty much a zero from two thousand eight from the financial crisis through two thousand Fifteen so we said well this is good you get free money forever and now it's not so friendly more\nWell that depends on who you are let's say that I have my money all invested in in in bonds out there or something I live off of interest rates these past few years have not been so great for me\nCorrect savers have been really got the shorter stuck here and they're still getting the short on the stick even though the fed has raised rates that banks charge on loans credit cards student loans car loans\nTo banks which have control over this have not for the most part raised what they're paying to deposit so the banks profit margins have widened\nAs they charge more but don't pay more and that's going to continue that way I think the thing the banks can get away with it will continue to do so savers have really been punished they should be the ones outside with the pitchforks but they they kind of ...\nWithout a ... type ... will take some calls here for Jordan good with America's money answers mad but before we do have time for a little quick session of econ one oh one here\nIn a true market place it would seem to me that as the interest rates in one sector rose that has to say let's say the prime rate\nThat interest rates ought to convince ... ... is a for auto loans home loans this alone in that loan and then ... and and and they let let's let's let's say that if some bank is not paying out the interested it could be paying out than another bank\nOr would would suddenly say well I could top that and then steal all their customers that is that's how a market economy works in a truly competitive atmosphere or there would be pressure on banks to pay out more to their their personal investors why is that working\nThe online banks are paying more for deposits or because they don't have the infrastructure and the branches and the staff of traditional banks but traditional banks have loads of money more than they really need to lend out\nAnd they feel they can get away with the people are kind of sitting there like a lump with everybody sitting and checking accounts earning zero savings accounts pretty much zero CDs less than one percent as long as people keep their money there and don't move it banks because I can get away with and they do so is there is some competition but most people don't move\nSo it's our fault I mean I I thought I I mean I I don't mean that it sarcastically but genuinely it's it's our fault if we were we're the ones who are not making the lead market economy working in regard to\nGive you an alternative if you want to do something completely different there are better ways of getting killed without having to wait for the bank to raise what they're doing I mean something I Do myself to him All right let's hear it cause secured real estate sons got an eight percent ... but there's no market voluntarily it stays at ten dollars a share doesn't go up doesn't go down\nUm and uh that's the way of getting an eight percent field as long as you can commit to at least one year and a member of his five thousand but\nThen ... and ... cause they secured real estate funds on the website secured real estate funds dot com they can see all by their fair enough bill in Pittsburgh calls and hello bill\n[noise] Ah yes I Want to know a lot of parts of the equity markets or your cat ... or ... that are on the kind of your or at least you left badly art market\nSo what's doing better right now our value stocks a defensive stocks for example utilities are like Pepsi was an example I actually went up a little bit today a consumer products companies that was going to do relatively better\nAnd that wasn't going to do worse on the high flying technology stocks so called fang like Facebook and apple and Netflix those kinds of things the ones that flew up the highest\nAre the ones that have gotten hit and we'll get hit further where's the defense of stocks going to probably do relatively better\nNot very good one eight six they did that answer your uh your question or does it bill as regards the equity\n[noise] ... yeah pretty much that that pretty ... I Want a broker at a lot outside of the and the fact that it's been a real small numbers stock\nThreats not wrecked the facts that that really loud and now they've been living on the way down that's that's\nVery good odd ... bill ever noticed that the term as always bothers me although I have one but it always bothered me when I go to a broker or to deal with making myself richer a mark in West Palm Beach Florida hello mark\nHey I'm thank you for taking my call true ah I had a question\nAbout a life insurance my father who's I'm getting older or in his life insurance policy continues to get more and more expensive um ... as considered cropping up but now he's heard about the possibility of selling it I was just wondering if you guys know much about that and\nThat is a possibility how old is your father mark\nOr he just turned Seventy five\nSeventy five and what does the size of life insurance southwest a death benefit of it\nHas a seven hundred and fifty thousand dollar Tina ... policy with almost no cash\nAnd and what is his health condition or does he have any kind of health issues of any kind\nUm he he's been dealing with some hard issues he is he's been dealing coke or more or less in the last couple of years\nYeah okay All right so in a case like that you're right if you drop that he'd get nothing for it he has no cash in it but if he were to sell it in what's called the life settlement market\nOr it's worth seven and fifty thousand you might get three hundred thousand or some huge amount because the the people are buying the policy then take over paying their premiums and when he dies they get to seven fifty the reason I asked about his age has helped condition as the older you are\nAnd the sick or you are the more they're going to pay because I don't think you're going to stick around very long actually so this is what's called the life settlement market a lot of people don't even know exist and certainly the insurance company is not going to tell you that's an option but it is\nThere's a free website you can find out if this would work for your father which is funding life dot com\nThey've also got a phone number eight seven seven for

five oh Jim bode well eight six six five oh five four six to six Jordan good but America is money answers man our guest and we've got a Frank in the Cumberland, Maryland to weigh in this evening into hello Frank welcome\nHow long can the u._s. continue to borrow a trillion dollars a year and how dangerous as a student loan that ought to be alone that\nWell we can keep borrowing as long as people went to us and there seems to be willing to do that were the safest place around the world\nUh people are fleeing particularly emerging markets turkey South Africa Brazil Argentina so they put their money here so we can keep going for quite awhile gyms asked me this question for what's the breaking point number I'm putting out is dirty trillion worried about twenty two trillion right now\nAt as far as student loan debt we talked about that little bit we're currently at one point five trillion\nIn student loans that are already the delinquency and default rate of about twenty percent it was going to be going higher because people just can't handle this amount of that but it doesn't go away and bankruptcy the only two deaths the Duncan bankruptcy or student loan debt and higher risk that someone hangs over people even if they declare bankruptcy\nOr when\nYou I I guess I'm I'm missing something here uh when you declare bankruptcy you enter into all kinds of protection is a ... or the laws regarding as a student loan debts are written in such a way that it is specifically exempted from the bankruptcy law\nProtection yes in the in the bankruptcy law changed in two thousand five student loan debt was made non discharge broke in bankruptcy that was correct specifically otherwise no land or whatever then everybody would default on their student loans yeah so yeah\nI I guess yeah as you get very well repossessed somebody's brain I guess [laughter] yeah ... ah bars calls in from adults in Alabama the jumbo had a job in the evening\nYeah good evening in the dark and I know I'm sitting in my car uh\nWell I'm Glad you're a you're listening to the radio and stay tuned to the station and you get you through all that is why I Can't\nGet any communication is my phone and in my car well good luck to you sir and hand right in there\nUh I had a question uh if wondering if he had heard of the book the killing of a ... by a raw they have brown\nThe killing of ...\nThat that has to do with finance does it\n\nA yes or it has to do with when or how the Federal Reserve was formed afoul of the diamond industry and South Africa or the the Cecil Rhodes that has a Rhodes Scholarship they'll with Harvard all that\nYeah uh how how\nHe getting they gained control of the uh the money system of the world\nWell I don't know there's a buddy system of the world actually that you could get control love or\nConspiratorial but I mean the the federal service for the Nineteen Thirteen after the crash of Ninety seven Ninety now wait we're basically J. P. Morgan said the economy from going over the cliff and they said well that's not a good idea to have one guy said was so let's have a central bank to do it\nUm it was formed on ... island in Georgia and there was a whole bunch of conspiracy theories about what happened there but I think it's been good to have a Federal Reserve instead of not having one\nLater this way ... if there were no Federal Reserve wouldn't there has to be some institution that does what the fed does\nWe went a long time without offenders are I mean until Nineteen Thirteen\nSo then how to how how are things like interest rates in the like determined\nOr just free markets apply there wasn't a a bank\nKind of ... tilting the field one way or the other I mean the treasury was there but there was no ... central bank at that time and so you had a huge surges and the economy and big plunges like an Eighteen Seventy three there was a major calamity a depression basically so there was no kind of a\nThermostat I guess you might say on the economy and that's and it crashed in Ninety seven Ninety underway\nAnd the whole thing was about to go in ... Morgan literally stepped up and said I'm going to save it so that's what I said maybe we should do it another way\nDo we have any statistics on just what percentage\nOf a student loan debt is a never paid back\nWell the fault writes about twenty percent something like that so it doesn't get paid back but uh it's it's hangs out there it doesn't disappear like credit card that if that's written off that pretty much disappears\nBut student out that it just kind of hang out at one point seven one point five trillion it's all the accumulated that has not been paid off ... percent is not being paid on right now it's either delinquent or in default\nWhat ... what ... do you pay if in fact do you just flat say uh I don't know so sue me I mean I'm not sure what these people have\nInterest rates go up as penalties they'll garnish your paycheck\nOr they'll take your iris refund uh they they they are very aggressive collecting student loan debt they don't just let it go ah so penalties interest that just really pile up and it puts people deeper and I hit us and people all the time to him I say you know I I started paying and I didn't pay enough\nAnd I are more and more and more every year and then my education was Twenty years ago it was just really pathetic philosophy\nI mean you stop and think about it you know a college education is is a lot of things to do a lot of people\nUh but uh it it from a societal point of view of the important reason for a college education is to be productive citizens and if in fact you're borrowing up let's say six figures of a dead end is in order to learn something that that they're not going to pay you money for\nAnd as I like to say on the program and make sure the are the most articulate ... Starbucks the society has no vested interest in paying for that I mean of financial aid should be based in large part\nOn the percentage of people that are given major who within twelve months of graduation are actually working in that field of work and it sounds like this\nTake on that Jim this twenty seven percent of the people who graduate end up using something it remains their major with twenty seven percent meaning Seventy five percent or you know three quarters do not end up working in their major field in one way or the other\nIn which case you especially if you get from a financial point of view you've you've wasted your time you've acquired I mean it's one thing if you have a hobby\nI'd say that uh our trust in literature I always say you know that well okay so I'm interested in that well that's fine but but but you shouldn't be paying off this kind of enormous money\nTo finance a hobby and as I've also noted before that's why we have so many bowling leagues in this country people like to bowl\nAnd there are just simply an awful lot more people who like to bowl the people who can make a living in the professional bowling to her and so I I mean it it just always it amazes me at all these people who want to find myself or I Want to do this or that well why don't you do that in your spare time and in the meantime get a job\nYeah well I mean luckily we have a good employment situation right now and and there's a tremendous shortage of workers\nExcept the people coming out of college in many cases are not qualified or willing frankly to do the jobs that are available there's something called the jokes report which is the job openings long term survey and the latest number was six point nine million jobs unfilled employers cannot find the people\nTo do tool and dye making or plumbing or electricity or climbing electric utility poles there may be the people coming out of college don't either have the skills or the interest in doing the jobs that are actually available in the real world\nWhich raises another point is too easy to sit on your body in this society there ought to be economic pressures on people like\nIf you're ever while student loans you are under economic pressure to do something a lot of people take jobs that are like but they've got services you know that's over fifty percent of the people graduating today go back and live at home because they can't services student loan debt and have an apartment in the car and kind of get on with their lives I mean it's it's pretty pathetic\nFive minutes you'll see an average

America's money answers mad Robert in Burlington, Vermont good evening Robert\n... says you're like oh there are some glad you're Mr Goodman a there's questions are the only for a long time over one is how much to the national debt that the whole er about at the end of this year is caused by the feds raising interest rates\nAnd number two where does all the ... the feds collect on that and just say where does that wind up as it goes towards the national debt or some of his at ...\nOr what I was doing All right let's let's say you're Jordan about that so I mean on the Twenty one\nTrillion dollars in debt we're paying about five hundred and twenty three billion in interest every year that's what it is right now\nThe way things are going we're going to end up spending more interest than anything else national defense Social Security or anything else right now but we're not there quite yet I mean that interest goes to whoever owns that treasury debt which is Americans pension funds Chinese Japanese all over the world is where that interest goes\nA very good before we take another call here let me ask you a little bit about the China and the and the the terrorist situation because the the Chinese economy is really not doing all that where it'll lay there there are other vulnerable position are they not\nIt it's been hurting them there are major export or thereabouts Seventy five percent of their economy of export oriented ours is about eight percent\nSo yes it's it's definitely been hurting them we've now for about two hundred and fifty billion dollars of their products tariffs ten percent going up to twenty five percent on January first\nAnd President Trump talks about the the rest of the two hundred and sixty seven billion so basically by January first everything coming in from China would have a a a path of between ten and twenty five percent meaning we're buying less of their stuff and that is hurting them for sure it's hurting us too but I think it's hurting them ...\nAre ... are we now leading the world in in uh the direction of dragging China kicking and screaming in the direction of actually a a obeying its commitments\nI Would say yes we're waiting nobody else is doing the same thing we're doing with China I mean we did have the Trans Pacific partnership which is the other countries around the Pacific was twelve when we're we drop down to the other eleven\nYou know Japan and Chile Mexico all those countries that was kind of an anti China trade pact as well so they're putting pressure on them as well so it's definitely heard in

question\nYeah I mean there are some things that are better there's I think Seventeen states right now the do require some kind of personal finance education to graduate from high school\nSo there are ... and I'm very much environmental program there's something called the jumpstart coalition that helps do that it could be definitely be better but there's definitely things going on in that area but

grown up and lately I've been going down\nAn earlier in the earlier hour than another alternative for you for income where the principal doesn't go up and down I Would have called secured real estate funds because you've got an eight under sent you on that and it doesn't go up and down it stays at ten dollars a share and then I said value so if you have to tie up money for one year\nAnd the minimum is five thousand but that may be an alternative instead of stocks were just so volatile a website for that secured real estate funds dot com or this is something\nI learned that is like the real estate fondest dot com\nCorrect and that would be an alternative echoed a money market funds getting one percent\nThat just so much for them at face article ...\nGood luck good luck ed or we go to Dan in Moses Lake Washington on the bow Hannah Joe hello Dan\nRather and what's on your mind tonight well my question\nIs um I have no debt but I'm retired\nI wife is retired but uh my hobby is incurring lift some old cars and so she suggesting we moved to leave I had different house with them you know a facility for housing that cars or whatever\nIt is that a good idea or\nI wouldn't want you to take that to do it right I mean could you sell your current house and moved to a place it's cheaper that has the room you need to fix your cars\n\nYeah 'cause 'cause the current houses is paid for it\nYeah I mean if you if you it's roughly if you were to sell your existing house Dan roughly how much when you get for just roughly\nA third of the current house or I don't know how to Fifteen to twenty five\nAll right so I mean if you moved to a sometimes maybe cheaper and use the two Fifteen to buy the house and had room for your car repair stuff then that would be okay I just don't want you as a retired person to take on a mortgage and to take on new that\nOkay and where that yeah and and what I'm looking at in a market I Would be taken on a mortgage something higher\nSo that's not a smart financial move I mean you're retired now so you don't have the income from your job to pay that mortgage off so that that would be as as Jim Jim with say a very expensive hobby because you're paying a mortgage to be able to do that how\nTo handle it yeah okay well that's kinda what I'm getting everybody else you know you're kind of answer my question\nWell we would certainly hope so and Doug good luck to you Dan we thank you very much for your thoughts one eight six six five oh Jim ... a one eight six six five oh five or six to six what are some of the instruments of investment that uh that people do take advantage of these days I mean uh uh\nWell I you tell me what they're thinking out there that are tools that oh I don't know futures markets and stuff like this are things out there that are even fully understand but I Know they exist and when you get beyond you yeah what do they tell me about the hottest thing\nThat's going by far right now are marijuana stocks no question\n[laughter] well now that that certainly would tend to make sense I suppose yeah\nWell as of October seventeenth in about a ... a week or so or marijuana is going to be completely legal in Canada both recreational and medical right and so a lot of these stocks are Canadian based I mean there's one called till re for example which came public in July about thirty\nI'm In September it went up to three hundred now it's about a hundred and sixty something like that I mean it went up ten times in two months uh and then other I'll give you some others Aurora Cannabis as\nOne called canopy growth does action exchange traded funds and ATF which has all the can of stocks in it which is called the harvest ATF symbol M. J. like marijuana um and that's got plenty of the biggest in there\nSo I mean if you want speculative growth [laughter] that's wildly hot a hot socks this year or what bitcoin was last year this year is that\nWhat about the bond market bonds in general and and and I I'm thinking of corporate bonds versus municipal bonds in days gone by people would often I think refer to municipal bonds as\nA as just really really safe and made they didn't pay a lot but they were extremely safe am I speaking now of something twenty five years out of sync with reality\nA lot of them are safe but some states are not so safe I mean I'll give you two examples Illinois and New Jersey I two states that have a huge amount of debt or and their pensions are only about fifty percent funded\nI'm so they're having tremendous fiscal problems and so those would be riskier municipal bond there are lots of places I mean you can basically go on their credit rating if it's triple layer double layer singled out you're probably going to be relatively safe for that\nYou don't you're going to get immunity isn't going to be in the two to three percent range to some extent so they're not going to be huge guild\nBut your principal is going to be relatively safe but I wouldn't go into the or or another disaster area really bond is Puerto Rico Puerto Rico had eighty billion dollars worth of bonds and they basically defaulted on them last year so not merely bonds and safe these days\n... I'm calling from William in the old for New York or the ... good evening William and welcome\nSir I was just gonna say uh I worked as a caretaker for about forty years the same place for the most I ever made for a month for Thirteen hundred and fifty dollars\nAnd yet by responsibility and commonsense I paid a cash from my house saved the hundred and fifty thousand in our age and I'm only getting eight sixty one Social Security\nBut I'm taking five hundred dollars or re so basically I'm earning more now that way than I did when I worked\nWell that's why it's about responsibility\nYou save the hundred and fifty which a lot of people have not so that's put you in a much better position than a lot of people that don't save anything you did the right that way\nLike I said at the bottom we thought the ability and you know an expectation of lifestyle\nAnd you didn't do it all at once you did it on a regular basis you probably had a rabbit savings program to get up to a hundred and\n... and all it just didn't like the same town that worried about the security of getting that five hundred dollars a month\nYeah yeah All right well I mean that's fine I mentioned the secured real estate find there's another alternative for every one eight percent but you have to feel comfortable with it that's\nYeah good luck to you William appreciate your thoughts to end your call or just a a wrapping up here how likely are we didn't have a ... and other little mini depression or a recession if you will uh the likes of let's say ten years ago is that in the the cards for the near near term\nNot the near term but I think in the long term the amount of that we're building up and we talked about the government that of whatever twenty two trillion going up to twenty eight trillion or something like that as a definite problem corporate debt is going up a lot and we talked about individual that\nStudent loans mortgages credit cards car loans all these kinds of things we're building a debt Bible not only here but around the world and and that doesn't go on forever so at some point this is going to break but I don't think right now I Would say another two or three years before that that kind of birth\nA very good oh and tell us if you go to a little bit more about what one more fine at money answers dot com\nWell I think emails from listeners and vowed to help them all the time but I've got a lot of resources and the YouTube page I did the money answers radio show every week it's on there as well or interviews with all kinds of people blogs newsletters to some kinds of things to help people and I do love that take emails from your listeners as well\nEnough alright money answers dot com\nOr Jordan Goodman America's money answers man as always Jordan thank you so much easier to help thanks so much Jim All right very good eyes that covers the some of the the world of finance will come back we'll take another a look at what's happening with hurricane or Michael one eight six six five oh jumbo our number one eight six six\nFive oh five or six to six and a bit later on\nWe're going to be taking a look at a survey\nAbout citizenship remember the old the Jay Leno Jay walking thing he used to do it's\nAre donors most of us want to make them get bring in a life in either saints dead miraculous or\nThe fact that no one has to pay it's a place where everyone is treated as an equal\nEverybody is welcome here and it doesn't matter the religion or what part of the world you're from all that is taken away it just gives you some hope\nIt's just a nice feeling to put your energy into something that really does genuinely make a difference in a child's life\nYou know ...\nIf we have the ability to how\nAnd when there was any doubt\nFinding cures saving children the children's research off they don't find out how you can have at ... dot org [noise]\nBy three\n[noise]\nWith Jay Leno hosted the Tonight Show he used to do a very popular feature called Jay walking and he would go forth with roving microphone and he would ask people questions to which you assume they should know the answer they didn't and of course the result was a hilarious and to cringe worthy [noise]\nWell now there's been an actual survey taken or jaywalking of course a emphasize the the bizarre the outlandish and was not a scientific survey but there's actually been a survey now\nThan they commissioned by the Woodrow Wilson national fellowship foundation\nAnd the results are no more encouraging we're talking ah right now with the foundation president Arthur Levine who can give us some of the over views and we'll look at some of the specifics of this survey of if you're living a first of all\nI Would have to ask you if you were at all surprised by the results\nI was deeply disappointed by the result in contrast to Jay Leno we weren't selecting for people who do poorly we were hoping that I'm being giving this survey they would show the nation was engaged in knowledgeable about the history of the country\nWell it would certainly seem to show up quite to the contrary just to ... mentioned some of the uh the parts that came out of this\nAnd let you a comment on on each one of the uh Seventy two percent of respondents in this Woodrow Wilson national fellowship foundation survey Seventy two percent almost three quarters\nIncorrectly identified or unsure of which states were part of the Thirteen original states\nAre back in my day when I went to school the the days of your the Jurassic Era of education that was kind of drilled into us I don't know that in fact I have a more responsible adult or or citizen of the country\nOr by having that information drilled into my head but at the time it struck me that it was at least a base is a foundation for understanding what role about\nAgree with you and I should\nExplain where the question came from which is to say that we gave a random sample representative of the country or one thousand the American citizenship test which means that in order to become a citizen of the United states\nOf the twenty questions we asked people need to pass at least twelve so they needed ... to stick to the parents say to them\nWe gave the same exam based on the simple question provided by the federal government\nAnd at the same passage rate and in general sixty four percent of all Americans failed that test in contrast the citizenship test as a passage rate of ... percent\nWow so at least we're we're teaching the people who who are coming here to become citizens of the rest of us are not so much of this one here only twenty four percent of those in this survey could correctly identify one thing Benjamin Franklin was famous for\nWith thirty seven percent believing he invented the light bulb seriously\n[laughter] ... faith in ah Benjamin Franklin cared for choices on each of these questions he\nWill not eat and we were there were multiple choice questions so so random I guess they would give you a little bit about bleach proceed\nHere we had twenty five yeah you're exactly right it is um made me very sad that people that thirty seven percent of Americans thought that Benjamin Franklin identical light bulb and that they were off by centuries\nYes now a twenty four percent of get only twenty four percent and this was a little more instructive about what this country is about only twenty four percent knew the correct answer as to why the call on the spot the British\n[noise] Mm [noise] and when you add up all of these questions and all these answers we have enough surveys every year they show Americans aren't doing well and so there aren't doing well in English or they aren't doing well in from other subject\nArea where it's really important about this one is we're going into an election in a month and we have some very very large issues facing\nSome more than being an embarrassment that people don't know these things more than pointing were bashing any source we really need to do is change ... soundly understand the history history isn't just been the subject matter\nIt's one of those areas one of those very few areas that we shared commonality and the time which are divide seem enormous\nAnd periods of dramatic change like the president\nHistory isn't anchor vehicle for seeing what happened in the past and looking at it as a laboratory to understand what could happen going into tomorrow because so many of those issues some of these issues we face\nWell in a new guys aren't really knew we face problems like him in the past\nIt's also a way of building optimism and confidence we got through them once before they can probably get through them now\nOne would would certainly hope that that would be the case or some other results of this survey only Thirteen percent knew when the U.S constitution was ratified even on this multiple choice exam\nOr most incorrect you'd think he'd occurred in Seventeen Seventy six which of course was the date that we declared independence or the year that which we did [noise] sixty\nSenator respondents didn't do which countries the United states fought in World War two and a despite the recent media spotlight on the Supreme Court fifty seven percent of those surveyed did not know how many justices actually served\nOn the nation's highest court for those who fall into these various categories by the way a World War two we fought Germany Japan in Italy for the most part with a few other ... countries throw it in\nAnd there are nine justices on the U.S Supreme Court\nAnd I'm Glad you didn't even ask how that is determined because of course there would be those who say well it's in the constitution when of course it is a is not a particular interest to me\nWas the poll found that those sixty five years of age and older scored the best Seventy four percent got at least six to ten questions correctly those under forty five\nOnly Nineteen percent pass the exam and eighty one percent scored fifty nine or lower that is to save failing and that I think pretty much says it all there apparently was eight point at which citizenship\nAnd related courses were simply dropped from our country is a curricula presumably a secondary curricula your cupboards\nWe don't know I assume that what you just described is correct we do know true fact it is a startling result we're going to read the survey and we're gonna end up doing the fifty states survey a beginning after Thanksgiving\nAnd we're hoping to get more in terms of why the older population did so very very well on this exam but it is disconcerting and the other thing that show is and it's not something that we do know history is incredibly boring in the way that it's thought\nWe teach kids to memorize facts dates people's names\nAnd we have no connection and no meaning it still when did they forget them as quickly as they do\nWill come back we'll talk some more about that in other aspects of this survey to get into this is a survey that was conducted by a a nationally recognized the analytic research from Lincoln Park strategies commissioned by\nThe Woodrow Wilson national fellowship foundation of which I guess

down here so the checking things out in different areas there's been lots of reports of looting in certain areas in death\nHas been linked to the storm but chief justice John Roberts is referring

confirmation hearings\nJudges who received complaints can dismiss them have local judges investigate them more as Robert suicide the complaints to judges and a different part of the U.S\nThat's the one thing that people don't I don't I don't think a lot of people didn't understand is the fact especially one that you know the winds and the outer eye wall hit those areas you just knew and and I you and I had gone back and forth because of some of the coverage on the uh the the Weather Channel and\nYou know putting on baseball helmet and things like\nThat that Jim ... you know at one point put a helmet on ... and by the way there was a smart move because\nI Do agree yeah I Would have thought about that I always said why you would think they would do that more often even Windsor Seventy miles an hour I Would if I'm Out\nThere sure covering it with the the debris flying around\nBut uh you know and and a lot of them are reporting from around the vicinity of Panama City in ... and really what the worst was to the east ... uh you know a lot of them and and you just knew what you just said well you know it seems like if you're just a casual watcher\nYou might even say well there's not really a lot of damage your well that's because and I saw one of the meteorologist say had down near there\nAnd you know she talked to ... and they just said no\nGet out get out yeah we cannot report you cannot report from a place where you've got wins of a hundred and fifty five miles an hour coming to you that you can't do right which was a very I sat there I said okay that's a very smart\nRight well that's it when you know I mean that that that tells you that the strength of this storm or when the weather\n... runs recover that is that's one indication that that you should to uh you'd look at the number of people that are that stayed behind did not a a leave the area did not evacuated a and you know of course our thoughts and prayers are always with everyone affected by\nA storm and and and uh and others like it or you know we looked at the uh the situation with with Lawrence we looked at the uh the and uncovering that\nAnd and the recent storms in Texas you and I I mean go going back to a Katrina\nReally and then a Hurricane Rita ah along the Gulf Coast and and and these storms I mean we have so much devastation I have a friend in New Orleans you know and talking about that you know people not coming back many of them moving to neighboring states like ours\nUm and staying and saying you know there's you know there's I don't want to go back there's you know again if if there's not going to be ah that that long term rebuilding effort that is a in some cases permanent devastation\nOr you know not only the physical devastation but of course the economic devastation of of a region\nOr like that my ah my nieces husband station right now going to school in Pensacola he's in the air force and uh I was checking in on them and they were you know they had a mandatory basically\nUh order to you know stay in in a shelter and ah and stay there he's a he could not leave\nA but they had of course there on the base where he is\nA they had it set up of course to keep everybody safe or that's you know again I was watching a couple of the storm chasers that were alive on periscope and and Facebook Live throughout the day and one of them had plans to stay\nOr through the whole thing or two to give as much coverage as possible uh but uh he had already are in this building he had a a huge sea meant stairwell that he was going to stay in\nA but it was the one in fact a drudge linked to to his coverage or that was that storm chaser but he actually showed everybody where he was going to stay within the stairwell and it was meant yeah I saw a ... and so\nUm you you look at the I guess the job of these meteorologists and and people and and\nAnd a news reporters that are that are out on these storms ah they often stay right there in their hotel is right there close to the beach in fact that's where the weather Channel's saying at this hotel that was right there on the beach or in one of their locations and\nThose are buildings that are likely a severely damaged although they are bigger buildings and can withstand a more damage than the sum of the other smaller buildings are coming up here just a few minutes after the bottom of the hour\nWe'll talk once again to meteorologist a meteorologist a Tom hale he's been with us he was with us yesterday he was with a with a performance\nOr as well and uh and Irma doing coverage for many years in fact in his career\nOn hurricanes we'll talk to him and John trout as well we'll keep us up to date on the latest uh as of right now Michael still hurricane yeah yeah ... Seventy five on our sustained with wins\nSo that puts it out a category one just just barely a and and we're expecting you and I talking during the pre show meeting and you were saying you expect a and I think most do\nOr that the next report which comes up here and I'm In uh in forty five minutes\nOr we could see that downgraded to a tropical storm\nAre still very dangerous uh you know if you think about uh the the uh a hurricane heard sustained winds of Seventy five miles an hour while they're not what the ... the storm isn't what it was in terms of its power is still dumping a lot of rain and then of course those winds are still damaging\nSo uh we'll get the latest from Tom hale and John trout along the way coming up here and just that\nWe have an election coming up here and just a little under four weeks yeah ah yeah breaking news\nUh and uh some of the polls out there is some of the uh interesting a poll numbers off from the New York times yesterday right well we'll get to that look at the CBS headline\n... also coming up here on the show prominent Democrats or reject taking the high road and as a viable political strategy that is yeah you know that's after Hillary Clinton\nAnd uh uh and then the more I got my like Cory Booker at no no no ah the former attorney general\nOh I'm a I've got Eric Holder Eric Holder yeah coming out and saying if they go low kick them yeah ah and ... and we\nYou know said this yesterday and the day before a ... and as well we said the day before it looks like they're heading in that direction and yesterday was obvious that that's the direction that the mainstream now\nOf the Democratic party holds is that we're going to be it's going to be instability it's going to be mop like tactics or it's going to be getting in your face wherever you are it's going to be getting that on camera\nMhm uh in order to uh to do it and then ah you when you had Eric Holder guinea the point of saying take them that was really the first statement of using physical force\nAgainst your political enemies they seem to have no shame in at this is coming from not the fringe\nAs as recently as even a month ago remember we had a call and somebody called up and said well not all Democrats are like that and we said well your party is\nYour party and that this was really basically going to wear the parties being controlled by the left ... uh but now when it comes to instability and getting in people's faces and wanting to film it and and getting to the point of\nTerrorizing people with a with a mob yeah how about a mob terrorizing people matter where they are that has now become a mainstream mindset of the Democrats if you're a Democrat you know that this isn't again when CBS writes it\nYou know that even in the media are saying\nWell what are they doing here which is a strategy right Hillary Clinton coming out and saying that Eric Holder coming out and and and and saying it and so here we go I'm Rand Paul and his wife taking on a Cory Booker\nFor his for his previous statements and I still have not heard one\nNow maybe you may have heard at one of the debates if they asked one of the senatorial debates I don't know I didn't see that but I haven't seen in any major publication where you have had I haven't seen any publication and to make that clear I have it may be out there I haven't seen it where you have one Democrat come out and say stop this\nThey're not as ... is this is ridiculous enough and as we've said when you when you think about it I I understand why they're going there because wherever else was there to go\nEither you were going to make the decision as a party to do what they said after twenty sixteen was look we've got to go to the mid west we've got to go to fly over country we have to start talking to people we have to find out what they you know what their needs are either you're ... you're going to go in that direction\nAnd talk about the economy and talk about those things or you were going to say our bases radical left\nAnd we need to go radical left and so this is obvious at you know that they're doing this this is obvious that the mainstream of the Democratic party have realized we can't beat this so we are not last week there is\nNo are you there is no road for them to turn around basically and come back reverse direction we'll weed said that two letters again really well and and you know when we said after the election\nUh you because there is that at once they took that break and you know\nAre considered going to the mid west for a moment they came back from once a month wait what are we said before lunch oh we're totally not do not know how to pronounce during that we're not doing that um but when you when you go you know back in and look at the

or read I I'm Gary McNamara long with a Eric Harley welcome\nAnd a good morning ah we're in fact are looking to talk with meteorologist Tom hale who has been with us\nAh he's been with a red eye covering a Hurricane Florence a covering Irma and ah over the many years of his uh his career has covered a number of storms very few like hurricane Michael because there are very few storms like this one let's talk to in fact Tom hills he joined us right now good morning Tom\nGood morning Tom I\nWhat what is your I I guess first take away in terms of the size of this storm a as it we ... we last spoke in our last hour which was the uh the five AM eastern hour on a on Wednesday morning\nUm it did could you ever have predicted going back to last weekend that Michael would have gotten to a hundred and fifty mile an hour winds plus\nNo I wouldn't have I wouldn't have gone that far I Would have said that it was going to be a major hurricane ...\nWhen when it took its bad because as I shared last died all of the meter logical conditions favorable for this to develop and continue to develop existed hum button for it to drop in air pressure down to nine Nineteen Miller bars putting it\nBasically the or the ... the third most intense hurricane and\nI'm a on record that to me it's kind of mind blowing a I would've never expected that this would have a lower air pressure than Katrina wow which was a nine hundred and twenty million dollars wow\nOr or let's take a step further I I\nI I I I'm about to the power of the train up but it was a pretty disorganized tropical storm when it came up through the Bahamas and actually I was in the Bahamas for that\nWell and at that point I would've never never guessed that after it went over to Hollywood, Florida cut across Florida and then went into the Gulf\nBut it hit that Gulf moisture that had been untapped\nAnd in the atmosphere with prime for that and so while in Nassau, Bahamas where I was it it dumps\nThree inches of rain I was an off a\nAt the amount of moisture that it dumped a nobody anticipated Katrina would be much more than a tropical storm and then when it came off Florida it just exploded yeah and and and\nThe thing about Katrina was its size it grew to four hundred plus miles across it was enormous in size and Winfield but then we've got to Andrew\nAndrew that came through in a you know Florida in the seventies Andrew was nine hundred and twenty two Mila bars it was even a little less deep air pressure and so here comes\nMichael [laughter] okay at nine Nineteen and so yeah\nYeah I'm I'm a I'm I
