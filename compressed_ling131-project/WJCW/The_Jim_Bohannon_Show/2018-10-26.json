represented Nebraska and he was embracing the sentiment and he was but\nI I forget the circumstance but\nIt was sort of a fluke that he ended up giving remarks that day and he's talking the other

instructions for what William Howard Taft was supposed to do to advance the progress of model and then he went off and did try to kill every ward hog and Africa\nAnd he went off on his grand tour and he was gone and he was very upset because Taft and the Republicans in Congress for not doing what he told them and he was upset about this because he had told them what to do\nAnd when he came back he tore into Taft and he tore into the Republican Party with his amazing zeal by the time he's done he has embraced a populist progressive ism or a progressive populism\nThat would that ... that exceeded

title of this book every man of king and then of course was about Huey Long limited time that we've got left ear to cover three important name's George Wallace Ross Perot and Pat Buchanan let's start with George Wallace\nWell if you would permit me I Will I Will reverse\nEngineer it for you to do I write ahead\nSo I can go faster or in two thousand Donald Trump ran for president on the reform party ticket or for Ross Perot Ross Perot and he and he ran he said to save the reform party from Pat Buchanan who he said was that not the\nUh he said who hated black people ate a Jewish people and he needed to save it for the common sense populist economic approach of Ross Perot do about the money it's not about social issues it's not about these other things it's about being a pragmatic businessman um and that was Ross Perot\nWhen Donald Trump re emerges in two thousand twelve is a political figure\nEmerges nothing like Ross Perot and re emerges L. Y. like Pat Buchanan he emerges talking about birth tourism and some other things and as a culture warrior and if you look back if you ... just a little bit you can see how Pepe candidate who challenged George H W. Bush\nA and Bob Dole but in Nineteen Ninety two and Nineteen Ninety six\nHow his success at capturing the cultural anxieties of a lot of white working class Americans a lot of people who felt like their interest for being pursued and things were radicalizing in the country he learned that from George Wallace\nPat Buchanan working for Richard Nixon\nUh in the Nineteen sixty eight election had observed the success that Wallace who shook off most of the direct segregation ism uh certainly buys Nineteen sixty eight run but what Wallace learned\nWas that the same cultural anxieties that are poor or middle class white voters in Alabama had were the same kind of things that all kind of folks were feeling in cities across the country and in the north it wasn't about segregation per se but women's liberation\nUm and the end of the segregation and bussing and a a\nProtest movement and everything all the cultural upheaval that was going up the people that felt insecure about their place in the world were very anxious and they were very upset and Wallace figured it out that\nYou could connect with those voters in a way you didn't have to talk about economic policy necessarily all the time you didn't have to talk about these other things all the time you could be their culture warrior\nAnd you could be the one who did that Pat Buchanan shot he was a young a ... a editorialists\nWorking in St Louis he caught Nixon's eye and he was the whisper to Nixon about how to connect with these voters and that is how Richard Nixon flipped the country right he flipped the politics of the country around by taking these voters away from the Democrats taking blue collar\nSome in some cases union member Democrat Democrat away from that party making them Republicans based on cultural concerning grievance and so you can then follow the thread back out from what George Wallace did what Pat Buchanan learned to what Donald Trump finally figured out\nRoss Perot didn't have the secret sauce that Donald Trump needed but Pat Buchanan definitely did\nWho follows Trump I mean most movements in this country you can you can look at the others or maybe less ... within that movement and say well that person would pick up the banner of old libertarianism or the progressive wing of the Democratic party what have you I I honestly I cannot think of any person out there\nAre now that I Would say well there's the Arab parents with Donald Trump assuming he has two terms in office and complete twenty four years the guy\nWell I wouldn't I Would think he he he he would probably run his son I Would think I'm Donald junior I Would\nSay hereditary populism hereditary as\nGood for the Roosevelt is as good a but I I I think I think that would be his ah or ... or that would be the inclination him and the people around them I Would say if we're looking into the future of populism I think we ought to look way back to Andy Jackson\nAnd say of immigrants and of people who are not been in the United states is whose families have not been in the United states for centuries who are the people there who are the leaders in that on on the other side 'cause I think that the left progressive is going to have its ...

talking about ... in a general rule I guess to the kind of a G forces fate of the fighter pilot my may face but [noise]\nBut uh we're talking about things which can uh put under stress I suppose even the structural steel and reinforced concrete that's the whole leaves things to the ground I mean you would you ask\nEven things was top of steel and concrete to do only so much I guess beyond that point you're asking for trouble\nWell you know back in the old days and this is a very good question because back during the you know that the beginnings of a of a you know I'm using parts and roller coasters\nI I can go back to Eighteen or an excellent Eighteen eighty four for a little Marcus Thompson coming out with this which back railway over at Coney Island odd back in the in the\nTurn of the century you know this was all done would nobody could really uh you know gay examine how how well the ride would be you'd have guinea pigs that actually would go on and off your neck wasn't broken I guess it was a very good ride so yeah there was some issues back then there are a lot of injuries\nI even would post it today today cannot do a loop theloop the way it normally should because of the the strain on the wood but later on especially right now the technology has\nGone to the point where you could actually create a roller coaster from start to finish computer wise generation or you know basically get it all set up no how many G forces is going to be at\nA certain point even though I'm ... you know how long the parts of going to last and how you know how many times that the maintenance\nOr during the year so the technology has gotten extremely\nAdvanced or the rise even though the taller and much faster there are a lot safer and again into the figure is one hundred and two hundred and fifty million or that will actually experience if a ... or you know just going to the park itself it's like one in thirty five thousand\nSo it's a you know you have a chance of getting hit by lightning ten times a year before this if they tell the er at a a a local amusement park [noise]\nHow many people are suffering heart attacks things like this\nIt happens every once in a while because you did mention about the G forces ... and ... and some of these rides or the bigger ones for example or you'll get about four to five jeez but if it's not sustains us like when you're in an airplane and you're doing a hygiene maneuver\nAnd it takes maybe ten Fifteen twenty seconds\nYou're feeling those five or five times your wait\nA while you're doing that in a roller coaster it normally only\n... you know you're only going to have that are that G. force for probably about\nMaybe a second or a second and a half now obviously if you got to a heart condition or something along those lines\nWe always tell people you know get yourself checked out before you go on some of these rides because in the back or neck injury obviously you don't want to also go of you're pregnant or they just say she didn't want to do but it's very very veterinary minimal or that you hear about an incident or an issue\nWhere someone had had a heart condition went on a ride in\nAnd I think I can

course aside from the middle of summer I suppose the end of the year is one of the best times out there to be thinking about things like this and we thought we would take a break\nFrom the hard the cruel to cold harsh tonight\nAnd just take a look at some of the things that are available out there and the last part of the year to make your life a little more ... joy above all right uh things like Ghostbusters or other words pop cultural references if you will in these rides is there for example a Ghostbusters ride or more than one\nWell you will find a yes or several actually out there or you know these rides or all seemed at this point you know amusement parks\nLoves the mean it was all started by Walt Disney when he started the\nTheme different areas and different zones of different places like that so yes you will find rides out there um in fact the names of chain of will actually change because some of the ride that would make them more scarier reappear even though it's the exact same rights so yes so\nThey they tend to want to go ahead and do that because that again it's all about getting into the mood and getting people to actually experience something a little bit different at a party that they might go in there during the summertime for example\nAnd um it's a certain way out classy example would be of course\nDisneyland or Disney World I mean you go during the year it's a certain place at Halloween everything and I mean everything gets\nTurned into a Halloween event and then overnight literally overnight on the thirty first going into the the first of the of November actually I think it goes a little bit later that to us in mid may be the beginning of the first because of ember it automatically within twenty four hour changes from Halloween\nOvernight to Christmas just like that so the theme is the feeling is extremely important\nUh in order to get to the right to you know atmosphere and an atmosphere is everything when it comes to an amusement park one\nOr other uh seasonal aspects of steaming besides say Halloween or at the Christmas\nWell of course you've got the Halloween and Christmas all but you know you also had Easter parades\nOr during the Easter Easter time period and of course the fourth of July celebrations on that you'll find all over the country and a lot of fireworks and so on down to life does really realistically is about maybe five or six major events or that go on and between all the other events\nThat these amusement parks and even the um\nThe uh northern amusement park steal the ones up in a let's say Missouri or Minnesota or or or even Boston you know nowadays it you know way back Thirty years ago they would close the parked after the summertime nobody would be going\nThat someone came up with a brilliant idea of saying let's keep it open until Halloween let's see how that flies and that that went really well\nAnd then someone else over Six Flags or was one of the first to Branson, Missouri was another one is silver Dallas city in Branson I decided that\nHey let's so let's try Christmas even though it's extremely cold frigid\nUh let's see if people will come to the parks during the during Christmas Time and believe it or not to um you know most of them not all but a lot of them are of course down south allowed him stay open but up north I'm a good majority will stay open all the way until Christmas Time\nOf course we we play football in doors now or do we have things like indoor roller coasters\nOh absolutely I thought well obviously during the wintertime though you also have indoor shows a Christmas shows and everything at these parks but yeah so a lot of indoor roller coasters one comes to mind obviously anyone who's ever been to a\nTo Orlando, Florida you might wind might I tried the rock 'n' roller coaster which is being with aerospace arrow um was it um\nAnd then I can never be but basically they uh ... it's actually indoors odds customs area fifty miles an hour Aerosmith Augustus fifty miles an hour and about three seconds draft you several times through some of the uh\nSome of the ah that that gets to hammer head type of stole stuff and um there's everywhere\nEvery single amusement park will have an indoor ride\nOr either dark for example space mountain overt magic kingdom is totally dark and even though it only goes about Eighteen to twenty miles an hour it seems like you're going Seventy or eighty because everything's in the dark so\nYeah that's a big thing now the dark rides are actually coming on board the mommy over universal studios is another a great ride or that that is\nPretty much more of a simulation or a ride that's indoors and Spiderman exact also so that there's a lot out there in fact that a good\nSection of people love to do a dark ride more than just something that's uh open and you can see everything that's coming before you\nI think about family activities and of course in the days that even before my agent time of families that is you say mom and dad and kids and uh if it was an extended family ah grandparents would sit around and they would stare at the radio listening to the ... McGee and Bali and Fred Allen\nOf it later that also extend to television which aimed at a general family audience in many cases back when they were only three channels yes youngsters ask your parents about that there was a time when there were only three channels\nAre these days of course we're so sad ... segmented so fragmented\nAnd uh the family's doing things together in some cases is a joke even eating together in the evening meal or maybe something of a of a of a sick joke so I'm Wondering the extent to which these Halloween rides offer a chance for families to do things together\nOr remember y'all year around and you and you and that's a good point actually because uh one of the reasons why amusement parks or we'll have and and this is the hole in the United states\nAt a four hundred million people that live in the United states are about half of them or two hundred million we'll visit an amusement park sometime during the year and the reason why they're so popular is the civil reason one of the reasons you you just mentioned\nA amusement parks have decided\nThat uh if you have something for everyone a show for the older people rides for the younger people hit he rides and and little shows for a younger people have food that pretty much anyone can try\nWhether the fast food or actual sit down restaurants or you will find them at the amusement parks because it's a way for the entire family to actually get together\nA and enjoy a day I mean even the older people or you've got scooters that can go are you know around with the scooters and I'll have to worry about the walking you know the miles as they say four miles\nOn average that you would at an amusement park\nSo I think that's one of the things that was really really intelligent it was that ah that means in parks and not just geared for kids anymore they're good for all family members and that's why they do so well\nSay there's more to compete tribute go an expert on travel and amusement parks and

now\nVery good time or during the summertime when it when you travel for example if you go to Disney universal or or any of the amusement parks or just any place that\nThat is in the sun belt the obviously the summertime is not a good time to go a good time to actually hit places is is actually right now uh because of the fact that uh you know this is really a time where people are gearing up for the holidays but not quite there yet so it's a good time to go\nAnd are you one thing I did want to mention is if you're ever gets in New Orleans and you don't do it during Mardi Gras the best time to go is actually right now during the Halloween season because they've got a you know decorative costume parades like the endless night vampire ball\nThe or the voter witchcraft festival the root of music and arts festival they really do a Halloween extremely well and uh you know now that a good time to go because once we start getting into mid November I don't know if you know this but\nUh the actual air travel goes up fifty percent for Thanksgiving and twenty five percent above normal during Christmas so a great time to actually travel is right around now\nI did not as a matter of fact I Know that uh but uh certainly something to to keep in mind that obviously a in terms of ah of\nPeople uh companies if you will who really do the sort of thing the best I automatically I suppose many other people think of Six Flags they certainly are are are well known for this are they the the kings of of such rides\nWell I've gotten myself in trouble on network television but I Try to who to basically ah you know approve wind over another so what I Try to do is is said that we all know that though the Walt Disney world was the first decree theme parks\nAre back in Nineteen fifty four and the first introduced to steal roller coaster and that a horn in Nineteen fifty nine\nSo they pretty much started what we now know as he themed amusement parks and of course up there you're going to find the universal studios both Hollywood as well as in as as well as in Orlando, Florida the Cedar Fair operations which includes you know the roller coaster mecca for anybody who loves roller coasters\nAt this point in Sandusky, Ohio I'll bet you also of course\nI have the Bush gardens locations in Tampa and Bush and and Bush gardens a scary I'll catch us when it's Carol wins are are Carolyn I'm you've also have as well on there's this many of them out there what I like best is actually not the ones that have\nFive six or seven different places to go to but the the the one off like for example Kenny would ah just outside of Pittsburgh in West Mifflin what Six Flags over a ... in America which is a smaller part for Six Flags just outside of Washington I think it's Largo Marilyn\nOn these places are are actually a great one of the oldest amusement parks out there it's called lake compounds\nIn Bristol, Connecticut and you will find a one of the oldest carousel there but you'll also find a part kind of like Hershey park where Milton her she built\nA an actual park for all his employees are while he was doing the or the ... the the candy and socket factory that these places actually supersede any any amusement park they just had the parks available like lake compounds in Bristol just for the people that were there\nJust forget about their problems and and go ahead and do that so there are a lot of parks out there that are that have that done quite well with that\nIs this a job for you or a labor of love beat tribute go\nThis is a labor of love I like everybody else I mean I'm a frustrated pilot who you know does or does a lot of different things but I Know I started writing roller coasters because\nBelieve it or not as a pilot I had a childhood fear when I was a kid and I wanted to overcome that fear which are built up after twenty or Thirty years and believe me it was very difficult to get back\nOn on the horse and they say oh but I wrote the first book as a as therapy and my second book just came out last year which is a personal guide to the best amusement parks and roller coasters and that's more of a labor\nOf large enough in order

eight six six five oh jumbo our number one eight six six five oh five or six to six times in Port Angeles Washington now good evening\nHello Jim but what strikes me curious here is\nHow come we rely on the FBI after having watched them try to like displaced the president that was duly elected\nAnd I don't want your tire and the I didn't try to displace the president\nAnd the FBI remains the preeminent law enforcement agency in the world and and the uh besides them who did you have in mind\nOr the federal marshals they have their own James and they're uh they're they're they're about Trump neutral\nAnd uh the uh a Jewish\nState and local law some local and the states and cities and cities and thorough involved games and you know what this is going to amount to which is a bunch of really good drills for a lot of people\nBut uh it's just all political theater and the more they do this in ... with the hurricane in Mexico or and the marchers coming up from Guatemala at her at ...\nThe more and more what I think I I think the liberals are shooting themselves in the foot because there's fish could it be an old timer Democrats that are going to go you know I have done with this party\nWill he may be political theater or it it may it may not be I mean it may just be a loony bin out there that's the thing at this juncture we don't know\nThis was all a hoax gym\nWell I'll put it this way and I ate easy for you to say and maybe you are right but a short of owning a crystal ball Tom I'm not sure how you could be so absolute certain of that I Would probably go as far as to say I think the odds are with you but I don't know that and I'm not sure how you know that [laughter]\nWell I Do have a crystal ball and it's pretty reliable is called a history it's called watching these things go by and it's all just wanting to who we won one piled up in a bunk after another and they're just trying to ... the president and I'm getting tired of it really tired of it\nWell I Am tired of of efforts to embarrass the president myself although I don't know for a fact again that that's what this is maybe I as I said I'd even go so far as to say that's the way I'd bet but I certainly can't be certain of that\nOne eight six six five oh jumbo to Janet in Scott's buff Nebraska good evening Janet\nHi thank you for taking my call sure you know say the bonds never exploited I Would also think that ... in the Clinton holder the narrow all have security cameras all over the place now some of these are hand delivered weren't they\nSome more hand delivered the others went through the mail yes\nAnd where does it went through the mail to ... get canceled on those\nThat's not clear at this juncture the item which was delivered to CNN in New York which was a\nA an address to John Brennan\nOf that item was delivered by a courier of some sort although I'm not sure that we know exactly what but he showed up nonetheless with postage stamp on it it showed up by the way with not nearly enough postage I Would think to\nTo actually deliver or something as heavy as a pipe bomb but they did his stance on those stamps were not canceled because it never went through the postal system why there were stance on there again like so many other aspects of this is a known\nYou know there's a lot of questions about this nonsense and and it's sad that somebody would do this and it'll be interesting to find out if they tell the truth is really behind it\nIt'll it'll be extremely interesting uh again or the FBI keeps very careful tabs\nOn this kind of behavior the bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and firearms as well or even for people that say who have been behind bars who uh who had been may be released\nA but if they're out of people do their methods of operation or that the hallmarks of the the types of devices they make in this sort of thing and I can guarantee you those have been going gone over with a fine tooth comb so my guess is\nThat a as though was indicated in that report the FBI may know a great deal more than we have been told because there were so many of these devices that unless they were meticulously careful\nThat they almost certainly left behind some kind of clues a fingerprint DNA\nOr the way the bombs were made in the past it's a it's hard to do and if they were that meticulous by the way that in preparing these bombs that they did not leave such forensic evidence\nYou would have to wonder why they were not so a meticulous about making devices that would go off unless again as has been speculated the devices were never intended to go off certainly a possibility we have listeners all around the world and the Michael calls in from Brazil hello Michael\nAnd Maria I'm fine thank you\nYeah we were talking about this and W. N. I. R. with um the average engine\nIsabella [laughter] okay about pipe bombs in caravans and stuff like that but um\nAnd I could I could probably ... on on on these on these bombs mhm to me it's a no brainer you know first\nOff none of these people I got this thing and then now to the post office ...\nNone of them read their own now they have at ... and assistance for that I don't think George Soros has the white picket fence and on his street is a mailbox for anybody can drop anything and if there is I'm sure there's lots of security cameras\nSecondly the stance on these on these packages you take a closer look at them they're not canceled\nCertainly I think in one case obviously that was true I have to see the closeups of every package but certainly in well as a general\nIf well I'm just saying is ... which which one it we talking about because I remember you're saying the other night I think it was you\nIt was the er the alien end the CNN or a package that was addressed the John Brennan ahead and canceled stamps\nRight and all these places have cameras we had a guy on the WWE and Irish show who wrote a nice a letter to George H W. Bush after you read this book and looked him up on the Internet and I went to like a a business office you know like one of those places where you can have your mail go to yeah is that we was he's very wealthy people\nUh unless it's a hand delivered tank can say I guess you know from one of their cronies or whatever at that point I'm sure that somewhere that\nOpens the mail for them oh I ...\nAnd let's just say if there were no let's say hypothetically I think I I think none of the packages stamps were cancelled that need somebody delivered in there\nWell now there's one that wound up in a postal facility in Los Angeles that was being sent to the congresswoman Maxine Waters and uh uh how they how you how you get it into a postal facility without at least put in that Amazon is on the planes\nGoing ... every time I used to go into my post office before I moved to Brazil guess what they had there just like banks cameras\nOh yeah well absolutely I have no doubt that there are cameras that have a disclosed or something about the methods of delivery and I'm sure the FBI is pursuing that that's one of the main reasons why uh I agree with Eric Holder for once that probably there will be a break in this case very shortly yes cameras are everywhere\nWell let's just hope we get the right information from this to fast and furious that's all I can\nSay on our well fortunately Mr fast and furious has nothing to do with that he was one of the recipients and he does not in charge of of the allegation fortunately\nThe Seattle does he have a government job still or is\nOh he's a he's a private citizen and uh probably running for president in ... he has no government ...\n... misses having my high school debate kind of I mean who would become more confident and every dreams\nThis message presented by the Tennessee secondary school athletic association and the high school in your community [noise]\nCan we just enjoy that arise [noise]\nMarcia gay harden how did you get any are getting older\nAdult brains things you can do to really\nLearn how to help reduce some risks to your brain had brain health [noise]\nBarracuda dot com slash backup\n\nBy September ... we're talking about the bomb packages that were set out across the country and talking with Lance and got away township New Jersey as the brake intervened\nI was actually one thing you brought up about the return addresses which of course listed a uh Debbie Wasserman Schultz as the return address or they were not handwritten they were generated the government says by a computer I Would assume that uh\nThat if they find the right computer that they can probably imagine too that Lance\nYeah I'm going I just ... you're just listening to the er the news the ABC News update\nAgain where they're coming out with more things are definitely bring it under the microscope sort of Harvard like the um there's too many like little serendipitous\nCrime line and it just I hate to say but majority of the callers seem a little bit more skeptical and stark there then uh\nI guess we'd be tried again Jim you always have that shooting for good reason which keeps me up late at night at times which I dread about\nWell I appreciate I protect your listenership into your your calls ... I I Do yeah uh I get into that\nI Hope they find that a ... and orders group of ...\nOr ... absolutely that is a distinct possibility thank you for your call that yes that is a distinct possibility you could very well be a group although there was a perfect synchronization of the delivery you had of course the Soros package on a Monday\nOr most of them I guess the showing up on a on Tuesday\nA a one of them I think the one that ... that went to Debbie Wasserman Schultz if I'm not mistaken\nWas one that was missed addressed and that was returned therefore to the return address which was hers so apparently was not intended for her per se apparently Debbie Wasserman Schultz return address was designed I supposed to give credence to\nA that's a particular mailing although why again I like most of the recipients uh Debbie Wasserman Schultz is has been she was disgrace for having a help to rig the Democratic party presidential nomination for Hillary Clinton over Bernie Sanders and taught he's sixteen and like the other people involved\nShe's ever she's either has been or never was I mean Iraq Obama a bill and Hillary Clinton Eric Holder\nOr or the never was as a Robert De Niro who brings nothing but a potty mouth to this discussion ... it is interesting and a lot of ways ... disagreement there Charlotte joins us from Durham North Carolina Charlotte\nThat evening came and thank you can't I Am not the sharpest knife in the door wide I beg to differ [laughter] well I say I'm not I don't think I'm going to do list either but I think and and you know I always just said that your your wisdom\nNow don't you think that all this stuff they are thousands of people coming up to Mexico and these bombs dance center end up to think it say all a distraction for the ... election\nPossibly uh I I guess although it would be quite a an organizational effort to have been involved in both\nOf the organizing and feeding and uh and uh sheltering of seven thousand migrants coming up from Central America and sending out these bombs that this is all the work of one first of all do one individual could possibly do that so we would have to be a group\nAnd uh that would be an amazing\nA group if in fact they were involved in both of those things\nAre the only thing that I can think of regarding the uh the bombing is is uh in terms of timing again or if it comes along at a time when the election is close and when the marchers were still marching\nBut again I don't see if it's supposed to distract us Charlotte we're not going to be distracted\nI mean unless we come up with more bombs were not going to hear another thing about this bill there is a suspect and then we won't hear another thing about that person after a couple of days until the trial arrives in the meantime the election will still be the center of our attention followed by the marchers\nWho well into the about the November it will be the center of our attention so if this was designed to distract us it was pathetically childish and ineffective\nWell that that's probably absolutely so it just seems to be\nSo you know very very coincidental to me and is it you know that move on dot org late but whatever you know they're capable of this\nOh in terms of of of people who would be capable of this absolutely move on the antifa groups or they would all be humanly capable of doing this this is not something that that I could I could see any of those groups saying oh well we wouldn't sink to that level oh really [laughter] I beg to differ\nWill not change us really really hope and pray that if these people that are doing these bombs that caffeine that you hope that they are prosecuted to the fullest extent of their lives that have just a slap on the way it's like so many of them are getting\nAll I think you'll do not see any risk slaps on this I think that uh uh the the penalties for engaging in terrorist acts are pretty severe and it is hard for me to believe that was the person is arrested if there's sufficient evidence that you're not talking about somebody who's going to be spending decades behind bars at the legal\nWhat last thing on skates me do you\nHave any hope of faith that or the military will be able to hold back these these immigrant\nThey've got plenty of time and it certainly the these people are moving slowly through Mexico and I even heard one report today that some of the group may have have given up and uh and and stopped a marching with the group that the numbers may be shrinking the debate\nBut certainly if the president means what he said when asked about the number of troops replied of the number that it it takes a it's certainly possible for us to to do just that ah it's possible to block them\nPossible to use for example non lethal methods that tear gas and the bean bags and this sort of thing there are a lot of non lethal methods to be used now as was pointed out to meet\nA one of the knights of this discussion the military is not trained to deal in non lethal force is trained\nTo kill people that's true but it could very well be that the military is going to have to be trained in other ways and certainly one thing that the military does very well is due to take orders\nSo it may very well be that that will be a continuing rule to to stop the invasion of our southern border that may be what their job will have to be but the short answer Charlotte is yeah I think that the military will be able to to do so pretty effectively\nThank you thank you ... your caller a collar ship and your listenership if you

mailed to several high profile Democrats across the country and CNN the FBI warning of additional packages after three more bombs were located Thursday correspondent Caitlin ...\nSell CNN Mr Trump believes he's being unfairly link to the attempted assassination and has no plans to back off his verbal attacks on the media\nOne confidante adding there is no talking him out of that one day after calling for unity and condemning the attacks on American the president changed course writing on Twitter that a very big part of the anger we see today in our society\nIs caused by the purposely false and inaccurate reporting of the mainstream media\nOfficials that Yosemite National park were investigating the deaths of a man and woman who fell from a puppy or overlook park's spokesperson says visitor once they reported that two people it plans to their deaths that have to point which has an elevation of about Seventy five hundred feet so unclear where the pair fell and from what smart\nSo that information is coming out there were mailed from ah from Florida I saw the story that that the uh sources are saying that\nThe whole uh ISIS flag thing that authorities believe was to throw them off and they don't believe it had anything to do with a a a a ISIS they belong Larry the cable guy or alerted the cable guy right I think it was something just to to throw them off and so we are getting all these different stories and meanwhile all day yesterday my question is\nWhere they live bombs where they ready to go walk right not rise that makes that makes a difference if you're giving up all this other information all this other information is being leaked out there why isn't\nWhy ... why isn't any media outlet\nIn really insistent in asking those questions for me it was quite frustrating yesterday and then uh was uh was busy a lot of the day uh yesterday and and went to sleep and and woke up late\nAnd when I woke up late that's the first thing and I saw like five hours I woke up right\nJust about two hours ago and and as soon as I woke up I ... you know okay there's got to be the new story out there whether it was a lie bomb or not and the same thing right like wait a minute this is about four days since the first you know since the first bomb right you know what what is it why can't why can't we get a straight answer when you when you talk about Austin\nAustin a bomb went off Mm So at that point you knew that they were alive bomb here no bomb has gone on\nSo the question would rain just for public safety or public knowledge are the bombs live or not\nAnd still referring to them as you know suspected of you know the devices potentially dangerous devices potentially dangerous devices that are you know that are dangerous mhm well why would they be dangerous does that mean because this will be the question I Would have does that mean that some contain gunpowder\nRight at summer in pain and explosive device but there was no detonator and then right so they would be a potentially suspected of you know a bomb a with a you know explosive material but the explosive material\nWasn't going to go off and it wasn't a danger to anybody unless you took a match and put it to the gunpowder\nRight right yeah just simply by handling the package itself it wouldn't be necessarily a dangerous in the way that a live bomb would be but but but again\nAh you know that this is something where you know not not hearing at all ah it has been\nAnd and there is no nothing wrong with an over abundance of caution by anyone and you know in the scenario except for the fact that you don't have something for I guess the the public if they were armed\nOr those bombs were ready to go off in transit that's something I think that would be warnings all over from authorities saying that you wherever you might be anyone could potentially encounter one of these devices\nAnd that kind of warning I'm not I'm not hearing so\nAnd when you get to the press coverage of calling them bombs yeah which is you know if the Saudis have not said that they were lied bombs why are we calling them bombs right what is the purpose of of doing that is that accurate reporting if they are not bombs were telling you when the real time the frustration that we have right\nRight and we think it's important to point out the frustration unless there's a reason for you know unless there's eight investigative reason\nFor for doing so accept the fact is the people that are the person or people that mail the bomb they know whether they were alive or not and they know the authorities already know right so what what would be the investigative purpose for doing it is beyond\nIs is beyond me and so when I finally saw some frustration because it got to be a little frustrating yesterday when you're trying to figure it out or they live bombs or not and would they have gone off was it just some explosive material but they wouldn't have gone off right because that that one of the reasons that the leaks are happening and they give out information\nBecause you see it all over the place I saw the the the tweets people retreating it if you know anything about it and now here's some of the information some of the information we believe you know it's it's the authorities now are being directed to Florida well leaks come out for a reason\nLeaks from investigative agencies come out for a reason so why are all these other things leaking and being told that the public by the media but not the one question that I think most people would want to know it was ... or they live where they live or would they not lie bond right\nSo there's where we are so we'll get to that like a more of that coming up here I Chelsea Clinton I consider running for office\nMhm I just had to throw that in there yeah it's a friday why not anybody shock no\nWell you know she has experience that NBC so\n[laughter] [noise] who was who wasn't on NBC\nI Can't remember who was the I think it was Brian Williams was it Brian Williams okay she's well traveled\nThat's how he described her ... ... the you mean she's been on a plane I that was the first daughter of course she's well traveled you and I will never\nForget him that night we I Know we played it on the air yeah that that was just unbelievable yeah it was like gosh you know over the fact right the Chelsea Clinton was not working for NBC brand and\nThey do that when when when George Bush's daughter went to work for NBC not so much that there are a couple of articles you know but\nYeah but but not no gushing no you're not getting as what I was referring to you did you did pause the news you know that's why I said it was like OK we'll let her in for now\n[laughter] I did a great job but it's like Megan Kelly exit stage left but once the entire contract and I looked at you and I during an appreciable meeting and said and does it seem like that NBC went oh wait a minute oh\nWe can make this cause it not ... uh she's already making too much for she hasn't made that kind of money she hasn't pulled in that kind of revenue yeah or so this is an opportunity to get rid of her now right well because the ratings I'm I'm guessing weren't stellar\nUm and ... and if any good excuse right ah yeah we're going to let you go\nSo uh Megan Kelly and who knows will she be back on friday but that looks like she's going to be off the air for at least a while and she lost so here's here's how it went down she made the blackface comment I I don't know when that was Monday or Tuesday and then by Wednesday she had lost her\nAgent yes they parted ways and now it's\nBasically it looks like there won't be any any you know coming back to to say goodbye or or sign off or anything else that looks like it's pretty much done\nAnd you wonder if you you just wonder okay that was the old saying that escalated quickly um she came out on Wednesday\nAnd did some kind of apology and they said the audience you know that was their gave her a standing ovation I I'm not sure why an apology it deserves a standing ovation [laughter]\n[laughter] it's not like some kind of great performance that social side of the ... well yeah yeah uh but they gave her a standing ovation uh and\nThen later on that day and just kind of went down from there and that's when the agency that she was with atomic agency I decided to part ways whether there were some celebrities that we're going to appear on the show that after the comments on black face they weren't going to appear and they decided you know the cancelled so\nUh but that\nLikely comes down to the fact that the ratings weren't great you know it's just the worst thing ... anybody has ever said\nAh no\nNo but ... but ask Roseanne Barr how much you have to say ... probably Roseanne Barr that situation was much more serious in terms of of how it was viewed in Hollywood than what Megan Kelly said I I don't know I might I don't know my my two my two conspiracy\nTheories and then once you know initially they weren't going to\nInitially they weren't going to fire that wasn't in their plans with initially just for that for what she said they weren't going to do it as you said in our personal meaning\nYou figured out it's just better till after Halloween yeah come back after Halloween but but then they went on wait a minute hold it she's not producing yeah don't wait a minute rating we can get out of his contract we can we bought one of the lawyer said you know this could be caused and if we get it for cause we don't have to pay off or contract that's one side of it the other side of it is\nOne of the conspiracy theories making Kelly was thinking I don't want to be doing this is just totally sucks but I Want to be able to collect my contract let me say something that's maybe a little bit controversial but not far enough\nFor them to justify all the fire me for cause\n[laughter] well I mean and if they try I can still collect here's the difference Megan Kelly saying that on her own\nShow on Fox News would have just been another night of making Kelly\nYou wouldn't have heard complaints maybe I mean on social media you would've yes but it wouldn't have been treated the same\nI mean she may have had to follow up and say you know hey that's not what I meant it's not okay or whatever but it wouldn't have been what it is that NBC for a morning show there's a big difference in in in the type of a audience that you have there\nSo who knows what will happen but ah yeah maybe maybe it was amicable by ...\nHe also coming up Chuck Grassley referring Michael ... sweat next to the department of justice for possible criminal action ... for making false statements about Kavanaugh mhm that would be interesting to see
