knowledgeable about these situations whether it's an attempt to mass murder or whether it's an anti Semite\nWho kept below the radar most of the reporting on this uh on Saturday today a has been along the lines that this is Robert Bowers was just a wonderful guy\nThe NBC News this morning head on a neighbor lived next door to them or\nHave you had a woman who said boy kept to himself quite friendly that kinda stuff joining me now is that a saint Thomas Redskin former NYPD officer investigator detective and Thomas Redskin welcome again in the bill Cunningham shown Thomas how're you\nGoing to be very tough situation awful um but when I watch\nSome of the morning and afternoon coverage of Robert Bowers forty six years old I guess no previous criminal record at all\nAnd they had menial jobs was a truck driver did various other little things next door neighbor a woman said boy he was quiet kind of shy\nAnd he said oh goodbye no difficulties he had posted online for quite a while and I met him ranting and raving including hatred for Donald Trump the president\nBecause he thought Trump was too uh too nice on Israel didn't like the fact that Trump's grandchildren are Jewish and ah he didn't like the fact that a Trump like the state of Israel nonetheless\nUh the media is pointing this out somehow Trump's response of all the Washington Post a yesterday afternoon it today did ugly reporting\nSaying that uh that in fact a Sarah Sanders put out something a few hours you go to the set is there any tragedy of the Washington Post went out exploit\nDo attack President Trump the evil active anti Semitism in Pittsburgh was committed by a coward who hated President Trump because Trump is such a on a public defender of the Jewish community in the state of Israel\nSo let's go back from a police perspective somebody said uh the analysis the experts come out of the woodwork now saying the Pittsburgh Police should have known the FBI should've known\nHow many thousands or millions I I've been tempered comments rather racial anti Semitic anti woman anti male whatever anti homosexual or ... is on social media like everyday who's going to monitor that monitor that and Tom do you see any followed by by law enforcement in this case\nI it's not as of yet when I've seen you know there's always twenty twenty especially in the long horn spin or the investigative world when I Can't believe that no one else was monitoring\nHis social media and other things that he was hosting it couldn't have alerted only what the what we don't we is up you know things to say something [laughter]\nIf someone had this seem right I could've alerted the police on the police if we find out that the police the FBI or some law enforcement agency was told about Bowers\nAnd do something or to look to see if this guy does have guns or potentially follow him we can criticize the police but until that time police law enforcement agencies even intelligence agencies don't have the manpower the ban with\nTo be able to follow every single person that they get a complaint\nAnd even sometimes like the shooting and Broward County there was a woman or call FBI numerous people had caught about that Eighteen year old a punk mentally ill insane person that just shot up to high school\nAnd even though call in or an FBI people call it in that wasn't followed up on even if those things happen there's no perfection there's no perfection and law enforcement correct [noise]\nKnow perfection on horse but you're only as good as shifts today and\nWish I could take on four spin is very easy to do after the same but law enforcement it's tough on so I Know from my experience with the NYPD we always look back we oh we used to\nIt at review of what had happened and what we could do better at the same way that they're doing with the case and the bombings or the bombs that were sent\n'em they're looking back and figuring out what we do better in the future and that's what law enforcement agencies I'm sure in Pittsburgh and the FBI and other agencies are doing towards ... and ... hours\nAnd in fact a barrel said a postage just a few hours before the slaughter on Saturday morning quote I Can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered screw the optics I'm going in unquote so whoever he was dealing with social media somebody knew or should have known this guy was disintegrating\nAnd I and that person did not do anything now the experts have said\nBecause I'm sure there are several thousand individual sadly in the country like ours waiting for a trigger moment\nThat social media exacerbates highlights these kinds of feelings because those of like minded get together and they feed on each other's hate before social media ten twelve years ago you sent letters or you made phone calls but in social media you can be a friend hundreds and thousands of people\nOr other like minded like those clowns marching around Charlottesville shouting slurs against uh against Jews and against African Americans every several hundred did that they use social media to get together and feed they feed on each other and feed on their hate\nNow the media doesn't well report this but this guy hated Donald Trump he he he'd previously wrote I never voted for Trump nor a vibrant own Warner even touch the mega had\nHe goes on about Trump's grandchildren being Jewish\n... but the media still jumping on Trump for some reason because the climate out there that everyone is causing the president is one of many causing it so when you were in NYPD or you go back right now the Pittsburgh Police or go back in time and say [noise]\nWhat did he do when did he do it who didn't send these messages to and investigate them as to why something wasn't done and about the guns right now according to media counts three fifty seven magnificent some blocks that were legally purchased and they are Fifteen they're still tracking that thing down and see what it is\nA ... if someone is posting anti Semitic slurs\nAnd saying I'm going in and they have guns now isn't that another tempted something's about to happen\nThat's what you would hope you would hope being from the polish Pittsburgh Police departments standpoint that you would have gotten a call or the FBI would have gotten a call and then if you drop the oil is a law enforcement agency [laughter] and it's on you but in this case nothing I have seen about ... hours\nTo respond to a ... guy goes into Times Square but no one of the reason that he wants to kill innocent people going to the theater in New York City on may fifth a bunch of years ago and thank God he had failed terrorism school and couldn't blow up his own car\nBecause he would have killed if not injured hundreds if not thousands of people\nBut they're on knots like this around the country it's what keeps law enforcement people up at night\nWorrying about this lone wolf the guy who's not really talking to someone the guy who was sort of a loner a guy who's pretty well thought of in this neighborhood who is capable of grabbing his guns\nAnd go into a place in killing innocent people for no other reason than his ideology or his private ideologies\nThomas is out there all the way but Thomas Rosekind former NPT NYPD officer thanks for coming in the bill Cunningham show and all of us need to learn the rhetoric just a little bit because

reasonable borders and David Wray will once again welcome to the bill Cunningham show and David how you doing\nDoing great my friend about you\nGo let me share with the American people something you of a put forth in one of your mission\nAnd that is what's going on and with all this stuff going on with the mailing bombs and all that stuff going on and the victims and then the potential arrest all that stuff something else is happening I think much more important in the southern border the media is covering for obvious reasons\nAnd that is that this is something being used by the mainstream media to attack the Republicans and Donald Trump but you say among other things in his article\nThe caravan of an estimated seven thousand some say it's closer to Fifteen thousand at this point of Central American migrants is now you know well into Mexico what the Claritin ten of reaching us border where the migrants intend to seek political asylum the impetus for this latest caravan is not\nA humanitarian crisis in Central America but rather\nAs accurately described by the wall Street Journal and organize stunt\nBy political agitator is an activist who are intent on using migration is a political weapon\nTo foment border chaos and I might add student to hurt Donald J Trump I could not can save on a particular day at a particular time at a particular place all of a seven seven to ten thousand a Honduran just showed up together in one place and said let's walk through America two thousand miles away no one believes that\nSo what happened with the political agitator isn't the activist who got this together explained that that the major media will deal with\nIt well you know build a thanks for highlighting this and this is the other example of a you know weaponized migration if you recall Nineteen eighty Mariel boatlift when Fidel Castro sent a hundred and twenty five thousand\nDisenfranchised Dan criminal and mentally ill a Cuban immigration to South Florida and the idea was to use population as a way to destabilize and disrupt a you know competing country and once again we have here\nWhere we have a leftist politician in Honduras former member of Congress\nA who's a\n... according to vice president Pence getting backing from the Venezuelan government no friend of the United states\n... who has stirred up and created a caravan of some Thirteen thousand as many Thirteen thousand people some of whom are our economic migrants and they say they're coming here just to work\nBut others are MS Thirteen a gang members deportees there's also a\nMen of working age from Asia and from a a East Asia or East Asia and South Asia coming this way what you have here is uh if you just watch on TV where they try to stay out of this you know people are just are are coming along and doing it on their own\nMeals are suddenly appearing pets are suddenly appearing medical care is suddenly appealing this this is not\nSomething that just happened on its own nobody is coordinating this and paying for this if you don't believe me why don't you take your wife and kids and try walk in Louisville, Kentucky and see where you end up tonight to who puts the tent up for you with the medical care and the\nFree hot food I mean it just doesn't happen like that these things are coordinated\nAnd there are a government behind this they're trying to destabilize the United states in let's let's be honest here\nIs it a coincidence that this is happening just ten days away probably the most important mid term election and your in my lifetime and I mean that is not a coincidence vibrant and on top of that there are now three cats\nOf ants coming to now because the media\nDoesn't cover this because all the news that fits they print and this doesn't fit the narrative the megaphone to the Democratic party explained why here we're getting ready for a week from Tuesday is going to be a very important election all of a sudden\nTens of thousands of my door and show up at the same place the same time with precision began marching together along with food and I'm an army marches on its belly along with water intensive medical care all of these things just just came out of nowhere and now there's three events happening with the media will cover what are they\n... well you know there there are three separate\nA caravan set of four of the largest one that we are talking about now and then to to smaller ones in El Salvador one that has an even left yet\nBut I mean on the one hand the reporters are saying these are women pushing their baby strollers and then the big you know they make the mistake of panning the crowd and showing the visual and I've seen\nPictures of people handing out money to these folks I've seen trays of meals being handed I've seen medical supplies\nAnd so on they are you know trying to uh I think that you know how the Mariel boatlift ... uh not only destabilized South Florida but it ended up leading probably\nTo Jimmy Carter's a election downfall and the following election although Jimmy Carter help that out quite a bit himself\nI think that that this is an attempt by leftist government and perhaps some of the open borders advocates around the world to destabilize the United states and to embarrass Donald Trump right before the most important mid term election of his lifetime\nI think it's embarrassing him because on balance\nBecause it was going politically against the Democrats all of a sudden a bomb scares the bomb threats began as if now the media doesn't deal at all with the migration that look so bad and according to CBS News about eighty percent\nOf the so called a migrants are young males between the ages of Fifteen and thirty it's impossible for a woman with a baby to walk two thousand miles\nThrough jungles in the heat and sand and deserts that ain't gonna happen somebody's organizing on this much like the boat live from Juba there are a leftist politicians who hate Trump and want to destroy America and they want to flood the southern border right now there's Fifteen and twenty thousand one hundred Fifteen to twenty million [noise]\nWell you know there are a forty one million people in Central America and I bet a good deal of them have their eyes on what's happening here and how we handle it the problem is that we have gaping loopholes in our asylum laws and if anyone in

this nation they don't where they do have what they do have an advantage of by the way I I just love did you see that some of the Democrats are now coming out against the debt and you know that's that's beautiful except the fact that if you see the plans that they are putting in\nIf you if you see what ... Harrison Cory Booker and everybody is talking about free health care well forget about it you're never going to pay for it because you can't tax everything that the rich has to pay for everything that you want but it's interesting because they're bringing up the deficit and the debt and look you know liquid trucks on the deck and we've all up and said this\nFor a ... you and I've been doing the show for Thirteen Years so we were there for the last few years with the Bush administration ... where we had Democrats constantly calling St Bush were spending too much and we said well we hope you're here when Obama is is back in in ... when the bomb us in power and by the way we criticized Bush\nOn his but yes we did we absolutely did yes\nAh and we [laughter] we criticized one of the images of of Texas a conservatism Tom DeLay when he told a conservative just shut up because we cut just about everything we kind of the budget we said you're full of crap mhm\nSo we have no problem if you listen to the show we you know we have no problem taking on a Republicans when they claimed to be conservative but they are not and so we invited all those people\nBack then that should be between two thousand five and two thousand eight and we said look the Democrat takes it in two thousand eight we expect you to come back when they sky rocket the debt how many calls we have from Democrats in the eight years\nOn the debt on the deficit or ... I Can't remember one zero\n\nSo I mean that's they they have no credibility of that and and people don't care that's the other thing too people don't care anymore Republicans used to screen the debt and they realize people don't care now the Democrats are screaming that people don't care\nThey they they just don't I run a couple of things over the weekend where people were saying you gotta understand the country is and I think I mentioned this last friday to this country is really going ah we're really going right we're really only right we're really going right in some areas we are\nBut fiscally were not no not even a close eye on on economic issues we're moving to the left well and and the Republican Party has moved into the lab yeah and\nYou if you look at the uh the the the major threat from capital of the two capitalism and freedom more importantly\nA it is that debt or because if we're not going to if we don't care about it now\nThan we're willing to let him go over the edge and at that point you can't turn back which means you have government take over control of industry when industry goes south or if there's a program that goes south or you're going to have what\nAgain or imagine a scenario forget about cutting you know we talked about the whole hair cut thing you know to two percent five percent ten percent but the\nProblem was is that now you can't talk about a one percent cut you can't talk about one percent increase snow you can't you can't live with your increase to one percent so there's there's just no way you would have riots industry member\nIn Europe when they were cutting or some of the social benefits and there were then and there were riots by young people you know there were they were talking about the especially like retirement benefits and everything else and the young people were writing there were setting cars on fire how dare you take away all of our free\nStuff well imagine you know an economy our size and we get to the point that we can service that that anymore\nI don't remember it was what open that door it was the jet I mind trick of Brock Obama as president the debt is not a problem well today\nThe the economy isn't collapsing but it will and I compare it to saying well you're bedrooms on fire but you're in the kitchen everything is fine\nOn on economics on on a tax cuts yeah the\nRepublican Party is moving more conservative on on spending\nUh on on a on tariffs talking about China we're talking about the other ones and no we're moving in the Republican Party is moving in a more socialist right a a a a a position remembers we brought you friday the Commerce Department numbers and a half\nOf the increase we talk about the increase in the GDP half of that increase is due to government spending ... not not the private market booming now half of it is the private market and preventing and we agree with that\nBut we look at what's coming down the pike here with what Republicans have done and we're extremely concerned about where the economy is going to go\nBut to me when we talked about you know for example tariffs again and you got as I said on friday have conservative lost their economic mind\nBecause you have people that are conservatives that would absolutely be against the increased a government causing the increase in prices in goods\nAnd services because the goods are going up and they're claiming that's a that's a good thing that will actually make an economy do better\nActually two responses on that on friday no no no no no tears makes the economy better know doesn't\nKnow we live in this and so people that were conservative around his delusional state of increasing prices helps the economy\nIt doesn't that helps the ... the companies or the industry that it's designed to protect beyond that no\nWhen we get to I mean we've been talking about the blame game in the whole civility thing because on many issues out there we talked about civility when we talk about look you need to get along with everybody well let's talk about the issues you and I've taught gone down this road before and we've looked at what the left as promoting in this country right now and what they're promoting something that we can't compromise on the wrist\nAnd if there is no compromise what do you do as a nation on sanctuary cities sorry not going to permit sanctuary cities I'd open borders there is no compromise on open borders there is no compromise on sanctuary cities\nFree shipping backed by thousands of dentists quip is one of the stuff so that your toothbrush is accepted by the American dented association upgrade your cat\nAnd stop brushing better with quit\nQuit start suggests twenty five dollars and it's guaranteed for life with regional plan sign up now I'd get clipped dot com slash W W O and you'll receive your first revealed pack free with a quip electric toothbrush that's your first refill pack free at G.
