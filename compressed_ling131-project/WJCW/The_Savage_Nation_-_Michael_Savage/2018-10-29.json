opening pages of stop mass hysteria hatred can be infectious and most difficult to self diagnose\nFrom my point of view we clearly see the hatred on the left than in the liberal media but I fear that

visiting Pittsburgh tomorrow or eleven Jewish worshipers were gunned down Saturday White House spokesman Sarah Sanders\nA language as a result of a\nMusic and Twitter but I'm getting a little far from a field that far appeal right now we are in a way honoring and respecting the dead in Pittsburgh but I also referenced the black people who were slaughtered a couple of years ago by that Dylan wrote if you remember him we should\nThat not forget that nine was shot in a black church in Charleston South Carolina June seventeenth twenty Fifteen I never forgot it church members shot as they took part\nAt Bible study mainly older black people nice people bother nobody\nSlaughtered by this maniac Dylann Roof went in there and kill them shot the same with these Jewish people were shot so what is it in the minds of these cowardly psychotic so that they pick on the softest weakest targets\nTo make their at the rain statements you're not going to harm people on the other side are they know they're always picking week defenseless people to attack\nThe same way the Islamic murderers target defenseless people on a Sunday afternoon or whether it's on a bike path in New York or a nightclub\nIn Florida people having a good time always defenseless people should a logical conclusion is armed guards\nIf the people won't on themselves then okay most people are afraid of guns by and large most people's fear guns I've seen this my whole life I've heard people say I don't want a gun in my house and the answer is why well they're afraid they'll use it on themselves or they'll use it against the spouse in a moment of rage\nAnd then there were those of us who understand the difference between fear in reality and we understand that we have to protect ourselves in a society where you have to have a policeman in uh in every home\nSo we come back to the questions of the day which is should armed guards be placed in houses of worship absolutely no question about it just as we came to that conclusion with the school shootings were common sense would dictate that of course most schools have\nArmed guards around them but not to the progressive the regrets of mine is so blind to reality that no matter what the question is they always come up with the wrong answer I Want to know go to some of the callers lined for Jeff WABC welcome to the program what's on your mind\nI'd like to Savage ah I'm actually a genocide seats here not too far from Pittsburgh and I wanted to call up and just tell you that you've been pretty fought on today I'm I've been teaching this for years\nWhen you have a society like ours based on ideals like the bill of rights liberty that were free men and women and then you neglect that year after year after year you get to the point where you're in a post constitutional America and when you get to that point\nAnd you put people against the wall people revert to their ethno nationalism they reverse of this tribal issue and it's disgusting we have to stand with the Jewish community day for Pittsburgh around the world we have the same with all free men and women and we have to we have to remember that we're American we need to stick together um\nMy myself my brother and my ... my brother is active duty in the navy for father's a veteran and you know we we've seen this week the the flow pattern of the collapse of our constitutional order and we you know you get a freeway\nOn how does the collapse of our constitutional order lead to a Nazi ... onto the teeth slaughtering Jews who have nowhere to defend themselves how does that how does that work\nFor the what I mean I'm Dr Savage and no disrespect to anyone in the in any community what what I'm saying is is that what binds us together as a nation was the fact that we believe and individual liberty and we believe and we believe any the rights of the individual and now we're we're the as we see these maniac\nEspecially the white nationalist movement you see this retrenchment into these tribes this tribalism that everyone in that group\nOf women that but you're blaming white nationalist nap all problems in America what about Louis fabric and just last week calling Jews termites what I'm saying is is\nThat no no no no let's not let's not run over that I Know it makes people nervous Louis ... preached anti Jewish anti Semitism for ages last week he joked and mocked Jews and called them termites are you aware of that\nI was not I'm I\nI was watching it on our why you're not aware of Louis ... hate speech which Twitter will not block the regime not aware of it is because the government in the media who are spreading hatred in lies won't even play the tape of lowest power can call in juice termites\nSo before you start saying it's the only white nationalist shore the problem I think you need to look at the broader problem in our society\nLiterally I can I can fully agree with you I was using them as as one example um but but it's the it's the point my main point is that when you have a constitutional order or even take take take a terrible terrible for communism okay where you have I think\nWe're getting too far afield right now and I I Know look you're on the right side of things I trust you know what you're talking about but I'm going to get the uh the wheel back in my hands now I Need to take the ship of the Savage Nation back in my hands because I don't want to go into the constitution and the bill of rights that's not what we're talking about\nWe're talking about the fact that hatred is in the air spreading like a virus we're talking about the fact that the media is the host organism that is spreading the virus we're talking about the fact that without hatred these media entities wouldn't survive a week\nThey wouldn't survive a week if they were told that they had to stop it if you took Jeff Zucker in a room\nAnd you said you stop you a merry and that's on CNN from spreading this hatred against white people against white nationalist because you just jarring them up I'll tell you right now ...\nWouldn't change one word coming out of a Andy bloopers mouth or any of the other characters that worked for him in the chorus line\nThere's no common sense left is no decency left in the media\nSo today I told you are I'm not going to write the whole ship of state but I Am talking about why it happened in the minds of the Mad Men without justifying explaining to different things\nUh ... backed group of regrets ... in Pittsburgh have the nerve to say the Trump don't come to Pittsburgh you not want to hear\nSixteen thousand communists in a group called bend the arc Jewish Action funded by Alexander Soros\nTens of thousands of quote regressive Jews\nAnd now they're rising up and solidarity against Donald Trump\nAnd the board of directors goes along with this do you have any idea what kind of anti Semitism starts up in the country when the average person out there in the end to land says oh it's those Jews in Pittsburgh or don't want Trump there do you have any idea what damage progressive or doing so this nation\nThey should know that after the killing to stop it but they can't stop it\nBecause of liberalism is a serious mental disorder the rabbi wants Trump there the\nRabbi wants Trump they make no mistake about it it's this group of mentally bent individuals funded by Soros his son in this group bend the ... which is quite ironic bend the arc you hear bend the arc\nI Wonder how long it's been since any of them actually walk with an ark with a toe or from the arc and felt the power of those letters and the power of the books and Moses in those letters there's a magic and by the way a power that you can't imagine unless you actually have done it\n\nWhen you stand in front of those Hebrew letters even if you don't read them and you stare at them and you realize that for thousands of years these words of God have instructed mankind\nYou feel something that you can explain in other words there's no way to to explain that you see well anyway I I Want to move on I think I made my point\nSo what point that you want to make is the point\nWABC Liz line for here comes
