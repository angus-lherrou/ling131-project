I I'm not sure that any of my colleagues had one quite like that but uh but all of us have had experiences like this in the last week\nHere's my question why to liberal support their movement by consuming the lying books while our side sits on the sidelines refuses to support independence like Michael Savage asks a listener and then I say stop mass hysteria which will be out in a week so people are put the answers up there\nOne of them said maybe they are at work running their own businesses hiring people getting out of debt saving for retirement well that's probably true but liberals also have businesses\nNext one says because liberals are always all in regardless of the cause liberals and Democrats alike message well independents are Republicans never have which is why the comic book was successful\nWhy make Cape ... and Ford have huge go fund me liberals message well and support each other but unfortunately our side does not many of you think is just going to happen on his own now\nYou have to ask yourself that with a story like this and here it is an asymmetrical Michael Savage all alone no one in the media on my side that I Know of why wouldn't this be a story on fix news network why it's a big story\nIt's a huge story why won't they touch it forget me for the minute I'm surprised that boat tied into rip it off yet\nAnd make believe that it was his like he did three four or five times this year why did X bow tie not do it well there's a story about bow tie and his connections to see you have to understand the connections between many people in the media and the very\nSame ah connections let's put it to you that way\nYou don't know about that of course because you are kept in the dark as I told you many times you only see the shadows on the wall you don't actually see the players nor do you see the people who are lighting the fires behind the players all you see the shadows on the wall so how do I Michael Savage\nThe independent stand a chance in this forest of shadows\nHow I'm going to ask you another question why is it that Trump's war became a number one book on the New York times without any appearances on any TV shows why is it that that my obscure book God faith and reason\nBecame a best seller without any media except maybe a it was certainly on the Drudge Report which is an enormous and big the only TV show I was on was the Huckabee show\nOn an obscure network because he's an honest guy this guy is it on a straight shooter he likes to get it the truth but every last one of them on Fox News is absolutely afraid to talk about me for some reason I think I Know the reason why\nAnd that's nothing to do with the intelligence agency\nSo what I Want to do for you today as ask these questions\nI Want to find out why you think this big story of her connections or her legit connections so far not disproven are not being picked up by the media why I don't understand it you say well OK people are afraid well I'm afraid I'm other increased security as a result of that posting by the way\nBut I have to ask myself\nMaybe there are rogue factions inside the CIA who were actually in favor of\nThe patriotic side maybe not every element of the CIA reports to duty for that bomb that they threw out that Trump pulled as a security clearances of I forget his name Brandon maybe there's a lot of bread and holdovers do you think they could act rogue or are the road is\nGoing to stop the ...\nI don't know I\nKnow this so far in there's no way to go out you understand what I'm saying to you I Am so deeply committed to the truth there's no way to pull myself out of it I Can't I Can't go back there is no going home again do you understand that\nEasier in this business to get to the truth or get the hell out of this business then you're nothing but a clown you may as well get Emmett Kelly up their beeping a horn calling himself a conservative\nJust get Emmett Kelly to get up there belch on the air every day and call themselves a radical wild conservative because that's what you're getting now you're getting files making believe they're really getting the truth I don't see the truth out there it's the same garbage every day\nDemocrats no good Republicans excellent Donald Trump Virginia's Donald Trump the greatest Donald Trump this Donald Trump that Well Donald Trump's great\nBut he's not everything they say is\nNor is he that great by the way\nAnd so here we are\nFacing them use it this morning we read Trump's trade deal with Canada and Mexico on and on on and on the trumpet tears were out they're glorifying the new NAFTA deal did any of them actually look into the deal oh I did I looked into the NAFTA deal the one that was greatly\nLoaded this morning or as some great savior of America's businesses and I was actually stunned to see it's all BS by the way\nDid you know the Canadian oil exports up to two point six million cars will not be impacted by the U.S tariffs on foreign cars\nDid you know that Mexico got the same threshold level of exporting two point six million cars into the u._s. but here's the kicker neither country export exports that many cars to the U.S so it's smoke and mirrors\nIt's all it's just a charade it's just a charade the businessmen who are running the country are doing a very good job in the economy on the economy\nDidn't do anything for the average any out there nothing I saw nothing in this that's positive so what do you want me to do get up you're like Emmett Kelly and tell you it's wonderful biggest the blimps does it every day\nAnd the bloody throw it does it every day what do you want me to do be one of them I won't be one of them I'm an independent I always have been always will be and so therefore I have to go back to the original story\nWhy is this major story being ignored by the media\nWhy how do you let this happen all these talk shows have Colin lines why don't you call in and ask all these great genius is in the media why they don't report about this is it because I brought it to light or what or their bosses tell them no no no no you can't touch that one no no we don't go there\nWe don't go there at all we stick to the basic vanilla\nMaybe you'll get vanilla swirl every once in awhile but you're not going to get into the real McCoy ... we don't want to go there well those are some of the questions that are really bothering me right now because this is a gigantic story which is Dr fraud\nNow don't get me wrong I don't think cabin on is the uh Knight in shining armor that that they want him to be a great choice but he's a Bush\nMiddle of the road Republican how many times do I have to say that to you does not the flaming conservative that the illegitimate or making them out to be\nHe is a middle of the road conservative judge from the Bush administration but even that's too conservative for the communists thieves on the other side\nAnd I still don't understand that despite all of the attention on her why Donald Trump himself does not stand up there and say wait a minute now Senator Feinstein millions of Americans are asking about that China spy that you are driving for you for

being said about white males in general\nDr Savage I'm thirty seven year old white male I'm a doctorate of my field\nAnd I don't go around calling myself doctor because to me a doctor is like when you break your arm or something like you\nGo okay well that was true that was true in jail Dr Ford became suddenly the greatest a neurosurgeon on the planet turns out she just doesn't even practice clinical psychology that was a fraud put forward by the media you know that don't you\nWell she's sitting there talking about the hippocampus and all this stuff like that and that's\nAll I Know that was very cute wasn't that she made it sound I made it sound like such a great neurologist and that's basically fifth grade charade hippocampus you could look at a Wal shot into chiropractors office and see the picture of the hippocampus\nI like to see if we didn't um what was his name then the neurologist that says that oh\nBen Carson yeah that would have been fun and um they didn't call him Dr how come all the barman garbage on the left in refer to him as Dr Carson when he's actually a pediatric neurosurgeon one of the most difficult forms of surgery in the world how come they made and what is it because he's a black man\nTry it yeah well get believe\nBy the way what's your field what's your field\nI felt for them if they\nDon't don't say with such again you you know I don't think you have a good enough image of yourself\nYou say pharmacy like it's not a big deal true pharmacy is a very noble profession a very difficult by the way the you know that when I was a kid you know that when I was a kid I worked in a in a pharmacy I don't know if you've heard that story\nNow for Twenty years well I actually worked in a pharmacy with a doctor compounded prescriptions of course they were pills that get counted that we didn't live in the nineteenth century\nBut he also would take more of a hassle and make prescriptions would you believe it\nOr that damage we still don't make prescriptions until about ten years ago until the government to take our right you know as farms that they make\nOn a pharmacy today do they still growing up various and sundry a a ingredients to make a pill\nThat we really are restricted because we used to be able to do that like very frequently and and you know for Frank and it's like I could make it kind of thing very cheap and very easily to help you out right but you know in big government favors big business your big\nPharmaceutical companies have lobbied the government to where you cannot no longer compound anything that's commercially available ... ...\nOh my God well that's why they tried to debunk vitamins with fake science on a daily basis that\nThey want to make money if you notice like all this stuff in the pharmacy if you look at the at the same exact thing that this call from different in its marketing\nYeah well that's why you're a little little I'm depressed to say the word pharmacist because unfortunately or just science is not useful it's a basically put on the shelf so you can just count out pills that's the problem and the longer making making the medications hey by the way my favorite compounding

a question mark and I put the evidence out there for the whole world to see\nAnd uh we received more traffic on that story than any story I've ever published in my entire career in radio\nAnd yet there's not one link to any website in the country\nThere is no discussion of it anywhere in the country\nYou will not see it on Fox News certainly you want to see it on MSNBC or in the major networks why is that if they're looking into whether capital I had a beer or two wouldn't they be interested in what Dr fraud may have done a who she actually is with that uprising little girl's voice of hers\nWhile I posted this besides being a so called professor at the off brand University in a parking lot she also works at a major university down the street from Palo Alto\nAnd that's cost Stanford and guess what she does at Stanford why she's the head of the CIA undergraduate internship program at Stanford that means she recruits\nNow unto itself there's nothing wrong with that I Love the CIA I think they do great work\nBut way to get more interesting Christine Blasey his brother Ralph the third\nUsed to work for the international law firm a bake a hunch that look that for him created fusion

companies called\nRed coaching at real security services in day to watch all wonderful companies they're run by Ralph lazy the second the I'm the father of a doctor for an route to third now the point is\nIt's a big story and by the traffic I have received on Twitter and on Michael Savage dot com you would think\nOne of the great reporters in America would be interested in it after all didn't we just have a best seller from a guy who wrote a book forty years ago about Watergate some old ... they dug up in an elevator somewhere I don't even remember his name oh what's his name I forget his name I Swear to God I Can't I Can't remember his name he's an insignificant\nAnd yet when his book came out it sold a million copies in the day why is that\nWhy is that because there's a fix and the fixes and\nNow if any one of the connections between Dr Ford and the intelligence agency is false I ask people please this prove any of these points nobody refuted any of those points what you think that Senator Lindsey Graham\nWouldn't you think that one of the so called Republicans on the committee would raise the issue of wait a minute how will will will will she's with the CIA recruits at Stanford what does it have to do with the capital hearings if you can't figure that out then you're dumber than a poster\nAnd yet you buy books that's the funny part about all of this to me and I asked this question this morning because if the Wilders me and maybe you have an answer for me\nHere's my question why to liberal support their movement by consuming the lying books while I was side sits on the sidelines refuses to support independence like Michael Savage asks a listener and then I say stop\nMass hysteria which will be out in a week so people are put the answers up there\nOne of them said maybe they are at work running their own businesses hiring people getting out of debt saving for retirement well that's probably true but liberals also have businesses\nNext one says because liberals are always all in regardless of the cause liberals and Democrats alike message well independents are Republicans never have\nWhich is why the comic book was successful why make Cape ... and Ford have huge go fund me liberals message while and support each other\nBut unfortunately our side does not\nMany of you think is just going to happen on his own now you have to ask yourself that with a story like this and here it is an asymmetrical Michael Savage all alone no one in the media on my side that I Know of why wouldn't this be a story on fix news network why it's a big story\nIt's a huge story why won't they touch it forget me for a minute I'm surprised that boat tied into rip it off yet and make believe that it was his like he did three four or five times this year why did ... did not do it\nWell there's a story about bow tie and his connections to see you have to understand the connections between many people in the media and the very same\nAh connections let's put it to you that way you don't know about that of course because you are kept in the dark as I told you many times you only see the shadows on the wall you don't actually see the players nobody see the people who are lighting the fires behind the players all you see the shadows on the wall so how do I Michael Savage the independent\nStand a chance in this forest\nOf shadows how\nI'm going to ask you another question why is it that Trump's war became a number one book on the New York times without any appearances on any TV shows why is it that that my obscure book God faith and reason\nBecame a best seller without any media except maybe ah it was certainly on the Drudge Report which is an enormous and dig the only TV show I was on was the Huckabee show\nOn an obscure network disease and honest guy this guy is it on a straight shooter he likes to get it the truth but every last one of them on Fox News is absolutely afraid to talk about me for some reason I think I Know the reason why\nAnd that's nothing to do with the intelligence agency\nI Want to find out why you think this big story of her connections or her legit connections so far or not this proven or not being picked up by the media why I don't understand it you say well OK people are afraid well I'm afraid I'm other increase security as a result of that posting by the way", "show_name": "The Savage Nation - Michael
