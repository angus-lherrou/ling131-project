it all in a minute\nBut is it really him or she she you know\nI Know that Trump's rhetoric is cool down already since the start of you do know that you can't deny that\nAnd I personally think is going to have a serious dent in the midterms for the Republicans even if people still go out to vote and that's another question will they turn out to even vote now you know on on the Republican side as much as they would it be for this because America is a very centrist right nation\nAnd whether Cesar ...

be able to get the show anyway whether the show is broadcast on the station and I was almost irrelevant\n[noise] I mean I Wish it was on a New York I have nothing to do with it that they want the somebody a little less forceful than me I guess what what was your main point David five\nPoint as well I was just gonna make a point about the van is that your question authority right but you're always felt for all law enforcement\nI don't know what am I always ... law enforcement how about when the cops beat up that girl in New Jersey where it was eye on that and that's where I'm not always pro law enforcement how about when they show that big black guy to death in Staten Island which side was eye on them\nI don't I don't remember\nWell I was on the side of the guy who got choked to death\nAt that time so don't say I'm always pro law enforcement there are ... cops just as there's rogue everything else\nFair enough can I tell you I'm not a Republican no I don't care so you're\nOkay I don't like people imposing their morality beyond me if I Want to smoke a joint okay that's up to the government to tell me what I can put in my own\nBody understand your classic American freedom loving man and your assumption is that Republicans want to tell you how to live your life and it's an easy assumption to make\nBut the actually the reverse is generally true it's the Democrats who run the nanny state who tell you what to think what to eat what to breed whether he was a plastic straw they had the opposite of the free market Republicans who leave it up to the marketplace so in the purest form you're probably a more conservative person then you may imagine\nI Know you're a Christian man and I understand that but I don't want\nPeople well I'm not a Christian man I'm Jewish by birth and I practice or my faith which is largely that of a worshipping God and uh so you\nProbably don't believe in anything right\nTo say that I said I just don't like people vote in or out you know what I mean I'm not\nI don't think anybody does I certainly don't want a bunch of stuffy old men telling me what I can do with my body\nActually lived as does that make me a leftist feminist\nWhat about the law and order thing with Trump I mean it's just it's only about law and order law and\nOrder a well I Want more law and more owner\nI absolutely you don't want the streets to be safer in New York\nThey are much safer you know New York was back in the day\nWell I'm a no I'm Sorry it's not as safe as it could be if the cops are unable to stop people in advance who are running around are about to break into a store punch someone in the face you know let's not mince words that we know what's going on in that city walk a lot of it's not even being reported\nThe cop should have the right to detain someone in advance of that crime not after the body bags on the ground\n[laughter] [noise] All right\nYou don't you don't read do you [noise] [laughter] well I'm not as ... as your obviously no I'm joking theory books [noise] yeah I Do\nI'll send you stop mass hysteria if you want it\nActually check it out\nOK will be coming in a plane ground rapper so your wife or girlfriend is not offended that opens\nUp one last thing at least he's got a good sense of humor and by the way saying something that most people that I Know said the same thing I Know conservatives who don't want anyone telling him what to do with their body nor are imposing their morality they actually detached\nThe influence of religion upon their their lives they don't like it they think it's their individual choice in their right they don't want the pope dictating what they can do and not do if you know what I'm saying\nOr or such so look the big story today is the sigh of relief in America on both sides by the way everyone signed with relief that no one got hurt let let's for one second\nAll settled back can we all say we're happy that we can side with relief now that this lone wolf not was found that he wasn't more dangerous than he was an impotent man this is impotence\nThe devices the scent according to the best information we can get we're all fake they couldn't even be detonated we don't even know what's in them to this to this minute\nWhat's laughable is that everyone in the Democrats' side wants to be somebody is claiming they got on\nThere now announcing new ones that are being found all across because if you didn't get one you're not on the list you don't qualify to even be ... you have to meet you have to receive one of these now to be a serious Democrat you understand that if you didn't get one you you're just not in the not in the in crowd I'm expecting more and more and more to be announced their very soon\nSo a look and you can laugh at it if you want the human human condition is laughable in a certain way no one got hurt oh a kind of an input of not weightlifting storage uses steroid user was arrested\nWe can all settled down we can all agree thank God nobody got hurt so that's it now what now what do we do we go on where we'd be for the left still thinks the right look like him act like him\nAnd the rights still things to the left as insane and suicidal\nBecause of their positions on open borders a on a leniency towards criminals there a constant constant attacks upon patriots and so I don't know that the battle lines have not been\nI think the battle lines or justice drawn as they were before this event to you and how will that affect the midterms is going to change your vote there's certainly Democrats are not going to change their vote but I'm going to ask you the independence out there and my audience is largely independent it's not really Republican I think the Republicans the knee jerk has\nProbably listen to

an email when you said about the bomber ... was brilliant we should have empathy for someone so beaten down being called the\nBecause my rhetoric if you analyze it is always about America it's always about a stronger America\nAnd they're based upon real observations about what's been done to our roads this nation don't you dare tell me that bringing in thirty or forty million illegal aliens over the last ten or Twenty years by the Democratic party\nHas actually strengthened this country because I Would tell you you're a liar you look at the welfare rolls\nThe demographics of the welfare rolls if you look at the schools in America and the ones you let's look at California which I Know a lot about I live here\nWhen I moved here in Nineteen Seventy five one of the reasons I moved here just because I was a poor student poor grad student with two young children and I had to go back to school to get my higher degrees while working while writing books\nAnd I moved here because I knew the kids could get a great education and California's a public schools and high schools and colleges I knew that they could go to any level they wanted and I was right and we once had the highest scores in the nation in this state and then what happened liberalism as what happened\nAnd where the scores in California now where are the scores in other states that have been seeing in flux of a a illiterate people\nFrom the third world because you're not bringing in people from the third world who are even literate in their own language I'm Sorry to tell you that there's a huge difference in bringing in a non English speaking person who is literate in his own in his or her own language\nYou are bringing in people who are illiterate even in their own language they can't even read or write in their own language now how does that strength of the nation\nIt doesn't which is exactly why the Democrats want them they want millions of ignoramus says that can easily be swayed manipulated in order to advance their socialist agenda and I'm just saying that categorically advance their socialist agenda\nI for one I'm not a socialist my grandfather fled socialist Russia\nAnd he came to America for the freedoms that I enjoy and I'm not going to sit here and tell you I Want to see what George Soros wants for this country I Do not\nI'm not going to tell you that I don't think that Hillary Clinton is wrong and all of the other ... of the left or the right way to go I think they're all a hundred percent wrong a hundred percent wrong there's not even a ... of truth that anything they say they are cynical and they only say these things in order to amass more voters\nAnd to increase the welfare state that's so clear to anyone who's actually study world history\nAnd so it brings us back again to this and put a little guy this mad bomber here who didn't you know the man of couldn't bomb straight so to speak\nYou know what why these bombs what would they made of and how do they get them all over the country and such a short period of time\nYou know as the Philippine doesn't matter whether his family is really from the Philippines and they are more involved in fighting the Communist Party the Philippines\nOn his linked to page sigh access that his grandfather colonel balances are look sigh ac was a martial arts practitioner who developed his own style of fighting course Cy Cy oc collie\nAnd this style was used to fight the Communist Party the Philippines and a hand to hand combat and there's actually a detail the website about the fighting style so what does that have to do with anything that has a lot to do with everything if if that is true about this this guy\nSo he's in America now and he sees a communist movement growing by the day by leaps and bounds you think I'm making this up\nDidn't Bernie Sanders said he's a Democrat socialist that we all know what that really means do we know that those are called ... code words for outright government control of it every aspect of your life from cradle to grave\nWe're pretty far along with that already aren't way\nHow different than most socialist nations Raleigh have breath away from losing it all what really differentiates this nation from socialist nations\nAre when you actually analyze it only a very few things want our Second Amendment right to bear arms none of the socialist nations permit the people to bear arms because that's the last link lynchpin in controlling a population\nWas at a Hitler or ... which is the one who said one man with a gun can can control the hundred mile without a gun remember that one I don't know that was Lenin\nWasn't it Lenin who said the object of socialism is communism of course it was\nSo you know those who do not know the history are condemned to repeat it I Know my history luckily I'm well educated and I know the history of the left wing in the world in in America so now let's boil it down here is a a guy uneducated guy on the bottom weightlifter steroid user\nTypical uh insecure male usually and secure males are weightlifters the steroid users I've known that since I'm Fifteen Years old I remember when I was a young weightlifter in in Queens New York I went to what was then a new a new group of a new a gym I used to go to the gym phonetically after high school it was called American help studios\nThere were new in those days I mean before that you had barbells in your basement\nFrom Joel reader that you use the cold I had them too I've worked out since I'm a little kid I was always like small and why are we in very strong so I started to go to the gym the American studios and I saw a lot of guys that I didn't ... arms and legs and and they're like weird looking but they were all on drugs or some kind\nAnd I remember trying to build myself up to look like one of these guys and a girl said to me it was in high school I Swear to God some of these girls was so smart she set something on line she's don't you know the old weightlifters are insecure it cuts through me like a knife\nSo wow man she's really onto something all weightlifters are insecure as true to this day as well by the way [laughter] I'm not knocking it keep lifting weights all weightlifters are insecure as what she said\nOkay so let's let's put that on the side for a minute so now you've got this guy he was an avid weightlifter muscled bound steroids a muscle shirt and he has nothing else to hang is masculinity on other than\nNationalism so now enter now entered the madness how's the madness entered the man's brain\nWhile the man that says that he's called every name onto the sunny feel humiliated he feels small or he knows that the people that he hates are the ones that look down upon him the elite so to speak\nHe fears that the last shred of dignity that he has will be taken away from him by those people so something in his brain changes brain changes\nYou don't have to be a psychiatrist do agree with every word I just said\nAnd what am I leading to what our leading to is the left is triggering a lot of people now into these kind of acts and it's going to get a lot worse before it gets better if they don't stop and when you see these mobs incited by Maxine Waters\nNancy Pelosi and they are citing them where all deplorable says Nancy Pelosi\nWhen you see these mobs these bombs threatened men like this uh this Mac a bomb or if you want to call him that he feels more and more threatened by the mobs so he gets increasingly mad in his brain and that's the cycle that you have to break\nAnd so you could blame anybody you want the left us already blaming Trump which is ludicrous\nBecause it's just as easy to lay blame at the foot of CNN which is around the clock hatred not only of Trump I got to repeat this Jeff Zucker and whatever his name was run CNN\nYou could just as soon say he triggered this man as you could say Donald Trump to if you have an around the clock array of puppets on your network like CNN or MSNBC do who are constantly mocking ridiculing putting down Trump and his supporters\nNever forget that when you put down Trump to these guys like this guy\nYou're attacking him and when you continue to demonize Trump like you do what you're doing is you're triggering men like this on the bottom\nDo you think that this is going to make Jeff Zucker stopped for one second no neither do
