Can't say well at the bottom of the hour to tell you what you can do if you're attacked by anti far or west or over the mobs because everyone's asking me\nWhat can we do the left us out of control Eric Holder saying when they go low kick them Hillary is saying let's have a civil war they're all trying to outdo each other and appeasing the left wing fanatical Mars now of course\nWhat you have to understand as it's coming to your doorstep whether you want it or not\nThere at war and they want to bring the war to your door already got a rap for you were at war and they want to bring them or to your door I'll wrap for you so you're asking yourself what are your legal rights to defend yourself you don't know well okay\nDan Horowitz and I had a discussion this morning about the law\nOn this and you'll be surprised what you could actually do if they do to you what they did to that man in Portland, Oregon when he's left wing scum ran after the car and hit his car with pipes\nDo you know that you have the right to defend yourself with your cars attacked by a mob you don't have to sit there and wine and call the police and you're going to find out what you actually can do to these these people\nSo now I treated this morning Savage won't stop the mobs one nation will fall and I gave some of my solutions one one of the solutions to stopping left wing Democrat mob violence one one\nFold the nonprofit status of the ACLU and also Ross funded groups that's number one Trump past that authority to authorize the IRS to pull the ACLU was five oh one C. three status because they violated all of the rules of five oh one C. three when they came out against cabinet\nHe can pull all of the uh five oh one C. three which is the nonprofit status of all the front groups that George Soros funds and if these mob these mobs are not funded you're going to pull a lot of the action off the streets number to enact the Espionage Act\nEnact the Espionage Act\nAnd if you can prove that any of these leaders\nNational lawyers guild ACLU I can name ten other groups\nThere all to be found and stop I Know you want me to say it I I'm not a lot of say you're upset that I say that my books name as a stop mass hysteria I'll say it again enact the Espionage Act and the rest of the leadership if they're violating the Espionage Act and he has a nice one for you\nI look very carefully the videos of the left wing mobs and they're filled with illegal aliens who are being abroad out to these riots especially here in the west coast San Francisco Los Angeles Portland Seattle they're filled with non citizens\nDeport any alien courted mob actions arrest them immediately and deport them right over the border\nThese are all legal tactics but what you're going to hear from my attorney and your attorney the attorney the Savage Nation Dan Horowitz will actually make you say are you kidding I can do that did you hear me Savage won't stop the mobs one nation will fall that's the screaming

criminal suggesting criminality and violence listened carefully\nThey have used the powers that they have gotten\nFor all the wrong things they want to keep themselves in how they want to cater to

[noise]\n\nWas the Democratic or any of\nThe new Democratic Party is clearly about violence and you have a choice\nHow do you fight back against violence now there are many ways to do it you can avoid the violence which is the best method\nWhether you're a a sportsmen are not even if you're in the boxing arena or I mean let's say martial arts the first rule is always avoid a fight outside the ring that's the first rule my advice to you is avoid situations where you can let the left wing ... get near you but let's say you were out to dinner with your wife\nAnd a waiter is one of those with let's say rings on his lips\nOr those big ... earrings that look they look like a bugs crawl than areas hanging off each year whatever those symbolized big things hanging off the lobes I don't know what that means I I used to know what a ring and the left the men all around the writing of meant something else now there are some of the rings and things hanging off people's heads I don't know what they mean anymore\nBut let's say you get one of those bug jobs with the rings on the lips serving you and they have you're talking about\nSomething that you believe in ...\nStop mass hysteria or whatever it is you're reading my book and then they go and they tap their little phones and they get a mob to come in the restaurant and they surround you at your table and start screaming at you what are your rights\nYou know what they are you have to run like a coward or what if they tread you out of the restaurant you decide to leave because you don't want to fight\nAnd you're getting your car and these these ah bombs start banging on your car with pipes as they did to that poor man and in Portland, Oregon what are your rights the you know what they are I don't think you do because all I hear are people lining which is how we going to stop them well less you know what your rights are aren't unless you know what the law is\nYou're going to run from them and I'm saying don't run and don't hide Eric says Eric Holder says that the new Democratic Party stands for war and violence that's what he just said\nSo he's very clear at least Eric Holder finally came out from behind a charade of being some nice guy from New York City he's not a nice guy from New York City he's always been a thug from the get go\nAnd now that he has shown himself for what he is you have an obligation to know what your rights are and go back to what I said at first you don't misinterpret Michael Savage\nAvoid at all costs confrontation meaning do not confront these violent mobs that's what they want however if

can avoid the violence which is the best method whether Europe or sportsmen are not even if you're in the boxing arena or I mean let's say martial arts the first rule is always\nAvoid a fight outside the ring that's the first rule my advice to you is avoid situations where you can let the left wing worm and get near you but let's say you're out to dinner with your wife\nAnd a waiter is one of those with let's say rings on his lips or those big earrings that look they look like a bugs crawl than there is hanging off each year whatever those symbolized big things hanging off the lobes I don't know what that means I I used to know what a ringing the left ear meant all around the writing of meant something\nOh now there are so many rings and things hanging off people's heads I don't know what they mean anymore but let's say you get one of those ... jobs with the rings on the lips serving you and I hear you talking about\nSomething that you believe in maggot Trump stop mass hysteria whatever it is you're reading my book and then they go and they have their little phones and they get mobbed to come in the restaurant and they surround you at your table and start screaming

getting your car and these these ah bums start banging on your car with pipes as they did to that poor man and in Portland, Oregon what are your rights to you know what they are I don't think you do

run and don't hide Eric says Eric Holder says that the new Democratic Party stands for war and violence that's what he just said\nSo he's very clear at least Eric Holder finally came out from behind a charade of being some nice guy from New York City he's not a nice guy from New York City he's always been a thug from the get go\nAnd now that he has shown himself for what he is you have an obligation to know what your rights are and go back to what I said at first she don't misinterpret Michael Savage\nAvoid at all costs confrontation meaning do not confront these violent mobs that's what they want to I just read a story\nOn um one of the Web sites that five megawatt liberal billionaires are pouring hundreds of millions of dollars\nInto the midterms against Republicans they're backing the Democratic party liberal billionaires are digging their own grave by backing the communist revolution being cemented by the Nancy Pelosi brigades by the Maxine Waters brigades\nThey're called progressive candidates that's a watch word or a code word progressive is a code word for socialist slash communist candidates\nAre just relented himself which I of alerted to both in my books

technologies another hedge fund don't get me started on hedge funds if you don't mind\nA there was a time that hedge funds were illegal in America it was called wild speculation they destroy the America wants they will destroy America Again it happened in Nineteen twenty nine and don't think it can happen again and it will happen again and who who do you blame when it happens again if the stock market blows out who you're gonna blame me\nI've been wanting you about wild speculation for years but here's the irony you got these wild billionaire speculators who are taking their fortunes and investing in anti capitalist candidates now how does that figure\nWell I'll let you figure it out at another time I explain it all and stop mass hysteria because what they're doing is making certain that the moms in the streets attack you and not them\nBy backing the Democrats these billionaires are keeping the moms from bank at their door steps\nBy backing the socialist communist revolutionaries they're making certain they're not outside the hedge fund offices\nDon't you understand how the game works they figured it out a long time ago they rigged the system and they know how the useful idiots can be used and they make sure that they are baying outside your door not outside their door at least that's one man's opinion\nSo I've been trying to disclose to you some kind of activity and connections that may not be a parent to you\nAnd we read that five mega billionaires are spending a fortune\nTo make sure that progressive meaning socialist communist you're going to be elected as opposed to the Trump team come November and I encourage something here that I think is of interest to you one of the billionaires isn't that man named James Simons\nOf renaissance technologies on the face it when you say well okay it's just a hedge fund he's a liberal with no but there's more to the story who is renaissance technologies they normally\nBack Republican candidates right and they're associated with the so called conservative Mercer family is not correct well who ... who are the Mercer is why are they playing both sides against the mental\nWhy is another

are you a snap plane\nRight prop Don Lemon can't even read the constitution no doubt\nHe would need someone to to phonetically spell it out for him because nowhere in the constitution doesn't permit you to commit violence okay I guess Don Lemon didn't read that in his contract which probably ought to be read out for him out loud\nWith uh some kind of special device you know the constitution does
