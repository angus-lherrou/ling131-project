Hebrew and many people holding up signs that stretch for several blocks near the synagogue made clear it's opposition to the president's visit but ... says it could be positive prompts the president to condemn white nationalism human\nWe on the other hand are just like hey come on over and it's not just south of the board and that's the optics because you've got what's going on with as Trump calls it the invasion and and the invaders which is not true which is ridiculous but\nYou've got this happening and then this comes out so the battle will begin and the fight is on over something like this and the truth is\nI look at this and say I I see where he wants to go with it right I think if you come here illegally\nAnd you have a child\nI question very much a question\nFor people who are poor and coming from places like\nBrought them Allah or Salvador Honduras Mexico or any of these other countries fleeing and they're coming and they have a child there there there is an ulterior motive there\nBut it's different than people who were were birth tourism for the Chinese the Russians are many other countries with a lot of money and they come over here and this happens a lot more than people think and they had their children here because the passport itself means a lot of things\nIt's a status symbol but it means a lot of other things\nIn other countries\nAnd that's where I I uh drives me crazy on both sides\nOne I understand right one I understand\nWhat I Do I get your desperate you're coming here you want your child to have a better life and opportunity in America is going to give you that\nBetter life better opportunity along this can be solved by the fact that you know our immigration system is broken and sometimes I think what Trump does\nAnd right or wrong is something where he's like you know what you guys are dealing with this kind of like what what you know ... with DACA\nAnd President Obama the frustration is you're not dealing with this so if you're not going to deal with this I'm going to do something about it which in theory may force your hand to do something about it which we all know won't happen\nBecause none of them will ever do anything because the reality is they just don't do anything their whole thing is let's let the court sorted out that way nobody can be mad at us and people can blame the constitution or the judges or whatever they can be mad at us it's a broken system\nI look at this I understand what they're going to try to do\nOr at least he's trying to do and how they're looking at this subject of jurisdiction and what their argument is going to be as you've come here let's say you right let's say you've come here from Argentina\nOr you've come here from New Zealand or Mexico you bought a house here you've started a business here you've been here for a year and you're a resident and you're paying taxes and you're you're here legally and you have a child\nThat child should be us is if you come here because you're\nChinese and you have a bunch of money and you're able to obtain yourself a past a birth passport\nBecause what that does is the minute that the ... the thing about the anchor baby is what's the baby's here essentially that maybe that child's real sponsor a ton of people coming here and that's where this thing goes and that's part of the problem what do we have this problem if we said find the child is a U.S citizen\nWith one caviar can't sponsor anybody else to be here\nDoes that change things oh\nYeah that might change things so there's a lot of ways that you can look at doing this I look at it like if you've done it the right way I have no problem with it and I think most people don't have a problem with just coming here for the sake of coming here to have a child whether it's because you have a lot of money and the opportunity for you to potentially and think about if you're Chinese right\nPart of this is the what ifs scenario\nWhat if China goes south again and we have a you know a gentleman square and a rise in all of the the crackdown and the fear factor and you've got the passport the opportunity to bring your family oh that's part of it\nIt's a status symbol and also shows you the well the same thing with Russia and several other places in Eastern Europe where there's an opportunity for people to do these kinds of things and it's more is as much as status symbols anything else there's a lot of ways to go with it\nBut it's it's it's just another fight when it comes to immigration and as much as people get past that from\nThe facts are he's taking on immigration nobody else has Obama had everything he wanted he pushed through Obamacare\nKind of half assed it with DACA could have done more didn't I've heard many people who are DACA recipients were men white and yet the time\n\nSometimes I think you've got to force their hands to do anything and they love the fact that it's they know what's going to end up at the Supreme Court so they don't really have to do anything so we'll see how this goes three two three five three twenty four twenty three and she had been some shows your Twitter you can tweet at us what do you think your\nForeign you against it\nYou think that that that maybe if you're a you know hey if you're here legally you shouldn't be allowed you if you're here legally and you have a child after a specific amount of time let's say it's\nA year right let's say it's a year\nAnd then you get pregnant you have a child that that child should then get birthright citizenship\nLet us know three two three five three twenty

the organization that has some kind of intelligence\nAnd they could care less about the ideology to them it's a business and how can they get people to do whatever they need to do to grow themselves

the crypts and the great street crypts and we had rolling twenties all kind of affiliated enough with each other then we're going to cause problems\nRight so but what what ... the kids that I knew that were gang members when I talk to them they fell out of some of it was that a need some of that as a necessity that this was essentially became their family\nRight now take it to the point where you don't even need to do that anymore because the gangs are virtual and you can energize them that way\nThese groups have become very adept at\nSpreading their message of hate and their ideology on

so what do we do about that\nThis guy is a stone haunted racist who has no place in the American media landscape and yet he is on and they were afraid to fire him now Jeff Zucker she'll be fired as well because this isn't the first time this man has done something like this\nTwenty Fifteen over thirty thousand people signed a petition demanding that lemonade be fired from CNN after he attacked police\nWhen Donald Trump became president\nIn January twenty Eighteen Don lemonade the racist in my opinion Don lemonade introduced his broadcast on CNN with this this is CNN Tonight I'm Don Lemon the president of the United states is a racist\nAnd yet Jeff Zucker does not fire him Warner broadcasting just not fire him a TNT does not fire him so let's look into Don lemons background because now I'm interested to see why he's so twisted and how he's gotten so far as a a hateful person\nYou went to a Baker high school in east Baton Rouge then he went to Brooklyn College which said he majored in broadcast journalism it doesn't say graduated\nThen he attended last year we don't know if he graduated but apparently oh into the hiring laws in America he was moved right up to this position rapidly began as a news assistant that a little station then move right up\nAnd here he is and he has spoken about a lot of issues\nIn September twenty ten lemonade said that he was a victim of sexual abuse as a child and it was not until he was Thirty years old he told his mother about it I'm reading from a computer in his memoir\nCalled trance parents Don lemonade came out as gay\nAnd discuss his color is in the black community I don't know what that is never heard of it and I I like to think I Know words but I guess there's a thing I never heard about gold collar risen in the black

conclusion as to how an overtly racist man\nHold such a position of CNN other than perhaps the payout would be so high\nAnd they'd be afraid of being accused of being racist themselves if they got rid of them because they certainly have to understand that their advertisers on CNN that could be boycotted by people like you who listen to the show I'd been subject to boycotts for twenty five years\nAnd yet this loud is not subject to boycotts go figure that out\nAll right well you could let me talk on this for a little bit more boycott ATM through the parent company I think he'd rather

they rise to the top of their fields if this is a racist society that keeps black men down explained to me please how Iraq Obama Eric Holder Bill Cosby Denzel Washington LeBron James just to name a

mean you name the people that the man's\nName some people I just said he has five men who are African American risen to the top of their field in LA and the legend racist society so I think it dismisses your argument I don't know what you're what you're actually arguing\nThey have overcome much more than had they been white males\nOh they ... oh so you know that for a fact that although Iraq Obama was born into an upper middle class a white family by the way where the grandmother and grandfather sacrifice everything for him he had to overcome what did he have to overcome the rack Obama used his racial identity to get where he is as a matter of fact we're going to turn it around what it actually is\nRock Obama used his rights even said so and his own autobiography\nYou\nKnow you'll listen go go listen to NPR or go turn on CNN where your your friend Don Lemon will make you feel good\nAll right look we can move on what let's lighten it up a bit we've touched on a couple of big issues killers tried to remove his tongue victim's family says justice was served with all that Whitey Bolger\nWhitey Bulger was sort of a market you know about that they try to cut his tongue out and ... out they did what mob killings deal with so called rats they tried to cut out his tongue and gouge their eyes out so there's a new twist of the story he was not killed in a wheelchair and the common area I remember they said that at first according to the latest report\nWhitey Bulger and again I'm Sorry to use the word Whitey I realize it's offensive to some people but that was his name I didn't make it up\nIt might offend Don Lemon to call them Whitey Bulger and his name was Whitey Bulger according to the latest report in hazel in prison he was killed in the cell at six am\nFor inmates walked into the show we'll Whitey was sitting in his wheelchair not funny they were brutally beat him with a lot in a sock and used a share of to try and gouge his eyes out they also tend to cut out his tongue\nAnd this whole lot of blood and bloggers but I don't want to talk about it the killers went back to the cells chains out of their bloody closed then went back to Bulger cell with 'em up and they bucket to clean up the mess\nAs for the motive prisons sources tell seeing TMZ they believe it was a mob retaliation because Bulger was considered a rat and an informant who helped put away several members of the ... the officials believe them up without a hit on blowing removal of the eyes and tongue are signs of such a hit\nSo when you watch movies you know that um are related you think it's a joke and it's all over I think you'd better rethink or that whole concept that it's all over and they're all gone the all white guys are gone you know I think you put that to rest that you think it's all like an old movie you know what I'm saying\nEight five five I don't want to repeat my number that you normally do to catch your breath\nIt's like a like a breather like when you finish your statement and you want to you don't want to sound like one that in the U.S threatens or copying you who say I'll be right back you know and that type ... copied you their entire career make believe their originals I'll be right back what you do is you read your phone number is that\nThere are other topics I don't know what else to talk about the\nUh let's see what's going on in Mexico Trump attacks Ryan proposed against the birthright citizenship Brian's is a snake\nRyan is a typical Republican rhino they want as many illegals here as possible for lowering the cost of doing business that's simple\nVideo shows hundreds of US military vehicles being shipped to you know Trump's really doing it man he's doing it can you believe there's hundreds of military vehicles being shipped to the border it just came up on 'em\nIn for wars Adams Salazar has the pick aj picture footage of train heading south bound reporter they captured in Arizona looking as they got tags on it hundreds and military vehicles sent to the U.S border in anticipation of a showdown with the migrant caravan currently headed to the u._s. should be fodder for Jeff Zucker\nTraining Arizona recently

yeah I think I'll go to the city and see the looney is maybe it's a bad night to drive around with all the drunk 'cause I was told don't drive but not a good night right Ryan not a good night to be in

I don't know where she is today\nIt was the six the fifth grade my mother had a party a Halloween party in his little attached house in Queens she was nice she put on parties for me great mother taught me that you do you think of what your mother does if you've got to ask yourself what your mother has done for you it's taught me everything had to put on my pants at a time my shoes\nHow to dance can you believe this we don't even think about what our mothers do for us we like to grow up and all your mom my mom but you look back when you're a baby that that's just to suffer remember never mind that the mess and being a baby so she threw at Halloween parties I was saying\nAnd the kids came over it had to be the sixth grade\nAnd I was dressed of the devils customer remember to this day I hated it because it was in those days they made toxic a toxic a material is toxic material and everything no one knew they were given get cancer it had amassed a red mask I can smell the rubber to this day it's like remembrance of things passed\nBy proof but its remembrances of things passed by Savage the mask I could smell the rubber I was choking in a today a kid would be a\nProbably hospitalized and I put the mascot I was sweating in it the suit that was like a rubber like a rubber job that they put on like a nut and I'm and I'm sweating\nI don't know how I wound up in a closet with this girl Maxine kissed her she hauled off and gave me a smack in the face but it hit my ear I turned my I turned my cheek 'cause that's what you're supposed to do but I didn't know you got hit in the year if you turn to shake [laughter]\nI turned my face when the smack the missing the hit me in the ... the ring the ear to ear rang for three for three days\nToday she's probably a feminist somewhere in Florida I don't know where Maxine would be today that girl she had to become some radical not feminist no question she hated men even in those days you could tell those are the anyways it's Halloween so as a kid I like the dead and when I grow up I didn't like it when\nI got social conscience and social consciousness I realized Halloween is a pagan holiday it's bigger than Christmas I wrote about it in good faith and reason religious Jews don't celebrate it and they have costumes every day so when the cost of war and Halloween joking come on free stone where they have a custom everyday joking as a joke\nBut I realize that it's sort of bigger than than than the religious holidays in our country because we have become a pagan nation right so I once said that\nWhen my kids were growing up they loved Halloween they always did they still do I guess\nI remember my son said to me that the kids love it you know give it a break\nAnd at the end of the day I Love seeing the children running around you know tonight with the costumes and the thing I don't like is the food that they give them the poison candy is unbelievable you know what all that sucrose does to your

Don Lemon it's that simple this guy's a stone haunted racist who has no place in the American media landscape and yet he is on and they are afraid to fire him now Jeff Zucker should be fired as well because this isn't the first time\nThis man has done something like this\nIn twenty Fifteen over thirty thousand people signed a petition demanding that lemonade be fired from CNN after he attacked police\nWhen Donald Trump became president\nIn January twenty Eighteen Don lemonade the racist in my opinion on lemonade introduced his broadcast on CNN with this this is CNN Tonight I'm Don Lemon the president the United states is a racist\nAnd yet Jeff Zucker does not fire him Warner broadcasting just not fire him a TNT does not fire him so let's look into Don lemons background because now I'm interested to see why he's so twisted and how he's gotten so far as a a hateful person\nYou went to Baker high school in east Baton Rouge then he went to Brooklyn College which said he majored in broadcast journalism it doesn't say graduated\nThen he attended last year we don't know if he graduated but apparently oh into the hiring laws in America he was moved right up to this position rapidly began as a news assistant that a little station and move right up\nAnd here he is and he has spoken about a lot of issues\nIn September twenty ten lemonade said that he was a victim of sexual abuse as a child and it was not until he was Thirty years old he told his mother about it I'm reading from ... in his memoir called transparent Don lemonade came out as gay and discuss this color is\nIn the black community I don't know what that is never heard of it and I I like to think I Know words but I guess that's the thing I never heard about gold color as him in the black community\nAnd the sexual abuse he suffered as a child he has Creole ancestry has great grandfather was a French accent in addition to Nigerian camera ruining and Congolese ancestry\nIn January thirtieth on January thirty

relations with a lot like this and work behind the scenes to make certain that I'm destroyed I think you can figure this out because he knows lemonade is not a threat to him\nLemon was only one of the

that she should have resisted all sex biting him despite claiming in his book to be a victim of sexual abuse himself there's not much here that you can really\nUse in coming to a conclusion as to how an overtly racist man\nHold such a position of CNN other than perhaps the payout would be so high and they'd be afraid of being accused of being racist themselves if they got rid of him because they certainly have to understand\nThat their advertisers on CNN that could be boycotted by people like you who listen to the show I'd been subject to boycotts for twenty five years and yet this loud is not subject to boycott go figure that out you cannot let this go\nYou can't let things like this go because the hatred for whites now is becoming and that Mick in the United states of America and it's one thing for idiots with low I used to be able to say it on Twitter it's quite another thing for this anti white racism\nShe'll be promulgated on major media like CNN and make no mistake about it this is what triggers whites at the bottom to become psychotic killers these kind of words remember what power will remember I have a radio show where I can attack this guy for what he's doing and it gets to that in my system but\nMany of you are listening to the show you have no outlet whatsoever maybe you are poor maybe you have a bad job maybe your wife has cancer maybe you yourself are sick what do you think those of you will not like that this is doing to them when they hear a man like this saying that men like them should be banned from America\nThe biggest terror threat in this country is white men or we have to start doing something about them what do you mean by doing something about them round up white males white males in jail for a white males out of the country what does he mean so now if you're a guy in the bottom\nAnd you're sitting there listening to this you say I'm not going to take this anymore and and something bad happens and that's why a TNT has a responsibility social responsibility to the United states of America to give\nPeace a chance it's that simple ... let me tell you this I Am the most frequently um\nIgnored person in the media that's a
