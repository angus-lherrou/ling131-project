Derek luncheon from scrimmage he handed me a baseball and uh it's got his company name\nScrimmage World Series what is scrimmage their\nImages on mobile training and education platform designed to provide a more personalized engaging in fun experience for learners of all kinds but we especially focused today around corporate education so it helping companies trained educate their people to be the most effective and their jobs\nHow did you get into this uh we recognize the opportunity to win the AIPAC and the market it was going to transform how people consume content and the I've had obviously informed iPhones androids and basically now the future is here where people are consuming\nAny type of content but especially educational content on their phones and tablets and rebuilt to an app that allows us to personalize experience and companies to manage all different types of content\nSo what do you come to a mastermind for what are you hoping to learn why came here frankly because I'm a huge Yankees fan and we're going to go to the Yankee game today a but also because I wanted to meet some amazing people have the chance to network and\nIt melts or who's become a good friend of mine who's also here in speaking and he told me that to be a lot of great people for me to to talk and network with so that's what brought me here\nAs far as a breakthrough what kind of a breakthrough you're hoping for in your business where do you need help I\nThink just exploding our brand right I think we're a right now focused primarily on enterprising and companies and you know we seek to impact education and training more broadly so helping the world understand who's for images and what we stand for and more about where our product is going that would be a breakthrough and I think\nWhat's baseballs as you mentioned are are are token if you will to continue to advance our game of vacation of our marketing\nThat makes sense so talk about this little game of vacation of you know I guess the learning process even for adults I think it's important I mean kids learn when they're having fun they don't know they're learning what adults do the same thing 'cause we are just kids inside that's exactly\nRight in fact we have shown that accompanies when we provide games the people that are they they're very competitive right they are learning they're learning information about their companies but they're competing and they're competing in a fun way as practice and it gives them a chance to you know\nSubconsciously learn while they're doing to realize that they are learning and that's a great way as the dogs we've learned to experience they're experiencing something that's triggering their mind in a way that they remember it and they remember that that association of\nOf being a kid quite frankly is that's all part of it\nHow did you get into this same thing just recognizing over the decades I worked in different training and technology companies and we saw an opportunity and we we went after it and also you know myself I I Love to play and I want to have fun and this was the perfect marriage between technology and and my personality and what we can do is organization\nHow old is this company and and what is the um what is your hopes for it yeah so we're\nComing up in or if you're a business we've recently won loss for words from cheap learning officer magazine American associated for talent development for our technology and innovation that we're bringing to the space\nWe want to be a a global business you know already working on six continents barely we want to be a worldwide authority and the space we want to be the company that people think of when they're talking about more training and education\nNot just for companies but for organizations of all kinds helping students learn in a way it's designed for them\nI mean I can say from experience that sitting in a classroom as a kid was was painful so given the chance for a kid or someone who learns using technology or learns out in the world to marry that with a tool that helps them propel us forward that's what we want to be remembered for so ideally will be a a billion dollar company someday\nSo I you know it's funny because as we watched some of the speakers here at this mastermind any any mastermind\nSome speakers have chutzpah we call it like for example Brandon signing his book you got to have balls you have baseball in your hand I think that's what he's talking about because his sports memorabilia company it started out with baseball's because of the Yankees\nBut I think having this this\nPersonality that lends itself to entertaining while you're educating is a very important part of any educators to make sure they make it fun how do you do that with scrimmage\nSo it goes back to this to brand himself as about representing fun fun in the business world right and then with the technology itself it goes back to delivering content that someone will remember and it's designed their spouse or whether they learned through games they learn through videos or they learn through simulations are they learn through reading you know the old school way and taking notes and things like that\nThat's fine but we collect data that allows us to personalize the content to them in a more effective way\nBut then it's everything around it and it goes back to the community making sure that people understand that especially within the work world you can have fun and they'll learn and still play and that's part of the culture and the brand awareness that we're building\nAll right well if you want to have fun and learn and play with malls and Frisbee and things from the sporting world to care for that one you can check out we scrimmage

challenge comes in to trade in the fall and the cat power it up the cat's out a lot of times those are going to go to recycler is that are just selling it off by the town\nI'm that then goes to people who are selling devices and your data still residing on those chips on the phone so that's where it gets a little bit dicey in my opinion\nYeah that's a good point Todd so if we can turn on that phone tablet or laptop than there are tools\nTo uh I think it's called scrub the drive cleaned whether it's a hard drive or a flash based Dr Lincoln SST but if it doesn't ... doesn't turn on that doesn't mean the data has gone from that ... it just means you can access it\nBecause of a battery problem is screen issue or you know maybe the mother board is damaged but you're right that that still puts your data at risk so in that case should you not trade it in or should you physically destroy it with a hammer what's your take on that [laughter]\nWell if there was my own the answer would be no\nIf if it was my phone um and it didn't power out absolutely not go traded and until I can verify that the the drive has been removed the ships have been removed to either scrub or destroyed right or the thought of you know running it over with your car hitting it with a hammer is obviously not a good option because the screens have different type of\nChemicals and I'm component elements on there that are not very environmentally friendly right not to mention the fact that you might slide your finger open while trying to do something like a good friend your\nBest bet yeah I mean your best bet if your phone's not operational and you know you've got data on there as you get a ticket to the one of the manufacture warranty repair type centers I get a fix for you to give it to turn on 'em and then they raise the data and then traded in\nOr take it to a reputable certified recycler that will actually physically ill advised properly pulled the drive out and destroy it will give you a certificate of destruction and she was properly destroyed and done the right fashion\nYeah great advice thank you so going back to what you said earlier about smartphones and tablets I heard the same thing that you have and all the experts I talked to say that any phone over the last couple of years say twenty Fifteen and newer\nHas an encryption built in which means you can use the factory data setting and the factory erased setting and it should be just fine to wipe that data clean properly prior to twenty Fifteen or or so you would maybe opt for a third party tool that would go through you know comb through all those zeros and ones on that drive to\nReally ensure that nobody can access it who's tech savvy\nBut if it's a computer to a different story altogether there still tools that is recommended to download and\nScrub that hard drive ... which in some cases makes it inoperable before you you traded in er donated any thoughts on that or are there any third party tools you you want to recommend I've I've heard a couple of one's called Phoebe I'll data shredder but there's a few out there\nYeah the the industry leader at in our space that Lisa the product called Blago they also bought a product called ... years ago which they both new cars a kind of an Internet pretty rather is pretty popular to use\nOut there I remember the bottom line is don't just delete your files and thinking it's gone don't even just go to the recycling benefits a windows computer or a Mac and think it's going there\nYou need to properly get rid of that data before you considered trading it in so good advice were chatting with Todd's eager to see is the vice president of Ingram Micro I'd had and reverse logistics division\nI tied refers to information technology asset disposition which refers to the proper disposing of obsolete or unwanted equipment in a safe secure and ecologically responsible manner as well\nSo with that in mind tied for those listening who run a business and they would consider using Ingram Micro size town services tell us about the process how do they get the ball rolling and what separates Ingram Micro XY ten services from other companies out there\nYeah I mean obviously I think the standard respond to go to Ingram Micro ... dot com and click\nThe contact us send us an information but once we receive all the information as far as the number of devices the location of devices or what exactly you are done with those devices some customers want us to ... resell everything we can to help get our value recovery back and help offset the service fees are potentially going to check back and\nA net proceeds from customers just want to have everything destroyed so once you decide how you want all that done will arrange to send our grew up there a pick up all your equipment will put lung power shrink wrap it bring it back into our facilities or we'll go through a standardized process where we're going to capture all the details around the the assets so them make models serial number\nReached devise a will do some basic level testing and functionality tests on the equipment to see it but they'll still does operate and have secondary market value if he wants to try to sell the devices for you um anything that has any sort of data on whether it's\nA multi function printer with the hard drive on it whether it's a phone or whether it's a loose hard drive but it's a USB stick will treat those devices whether their physical Schrodinger raise your prior to resell\nAt once everything is either solar cycle depending on what you are done with it I Would give you fought a record of the show and everything we picked up from you when we took it who took it if it's sold much assault or what your share of the value\nA company with that will be a significant a day to ration destruction basically I'm Dennis ... from any sort of liability that may arise some sort of data breach or a loss of that at\nAll right very interesting stuff Todd the

DVR and of course TiVo software and before the break tad we're talking about some of the voice enabled features of this product\nGreat OK TiVo also provide support\nFor Alexa devices as you said what elections what Amazon calls a video skill so if you go into your Alexei app on your phone or your tablet\nAnd you go to a Lexus skills there's a TiVo skill that you enable which is free at no cost to Alexa users and you've been able to TiVo skill\nAnd then you pair it with a team of box in your home\nAnd then whenever you want to make a channel changed command you can say ... watched NBC or Alexa bring up the channel guide or a leg to skip commercials so just using your voice and an Amazon device you can control a lot of the basic functions of the Boulder Ga\nThere was a couple of ways that you are integrating voice into the ... and then finally Ted how much does it cost what do you predict people can save over the long term by leaving the cable company out of the equation and worked we learn more about this product\nGreat okay so the the retail price for\nA ... a TA is two hundred and forty nine dollars and Ninety nine cents and that's for the one ... that I've been describing and then there is a subscription fee to the TiVo service and all explain in a minute where you get from the tea is served as\nThe ... service is an additional six dollars and Ninety nine cents a month\nOr sixty nine dollars and Ninety nine cents for a one year subscription um some people who really would rather not pay for a recurring subscription fee will choose what TiVo called the all in land\nWhich is two hundred and forty nine dollars and Ninety nine cents as well so you can think of that as kind of a one time up front service payment and then there's no future occurring fees\nOkay got it and the antenna is sold separately just to clarify your on your own for that but they're not too expensive\nAntenna is sold separately and we recommend that consumers go to antenna Web dot org that is a wonderful website that you can punch in your own address\nAnd it will help you determine whether you need a a small antenna or a large antenna whether it possibly needs to be directional those kinds of things so it's a it's a really good tool to understand because not everybody needs the same type of antenna\nI also promised you I Would tell you what a consumer gets with the TiVo services be\nThere's several things that TiVo offers as part of our service\nThat are not available from anybody else and and these unique features and services that we run\nOur part of the reason why we charges service fee\nSo in addition to things like program guide data and software updates and the the kinds of things you would expect from any connected device on TiVo also delivers\nCommercials skipped tags which are delivered directly to the ... box um over broadband connection from the service and so when you're watching a record in ...\nAnd there was a accompanying button on the table remote than just labeled skip\nAnd you press the skip button whenever you get to a commercial break and we'll jumpy right to the end of the commercial and start playing your programming again so that feature and is much more advanced than a lot of what other people do where you have to fast\nForward and then watch for the end of the commercial break and then maybe back up a little bit um we take all the all the mess out of it and just had this one button skipped function we also have a feature we call quick mode\nWhich allows you to watch a maybe a slow program that might be say a a golf match or a soccer match something where maybe the actions a little bit slower\nWe speed it up by thirty percent so that you can watch the program a little bit faster kind of like listening to a pod cast and you know one and a half times bean\nBut we adjust to the audio so that it's not it doesn't make everybody sound like they're all pitch shifted and they sound like raccoons so our our feature takes care of that we also offer a continual pair warranty along with our monthly an annual service\nAnd for the for the length of the time that you own your TiVo bolo TA\nIf there's any sort of failure or whether it's a hardware failure or hard drive crash\nWe will repair your TiVo box for forty nine dollars and that is an ongoing service think of it as a as an extended warranty then make sure that your devices continues to function\nAs we understand that these devices are investment for customers and that we want to make sure that it stays functioning for them so this\nContinuous care warranty allows them to have access to that forty nine dollar repair iffy on so we feel like when you look at a lot of the a lot of the advanced features and and services we provide people will understand why we charge six dollars and Ninety nine cents among\nHow much says TiVo estimate customers will save over a period of time\nSo for for somebody who has made the decision to cut the cord from cable and go to antenna we estimate that the average consumer would save about eight hundred dollars over a three year period by reducing their cable fees\nWhile yeah I've read that in the press

in Southern California is the weather can enjoy the rain here\nVery good word or in wait wait for about a year and a half we've been looking for a dog we had one here for about twelve and a half years we loved it was a wonderful dog we got from an animal shelter\nAnd we got another one from an animal shelter up here in Virginia, Minnesota humane society in Virginia, Minnesota and we just fell in love with the dog and uh we thought would be a great dog we live on the country\nAnd we did everything you know and then when we left or we gave him a donation but the problem we had as when we left or we didn't they didn't give us a lot of information that we found out that dog that was his three and a half years was in a kennel the whole time\nSo we didn't know any of that stuff so then we brought the dog and a dog went right into our dog knows you know and for about the first ten minutes we were just we were sold a static we call the humane society and Virginia and we told them that dog adapted well\nWell then I was on the back yard just pulling up some laundry out the clothes line and then I went around the house and then I looked and I didn't see the war and the next thing you know I was running like a fifty yard dash after the dog down our dry wits about a quarter\nOf a mile and it kept running and running and George I don't want to run on time did you get the dog back\nNo no and so they call the contact humane society and they were more than willing to give us our money back on a dog because they tend to group called a retriever all to cage that dog but now they don't want to return phone calls to us Warren and I'd just asking you replace what what would what would you do in our situation\nWhen I Would do is I was asked for a sit down I Would ask to go there I Would ask to sit down I mean obviously the dog got away from me we don't want that to happen again but you can't blame the main organization their main concern is the care of the animals in the fact that the animal got away they should have given you more background would I Would do is I Would call up tell them exactly what happened to have you had dogs in the past\n... all her life out or forty five years old and a\nCoke I Hope so but you know you've used the same veterinary over and over again you know the vet you've used\nI absolutely heart and would I Would do is get a letter from your

and say this was one of those things that just happened and it won't happen again the dog will always be on a leash and color we have a fenced in area the dog will be in the house that would be my recommendation for you\nOkay you I've tried that the war in but we'll keep plugging away uh hopefully they can return call\nHopefully hopefully they can to the fact that the dog's been in a kennel for so long you think they'd want to find a good home but I understand where they're coming from this was a dog that was in a kennel we got away\nThey got him back in and now they don't want to give them

five plenty of time because lots of great stuff to give away as well by the way if you are owned by a cat\nI stay tuned I got a grand new brand new a cat proud of you guys at every cat guarding the I'm not mistaken for that but right now let me go to Tim and Des Moines hey Tim welcome to the show\nHim how you doing good you are doing super what's up\nMy question is um we have a a two and a half year old bully um you gotta lotta energy and we can't seem to break into jumping on people\nUm we bought him in obedience training um\nWhere there's nine of us in our household seven kids and he doesn't bother us I mean he jumps or on a try to get him to stay down but every time he gets out of the house neighborhoods and the easy to jump on every when he comes in contact\nWith a well I'm not thrilled but it's getting out so often a neighborhood but listen to me carefully okay one of the main reasons why dogs drop off is their way of communicating they want to make that facial contact\nSometimes the best way to teach your dog not to jump up is by getting down but what often happens when a dog jumps up people y'all with a dog and they pay a lot of attention to the dogs jumping actually reinforcing the same behavior they want to stop\nWould I Would recommend that you do specifically when you're walking the dog in the neighborhood on a leash when he goes to approach to people and he goes to jump at that point that's when your basic training needs to come into play\nAt home you know it's kind of interesting because dogs work for the associated memory\nSo you say you have a lot of people in the family so if\nIf six people in the family are doing it one way and one person in the family's doing it another way\nThat is going to confuse the dog will be a good idea to sit down with the entire family say okay this is how we're going to approach it we're not going to let the dog jumped when the dog jumps this is what we do number one spend more time down on his level number two when he jumps that's when the leash and harnessed should come out\nAnd he should get a five minute lesson right then and they're\nThe worst thing that you can do when the dog jumps up is kind of push them away and get down shake them off get down get down because you're encouraging him to jump out more\nSo if you have a dog that jumping that's when the obedience training he's gone through should really come into play instead of saying no no no no no when he's jumping the leash and the hardest come out\nI Know it's not convenient but if you're consistent Everytime eventually the jumping will stop how long did you say the dogwoods\nToo and that\nHe's still young dog with so many people how old are the kids are all different ages I'm assuming\nYeah Nineteen does seven\nYeah and I'm sure the Nineteen year old they're going to rough house with a dog and encourage him to jump up you really need to sit down with the family and really have that ... that talk that everyone has to do with the same like here's what I'm going to do to him\nJumping is the easiest thing I can do to resolve when I'm going to do is I'm going to send you a copy of how to get your doctor do you want\nI'd like the entire family to sit down and just focus on the jumping aspect for now in the book and make sure we resolve that because what happens is if the dog runs out and he jumps around somebody he may be the friendliest started in the world but they don't always the family's dog in the world so\nI Try to keep them on a leash and harness number two you\nTry to take him in introducing to the neighbors and if he goes to jump on someone new\nThat's where the basic training comes into play nothing no no no 'cause dogs are like kicking you have plenty of kids that you understand they respond to negative attacking just as much as they were smart the positive attacking so by focusing on the horizon inconsistent you'll be able to resolve this problem as I said jumping nothing easier ... re chapter in the book\nOh I'm going to send you a copy that help you ought to be the attempt\nYes thank you appreciate it I did you adopt this dog\nUh no we bought him when he was just up eight

with friends he peas in their house and it's embarrassing I don't want to take him\nAny yeah of course it's embarrassing you don't want to take them anymore but let me ask you questions he neutered\nYes you know their name right away as soon as possible to do and what type of dog is it is a tiny Yorkshire Terrier I\nAnd it's like owning a small dog and a big a big dog and a small suit believing they're ready to take on the world is a little macho to the friends' houses that you're taking him to do they have dogs with their own\nSome do but I I now that you mention it when the last time I took them someplace or she has her daughter has a dog so maybe that was in the house prior to me being there\nAnd possible what I Would try to do if they do have a dog at the home before you bring your dog you into the house would I Would do is give your dog the opportunity to meet their dog outside are neutral territory it makes it a lot less important for them to claim territory\nIn terms of the marking would I Would recommend doing at this point when you're going to someone's home in ... new location location you been to before I think you should keep them on a leash in their home which sounds to me like you have a really macho dark\nIf he were paying in your home or if he was going in the same home every single time you went there and you went there are a lot I Try to correct him but at this point when you're taking it to someone else's home I'm assuming it's maybe once a week once a month whatever it is it's really difficult to make that correction so the best thing to do\nWould be to keep more than a lead when you take them to other people's homes or if they do have a dog\nIntroduced them to their dog outside of the environment a neutral territory that ought to resolve it in the interim dealt with your dog does paying someone else's house you want to make sure you get rid of the sane and the owner and that will not attract your dog again as well so\nLet's get you some kids in pet staying in order him over to make sure that you take that with you when you go to your friends on but the factories paying and other people's homes\nIs being really macho if you were going to the same home as I said it would be easier to stop at the fact that you're going to different homes and makes it a lot more difficult so that neutral territory cleaning up with the kids in pet standing order mover that should make the difference for your company does that help you out a bit\nThank you that's a good idea yeah I I Will try that thank you some I\nDon't go

do this ... this is my nieces dog and I I'm just calling to get the information for them because they just can't get her out they want to let the dog and the little girl and that it and I just don't know the answer and then you have to love going to call\nHere's here's here's the resolution to the problem when you have a dog that's a little anxious about being paid for whatever reason what you need to do is let them start to understand you need to build up their confident about being ... what I Would recommend you do\nIs spend a lot of time outside what they'll do y'all with a dog when he peace because he's already nervous so if you were to say no bad dog for we wait till it comes on you just going to make the dog more nervous he's already accuracy nervous that's why he's paying so I Would say a lot of time with an outside\nTouching him is charging him getting him are really really comfortable about being touch\nThan what I Would do is when people come into the house would I Would do with how they treat or a toy by the front door\nHad the dog to treat her toy having just cut the dog walk the walk away just got to rub them and walk away this way starts to understand that when he's touched nothing bad is going to happen only good things are going to happen and little by little you'll start noticing that he's going to want to be touched more and more and has actually is\nSelf image incompetence starts building up you'll start noticing that the pain will stop now at the bottom line is this and this is what what's happened\nI can almost guarantee you\nThat when you have a dog it's a nervous wetter people get upset with that they get a little anxious books paintings no stop it don't do that and that's making the dog more nervous\nDon't react to it ignore it if
