some practical some more working but I really do like\nWhen a product could make life easier and that goes for students and travelers to who may need to carry a lot of things on their back like a laptop some books charging cables and so on so I caught wind of a new product on Kickstarter called Hubbard glide dubbed the world's first floating backpack\nJoining us to explain what that means is Larry robe he is from power glide welcome to the show Larry\nA great great great thanks thanks it says it so much mark\nThe first thing to explain is\nDo do go swimming with a backpack actually does it ...\nIt in in terms of keeping your head above water for what it does do is walk your ah your body moves up and down your torso move up and down right and if you have a normal path\nA on where attached to show shoulders and hip the the the pack moves up and down a way where we're with you um and and and that's a non off the mold because\nEvery every step you take you have to lift the load and put put put it back down and if you've ever ... ran with a backpack on\nThe the forces are very high and everything that goes flying\nSo what's the ... however glide does is a match and you're you're you're running with a backpack and said if the backpack up and down with you it stays that constant height above the ground\nAnd and that cuts down the forces on uh on your body for tremendously I'm you know for for instance if you were to run with a fifty pound backpack um the peak for a\n... way way way when they hit the ground is three times higher hungry and fifty pounds that we're we're we're with the harbor glide it stays constant high above the ground\nSo you don't have to do the salary that in ... seller rate it and just put the concept for about ... the er sixty pounds on on a on your back and\nThe the the the ... therefore it's much easier to either walk or or or ... and ... with a heavy load or friend to catch a train or or or if you're of class you know you don't want to miss\nGot it okay so it's been said that good technology solves the problem so with existing backpacks the weight uh fluctuates on your back but with ... as the name suggests it\nKind of harbors in one spot and that reduces the stress and wait load on your back and your neck and your knees and your ankles while you're running around the city that's basically the idea of correct\nRight right right and and and the mad and imagine if if you ran downstairs for for for for for instance the ... it's a subway we we we we have those ... in Philadelphia\nAnd ... if you go downstairs every every step you take with a normal backpack your feet to stop\nThat then you have to stop the load in ... that puts it even more for you with a ... ... ... you can just go down there your feet stop but the load never stops it just moves they glide down then the very easily\nNow does this reduce the impact of force on users by a little bit or buy a lot I mean can you quantify it with let's say a percentage of how much your technology can reduce strain\nSomewhat right I'm I'm a scientist cent per yeah professor at ... University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia So we actually made those uh ... measurements in my lab and we publish them\nAnd and they basically you can actually measure the force the load\nIs exerting a on a on the person and what we found is third during a walking\nUm it produces these forces are on the person by eighty two percent and and ... and and running where the forces are even higher reduces those by eight eighty six percent said\nWhile separates yeah that's it that's a huge difference indeed and this is a much to do with this\nPatented technology that you use called suspended load technology or S L G in plain English can you explain how this works I mean there's this like hydraulics is it a gear system how does harbor glide work on these special backpacks\nThe way that that however glide a work that is by ... spent a lot of technology and and the basic difference is ah we used to phrase there ... there is there a frame that\nCame to connect to the person and it has a shirt shoulder or innocent had felt\nAnd and and there's a second framed to to to to which they ah we're we're told the bag and and and the load we suspend the second frame from the first frame through an elastic ...\nVery cool we are chatting with Larry aroma from Hubbard slide this is a new Kickstarter project to say it's a high tech backpack if you will that is designed to reduce strain on your back and other parts of your body as you're carrying\nA big load whether you're a student maybe you are a traveler or you're a hiker and I know that you would that in mind Larry you have different models different frame sizes to choose from\nCan you give us an idea of how much the backpack start at and what the size options are\nWe have a large bed backpack cog called called the ... uh and and that that says ... fifty five leave leave leaders and right now that that's going\nFor a four hundred and Ninety nine dollars on Kickstarter and we have um three small pack where we were ... which have the short frame that but the individual bags can be a ... exchange so we have three bags one's\nCalled the tactical and others call the hiker and it it and and what one is called the commuter\nOkay so the product is one word Hubbard glide and congratulations Larry I understand that your campaign has already raised twice the amount that your minimum funding goal was so\nKudos to you and uh if I encourage our listeners also as we wrap up to check out videos of hover glide online it's very impressive to look at and as a frequent traveler myself this is something that I'm anxious to give a give and go so thanks again for your time Larry\nOkay great thanks so much or is there a real pleasure chatting with you\nThank you to my sponsor a tooth Chuck it out is powered by a sous creating technology for today and tomorrow smart life a sous for those in search of incredible visit a suit dot com slash us\nSlash radio for more info and you ask dot com forward slash us forward slash radio\nA central tenet of the American dream as always been that the next generation would do better than the one before it education was the essential key ...

Would say that the vast majority of intrusions are invisible from the front right so even a like a ... let's take a major risks being fire\nFor a break and I'm In in either case with fire the way that most people would assess the risk of fire is due I see the flames or smoke\nRight and you can either see it immediately or you can see it at some point in time and\nThat's the way that I'm most fired\nWould I think function as well I rarely a I don't think that they would necessarily break down the door\nUnless there was some things are happening in in in that case the your friends and

remotely\nEnable it but because I have the safe I have six system installed again to piggyback on your existing alarm system I was able to open up the up and remotely enable it so that's another cool

state people don't realize what a pretty standard is no snow yet not yet both given an hour anyway what can I Do to help you out there that you get\nA cat I have two cats actually I had six cats altogether\nInside and outside cats they can go in and out I have to go boxes one of the cats in eight years old and one of the cats is two years old\nAnd I've seen both of them and the cat box and now one of them well she has blood and urine and I'm taking are down for some test this coming week uh to see where the blood is coming from\nYeah well let me let me just other one let me stop you for a second it doesn't make any difference which one has the blood in terms of and I'm Glad you're taking the cat to the vet that's critical just one could be your neighbor could be any number of things but listen to me carefully when you have cats use the litter box and all of a sudden they may not use the litter box in the same way\nEven the cat that's not sick ... may may stop using it based on the fact that the scent of the other cat who has a some type of physical physical problems dissent is different may send the other cat out of the litter box to clean my areas as well so is that what's going on\n[noise] well actually um\n[noise]\nI was cleaning up some urine and our computer and I looked over and they're the cat is the other cat keen on the rug\nThis is the cat with out in the cat that is not sick right\nAnd then my heart but he he came out and they went to his restaurant on it and it's we're after him and looked over and here she is opinion on a rug or on his rug right in front of us\nAre yeah but they say here's the difference here's here's what we're missing here the urine that the cat that has the blood and urine\nThat urine smells so different that may be creating a scenario with the cat that he's healthy\nFeels he needs to claim territory the fact that he went into your husband's bathroom impede there because the scent of yours there no matter how good and your husband may be okay that's the number four no point in fact and number two the factories going in other areas is just the concept that the urine smells different in the box of what you need to do at this point\nIs make sure you get the captain about what you're doing I Want you\nClean up any areas where the cat had previously gone with a product called kids in pet staying in order them over because if you use any of the products in your lab ammonia you're putting down the same old or you're lifting up\nBut I think at this point the most important thing that you can do is make sure that you get that cat checked it could be a urinary effects could be any number of things are so the cat that does have the blood\nIf that cat is not using the litter box it may very well be because when he does use the litter box their pain involved within urinating or heard urinating therefore she's not going to use the litter box is consistently so here's what I'm going to recommend\nGet our check by the that what you're doing\nGet yourself a brand new litter box today take the other one's wash 'em out put them in the garage get yourself a brand new way to box but some brand new leader in that litter box and let's see if that doesn't resolve the issue but the first thing we need to do is clear up the urine problem with the other cat and that's so important because\nWe don't want the cat not being comfortable but that's the reasoning behind it if a cat has a little bit of pain just pain once in a little box back and forth or out of there\nNo yeah I've seen her in it digging yeah and then she comes out and there is you're on the floor with ...\nYeah well that's what you need you need to get it to the vet and I'm surprised you about his way to want to know why you're not getting to the cat to the vet today\nWell because we live in an hour and a half away from the\nThe closest that you're really in the rye or next week yeah yeah no there's no there's no closer to your\nWell she's ... she's been on an antibiotic pretend my there's a lot of trying to clear it up that way yeah\nThere's a lock on your hip I you know what I'm going there there's nothing I Would do until you get is taking care okay there's nothing you can do is not fair to the catcher in the meantime W what am I just don't put you on hold I'm actually going to send you a coupon for kids in touch screen in order to ... I Want you to clean up those areas you're going to need it when the cat comes back but I Want you to make sure\nThat you get a clean bill of health it's not fair\nTo try to correct the behavioral issue if there is a physiological issue causing it if the cat is not comfortable in the litter box and you gotta catch picks up the scent of the the different smell of the year and that's going to cost me even though they go in the litter box they're trying but the association with pain is there and remember\nThat dogs and cats and learn to the associated memory so that's what you need to do right now\nGet a clean bill of how to answer and I can't believe that causes that you have to use its an hour and a half away that sounds pretty amazing to me but\nAnyway they need to clean up that bladder infection or whatever infection it is whatever they need to do and then once you do that clean up all the areas in the house the kids in pets and then give me a call back will go a little bit further if we have to and I do appreciate that phone call\nAnd the phone number here at the pet show eight seven seven seven to five eight to five five eight seven seven Seventy five\nThat's what you really need to do at this point in other words you can't just separate 'em that's not going to resolve the issue I die I send you a gift on the show\nWhere she stretches their mothers I just\nI don't know I understand that but you have to get them to get along with each other and little by little by little keeping them separated it's only going to make the problem worse it's like when people are separated they don't know what to expect of each other but the more time they spent together the quickly they learned that you know things can work out that's what you need to do support I don't remember they send you a gift and we had a show\nLike you know sends a yeah support that I said you did I send you a gift not again\nOkay I'm going to put you on hold I'm going to send you a copy of

Joe\nAt nine o'clock in the morning what you need to do is when the dog is being assertive with you when the dog is dumping he still mouthing at this point so when the dog is jumping on you and your reacting to the dog you're playing with him as if you were another dog that's the way they react to each other except you don't have first so his mouth and teeth are new hurts\nSo the resolution to your problem is when he's reacting in that way is to put the leash a harness on him and that's when he needs to go through some of the training exercises\nHi daddy and learn English and then leave it on them when you're home leave it on them when you're with him and this way in other words right now and here's the thing let's say I'm assuming does he do the same thing with your kids\nHe does he do with me all the time only sometimes on the other nobody but he lives with her dad who lives with her grandkids yeah right my kids OK doesn't that you'd react the same way with with the kittens Heinz\nOnly sometimes when they're ready to take a nap and my hunch at his face\nAnd I want to do it has had the trainer trainers confronted backed by saying within that's the point where you have to establish not negative with positive authority with the dog\nI'm not sure on that I see that's the bottom line you know there was some great trainers out there I don't know your trainer from from anyone but the bottom line is so many trainers focus on correction rather than focus on teaching the positive if you focus on correcting\nThe dog is sometimes getting more attention for being bad and he's getting for being good so when I'm working with a dog\nAnd the dog is reacting in the way your dog jumping up grabbed my arm then I give them a ten or Fifteen minute lesson and then I play with him again if he's still becomes assertive you get back to the basics then I let him go get until he realizes what's going on this is an eight month old book the combination of a of a golden do know is it an an an an a a\nBernice mountain dog really emotional and a poodle way Bernie set a poodle just first of all the pool is the most intelligent of all dogs British mountain dog is is a lot but that that's the problem and the more intelligent dog use the more difficult they ought to train for example if I'm working with a dog and I said to the dog sit it looks up into the war and you're talking to me\nThen I Know I have a bright dog so they're going to challenge the bottom line is just like a good teacher when you're being challenged you have to take that energy and focus in in a much more positive direction really simple really easy but that's what you need to do\nRight so I should keep the leash on him and then when he gets like that just yank\nOn only the only one y'all don't leave it on and when you're not on what I wanted to get when you're alone but when you're home and I'm surprised how much training as he gone to already\nLaid ought to take them and I don't you know not to all the time they have like this she does but\nIf he's eight months all they've got to a training a few times and he's had a few lessons then everyone ... she hears the most important thing I can tell you if you do it one way and your daughter does it another way and someone else starts at a third way the dogs never going to learn dogs learned to association sort of continuity is critical\nEverybody has to do with the same way for example if you would hire me as you're trained by the way I'm not available but if you were to hire measured enjoys I Would come to your home but I Would only come home and work with you and your grandkids at the same time I would want the whole family\nThere so that I can make sure everyone's doing at the same way to the consistency which is going to make the dog learn a lot better and they were just I got to move on but don't go anywhere I'm putting you on hold on sending you a copy of how to get your dog\nTo do what you want don't maybe ...
