and facts are amazing but it it's who's giving you the facts what numbers who's asking the questions how were they asking the question that speak\nThe truth is that they had a big lead at one point in time but I'm not quite sure that there anymore\nHere's what our brand new and be seen as Wall Street journal poll shows with just over two weeks ago until the mid term among registered voters Democrats only seven point lead and the generic ballot forty forty one that's down significantly from the twelve point lead Democrats held just a month ago for Kavanaugh when it was fifty two forty\nYeah and now you've got this caravan which I think it's going to be a big thing but\nTrump's been going around and you can do it everywhere he goes pretend I'm On the ballot for attack because

assume nominee in the house maybe more of a trickle so he said hey pretend I'm Out there and guess what right now for Trump\nAsked for President Trump he has his best numbers yet in our poll among

approve this approach but again among those likely voters his numbers didn't get worse forty five percent approve fifty two percent disapproved\nBut it should be among voters that show up and that's

problem because we voted like crazy for Donald Trump and so far with thanking God that it wasn't Hillary Clinton which is true and we've gotten a lot it's a lot of good stuff but the Alamo now is the illegal immigration army that is swirling toward the bus or surging toward the border\nThis is his Alamo and if he does not stop them it will become has Waterloo you left referred to Napoleon to see what the Waterloo was\nAnd as a student of history Waterloo was not a good place for Napoleon\nIn order for Trump to stop this massive army of invaders and to make sure this is not a Waterloo for him and for America\nHe has to crack down as fast as possible on Mexico and make them do the job that they promised to do when we were finagle into signing the NAFTA deal with them because they're that horses out of the bond as they say in American parlance\nAlthough some of the topics there are other things I Want to talk about the uh immigration thing is about the biggest thing on my mind the taxes on the Powerball thing is another big story that I Will get to a little later on in the program\nAnd what else oh did you hear the new opening Tonight Show I cut out the other two books and now the Savage Nation the most of law author of stop mass hysteria would cut out the other two books because we had to promote now since you're listening to the first hour of the show I'm going to reward you\nBecause we're already moving on to the end of October which means there's only two more months or so of the Savage Nation as you know it\nAnd although I Will make my official announcement around November first I mean I've already made the announcement\nBecause people are confused I met someone over the weekend he said gee you're only doing podcasting in January I said no I'm doing one hour of radio across America\nEspecially here in San Francisco you'll be able to hear me that first hour the second hour will be a podcast\nOr another piece of a radio show but the point is is that if you're losing me ask you will oh into political considerations in some markets that I mean major markets where the audience is I Love\nYour going to have to listen to my pod cast every day in a cost you nothing that's the good news is free you got nothing to lose so it'll be a hybrid one hour of radio one hour of broadcasting and most of America except in liberal quarters\nOn the east coast where they only want one position position to be expressed and by people who are moderate Republicans or modest Republicans are middle of the road Republicans posing as hard conservatives heart conservativism is gone\nIn the American media as far as I can tell\nSo you want me to play Davy Crockett you want me to uh\nTalk about other I don't know I'm not even in the mood to talk about the illegals I've done it for twenty five years every one of my books going back to my first political both that is sorry for that has an issue about borders language and culture I was laying in bed this morning I got up at four AM and I thought about it this is my signature issue\nMany Johnny come lately has jumped on it over the last few months they make believe they knew about a care great welcome to the club now what are we going to do about it\nTell me what you're going to do about it now that we're all talking about it what are we can encourage the president didn't to do now that we're all talking about it\nWhat should the president do now that we're all talking about it what do I as an immigrant sun suggest you do\nIn a compassionate yes yet forceful way to prevent this army from invading the country telling I don't want to hear any more about it's a humanitarian crisis that's under rubbish that is our absolute garbage look at the young men they're stronger than you are\nMuch stronger than most of you are there in great shape wearing new clothing someone's feeding them none of them look like they're hungry who's cooking for them along the road they went on the road from us who's making them food every day where's the toilets\nI I mean can you answer the question are we build that wall build that all we hear it but nothing's happening here in San Francisco I Want to lead a rally\nI Want to get a ten thousand people down by city on screen build that stole build that stall build that stole build that stole that's a joke some of you don't even get it you don't have a a a comedic gene than you are comedy Jean you need a gene to even receive\nWhat'd you go back to my first published book I'm looking at my beautiful I'm using a Trump biology now Trump phraseology I'm looking at my beautiful shelf who am I brought a studio at the beautiful covers my beautiful books and my first beautiful political book\nIs Michael Savage the Savage Nation and what is the subtitle that's the great picture of me with the sun glasses under the Golden Gate bridge with a star over the uh glasses in the eyes voted I look good luck on your age my God saving America from the liberal assault on our borders language and culture\nSaving America from the liberal assault on our borders language and culture so I've kinda been after a while a quarter of a century that's so\nWild Jake Tapper was still taking Ritalin or in junior high if he took her at all and I don't know maybe that maybe he escaped that you show looks like a type it was raised on something other than Americanism\nAnd here's what I said if you're tired of being attacked in school whenever you celebrate the achievements of America huh\nIf you're weary of being trampled on whenever you speak in favor of morality if as a boy scout you become a pariah while the perverts have become the victims you've come to the right place Michael Savage the Savage Nation that was a huge bestseller do you know when you know what year that was two thousand and two\nTwo thousand and two\nTwo thousand and two so believe me the issue of\nBorders language and culture has been near and dear to my heart\nBecause Without Borders there's no language and culture the borders are the key to the entire a subject\nWithout Borders there's no language and there's no culture it's a ... mix of\nThings and it's no longer a cohesive nation which is exactly why the sorrow sled mobs want our borders dissolved in one open borders do you understand finally what they want and why they want no borders why do they not want borders in Germany or France or in Hungary\nOrange Sweden or an oil Finland\nWhy did they not want borders there why are they flooding nations with people totally alien to their culture in every way imaginable not just in racial ways in every way imaginable why they try to destroy the whole ... of these great nations why ... you'll have to ask the Hungarian emigrate\nUp there on his ranch somewhere and could tone in New York\nWhere allegedly someone put a bomb outside his ranch God that's a terrible thing we don't wish down anyone I certainly don't wish it on any one I'm a man of peace apparently sorrow set a idol I picked up a bomb in a post office somewhere in town and they throw it in a field the next day but here's the odd part about the ...\nBomb story that it doesn't ring true to me he knows he's being blamed by the entire conservative movement for destroying our country and destroying our borders we we've all we've all known that and yet he gives a speech today where he says Trump will disappear and twenty twenty or even sooner\nNow why would a man who was just allegedly allegedly frightened by a bomb that went off somewhere on his property if that's true why they suddenly come out and attack trumped the next day there's something wrong with that story but you see I don't work for the NSA\nAnd I do not have a walrus like moustache so I don't know the truth to that are speaking of which were about Seventeen minutes after the hour All right oh it's Nineteen\nThe our now if this for a podcast by the way here's what would happen I wouldn't take a break right now I Would actually start talking now I just gave you the the prelude you got the preface to the to the show I can go now for another hour without a single break I don't know where it comes from the young guys that work for me to say how do you do it\nI said how do I do it they say I Wish I could be like you at your age I should stop talking down to me how do I do it because number one I Believe in what I'm saying and there's nothing like truth to get you up every morning see if you believe in what you're doing\nYou'll get up in the morning and look forward to doing it nothing could stop you because the truth shell set you free\nIf you don't have your voter registration card and it's okay uh kept bringing a rapper slash and or federal or state issued photo ID\nIn Tennessee there is a high

America are losing their will to live\nAnd they don't know what to do they came out to the polls in the last election with one last hope that one last candidate who was not a politician would save the country\nAnd thus far they're not sure what's going on\nThey love the rallies they loved the speeches they like many of the policies they thank God the truck that Trump is there and she is not there but they don't know why he's not doing anything more visual for them with regard to the border\nThey don't know why\nIt's one thing that give a speech with Ted Cruz and inspire people that's very

here's why I'm angry\nRussia did violated and I have no way of knowing that I don't know neither the you all we hear as both sides that Russia did violated our Russia didn't violated the first rule of

tough guy sitting in your arm chairs and want to drop nuclear weapons on every country on the earth\nI'll be very clear I Am a man of peace and I've said this from that they're starting to radio I'll say it again sometimes you can confuse me with someone else because I'm very vocal and I\nSpeak very loudly and people get afraid of what I'm saying but they don't actually listen you know that I'm the most the least quoted most published man in American media I Am the most publish least quoted man in the American media repeated again write it down\nWho is the most published least quoted man in the American media me what am I trying to say to you when\nYou figure it out you figure out what I'm trying to say to you so let's go back to the issue at hand closet with\nRussia the United states war and rumblings of war\nAnd the bellicose little man with the walrus moustache running around strutting around Russia threatening everybody with bombs in unless they cave in to him now let's look at it from Russia's point of view because in order to negotiate with an opponent\nAren't you taught to understand the opponent's position whether you're playing a game of football or whatever game you're playing politics war isn't it isn't it wise to know the opponent's position you have to you so how does Russia look at the situation\nThere saying wait a minute you want to put short range missiles in Europe facing us\nRight on our border you want to put short range missiles in the Baltic states you want to put them in Ukraine and we're not supposed to do anything about what are you crazy now that would be the equivalent of Russia coming in St us our new ally as Canada and Mexico and we're moving short range missiles into Mexico and Canada\nAnd unless you let us put missiles into Canada and Mexico we're going to build more missiles ourselves so that's how Russia is looking at it from their point of view in other words we're moving missiles are up to the border and was saying how dare you violate the agreement\nNow this is a very dangerous escalation so I wake up over the weekend again I have not slept really well for three nights for a number of reasons one is\nSee I don't think you understand where I'm coming from it and it's important you do I grew up in an age where we thought we'd be a nuclear wiped off the planet in the Nineteen fifties and in our school rooms some of your old enough to remember this I Know you do remember it\nWe were practicing with air raid drills and schools can you believe it oh today they'd probably a breakdowns they wouldn't let them do it we did duck and cover you could look it up on YouTube\nWe were told by the teacher that any this was in the early fifties now I was in grade school\nAnd we were we were trained to jump on to the desks when the alarm bells went off or go into the closet in case there was a nuclear attack on New York city can you believe this now could you imagine the hysterical school ... moms today and the the men who are not really men in the school business saying that it would cause anxiety and the children\nIf they had to actually run under a desk because of my anxiety you have to medicate them they start to scream and yell what a nation of weak lungs so I grew up\nHiding under the desk 'cause I I used to like it it was a lot of fun that got me away from the study I hated school\nI couldn't stand sitting in a regimented at you know environment you got to play with the other kids on the desk was crazy things I mean imagine a bunch of young school kids being forced into a closet what the kids did to each other we play with each other you can't believe it the fun we had we didn't take it seriously we didn't care kids are wonderful\nKids are resilient yes yeah go jumping the closet though the idea of a nuclear weapon going off in New York was not real but we know that was such a threat hanging over our heads of a nuclear you know and to change in fact I Lived in Queens New York when I grow up but it was a kid rather when I moved to queens from the Bronx\nI remember to this day there with Nike missile installations in empty lots along like in the LA pond park area with Donald Trump grew up would you believe that I remember to this day I could almost picture in my head\nDonald Trump grow up in Jamaica estates I grew up on the other side of the highway in the middle class attached houses and in that area there when Nike missile installations with missiles pointed to the sky would you believe it\nSo what I didn't get it I didn't scare the missile I was proud that we had missiles pointing up we loved it all the boys love that we had defensive weapons in our neighborhood would you believe it\nWe don't sit there frightened of it we understood that there was a potential for a war and we were glad we got a nation run by a real man calls white the Eisenhower who was ready and willing to take on the enemy\nSo now ... fast forward to to today I'm In politics as a commentator in America\nAnd I've been doing it a long time and I wake up and a man that I thought was a man of peace Amanda was not an interventionist all of a sudden his administration seems to be hijacked by the global is who have come in as Johnny come lately they've been uh\nYou got to understand something you don't even see what's going on it's my job to see it for you\nI Am the SERE before I Am the talker\nAnd I see that the Trump Administration of today is not the Trump Administration of yesterday and that the global lists have taken over his administration notably when that\nWhatever is I Can't even remember his name I block it I Want to think of it that outcast that ... that much that showed outcast came in I don't know put them in there or have some suspicions but this Neal con\nBolton is you've got to remember is history every politician has a history both him and his knee ... got us into the Iraq War by lying to Bush\nAnd saying that there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq when they have a war that Saddam was about to set off a nuclear war against us do you remember the justification\nHere he is again first he lied about Syria and he tried to get Trump to launch Tomahawk missiles not oh I don't two months ago Nikki Haley was screaming your head off and the un ... threatening Syria I was terrified that they were going to do it and set off a war

you go back to my first published book I'm looking at my beautiful I'm using a Trump biology now Trump phraseology I'm looking at my beautiful shelf or am I brought a studio\nAt the beautiful covers of my beautiful books\nAnd my first beautiful political book\nIs Michael Savage the Savage Nation and what is the subtitle that's the great picture of me with the sun glasses under the Golden Gate bridge with a star over the uh glasses in the I voted I look and look how young age my God saving America from the liberal assault on our borders language and culture\nSaving America from the liberal assault on our borders language and culture so I've kinda been actor so while a quarter of a century that's so\nWild Jake Tapper was still taking Ritalin or in junior high if he took her at all and I don't know maybe that maybe he escaped it sure looks like a type it was raised on something other than Americanism\nAnd here's what I said if you're tired of being attacked in school whenever you celebrate the achievements of America huh\nIf you're we're being trampled on whenever you speak in favor of morality if as a boy scout you become a pariah while the perverts have become the victims you've come to the right place Michael Savage the Savage Nation that was a huge bestseller do you know when you know what year that was two thousand and two\nTwo thousand and two two thousand and\nTwo so believe me the issue of borders language and culture has been near and dear to my heart\nBecause Without Borders there's no language no culture the borders are the key to the entire subject\nWithout Borders there's no language and there's no culture it's a ... mix of\nThings and there is no longer a cohesive nation which is exactly why the sorrow sled mobs want our borders dissolved in one open borders do you understand finally what they want and why they want no borders why did he not on borders in Germany or France or in Hungary\nOr in Sweden or an oil Finland\nWhy did they not want borders there why are they flooding nations with people totally alien to their culture in every way imaginable not just in racial ways in every way imaginable why they try to destroy the whole ... of these great nations why ... you'll have to ask the Hungarian emigrate\nUp there on his ranch somewhere and could tone in New York where allegedly someone put a bomb outside his ranch God that's a terrible thing we don't wish down on anyone I certainly don't wish it on any one I'm a man of peace apparently Soros set a\nIdol I picked up a bomb in a post office somewhere in town and they throw it in a field the next day but here's the odd part about the ... bomb story\nThat doesn't ring true to me he knows he's being blamed by the entire conservative movement for destroying our country and destroying our borders we we've all we've all known that and yet he gives a speech today\nWhere he says Trump will disappear and twenty twenty or even sooner now why would a man who was just allegedly allegedly frightened by a bomb that went off somewhere on his property if that's true why they suddenly come out and attack trumped the next day there's something wrong with that story but you see I don't work for the NSA\nAnd I do not have a walrus like moustache so I don't know the truth to that\nI'm going to ask you again you are now an advisor to the president of the United states of America\nThe caravans have now combine and they've grown to at least fourteen thousand illegal aliens who are invading the nation and it could become Trump's Waterloo while right now it's only Trump's Alamo it is an existential threat to the nation and to the presidency of Donald Trump\nNow you've seen the footage\nStrapping young men and good new clothing in front of them women pushing strollers with five children in the stroller are we supposed to take care of all of these people every third world impoverished person in the world is coming here and the truth is we can't take care of them all\nOver there is another question that is begging to be answered according to the Democrats we are a racist nation\nAccording to the Democrats were very very bad to illegal immigrants and were racist to Hispanics and what are they coming for if this is such a horrible nation and so racist why are they all breaking down on door to get in here\nAnd I guess another horrible truth for all of you\nThere's not a liberal listening to this program who wants to them here can you name any one in the Upper East side of the Upper West side of Manhattan who really wants hordes of illegal aliens in the neighborhood\nDo you actually think they're going to rush out an invite these people to dinner now they don't want their quiet little lives ruined\nLet's be clear this was an attempt by the Democrats\nTo create mass hysteria against President Trump against Republicans and against the Americans who support them that means you and I this is how evil the Democratic party has become because if we were a sovereign same nation there will be no division on this issue\nBut they would like to see Trump send the military to the border\nAnd they would like to see immigrants brutally mistreated or shot and killed at the border they like to see a killing at Kent State so they can hold up the pictures but make no mistake about it\nThis is an invasion and invasion army it's an army without guns you might say that no other nation on earth would allow something like this to happen but you would be wrong\nGermany's communist president Angela Merkel did this to Germany and look what happened to them leaders in Germany now getting up and gloating and saying there are no Germans any more\nThere are French communists there were saying that no French anymore they're English communist saying there is no England anymore and now in America that you want someone to stand up and chances are no Americans anymore\nWell this big caravan and the others that will come after it\nOr an existential threat to the survival of the nation it but it's not stopped and the question goes back to the first one I asked on the Savage Nation how does Donald Trump stop it he is the commander in chief he does not need Congress to approve his actions when it comes to the military so what should the military do\nWhen they're sent to the border\nTell me what they should do what should the rules of engagement be are they going to be water cannons rubber bullets how far should they go Trump is the man in the driver's seat we put him there just for this alone did you and I just said\nNever forget what Trump was elected on he was elected on stopping the flood of immigrants coming into America I don't care what else you may have voted for that's the number one issue that he took and ran with right well this is now his moment so how does he stop the human wave\nWell here's a ... a thought that's a little troubling it doesn't really matter what Trump does\nIf he sends the military to the border the vermin and the media will follow and they will make their pictures and videos and frame interviews with women and children to fit their sick narrative and make it look like Trump the military the border patrol the Republicans are all evil white men\nResorting to drastic measures to keep brown mothers and children from a better life in America you can you can bet your Social Security on that they did the same thing with the separation policy at the border\n[noise] did you notice that every media member every Democrat in Congress every Democrat spokesperson all of them said Trump was ripping children from their parents remember the narrative ripping children from their parents ripping families apart\nYou think that's a coincidence the word was chosen on purpose and they all collaborate and then using it it was to create an image in your mind and it was to induce a mass hysteria against not only Donald Trump but against this nation itself I'll be right

which I gave yesterday on the show it fell on deaf ears because although I Am the most published member of the American media I Am the least quoted the least quoted I don't have a PR agent\nAnd a I'm a competitor to others so they don't quote me but you know I did put up a good idea and shorter should Trump threatened to withdraw from the new NAFTA if Mexico fails to stop the invasion if he's willing to rip up a treaty with Russia\nOver um their alleged violations of the nuclear treaty that Reagan signed without ratification or such by the Senate then he has the power to tear up the agreement that he just signed with Mexico\nAnd they need more than we need it so the problem here is a lot lobbyists would would scream bloody murder if Trump ever said I'm going to tear up that new agreements that whatever the agreements called I was not really NAFTA the same thing though\nI'll tear it up and less Mexico stops the invasion that's what we'll do it I mean you talk about the way to do it that's the clever way to do it because it's all about money only thing at a country our response to it rarely is it about anything other than dollars and cents\nSo Mexico is our partner Mexico is our friend in many ways there are ... very much went to this nation\nBut we have all the power they don't really have the power so we've got to use our power on their power so they use their power to stop the horse\nInvading so you say here's what we're going to do and you do it quite publicly you don't have to ... threatened to scream you say you're going to force us to tear up the treaty\nI'm and it'll be painful to both of us but worse for you\nAnd we mean now we want your military in Mexico to forming a line that cannot be crushed\nAnd will tell you what will meet you halfway will provide you with the food the clothing the tense whatever in your country and then make it an international crisis not just on our backs let the damn un do something those useless criminals and the un what are they doing\nWhere where are you in all the hundreds of billions of dollars where's the money or this is the un problem they should be there and Mexico stopping the hard shouldn't they\nKnow what should they be doing what they're doing using a diplomatic pouch to bring in a uh whatever they bringing in a diplomatic pouch\nShould Trump threatened to withdraw from NAFTA Mexico fails to stop the invasion so here's a clever solution\nDo I have to now ... what are you know who you're gonna turn to see if that smarter than anything anyone said I haven't seen a solution you got other than this gym am I right we all studied than it was all day long just five people in my team all over the country right\nHas anyone come up with a better idea yet no but because I'm not quoted by anyone for commercial reasons for competitive reasons really\nThe idea is not yet been talked about but it will be I Hope my students producer is listening avidly I Know she does every day to give a the bow tie a little info for tonight maybe the bow tie could rip it off\nAnd like loud so it doesn't really matter at this stage in my career who represent often at the end of the day as long as my ideas a thought about I'm really happy so they ripped off the word hysteria but try to create hysteria but I put together three words stop mass hysteria\nAnd then for a while you heard the words hysteria being used and they realize they might be helping me so they stop everyone's trying to come up with a new word for hysteria they don't know what to do with that so now there's a new idea that I've come up with I have an idea Smith and should Trump threatened withdraw from the new NAFTA Mexico failed to stop the invasion it makes sense to me it's a good strategy\nIf I were in Donald Trump's kitchen cabinet\nHaving a Diet Coke in an ice cream with him\nI Would suggest the same thing ... to have such an intuitively intelligent man and a man of action they say you know this is a good idea let's do it that's how he would work\nHe would work like say if I was with it but I'm not invited I'm not invited because I'm not part of the Fox news gang and it seems to me right now only Fox News people are being listened to particularly that educated genius\nOr who speak to them twice a day and advisors on everything probably advisors on things we can't even imagine given his lack of education is probably a considered even smarter than people who actually study these things", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Savage Nation - Michael Savage", "city": "Johnson City", "day": "23"}
