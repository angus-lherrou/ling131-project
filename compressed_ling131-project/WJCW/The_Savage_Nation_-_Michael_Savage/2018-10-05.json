hearing people are tired of them but they keep running them because of the political consultants believe that they work\nBut this is an area where I don't have a lot in common with with the people in this regard\nAnd it it leads to being a constant frustration for me I Am never influenced by the money spent on the campaign particularly campaign that didn't that doesn't affect me I Know who I'm going to vote for before I see an ad and there's not an ad in the world it's going to make me change my mind\n\nBut I have to keep in mind how rare that is most people watch local TV they can avoid

going to have a lot of work to do over the months and even years to come\nThe phone number here is eight five five four hundred seven to eight to big news is\nCollins' vote yes on Kavanaugh\nI published an article that I Want you to read entitled I just posted it the plague us next amongst the ... the plague us next among the homeless armies it's on my website it's on my Twitter feed and I hope you take it seriously because I as a former public health scientists I'm warning you again\nThat the chronic homelessness in our nation's cities are now reaching a critical mass they've allowed the homeless to over on the streets now some so am I warnings as exaggerated but\nWe're not raping the consequences of this neglect as we see today in the city of Los Angeles you said Los Angeles county officials are warning residents after several cases a flea born ... have come to light now tie fish is closely linked to poor hygiene and overcrowding and if left untreated can cause severe organ damage\nThe cases are being seen in the bomb communities what you call homeless community I'm not going to use the word homeless over and over again it's a left wing invention the word homeless you know where it came from its to make you the middle class is working around the clock to pay taxes and to keep your own family clean they want to make you feel guilty that someone\nHas destroyed their life to the point that they can't even afford an apartment anywhere they want to make you feel you have to build them sort of Soviet Bloc housing somewhere and you'll beautiful city to house more of them no that's not the way it works\nYou see I was once a young man who was poor\nAnd I had a job in New York City I was a social worker\nI wanted to live in Manhattan I had a dream I wanted to live down on Sullivan Street in the west village I wanted a little apartment that's all I wanted was a little apartment after I got out of college a with a brick wall so I could be a bohemian walk around the streets drinking the bars and have a good time after I work but guess what I couldn't afford it\nI couldn't afford to live in the west village in New York even then\nSo what do you think I did I did what everyone else been doing forever what do you think they built the subways for and the Long Island railroad they built it for commuters biggest commuters couldn't live in Manhattan and worked in Manhattan so I guess what I had to do I took a subway home at night and I went to a an apartment I didn't want to live in in Queens New York\nAnd it wasn't bad but it really wasn't what I wanted to be it was not cool it was kind of boring but I had to do it and I do the bridge tunnel thing on the weekend when I wanted to have a good time but that's the way the world works not everyone's entitled to an apartment where they want to have it\nAnd no one in the world is entitled to have the benefits of a society if that crap on it in plain English it's that simple\nAnd so I said you know the play is next amongst the homeless armies you can laugh at me you can revile me but you better pay half full attention to the fact that microbes do not discriminate\nSleeves do not discriminate they're very democratic\nAnd they don't know if the ankle going past the bomb with allows or the or the house on the bomb they don't know the ... the life still I still don't know whether you're a progressive or whether you support Trump\nAll they know as they see a nice hot foot going by and if they should leave onto your ankle and you should be bitten\nBy that fleet\nThat has jumped off an infected individual\nYou two are likely to become infected now the liars in the health industry of St typist cannot be transmitted between humans\nWell that's true in one way but type ... transfer as one fleas are infected with bacteria known as ... or a catchy fail us and humans can get the disease from a flea bite or by rubbing infected fleece feces into source of cuts in the skin you wouldn't know if it's fully feces\nA flea bites you and the flea relieves himself on your foot and you'd get a niche and you rub yourself and you're robbing the bacteria into ah your your ah circulation\nNow Wednesday on this national program Savage Nation I Wonder about the health threat the homeless populations in America posed to our cities and I'm warning you sheep all over and over again you\nI've created this Frankenstein monster I have told you I Walk down the streets of San Francisco and I've seen bums picking lice or if they're running clothing and throwing them in the street of course I Walk to the other side of the street\nI also want you just the other day what diseases are lurking in the streets of San Francisco you have the life of human feces you have the rats that's totally perfect incubator for a major epidemic\nAnd wants this epidemic brains breaks out who you're going to blame you're going to blame us those of us has said round them up and give them into treatment if they still desperately need or you're going to blame yourself for being oh so tolerant\nNow I fear that this is going to get much worse I figured type fish may only be the beginning and I asked could we witness an emergence of the play in a lifetime in the civilized west\nAnd I say it is possible and I also say we must stop these outbreaks and end this invasion to protect us and the homeless found themselves and I say reopen the mental hospitals across America and build new ones\nAnd in turn them against their will this is the Savage Nation\nJoined the Savage Nation coal no
