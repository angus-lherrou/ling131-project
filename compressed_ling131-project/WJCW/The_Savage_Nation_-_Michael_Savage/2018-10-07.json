you watched it a two hundred and one laughs\nDominated the race that I guess it looks very similar here today like it did when we were here back in the spring\nYeah Joe when a Japanese it's like I said\nIt looks like an extension of the rings with\nReally assuming is not the leader board and he is taking that we'll do what she had already we've got a lot of cars and he's now trying to pull away

very substantial near this early in the race or showing Kyle chase in plant still hanging onto the physicians inside the top five but so far no one anywhere near what Kevin has here today Kevin horrific\nStayed on the racetrack much longer than everybody else and so then lead them ten seconds was linked to evaporate simply because\nHe have on the front row late you had other drivers out
