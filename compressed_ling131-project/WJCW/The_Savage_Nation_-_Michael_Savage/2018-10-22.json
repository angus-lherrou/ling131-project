invade the nation the blame squarely belongs with you the good nature liberal who's never found any way to disagree with anything that I say and so can you tell me all your liberals are so concerned with health care\nAnd your health care benefits that's all you're worried about where's the money come from all of these illegals come across the border where where's the healthcare going to come from for you you know that they're going to get better health care then you you know that don't you do you know that right now illegals can go to any emergency room in America and qualify for the best health care in the entire world without showing any ideas you know that\nYou know hospitals are not allowed to ask for any idea because of you and yet you're complaining that you\nHealth care isn't good enough well I'm going to ask you again you want now an advisor to the president of the United states of America\nThe caravans have now combine and they've grown to at least fourteen thousand illegal aliens who are invading the nation and it could become Trump's Waterloo while right now is only Trump's Alamo it is an existential threat to the nation and to the presidency of Donald Trump\nNow you've seen the footage\nStrapping young men and good new clothing\nOr in front of them women pushing strollers with five children in the stroller are we supposed to take care of all of these people every third world impoverished person in the world is coming here and the truth is we can't take care of them all moreover there's another question that is begging to be answered\nAccording to the Democrats we are a racist nation\nAccording to Democrats were very very bad to illegal immigrants and were racist to Hispanics and what are they coming here for if this is such a horrible nation and so racist why they all breaking down our door to get in here\nNow here's another horrible truth for all of you\nThere's not a liberal listening to this program who wants to them here can you name anyone in the Upper East side of the Upper West side of Manhattan who really wants hordes of illegal aliens in the neighborhood\nDo you actually think they're going to rush out and invite these people to dinner now they don't want their quiet little lives ruined let's be clear this is an attempt by the Democrats to create mass hysteria against President Trump against Republicans and against the Americans who\nSupport them that means you and I this is how evil the Democratic party has become because if we were a sovereign same nation there would be no division on this issue\nBut they would like to see Trump's and the military to the border and they would like to see immigrants brutally mistreated or shot and killed at the border they'd like to see a killing at Kent State so they could hold up the pictures but make no mistake about it this is an invasion and invasion army it's an army without guns\nYou might say that no one of the nation on earth would allow something like this to happen but you would be wrong\nGermany's communist president Angela Merkel did this to Germany and look what happened to them\nLeaders in Germany now getting up in gloating and saying there are no Germans any more there are French communists was saying the no French anymore they're English communist saying there is no England anymore and now in America that you want someone to stand up and chances are no Americans anymore\nWell this big caravan and the others that will come after it or an existential threat to the survival of the nation of it has not stopped\nAnd the question goes back to the first one I asked him the Savage Nation how does Donald Trump stop it he is the commander in chief he does not need Congress to approve his actions when it comes to the military so what should the military do\nWhen they're sent to the border\nTell me what they should do what you their rules of engagement be are they going to be water cannons rubber bullets\nHow far should they go Trump is the man in the driver's seat we put him there just for this alone did you and I just said\nNever forget what Trump was elected on he was elected on stopping the flood of immigrants coming into America I don't care what else you may have voted for that's the number one issue that he took and ran with right\nWell this is now his moment\nSo how does he stop the human wave\nWell here's a ... a thought that's a little troubling\nIt doesn't really matter what Trump does if he sends the military to the border the vermin in the media will follow and they will make their pictures and videos and frame interviews with women and children to fit their sick narrative and will make it look like Trump the military the border patrol the Republicans are all evil white men\nResorting to drastic measures to keep brown mothers and children from a better life in America you can you can bet your Social Security on that\nThey did the same thing with the separation policy at the border [noise]\nDid you notice that every media member every Democrat in Congress every democratic spoke every Democrat spokesperson all of them said Trump was ripping children from their parents remember the narrative\nRipping children from their parents ripping families apart you think that's a coincidence the word was chosen on purpose and they all collaborate and then using it\nIt was to create an image in your mind and it was to induce a mass hysteria against not only Donald Trump but against this nation itself\nNow I Will invite you to call on this issue but I don't want to flood myself only with this because there were other issues that are plaguing may I almost did they periscope performance over the weekend on Trump ripping up the nuclear control agreement with Russia\nIt scared me to my core because this was one of Reagan's signature achievements was working out a nuclear control agreement with Russia and then I wake up and I see oh Trump's going to wrap it up and throw it out why now I'm going to make is very clear\nDonald Trump is surrounded by nationalist and global is over the last several months the global is of taking control of this administration most notably the walrus once I saw that little bellicose\nWalrus enter the inner circle I knew things were going to go really bad in this country and in the world\nThat bellicose not the ... the national security advisor is struggling around the world stage throwing his weight around threatening Russia as we speak\nIt's not going to end very well for the world because that will tell you this I hear oh well Russia violated the agreement first of all how do you know that's true\nWhat because you read that in the newspapers do we really know Russia actually violated agreement number one and number two if you have an agreement with someone and you think they are violating it if you call them and say I'm ripping up the agreement they no longer have any reason whatsoever to talk with you about abiding by any part of that agreement\nThat is the stupidest thing I've ever seen the dumbest thing I've ever seen and it's a turn from what Trump was elected to do never forget why I backed him I didn't know Donald Trump before he ran I met him once or twice I didn't know him but I made it a rational decision\nOn this show and I bet you if you hadn't voted in the years to come out and vote that you remember when I said to you I said this may be our last chance he's not a politician but most importantly I did this because I knew he can beat the others and I knew that he alone could beat Hillary Clinton I was right but there was another thing about it that you may not remember\nI kept saying to you Donald Trump as a man of peace\n... Donald Trump is not an intervention is Donald Trump once our troops out of Afghanistan he wants our troops back home Donald Trump even set on this show in November of twenty sixteen that if I win Michael he said I Will meet with President ... and he said that right on the show long forgotten but I haven't forgotten that\nDonald Trump ran as a man of peace and as a non interventionist that's such a big issue that I also want to get to but primarily today we're going to talk about the confrontation at the border the Alamo as I call it and I'm going to ask you\nWhat would you advise the president to do can you come up with a solution that hasn't been thought of yet\nNow over the weekend I came up with an interesting one liners from Russia collusion and the on the left to Russia

democratic candidates to ignore public worries about the hordes okay\nWell I Know how to fix that Donald Trump if you're still talk to me instead of to the wall bag or I have an answer for you Mr Trump you know you ought to broaden the euro kitchen cabinet you talk to\nStewards twice a day I understand it's not that he's not doing too good right now you don't have people that watch Fox News and tell me that can't watch it because all day long as the same stories on every show no matter what show they turn on the same five stories with the same gosh how many times can you watch Newt Gingrich\nOr any of the other hacks that they have on over and over and over again and yet it seems that Fox News is now running a presidency or go to the geniuses now and ask them what they think should be done because they won't have the answer I'm going to give you missed the president because here it comes for free for the world to hear what's the problem\nThe problem is the Seventeen to twenty thousand illegal aliens who were gonna hit the border and try to ... that come over the border and then you're going to be stuck with them what are you gonna do about it [noise]\nWell if you hear that most Americans don't care about immigration they care only about their own self meaning health care\nWhat you have to do miss the Trump is cleverly explained to the American people how much health care is sucked out of this system by non citizens you don't have to go any further than your local hospitals\nI've been there several times over the last several years\nAnd I've been given worst care than illegal immigrants who don't speak a word of English\nI see them come in with a runny nose with five members and their family with some ... votes on with much still on their feet from the from Mexico you want me to be graphic I'll be graphic I Know how to paint the picture with words maybe it's offensive to you maybe it's not polite NYU talk well they're not so polite either\nAnd the invaders and not so polite either by the way maybe if more Americans were less polite than they are we wouldn't be overwhelmed as we are right now\nExplain to the American people how much each illegal alien costs us in terms of welfare and health benefits and then explain to them that if these illegal aliens are allowed into the country there won't be health care for all they have a lot of will be healthcare for none\nThat's what's gonna happen the hospitals will be turned into third world hospitals the hospitals will be overwhelmed who's going to pay for the doctors and nurses and the equipment and all of the things that are required for the care of these people I Know they're human beings\nI understand that you'd like to give everybody everything but the world doesn't work that way you cannot work that way\nThe reason this nation is so great\nIs because of the hard working American people but there's a limit to how much we're willing to pay in taxes\nThat's a separate ... a question uh you know I don't want to go into taxes right now explain to the people who want free had a health care for all how much each illegal alien costs us and what it will do to a health system and how it will destroy Medicare for all\nDestroy it completely destroy it that you won't have anything left\nSeventy percent of Americans support Medicare for all explained to the average American that if we let in all the immigrants that are trying to break through our borders the illegals\nWill have Medicare for none because the system will be completely destroyed [noise] okay so that's a simple message the president needs to get out in front of this and explain the connection between the desires of the American people that wants to the American people\nAnd the lack of resources that already are as in place and what it will do to the system if ah they're allowed to over on the border I mean it's pretty straightforward you know keep it simple stupid but it's all true\nI've talked about it for many years because I've been in hospitals and emergency rooms things have happened to me I don't have a doctor even at my age I take the medication I Know it's a crazy I don't I have no medication so far so good and I don't go to doctors\nOnce in awhile something goes wrong I go to a doctor they're great we have the best doctors in the world\nAnd I liked that go a substance they put on my body and and run the the thing whatever the thing is okay so far I've been lucky and I'm covered by you know medical care and all of that because I paid for it my whole life\nBut I'm Talking about the masses of Americans who don't understand that everything costs something every brick on every side walk every every centimeter every excuse me every every piece of pavement in your city cost something every fire hydrant cost something\nNow what about the one trillion dollars in unfunded pensions and the state of California one trillion dollars an unfunded pensions in California\nBecause of the unions what's the number of underfunded pensions in your state and who's going to pay that so you're telling me that there's no way to explain to the American people that if we let more people into the lifeboat the life but will sink\nThat's an analogy have used for years and all of my books I look at all my books sitting up here on my showcase\nEvery one of them has something to do with illegal immigration borders language culture has been the watch word of this program for twenty five years borders language culture borders language culture hasn't been lifted yet by or any of them I'm sure the next cartoon book will be called bought his language and culture by my student\nBut this is not about me this is about this nation and what we're going to leave behind when we leave it behind what are we gonna leave behind when we leave it behind a third world cesspool again does that offend you or I Hope it does\nBiggest in San Francisco we already have a third world cesspool in

fine who's going to pay for it oh covered by Medicaid Medicare for all treatments in their tell me what's not covered in Medicare for all fallen arches covered bald discovered\nTest anxiety covered alcoholism treatment covered drug addiction treatment covered how much does this cost\nHow can we afford this\nThe answer is we can't the answer is went bankrupt the answer is the government's

best healthcare system in the world\nI'm here to tell you that each illegal alien cost this country approximately eighty five thousand dollars over a lifetime it's probably much higher than that in medical care and medical costs alone\nAnd if you do the numbers\nThis medical system will be broken if we let these poor people and and while I've compassion for them wanting to improve their lives by coming here we cannot permit it because ... will lose the greatest medical system in the world for everyone and for that reason\nI Am here by authorizing the military\nTo a approach the border now the problem is is that they have to be stopped before they get to the border biggest by international law I\nThink once they cross the border we have to process them for an asylum claim that suggested the laws are thanks to the show ... a complex\nIt's going to have to be a little different than that and I haven't worked out the details\nI think that since we signed NAFTA unfortunately an foolishly NAFTA was signed a few weeks ago it destroyed any negotiating power we may have over the Mexican government uh but I assume there are still some elements of NAFTA that haven't been ... that we have

mainly they treat other Hispanics just in case you ... your mind is so ... did you think that it's all one Brotherhood you know\nSo they they know how to deal with the problem you have the detention

million Americans went to the Mexican border what if there was a million American marched to the border\nAnd we the people went to the border and said enough is enough what would happen then well that's a terrible thought isn't it but what if a million American people went to the border I don't know the logistics of that may be Al Sharpton could help organize and he's real good at bringing
