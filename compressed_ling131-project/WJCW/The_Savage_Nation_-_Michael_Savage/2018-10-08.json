over that city catering to the mobs catering to the ethnic bombs in Columbus ohio with the big lie about Christopher Columbus\nAnd I gave you a true history of Christopher Columbus including the context of the world in which he lived at the time\nAnd what impel them to make that great discovery of a America\nAnd without him you wouldn't be sitting here right now God those that would have found this country and what it would be today\nThe point is is that the history of Columbus is so important for you to know\nAnd as concisely contained into pages and stop mass hysteria if for no other reason that's worth reading that book that's all I can tell you but that's one of hundreds of different facts that you will find that you need and I don't want to oversell the book I Want to go into the subject of a of the day okay so let's take a quick call\nBefore we break on so many different topics\n[noise] a lot of your calling on the sperm count that want to see about that one I there was a report that males sperm counts are so severely down in western nations that they're afraid that the entire west could collapse entirely\nWhat do you think is the reason for the collapse of the mail from count\nI don't think you understand what that really means in terms of the fact that it's not like you're ... looking guy\nSome of the toughest looking guys with the Arabs and the biceps and the lights and the Mets and the glued to the ... are important basically because ... and not only impotent but they actually have a very low sperm count is too low to actually bear a child is you know

reading five five in traffic and fight for ... for like fat frankly [noise]\nWell okay so you're blaming women who are aggressive for the lowest sperm right I don't know how that would work that would have to be a psychological reaction\nFrom now if I felt\nMy understanding what truthfully what do you think is causing all the decrease in sperm counts amongst western men\nThat a lot of harm profiting off ...\nI Would I Would not dismissed that as a very ... versus well educated in the whole year area of the environment certainly environmental toxic and have to be one of the factors but you do know that marijuana reduced the sperm counts don't you\nKnow\nOh no no one knew that that isn't part of the new mass hysteria that marijuana is good for everything\nOh yeah marijuana Dr sperm counts down not up I guess you didn't read that in the New York times of the daily news is now the cure all for everything that's part of the mass hysteria marijuana is one of the reasons the stress is another reason sitting in front of the front of a computer is another reason in fact sitting alone make sperm count slower incidentally\nYou know there were ... I don't want to get into the biology of evidence pretty obvious a man is designed so that his sperm\nIs housed in a Oregon that is outside of his body in order to keep them cooler than the body temperature okay that's the way it was designed sperm these are cooler body cooler temperatures in the body temperature\nWhen a man sits for lengths of time like all day long in front of a screen\nOr sitting in a car commuting he's increasing heat in that particular an atomic all region of his body thereby um diminishing the sperm count right then and there I don't think it's that complicated\nBut then again when the common sense ever count in this country in the last Twenty years so there's your answer now shown it you're going to go to a bookstore tomorrow for me or not\nI Am I going to find out\nWell I'm sending you want for free right now I'll be right back joined the Savage Nation coal no eight five or four hundred Savage eight five or four hundred seven to eight to ...\nTo Savage Nation is sponsored by Swiss America the only company I trust with my financial future coal eight hundred to eight nine twenty six forty six or Swiss America dot com\nAre you taking my anger and tired of paying fifty dollars per capita\nMali John catching married my and I think just ten dollars per time it came down his thinking ... is a ... dynasty does come out and get free shipping and Ken proper term on until he ran Miami Tanya from Caroline a sign of the licensed in all fifty states\nFor information coming in managing X. dot com icon and eight hundred four or five seven one six eight one eight hundred and\nFour or five months six eight wind\nStopped George Soros and is paid agitated before they ignite a civil war in the United states remember I alerted you to borders language and culture they are trying to destroy this nation stop mass hysteria\nYou need to own stop mass hysteria it's a history book a political book America's insanity from the Salem witch trials to the Trump witch hunt stop mass hysteria go wherever books are so the Savage army once you buy a copy of stuff\nThe jeep runoff snaps very road travel through a film hidden and buying it then when airborne landed a cow pasture rolled over\nProcess throw him from the vehicle before it landed on top of him he was pronounced it at the same hand might have been cut out and falling into a hospital charges are pending there were numerous reports of a black bear that's been spotted in Johnson City today it's been seen in the area of sunset drive north ruined street twelfth avenue and Thomas to read\nThe Tennessee wildlife resources agency has an officer in the general vicinity\nAnd so the animal continues moving toward a more rural area if it is captured the beer will be re located in the Cherokee national forest\nAssociates the university's officially acquired the millennium center from the city of Johnson City in August city commissioners approved selling the facility for five point eight million dollars it open in Nineteen Ninety nine and it was in the long range plans for it to one day be under ATS you control\nJeremy Ross GPS huge chief operating officer and says the purchases time we have\nNew academic programs that are being rolled out but also the fine arts center architecturally and even from a pedestrian flow hopefully the fine arts facility and the millennium center will be seen as one\nATS you also use the new space too accommodating Roman growth\nUniversity now who's the parking garage ... bridges well the center does remain available for outside event and if you want to vote in the November election time is running out Tuesday's the deadline to register in Tennessee on Wall street the Dow finished a thirty nine or Richard Levin W.

Chu I guess Feinstein didn't get that memo from Dr fraud [laughter]\nThat's what I mean by it's not just mass hysteria Ira we're living in a time that much worse than mass hysteria\nBiggest mass hysteria can be dismissed this is an orchestrated masses Larry as you well know the money is coming from somewhere to organize these people seem to have a limited time to harass senators chase people out of restaurants\nAnd we know where most of it's coming from the head of the snake\nA is a there's a man named sorrows and then now the ACLU which has uh\nI have a one C. three status nonprofit supposed to be nonpartisan mhm worked against capital and Trump hasn't had the IRS their their nonprofit status how is this happening Aaron\n... is the perfect timing for your book to come out the last few two to three weeks after a clear a mass hysteria on on Kavanaugh first of all can you define what you mean when you see a mass hysteria so that people understand\nI think they can see it all around them you see people going hysterical and invented em themes cabin or the drunk cabin or the serial rapist\nThat's one example there are many many others the sky will fall if they put a moderate Republican on the Supreme Court I mean let's be clear about Aaron\nI actually didn't support cabinet when he was first chosen because he has a Bush era George\nBush was to moderate and too liberal for me\nBut here you have Trump picking amongst twenty five nominees for the Supreme Court that he had before him perhaps the most liberal Republican and look what they did to this man\nCan you imagine if a true conservative had been checked by Trump what they would be saying couldn't get any worse than what they did to this man and and here's the question\nIs a reversal of the mass hysteria would just massive no says it's one thing for a bunch of young girls to become a historical in Salem, Massachusetts\nIn the sixteen hundreds and such people condemned to death for being which is based upon pure hysteria\nIt's another thing for millions and millions and millions of so called intelligent so-called educated people to buy the propaganda in the numbers that they had been buying it\nI've not seen such mass hysteria in this country in recent times you can go back in history and find it during the McCarthy period\nWe heard about McCarthyism and how evil he was and he picked on the poor the poor innocent Hollywood writers how many times you've heard that story with the famous movie with zero ... throwing himself out of a window\nThere was actual communism back then it was real\n[laughter] well we know that from the vet known of papers that were released I Believe in the nineties by Soviet intelligence after the war came down which confirmed that every one of the individuals I think without exception\nThat had been named by the house of an American activities committee senator McCarthy turned out to be either a direct fellow traveler or a an operative of the Soviet Union in Hollywood in government and the media now has that ever entered the history books\nOne North Dakota you know today America's economy is flying hiring faster than any major nation in history what

happened\nLet me begin where I Would begin the so called journalists who sit underneath them during the hearings and in in in that dissemble is that that that are in in in the dirty clothing you know what I'm Talking to you remember what press ... the press was like\nLet us say in a more reasonable time in America did they ever come around dressed like bombs and sit on the floor underneath the

any respect for the people on the podium there it started that than others the meltdown\nIn Congress began with the entrance of the gaggle of press that show up like a bunch of bombs and sit there are

his wealth to the needy\nHe's specifically named Elizabeth Drew as the beneficiary of a portion of the state\nColumbus also earmarked part of his estate to go to a group that was charged with retaking Jerusalem for its Muslim occupiers and finally\nHe signed a document with a triangle of march that appeared on Jewish headstones those dots and characters were intended to represent the ... the Jewish prayer for the deceased\nI'm going to continue in a few minutes reading about the real history of Christopher Columbus one of the greatest explorers in the history of the world and the sadness that we

thing and we see\nMobs mobs mob rule mob is stereo\nTearing down statues of Columbus I think you need to know a little bit about the context of Columbus to understand what you're doing and why you should defend Columbus in Columbus Day which is today so let me continue\nOn page fifty three it's only about another half page from stop mass hysteria out tomorrow they'll born in what was then the

home a trading edge\nIt would also perhaps insulate him by both distance and accolades from Spain's rampant anti Semitism that was raging of the time you have to understand the context now that you never knew okay\nMy book this book is not the place to debate the modern day if you're a surrounding Christopher Columbus and the voids you undertook and fourteen Ninety two the voices of political correctness won't even let us call it the discovery of America any longer since uncivilized natives were here before the civilized Europeans arrived\nVoices of mass hysteria wants his stature remove from New York City's Columbus park\nAnd his name removed from the October Holiday the bears it\nBoth actions I vehemently opposed by the way whatever else may be said of him Columbus had courage selling three tiny vessels west into waters that were uncharted and said to be populated by sea monsters on a world that many uneducated so still thought was flat\nThat alone should be celebrated in its own way\nHe set a standard for the ideal of American exceptionalism in which I wholeheartedly believe but now listen to the rest of what I wrote for those of you think I have a one sided mind\nWithout ignoring the historic truth of the diseases his crew and those that followed introduced to the defenseless native population among them syphilis measles smallpox and influenza and also of course the horrors of slavery\nColumbus is enterprise failed in its original go yet succeeded on a scale you could never have imagined\nColumbus the search for a trade route triggered the sixteenth century colonization of the confidence to the north of his family over in the Caribbean where he had landed let me repeat what I said at the start of this chapter context matters the anti

days after a terror attack in Barcelona kill fourteen and injured more than one hundred others the chief rabbi of that city gave an interview in which he won that Spain had become a nexus for Islamic terror\nThe Spanish rabbi said I'd tell my congregants don't think we're here for good\nAnd I encourage them to buy property in Israel this place is lost don't repeat the mistake of Algerian Jews or Venezuelan Jews Europe is lost he described the Muslim community in Europe as harboring radicals and terrorists and one is very difficult to get rid of them they only get stronger\nI'll stop right there\nAnd I'll let you read for yourself a the book mass hysteria this is one example of what I'm trying to do before it might be too late if it's not too late already and I don't think it's ever too late by the way\nSo Columbus Day is no longer a holiday for the namesake Ohio capital\nWhy is Christopher Columbus been turned into the most evil person to of ever lived was he that evil a person and by the way what was life like for most of the indigenous peoples\nIn the areas that he landed on what what were they like to each other where they kind of loving\nOr they some kind of as sending the angels as you would have the uh as they would have you believe all of these uh lecturers of ethnic studies whatever you believe that the Native American was living in peace and harmony with each other and with nature nothing could be further from the truth\nI have studied this issue since Nineteen Seventy the Nineteen seventies if you look at how tribes live with each other here in North America\nThink of the crypts and the bloods because that's how the tribes live with each other before the Europeans arrived they will work constant war with each other fighting over things as simple as salt\nOr hunting grounds if they captured a warrior from another tribe they would sometimes skin I'm Alive and throw them into the snow without skin\nDo I have to mention the rapes well you see
