he\nHe had a chat or for a couple of laps and they got so bad he had to come down the road\nThey change all four tires just radios back to brand\nIt said they had a loose left rear wheel on that

that are playing their cars there but certainly this new or an obscene playing very well\nWith the top four spots will get along the way all points and right now it just had a good feeling my bag with

how you found a lawn you won't find out well\nThere's not been a lot of that there's been a lot of single file raising but what's the odds\nIs that we had to pack up seven leading now we have\nOf for

how about ...\nWell I tell you what Mike I think the reason we have the top for separating themselves from the rest of the field as they are showing a tremendous amount of this turns reinforce as if they're driving like one car Kurt Busch lead them into two or three in foreign everybody takes the exact\nSame voice their shadow when you go to various\nWhatsoever through turned three and four and they are writing unreal they are visibly quicker\nThan the rest of the field of\nWho drew reinforce break discipline and\nThose guys are totally hooked up and there are lock step there is no doubt about that when I got to believe after this races over NASCAR is going to take a hard look at this real spoiler\nIs pretty new on these cars right now is generally a form of spoiler really will make the cars draft\nTighter together we were proved that many many times as the heir hits the sport with the air goes way up in the air opens up a big hole kind of like when you on the highway bottle no

bit you getting ready for the next race\nSo really no no wonder that things are a little bit different today with that you\nAre all the cars and I like I said let's talk about the fact that this was

and space or just might become a whole new game\nNo question about it we'll start with the ... paper to force me to go from one size a bigger size down to a smaller size I think about your blue jeans or a little wider around but by that get a little shorter and smaller circumference wise around your ankle\nThat's what it tapered space are essentially just going to take the thought of or restrict your plate it's going to go from a bigger opening and funneled down to a smaller one\nOf the changes and that is going to choke off the horse power to the engines and it's going to reduce it\nSignificantly warmer after the Daytona five hundred when we come to college and they told me in July of next year it's going to be much smaller but one of the things that these teams were battling\nRight now is how do you hide the spoiler here at Talladega as well as what you do what they told us\nBecause we are to some\nDegree now so far to try to get it to avoid the soil and that the

throughout\nThis whole run on a ... which is running out of fuel before the before he actually made it to the under the stage he ran out of fuel on the parade and I am one of I think there's some concern about the budget till the end of the stage of the game plan\nThat's deep posted a quick update their on that road presented by O'Reilly auto parts when it comes to safety nothing's more important than the vehicles breaks\nTrust O'Reilly auto parts to help you choose the breaks the pitcher vehicle brands like rake best break best selected wrangler thermal quiet O'Reilly has the brake parts you need if you're in the low prices around the auto parts better parts better prices everyday\nTwenty six slap stick out till the end stage to hear it sounded like a super speed why it's been Stewart horse racing with the top four spots\nMost of the day matter\nOf fact I've been wanting to all but two green black labs in the race here this afternoon so now here's the question if it comes down to the last lap and they're in the top four spots what happens there\nTake your gloves off and it will be man against man team against team and was the Kelly you've got three of those teams in your head area they have to be ecstatic about the way this race has unfolded so far here this afternoon\nYeah we saw this in the Daytona five hundred with a joke in racing teams just a few years ago at Martin through ex junior to make and they were able to keep all five of the the scene up\nFront and in that high same thing we're seeing the store\nKevin harming saying very little about the handling of his race car leasing for Eric\nFor Kurt Busch a wedge adjustment the last time so the handling just a little bit different for each one of them but they're all very pleased\nWith the race cars very pleased at the right way to keep themselves together it was interesting on my last restart the kind of let the top one that would have been Kevin harvest to slide and won first Eric ... third\nAnd that kind of broke up their momentum just temporarily fertile Bush to be able to run side by side for a couple of laughs but once they got their momentum up they've been able to pull away and keep out front so they're going to be tough the tough to handle here when we get to this final stage\nTalking about ... Boyer elbow roller and Kurt Busch the poor Stewart\nPretty much all the way but I wanted to take it back to the four hundred lap or that we had a week ago at Dover\nWe were already physically Kevin harvests\nName a in a ... the monster that drove me there are thinking that you know what this was a slam dunk he was dominating the race but not so fast Harvey was not in victory lane\nYeah he won the boat stages the first two stages of the race dominated Abdullah leads up as largest ten seconds at times\nBut then they had a little mistake on that road knocked off a valve stem during a pit stop it went out the window he didn't get the when we had a surprise winter there in ... but that's how quickly this stuff could go away it seems like you have it and then suddenly adult never played that game heavy rusty my God just frustrated you you said about\nPicture when away from you so but it's a team effort this NASCAR isn't it what you gotta do you got to get all the stuff like that getting with the\nBad but that was a lot of bad for her book at Dover but he's been there done that\nAt the moment it's a lot of good for her Vic he leads would laugh eighty seven at Talladega\n\n[noise] All

himself trying to wrestle away and have places is a\nField now charging back to the trial but with those fast cars at the front of the pack right at the bottom of the race track and still scrambling further\nBack they just won't give up a lot of guys they're desperate to come back to the field\nAmong those the poll sitter Kurt\nBusch hurt me to move three why do the outside of a time machine it did not work and now he is one of the acreage\nWhy are you trying to make some hay but the problem is he doesn't have the wrapping help to get it done closer to the front more\nWide ranging from what I find a\nJob when Donald going way to the outside oh bubble walls you had to chase Eliot up ahead he has Ryan blaming behind them so far the effort has been sold\n\nFor was sixty nine to go here at

... cars and they've been together\nAll afternoon and now they're scattered throughout the field this has to be the most dangerous time for them because they're trying to get back up with their teammates trying to get that draft going trying to work their way back to the front of the field yeah we have sixty nine left to go with this is the stage of a race of Talladega where things bad can

I think you're in\nTrouble they're going to work and that they're going to stay up front the rest of the day but again a different mindset right now stays rations gone is racing to the end when the right now\nIs coming to the green flag we mentioned look ... Bush to perhaps pull out of line and drop towards the tail end of the field he did exactly that is right now running in the twenty six position to be working the way down to super stretch Dan Hubbard they're headed toward you would read because last year the run of the field\nWearing a wire and took a look to the outside of bread goes lousy lousy was willing to block if he had to he did not happen so we may lead woman\n[laughter]\nAgain that outside lane mailed materialized but did not produce anything for William Byron he was there for a few\nMoments now he's falling back\nNow here's a run going once again got some drafting help from Daniel Suarez Daniel forest\nIs right there he pulled up out of the back of the William Byron machine there was a third line but material I thought that's what\nGets sealed off ... tour number two is that middle wind swung way why the throw the block now the plot is led by William Byron\nResident fair why from falling back good\nMomentum for William Byron coming into turned three and four he gets a hoot out in front of ... just last year because the last few strong enough room for tourists reinforce [laughter]\n\n\nKind of dig a master which is read his Laskey trying to fend off a rookie and that would be William Byron across the line\nThey are side by side in fact the advantage to\nTwenty year old William Wrigley charity Talladega Byron\nOther leaders right hip turned number one now it'll be Daniel forester challenge to the outside the polls even what Brad was deep that's about all\nThe yellow and black car William Byron delete the yellow and black cardboard Daniel Suarez taken away all the facts right away they calm Suarez\nWith Iran he cannot be a fair way side by side for second this\nTime William Byron goes to the low side just in front of bread goes lousy but again why run\nUp just slightly middle group in case he has to put on a walk\nHim\nComes up in front of Daniels war is because he saw swore is starting to make a run outside lane so Byron learned but defensive\nMechanism here it sounds like a super speedway he hangs over the top spot\nWarrants to get a piece of the lead buddy sure as heck is running at heart board second to the outside of the bride kids while ski machine while the portions you about that for group for it's going to\nSell it had to check up there for just a moment now as far as an Elliott talked side bottom you've got William\nBarber and if I saw for the latest one\nI'll run by Daniel swore is down the back straight away and then it turned three and four but it does not amount to him taking away to lead wire and still has the U.S forces\nPoint that\nTrend spotter tabloid on the radio with the twenty year old driver at the front of the field here at Talladega that is William Byron trying to keep them up\nRon Davis one thing to get the front or get to the run on a track like Talladega or Daytona it's another thing entirely to stay there\nWell that's exactly right because you got to block it sometimes you have to decide what's your three different lanes of doctors and you want to put the\nBorrowed now as Brad Keselowski right behind him those to write down the middle of the ... role in third\nAnd the other side by side for for what kind of putting a sign of foreign wars have\nGone on showing some good speed and horse power down to the bottom into turned three years trying to clear Daniels war is war is just a lot forgot what was going to believe that we find\nByron showing the white keeping a close eye on that rearview mirror because ... years right there

good race glad to have you with us alongside rusty Wallace Joel more my name is just three gold covering the action forced into turns today\nOverturned wanted to date looting down with that in the super stretch like by glee overturned number four is Dan Hubbard\nCovered the action forest today on the road Winston Kelly Alex said Steve Post and Kim Kuhn a day job or that his born\nPoor boards all from the same teams\nThere weren't horse racing you're talking about they have been at the front of the field most of the afternoon only one time rusty what was that there is a bit stopped by variations or are they scattered out there a month to the rest of the players now they're right there at the front of the field ready to do battle to the finish and are hoping that one of their cars goes to victory lane\nWell they've got a better job than the rest of the teams right now getting a spoiler figure it out it really adapted to the rules you're telling negative Alex is talk a lot today\nAbout how the cars are going down this right away basically crooked with the left with the back of the car basin towards the infield and that's all to try to get air off the roof spoil or they're going to do that but it manipulating the the set up in the back of the car and the way they put the body on [noise]\nLike what they just done a better job than anybody so far at this point I don't know if they're going to win the race or not because all help but getting ready to break loose right now I'm thinking what like twenty five to go everybody's beyond the throttle so we'll see what happens but until then they've won everything today so far for really fast cars\nFor they've been there most of the day will they be there at the end of the day we'll find out from Talladega super speedway this is the motive racing network the voice of NASCAR\nRace we just have to end with the way I should over in the Monday with him on Monday President like outback steakhouse lot on him

it's so uh so before we get out in nature and just sit in the woods and watch the deer and birds\nAnd typically honor runs there's a lot of conversation for twenty five or thirty minutes and then gets quiet because you're sucking sucking wind but on the bike especially the racetrack and stuff they're pretty pretty easy ride\nThe bus with your favorite NASCAR stars each weekday on NASCAR today the

three wide come a pet day moody\nThey really are rusty\n\nPack but they're too much doing three wide like by going to try and make any ground they've\nGot to get in line if they got any ... hard to

eight laps they've been trying for one hundred and Seventy eight laps there has been failing and based on that rusty what are you going to do you try that you've seen a teammate tried it a try at USC and others do it and they all but the only way you're gonna get\nFor what you have an an error is to go where they're not and that's what the top of\nThe race or you're gonna have to go around up on the top racetrack the spiders are going to have to be talking to all of the cars right now because they're the next one's in line and said okay let's get ready get ready to make this run let's hook up bumper to bumper the billboard and tell Mitt they're just going to have to do that because\nThey're going to read as well get to the hot high side joy ... behind them their day moody\nYeah I got to go
