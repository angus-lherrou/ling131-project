Kennedy came along\nAh when the media propped up at president into a celebrity made JFK a celebrity they talked about as good looks as youth as vigorous beautiful wife his life and Camelot while ignoring his father's bootleg ing and ... his many affairs and his horrible health problems\nThat was probably the trial run in the media are making up a celebrity of a president nobody came close\nTo being a celebrity for awhile afterwards Nixon certainly was not well liked by the party forward and had no personality Carter was bland and depressing and then along came Ronald Reagan\nYou might say Ronald Reagan was the next celebrity president but you would be wrong yes he came from Hollywood and today we look back on his presidency as successful and look upon him with respect but while conservative Americans love Ronald Reagan the establishment or didn't\nThey didn't let them at all and so here we are facing what we face today we're moving slowly but surely into a new direction right\nAnd I say to you we have to look at this very carefully because presidents as celebrities are something rather new and as I said when Reagan was there a conservative Americans love into the establishment Republicans hated them and the Democrats painted Reagan is a dangerous dumb cowboy\nBut still the American people respected Reagan in ... and they did not work but they did not warship Reagan never celebrity presidents really took hold with the cult of Bill Clinton\nEven though there were many scandals white water rose law firm records allegations of sexual misconduct and write the media ignored it and create a celebrity and Bill Clinton\nScripted dances with Hillary on the beach Harvey Weinstein your knee ride Harvey Weinstein orchestrating Clinton's entrance at the convention for television consumption these were the tactics that were just being developed for the age of the celebrity president\nWhen GW Bush won they use the same tactics on him that they've tried unsuccessfully to use on Reagan but this time they were successful\nFirst they said that G. W. Bush stole the election sound familiar then after being the most popular president history after nine eleven they successfully turned them into a racist failure after Hurricane Katrina and an economic meltdown that was not if it's doing\nNow with the rise of cable news channels\nMore talk radio and more and more television programming able to pedal the ideas of a socialist ideal the media would not fail again to allow another Republican takeover so they created the ultimate celebrity president in ... he had the looks the other smile\nHe had an empty message of hope and change that they could sell even though it meant nothing and he was black and articulates Joe Biden said\nHe was articulate he was so perfect they tossed Hillary Clinton to the side and for eight years he was the perfect president no scandals they said there was no fast and furious no weapons going across the border to Mexico no Irish scandal notifying and reporters no ... no attacks upon the opposition no\nAttacks on the police they covered up for Obama and recreated Camelot celebrities like Jay Z and Beyonce were paraded through the White House and the celebrity presidency took hold in America they didn't respect him or admire him they worshipped him\nBut Obama's bad policies in big media gave rise to a real celebrity president than Donald Trump\nWithout to make believe perfection of Obama and Republican Party who did nothing for us from could not have arisen and we are happy he is there because he is promoting our agenda but he has continued the poison of the celebrity presidency by providing more celebrities through the White House\nNow it's Kim and con yet but what difference does the climate was\nThe hatred for Obama as bad as it is for Trump some could argue yes but well you didn't have during those years was the violence we are saying this is the new element so we've gone from celebrity worship\nRight to now motivating the worshipers into becoming a violent mob did we encourage our anti Obama people to beat up the other side to destroy property together people's faces in restaurants no we did not\nWhen Eric Holder the former chief law enforcement officer of the nation stood up before supporters\nAnd said when they go low we kick him he also said this is the new Democratic Party well this is new this is the result of a presidency that as a cult of celebrity now we're not allowed to call on ... a mob the word mob is not to use the cording to these new idiots this is a very dangerous place we're in now here's the main point\nA cult of celebrity has gotten our society to where it is Obama use that to his advantage to ah rile up the radicals we are seeing roaming the streets now\nBecause of the celebrity of Trump Hollywood in the media have riled up these radicals to acts of violence and then there are those on our side who say President Trump can do no wrong they are the true believers there's just not healthy either\nMaybe we don't need a celebrity in the White

a related matter\nWhile covering a lot of historical ground the book is actually fun to read\nIt also involves a lot of storytelling told by a dentist viable engaging voice now here's what I'm getting too he writes this is my absolute favorite among the essays was the second half of chapter eleven from communist comics\nAfter discussing the Hollywood blacklist than Joseph McCarthy and I knew once

and for fourteen million users more information and that was compromised including user names check ins gender the area in which they live search history religion may be more Facebook says it will be contacting compromised users and post information on his help center\nHe isn't saying if he'll run for president in twenty twenty but former vice president Joe Biden is campaigning for Democrats bath county Kentucky Biden says there's an important question all Americans must ask themselves\nPeople don't want to read history you don't want to understand the history of what they're living through they don't want to understand the context the new ones they don't want it they want black or white white or black ...\nThe bad they're good they're bad we're the good guys that are bad guys all you want to hear\nSo when you were a man like me who grew up thinking about everything since he's a kid looking for answers\nWalking down the street in New York and my down and ask them questions and not wise a sky blue I don't know what I asked them ... who are members what kids ask their fathers I always was taught to try and come up with my own answer my father wouldn't answer a question\nHe was from the old world he made me answer my question\nAnd he taught me how to think for myself and that makes me a great minority in a nation of true believers and true haters\nMost people in America today the true believers a true haters there's absolutely no in between this is the problem that I've been trying to tell you about this is why the country's falling apart this is why we're on the verge of civil war because the the large large middle ground has been lost\nThe middle grounds gone there's no middle ground in the media you see people on both sides taking a hard position one way or the other and if you don't take a hard position what happens you don't make it in the media\nYou don't make it simple as that there's no room for the middle ground there's no room for the new ones there's no room for thought there's no room for discussion you see the lover hey that's all it is so it you know if you're a man like me to grow up thinking\nAnd now you're living in a in a me I'm a you know in the medium of radio and a best selling author and you want to come toward a true answer a reasonable answer a rational answer or civil answer\nAnd you're living with shackles on both sides taking hard positions\nIn leads you to believe maybe it's time to step off the stage you get out of the spotlight I I'm telling you I'm going through a lot of soul searching right now even though on the verge of a whole new career I'm asking myself\nIs it going to get worse leading up to the president said forget the MIT terms we already see what they're doing on the left egging crowds on to violence we see that already from Hillary onto a lemonade\nViolence is good now all of a sudden the people thought their children not to hit remember just a few years ago the lives of saying oh we don't hit we don't have we don't have we know now it's kicked people\nStart a civil war anything goes because the which hasn't become president yet she thinks by whipping up the masses she's going to become president oh no the opposite is going to happen\nWhen is they're ever going to be civil living in this country and I don't really know I don't think you can ever ever return in in the near future\nSo having given you a nice uh nowhere introduction leading to nothing\nUh I'd say what you do open my to my left you should do open Mike and Mike eight five five four and seven to eight to because right after the show is over I'm going to just uh I'm just a big big whirlwind now with this book then I got a race to a TV studio get the makeup job which I hate\nI don't like make up even on women I like Vegas on my own face I Can't breathe and they put it on me I don't know and it could breathe all that stuff no wonder they can't think of television how can you might be clear of your face is covered with with muck\nHow could a man thing would lock all over his face I guess in that sense I but I got a race and they would do the the Huckabee show which I Love doing because it's a great audience of\nCountry and western and Christian people and they truly understand me so if you want to talk about any topic I had to okay\nLet me read you one Bible passages to blow out the people who hate the Bible and God and make the three people who are believers happy today because I promised you on Fridays I Would do a little did I did because I said I didn't actually I Would do Bible on Fridays like a little piece of tiny piece\nAnd I should get a passage that works for today and I can find that\nI don't know Isaac and Abraham is Sarah I'm not interested in Hagar the Egyptian wasn't there a drummer hangar or the Egyptian I thought there was a musician and they have or the I'll give you one that will really you'll all relate to its from genesis\nThan the lord cause the to rain than the lord costs to rain upon Saddam and upon Gomorrah brim stone and fire from the lord out of heaven\nAnd he overthrew those cities and all the plane and all the inhabitants of the cities and that which grew up on the ground but his wife looked back from behind him and she became a pillar of salt that a little passage from genesis has resulted in so much great literature\nIn so many languages ever since that one piece of genesis has been written that genesis Nineteen or twenty four twenty five twenty six you you've heard ...\nThey'll look back we will become a pillar assault and you remember Bob Dylan's great song and movies don't look back\nSo many musicians I've been inspired by biblical writings and biblical ... insights we've heard about Saddam and get more we all know San Francisco as a symbol of that and it's generating by the day more and more and more you were talking about brim stone and fire\nWe don't have room store on fire a fire and bumps don't in San Francisco we have human feces and an epidemic needles but hey all is not lost without a lobbyist plastics draws\nYou use plastic hypothermia needles to shoot yourself up and throw them in a playground but hey not a straw liberalism as a mental disorder\nAnd I cannot escape to the mountain less the evil over take me and I got to behold now the city is near to the flea onto any of this little one so you could say it's poetry written by ancient Israelites the ancient olive groves of the Bible\nAnd they created a religion\nEven if you don't believe in God you have to understand that it creates then religion of Judaism set the foundation stone for Christianity and for his slum if you don't know that that you're you're on on a on a educated person\nSo this book this original book the so called Old Testament set the entire western world in motion for good and for bad\nAnd there's a lot of bad and good by the way in what came up from that\nAnd it came to pass the under two full years the pharaoh dream to behold he stood by the river but I don't know you want me to do this I don't want to do it how about birds and dreams number I had a dream about a white\nOwl a number of years ago and I painted it you don't have an painted in about six months then about six months before the stop painting\nThat shows that my ... my creativity is is going in me I don't like that my creativity is kind of dried up\nBecause I'm too driven by politics I don't want to do this anymore just politics I hated actually actually hate politics I'm trying to think back before politics was their life for me what did I Do before politics\nI ask myself this everyday God has blessed me with good health thank God thank God I don't know what tomorrow will bring ... good health\nLong life relative wealth\nWhat am I supposed to be doing with all of these blessings\nGetting up to her every day on the microphone and talking to the people writing books for the people and being at the end of the day completely drained and exhausted with no no ability to do anything after that do you understand what this takes to do and I'm not complaining to you I'm not required to do this I'll never forget\nWhen I first started in a righty I'd never done anything like this and I was a natural\nAnd I I'm not kissing is behind him he knows what I think of my first program director ... who is back there now after all these years which is amazing as the best they run the business\nI say that because he does but number two actually loves my show even though he'd probably politically is the opposite of me but he always had an ear for talent and I would finish radio in the early days of radio I had never done anything like this and after three hours I was drained I was sweating from head to toe\nAnd I would say I am just drained and you know the sentiment that's how that's how a great radio show is made and he said that's what you're supposed to feel when you give your all\nAnd I've been giving it my all for twenty five straight years almost without exception I Can't remember a show where afterwards I wasn't completely drained because I get up here and I gave it to you all of it but I ask myself\nIs their life after radio certainly I had a life before radio I traveled the world I collected plants I sent my plants to her barrier museums around the world I thought I was making a difference for

the nation will fall that actually that was Matt Matt Rogers headline Savage won't stop the Mavs donation will fall he summarized it\nThan me but going back to Thomas listens\nReview he says the average employees a broad definition of mass hysteria characterizing two complimentary aspects of it on page thirty five mass hysteria or a massive doses is insidious in stealthy\nAnd it falls into two categories the first is positive illusions nations or hysteria when you believe something Israel ... evidence just because someone says so where it fits your preconceived notions\nThe second type is negative hallucinations or hysteria when you deny the existence of something real despite overwhelming evidence that it does exist\nUnder this broad shot Savage Rome's through our history with a series of highly entertaining essays on incidence of mass hysteria and then he summarizes them\nAnd I'm not going to read what you can read your cell phone\nOn my website what I Want to go down to\nThis he says at his best on his talk show the Savage Nation he can be a master storyteller and that voice as heavily present in this book many of the essays are full of interesting angles and as he does on air Savage ranges widely and bringing in comparisons or taking a moment to dwell on a related matter\nWhile covering a lot of historical ground the book is actually fun to read\nIt also involves a lot of storytelling told by a dentist viable engaging voice now here's what I'm getting too he writes this my absolute favorite among the essays was the second half of chapter eleven from communist the comics\nAfter discussing the Hollywood blacklist than Joseph McCarthy and I knew once fashion\nThat conveys the genuine this of the threat but follows the threat of hysteria that eventually was used to discredit anti communism he turns to an entirely unexpected comparison the anti comic book hysteria of the Nineteen fifties in which lurid comic books were claimed to be corrupting\nThe nation's youth leading to congressional hearings the hero of this particular tale as a man named William games with him Savage explicitly states she identifies listen to this you won't believe this\nGames came home from World war two and joined and eventually took over the business started by his father max gains whom Savage jobs one of the most important men in the history of popular culture games you see invented the comic book\nBecause as a printer he was bothered that the special presses used to print Sunday color comic sections for newspapers sat idle most of the week\nHe first reprinted son Sunday comic strips into book form staple them together and then moved on to original contact content when ... died in the boating accident in Nineteen forty seven his son William took over the business among dispersed titles was tales from the crypt\nFollowing the publication of a best selling book by a psychologist subduction oh the innocent senator Estes Kefauver scheduled hearings of a Senate subcommittee on juvenile delinquency and drag games before it and her rank them\n... went on to a greater prominence nagging the vice presidential nomination of Democrats in Nineteen fifty six would I'd lay Stevenson at the top of the ticket\nThey lost ... lost everything the backlash against comics drove them out of business now it turns out that there was a happy ending to this story but I refused to ruin it if that's a reason to go out and\nBuy stop mass hysteria you probably won't mind if you read this far Thomas thank you very much\nIt is a very beautiful review because you actually think and you could actually right very well it was time to write a book anyway it's a great review and I'm not going to tell you the rest of the story but the whole comic book business is very interesting to me how it is an example of mass hysteria what was done to them at that time the comic book thing\nSo I don't know I could ask you the comment I can play some sound I don't know what ... marriage is fine\nShy play that or um what's his name as getting a lot of playing Don lemonade if ... if you have a lemon ... if you find yourself with a lemon making lemonade Don lemonade\nHe's a loser on lemonade as I said you many times before he became a prominent moron before he was an uh an unknown more and now he's a prominent moron Don lemonade again if you go into a light bulb store let's say Home Depot\nAnd you buy a bold for a lay up you've got a hundred a hundred and a quarter an eighty water or Seventy seven water that make a forty water than they were all utility bulbs the little ones that you put in the back of a refrigerator a stove in the media Don lemonade is like a utility bold in terms of intelligence and brightness\nSo now he's making a name for himself and becoming a vial idiot that so what\nMore do I have to say about it more nothing more needs to be said oh here's a nice one this is a good day for it that way I'm feeling\nCan us reveals pointless iPhone co during White House meeting why he would have a deranged dirty mouth\nIndividual like this at the resolution desk is so heartbreaking it's unbelievable to me\nI tell you the truth I think this advice is not coming from the president I can pretty much tell you I Know who advised this but I'm not going to do it at the risk of alienating even more people
