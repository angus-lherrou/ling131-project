I don't know it was first thing he slouch in a chair facing the president he called himself a crazy M. F. in in the oval office\nHe used the F word he called the Seventy two year old president broke the rapper had no respect for the oval office he wore no try he wore a stupid baseball hat on throughout is this the kind of behavior\nYou want in the oval office huh\nWould you ever expected me when I went to start when I went in there to start dropping F bombs with the president\nWhy is it no conservatives has said that this is unacceptable by that low life rapper I Am the only voice just had the nerve to point out that behavior like there should not be accepted in the oval office that as a sacred office even Obama didn't permit that kind of behavior to be shown publicly\nWhy are we turning this nation over to whatever pop culture demands\nThere needs to be the core and brought back to our nation's capital remember where it starts it starts there not only in the White House but in the Capitol building to there was no civility left\nIn our leadership during the Capitol building without gaggle of reporters on the ground with dirty clothing I'd make them wear suits and ties and I'd limited to a few ... press pools and that's it a few in the excuse me in the press pool sitting there underneath the hearings the clicking and the lights it's a disgrace the whole thing is a mess\nI Want to talk about nothing related to the low life rapper and the White House although it's a symbol of the decline of our civilization by the way I Want to talk about something else I'm I'm a student of history\nAs you know and I am a student of war and warfare revolution\nI Want to tell you something I saw last week or two weeks ago that one third of American youth\nWould be unqualified to serve in the military because their fat slobs one third of American youth are fat blobs of garbage sugar or salt dairy just useless piles of DNA useful only for a social media\nSo one third of the youth couldn't serve in the military so I look back on how many died in the last weeks of World War two and I look at how the people lived through it I don't understand how this country could live through anything like this\nAnd I'm focusing instead on one part of World War two when tens of thousands died in flames when the allies bomb Dresden, Germany it burned for seven days in seven nights\nFifteen square kilometers of the city was reduced to rubble bodies or carried away from the center of Dresden, Germany days after the bombing how many died twenty five thousand to forty thousand civilians now why my telling you this you'll figure it out soon\nOkay how many died\nIn the firebombing of Germany the you know the answer how many died amongst the Russians to take Berlin in the last weeks of the war you know how many\nI'll tell you how many of the show goes on Hamburg forty thousand died in one month to Nineteen forty three year the number forty thousand here if you break a hanging they'll call like shy still lawyer and as soon as the company they slipped on the floor they'll break a hanging out in a department store and they get a ... lawyers so forty thousand burned to death in Hamburg\nTwenty five thousand forty thousand killed and dressed in\nBerlin twenty two thousand one month\nForce I'm Seventeen thousand killed in Nineteen forty five one month dumps that Germany eleven thousand killed in one month in Nineteen forty four cities reduced the ashes but how many are Russians died in the last weeks of the war to take Berlin when they bury the third wife\nYou know how many died you have any idea how many Russians was shot in the back by their own officers if they didn't go did you know that here in the military if you have let's say depression or bipolar you don't feel good that day you wake up in the wrong side of the bed you get a pass they got shot in the back at that time by the by the Soviet military\nThe your nominees Soviet tanks were lost to the streets of Berlin eight hundred tanks were blown up just taking Berlin and the last weeks of the war\nBecause the idiot maniac crazed drug addict Adolf Hitler refused to let us troops even though the war was lost he refused to let his troops give up and save themselves and of course save a Berlin from total destruction this is what happens when you have fanaticism\nThe battle for billing took twenty two thousand civilian lives in the street battles twenty two thousand [noise]\nBut how many died amongst the Russians why am I telling you this well I'm telling you this to show you the scope of human tragedy and how we in this country are so diluted into thinking that every one of our complaints and cranks and this and that is something important it's stupid\nIt's stupid it's an embarrassment to the human condition\nAnd was so soft I don't know how this country can survive much longer\nWe have become so soft\nI don't know how the nation can go on but I'm I'm not I'm increasingly pessimistic about the survival of America incidentally that's really what I'm getting it you may think I'm supposed to sit here and give me give you a ... job it's a wonderful world everything's great everything's coming up roses\nYou take away welfare from the fifty five percent of the American people don't work\nYou take away the food stamps from the lazy bums who don't work\nYou cut off the ss the guy from the fake crazy people you'll take back all of you know how many people are on disability federal disability payments due to how many people on federal disability payments it went up on the Trump not down 'cause they're not cracking down on the fake disability I think it was twelve or fourteen million people faking it\nTwelve to fourteen million people declare their to their unable to work you hit us and you're paying hundreds of billions of dollars for all of this the country is so soft\nThat all they want is more free things you understand that so then you've got demagogues on the left say we'll give you anything free that you want and all of the losers of the world so yeah yeah yeah we want the free stuff will vote for them but where's the money's supposed to come from where from me\nFrom the people at work that's where it comes from so what happens is when when they tax us to death and becomes too high what do you think happens do you think that there's unlimited money we stop working\nWe just stop working and that's the end of it and

about\nDemocrats is about we know that the president is\nDraining the swamp so what we're doing is exposing the swamp and exposing the hypocrisy so it's just about that is about going into these different districts\nLet's see how these Democrats are running these districts especially the ones that keep running around talking about we have to impeach forty five so what we're doing we're giving you the truth with full well give me the facts and we're not held in anything that and we're giving it to you straight from the gay that's\nI Would go do you go into Maxine Waters district to see how she's managing things\nOh absolutely because she don't stay in her district she say outside of ... district oh\nNow I mean like Nancy Pelosi and they have Feinstein ever come down from the hill and the bumps and not up there on the human human feces doesn't slow up Pacific I only seems to be on the bottom down there\nAbsolutely that's the that's probably why you have Nancy Pelosi walking is the lead us you don't want to step in all that\nA very good bond fund bonk bonk so what uh I Know you went around the country to make this movie which are the cities that you looked at managed by liberals or shall I say mis managed by them\nWell when we look at San Francisco I mean I was taken aback and appalled by that you know to see homelessness\nTo see people dropped out on their minds to see them to appetite in in the streets I've never seen anything like that you know and so we catch a glimpse of that\nBut we need to expose that see it not long gone are the days with these congressmen and women think that they can work for their own greed and not the need to people if they don't want to work for us it's type to vote them out but instead of people listening to the soundbite we have to show the proof that if I can tell the truth\nYeah but how can you vote out in the trench candidate like Dianne Feinstein when the machine does not permit anyone to run against or they're like Tammany Hall was in New York for a hundred years nobody could compete with them because they own the voting machines\nOkay so they own the voting machines but we own the people's mind the people on their own minds and they're going to have to see for themselves and they're gonna have to go to the polls listen I I I'm not going to believe that they all the voting machines and they can switch off out because if\nKnow I don't I don't mean that they own the machines in that regard I mean they own the voters they flooded San Francisco with illegal aliens\nGo to vote in six or seven languages and you all know that unless you speak English you don't even know what's going on in the country right when you look at the people will do speak English and a half of them don't know what's going on now imagine someone who speaks Farsi and votes and doesn't do it through and voting for as long as I said ... their name\nSo let's go into the movie itself or who you are hoping the movie will reach\nListen everybody and I don't care what side of the hour on everybody I think this is a bipartisan movie and the reason why is because it gives everybody shaking awake and let them pay attention to what's really going on especially from the wants as walking around here\nThey don't come to the table for tax cuts they talk about impeaching our president's they don't come to the table to make life better for American the only worried about illegal aliens we need to expose the hypocrisy about that and let people see and then you can make your decision at the polls and the Mets aren't

I'm joking come on let me ask you something did you interview people like Maxine Waters which you sit down with us she boy did you write\nShe said well you don't have to watch the movie because we went looking for we went looking for but I Want everybody to watch the movie tonight to see what happened with that\nWere you able to interview Nancy or a Diane in San Fran I'll bet none of it they voted you like the plague\nWe'll see but see that's the deal we have a right to expect answers from these Congress for outlets period if they don't want to give an answer about their hypocrisy about their own greed and then we're gonna have to call them out and we're going to have to call them out on the big screen\nUh let me ask you something you you know you're African American women but you're

madness today is worse than any I've seen I Would say not any actually when I think back during the sixties the riots by the ... was worse but it's going to ... it's going to ramp up\nIts going to ramp up again the hysteria is being whipped up by Bernie Sanders a and others but it's not the first time in American history that this has happened as I point out and stop mass hysteria which is a very important book of politics and history combine\nBecause you should remember that John Adams was self one of the founding fathers had to overcome the hysteria of his time\nAnd to help see British soldiers acquitted murder was John Adams of stepped in to interfere with that\nAnswer is very simple\nA team of five five nation scientist for five nations they drill down five miles into the coldest place on earth and Voskuhl in the Antarctic coldest place it are\nThey drill down five miles into the ice core why they pulled up the sample from five miles below the ice and then they analyze that ice core sample and what did they find\nThey found that the earth was warmer millennia ago and there was more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere millennia go that tends to disprove the entire theory\nThat man is destroying the having said that I've worked all of my adult life to make this a cleaner or clean up clean a land clean water cleaner air but it doesn't mean I have to use hysteria\nIn order to talk about environmental cleanup let's use facts not hysteria so if he had said Leslie\nThe Vostok ice core samples of what I'm referring to what are they it's research it's real data is not created by Al Gore\nIt was obtained by drilling down into the ice above lake Vostok in Antarctica to adaptive ten thousand feet and you see French in Russian scientist obtained deep core samples which allowed them to look out among other things to history\nAnd carbon dioxide over the past four and twenty thousand years so they drill down all the depth into the ice and what did the sample show President Trump and show a lot of things that Leslie stall would have been stumped by\nThe main thing that show the levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere did not cause warming\nDid not cause warming the increases in carbon dioxide consistently lagged behind temperature increases by about eight hundred years Leslie stall would have fallen out of a chair but wait that's not all\nThis could have finished their off\nVostok ice core samples tell us more three hundred twenty five thousand years ago long before there was rap music\nThree and twenty five thousand years ago long before Twitter came along global temperatures and C. O. two levels were higher than they are today I guess Iraq Obama didn't get any of this when he was at Columbia University learning how to become a community agitator so what I'm saying to you is of course I Want to clean up your earth\nMore so than you might imagine and I've been working in ... conservation movement since I'm a youngster that doesn't mean we have to have hysteria in order to make our point and it's embarrassing to me that the administration refuses to permit\nMy wisdom to get anywhere near the president it really gets me angry actually because he's losing great opportunity and so when he was interviewed by sixty minutes\nAnd she said what about the scientists say global warming is this and that he could have devastated our with one word Vostok ice core samples and a few more line she would have been finished and it would have made it look so smart because he is so smart\nBut you can't just wing everything that you talk about your catcher shined it on to everybody like everyone's stupid moron and no one's really listening to you and I go on to the next point\nIf you want to make points with the public and I mean the educated public try to use them educated statements is what I'm saying in order to use educated statements you educated people around you\nSo that's all I Want to say about that subject Vostok ice core samples I Would like to reference an article written\nBy Cindy gross and the times of Israel I'm going to read you a few paragraphs and I'll Try to stay away from the obvious she says\nSavage is the host of one of the most countries most streamlined radio shows but Michael Savage and also fortune teller a brilliant wanted that who else of Michael Savage would release a book on October ninth the first day of work for associate justice Brett Kavanaugh after three weeks of historic hysteria embarrassed our country internationally\nI spoke with Savage and he said the left is not just take President Trump they hate this nation it's nothing new but it's at its worst\nAnd that she says Savage delves into American history history of mass hysteria to prove it from Christopher Columbus the Salem witch trials and then he or she she quotes me and she says that these are being set in motion by cynics the politicians with ulterior motives\nSavage provides vital contacts for the common elements of dozens of outbreaks of mass hysteria their causes they're short and long term effects and the tactics of the puppet masters who do gullible masses interfering threats both real and imagine\nShe then went into the issue of Jews because she writes for the times they're Israel she's very Jewish\nAnd she asked me a key question which was funny\nWhich was is this good or bad for the Jews what is being done to Capitol at that time\nAnd Savage said quote when Jews are good they are great but when they're bad they're very dangerous\nSavage pointed out adding quote the smartest yet most dangerous person today is Bernie Sanders he is so smart he knows exactly what he is doing he models this platform from the power madness of the Bolshevik Revolution he is energizing this frenzy among the young ...\nOf course we discuss the Kavanaugh hysteria\nAnd he said the check off the smear Kavanaugh was challenged in last male white heterosexual married and Christian the involvement of a Feinstein who was not Jewish Blumenthal Schumer affects Jews long term\nWe compared how Jews were treated during the alpha Dreyfuss earlier Frank cases\nSavage also related how Jewish laws and ethics are the exact opposite of what took place during the process of confirming Cavanaugh I thought that was the most salient point of our interview Savage related how the Jewish laws an ethics are the exact opposite of what took place\nDuring the process of governing Kavanaugh and what was sad about it was that there were Jewish people\nViolating the ethics of their fathers Blumenthal amongst them Blumenthal and others amongst them using the exact opposite of the teaching of the Jewish people\nSavage a Trump supporter agrees that while he doesn't agree with Trump one hundred percent he thanks got every day that Hillary isn't in the White House to any critics Savage says nobody agrees with a spouse or friend one hundred percent\nAnd then he went on with other stuff Savage encourages opposition to read the book and debate him\nAnd of course my discussion with Savage including where to get some good food the Catskill Mountains in his involvement with about so there was a very good interview and I ... and it's worth reading by people who are interested in the deeper ramifications of what happened and how the effects of going to be seen for years and years to come\nYou're going to learn so much by reading my book that no one else can teach you the way I did I'm going to give you three quotes from that book that you must have his Lenin who was the architect and many many ways as a communist revolutionary\nWas the head of government of Soviet Russia from Nineteen Seventeen to twenty twenty four out of the Soviet Union from Nineteen twenty two and Nineteen twenty four here he is the architect of evil saying\nThe goal of socialism communism lead and said that not Michael Savage was quoted in stop mass hysteria what else did lead and say that you must know a lie told often enough becomes the truth that was Lenin\nAnd here's another one for those of you are into gun grabbing you fools you lead and said one man with a gun then controlled one hundred men without one all of you who want to make America gun free\nWe know the truth it's all and stop mass hysteria because we're living through it we're living through it we're living through the nightmare all over again\nAnd when you have a biased media as we do today we even so called Fox News which is allegedly conservative\nBlocks Michael Savage perhaps the best known conservative intellectual in the world and they have left wing goes on if you're an independent as I Am it's very hard to survive in the sea of lies\nAnd you know what I have going for me I have two things going for me which is why you listen to me one I have a desire to tell you the truth\nThe best I can you'll have to be the judge of that and number two I've been blessed with a great energy to this point in my life that's something I have a little

American youth are fat blobs of garbage sugar or salt dairy just useless piles of DNA useful only for a social media\nSo one third of the youth couldn't serve in the military so I look back on how many died in the last weeks of World War two and I look at how the people lived through it I don't understand how this country could live through anything like this\nAnd are focusing instead on one part of World War two when tens of thousands died in flames when the allies bomb Dresden, Germany it burned for seven days in seven nights\nFifteen square kilometers of the city was reduced to rubble bodies or carried away from the center of Dresden, Germany days after the bombing how many died twenty five thousand to forty thousand civilians now why my telling you this you'll figure it out

the ashes but how many uh Russians died in the last weeks of the war to take Berlin when they bury the third wife\nYou know how many died you have any idea how many Russians was shot in the back by their own officers if they didn't go did you know that here in the military if you have let's say depression or bipolar you don't feel good that day you wake up at the wrong side of the bed you get it passed a day you get shot in the back at that time by the by the Soviet military\nYou know how many Soviet tanks were lost to the streets of Berlin eight hundred tanks were blown up just taking Berlin and the last weeks of the war\nBecause the idiot maniac crazed drug addict Adolf Hitler refused to let his troops even though the war was lost he refused to let his troops give up and save themselves and of course save a Berlin from total destruction this is what happens when you have fanaticism\nThe battle for ... twenty two thousand civilian lives in the street battles twenty two thousand what how many died amongst the Russians why am I telling you this well I'm telling you this to show you the scope of human\nTragedy I'm increasingly pessimistic about the survival of America incidentally

you want and all of the losers of the world so yeah yeah yeah we want the free stuff will vote for them but where's the money supposed to come from where for me\nFrom the people who work that's where it comes from so what happens is when when they taxes to death and becomes too high what do you think happens you think that there's a limited money we stop working\nWe just stop working and that's the end of it and then what's gonna happen what are you gonna do eat dirt so this is how it works unless you see the whole picture than you actually believe that Elizabeth Warren is an Indian chief [noise]\nI was reading some sue again over the weekend\nThe art of war and he wrote some you know strategies for the feeding an enemy and one of them is\nMake no mistake says what establishes the certainty of victory for it means conquering an enemy that it was already defeated and those words resonate with me all weekend conquering an enemy is already defeated so Obama flooded America with illegal aliens for eight straight years ...\nHe flooded us with Iranians many of whom are operatives of the enemy ... has ... has operatives in America ...\nOne third of our military age men are too fat to even fight ...\nThe rest of the drug addicts or addicted to something else on the Internet and wouldn't know how to fire a gun without shooting themselves in the foot ... so you read sons sue and you realize that the enemy has been working around the clock to destroy us and with little help from their friends in the media\nI Wonder if we could still win a war means conquering an enemy that has already defeated\nHence the skillful fight it puts himself into a position which makes the feet impossible and does not missed the moment for the feeding the enemy when I'm On that moment come\nWe
