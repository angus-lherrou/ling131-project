know that listen to what uncovered this racism at Harvard\nA Harvard University dean testified that the school that's different SAT score standards for prospective student's based on race and sex\nNow this trial was brought about by Asian American applicants who have said for years they've been discriminated against\nAt Harvard no kidding no kidding it's the same in Berkeley Princeton Yale all the other is the tuitions have lower living they haven't let the best and brightest then not at all they've discriminate against Asians and whites did you know that if they want to have diversity they want the catalog to look like an inner city\nThat's what's important not whether the students to keep up with the learning not whether anybody can excel at Harvard all that matters is that the brochure looks good\nSo the Asians had it up to here and they decided to sue trial began Monday\nAnd all I heard from so far was the dean of Harvard\nAnd they learned that Harvard sense recruitment letters to African American Native American and Hispanic high schoolers with only mid range SAT scores around eleven hundred on math and verbal combined out of a possible sixteen hundred but if you're an Asian American\nYou only get a recruitment letter if you score at least two hundred and fifty points higher that's Thirteen fifty for Asian women and Thirteen Eddie for men and the story\nBut the the liar\nWho runs it at Harvard\nSays it's not discrimination midst if it's him and said no no no this is not discrimination in Asian\nOh no no no we ... certain groups in order to break the cycle

is very hard to figure out but we made it America's and Saturday from the Salem witch trials with the Trump which on\nAnd that's only the beginning of where we're going to go I think that this book

and not being accepted based upon their qualifications they're being accepted based upon race straight out race discrimination that is what's coming out in the trial right now or that as a result of Asian Americans saying enough is enough\nBecause they're sending SAT scores higher for Asian Americans and higher for whites and this is absolutely violating the civil rights of everyone as a matter of fact because affirmative action is racism one way or the other\n[noise] an attorney representing the students for fair admissions accused Harvard of giving Asian Americans significantly lower ratings\nFor certain personal qualities listen to this that's how they used to get around it let's say you were a kid I got a six hundred SAT instead of sixteen hundred and they wanted to assure you when\nThey said you had great leadership qualities let's say and you had compassion now how can you judge compassionate leadership that's made of the two made up things right so they give Asian Americans lower ratings for certain personal qualities such as leadership and compassion\nThan any other race can you believe this\nBut the liars at Cambridge, Massachusetts Harvard said oh no we don't engage in discriminatory practices our doors are open to students of all backgrounds and means yeah but it's open more for some students than others\nThe door is only cracked open for Asians and whites while it's not taken off its hinges for others if you get the picture\nNow you know this is an interesting turnabout because no matter how this case turns out\nIt will go to the U.S Supreme

Court now [laughter]\nAh\nOh yeah that's our Supreme Court now and so we'll go to the Supreme Court\nAnd finally the debate surrounding affirmative racism which you called affirmative action is a policy from Nineteen Seventy eight that has given mostly African American and Hispanic students a great advantage in the college application process will finally be turned by our Supreme Court that's oh\nThat's so you want to live in a world of racism I don't I don't I was never given anything based upon my race or upon anything other than how hard I work and by the way I did poorly on the SATs as
