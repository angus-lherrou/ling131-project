I retired in April of this year after twenty four years of service you're\nA you know I have friends that were at that seen my brother in law was that that seems really\nPeople tossed around the worst year oh so lightly it bothers me there were real heroes that day and these officers\nAre being talked about for whatever reason but I Know what happens is those first two officers that arrived to gauge that guy coming out and he's not a shooter shooter is for legitimate operators that are on the good side even murder\nCase the murder\nJust showing up that got the call the police station as true blocks around the corner from a couple big cage to him and drove him back into that bill will be a while taking fire one of them as a hand in three that's probably never going to allow him to return to work again\nOr they set up a perimeter a commander showed up and saw all these officers stuck you know to go in because the SWAT Team wasn't there yet and\nThe murderer was laying down on fire and trying to draw them into the into the building because you had a bottle show they allowed the SWAT Team to come in\nAnd they encountered him on that third floor behind the giant ... like a presidential desk\nAnd the first one operators are huge guy he's over six foot four just solid muscle you went in\nWith his team and he took so many rounds you got shot at least in both like the abdomen while on any of your head shots tennis\nCounting only can we get your number and can we call you back tomorrow to not hang up is to reduce or scrapped county and get in the number was like all the wonderful heroes or they're really appreciate everything you do see tomorrow [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrying to ... talk radio station Eugene Johnson City sports though [noise]\nIt's for a massacre I come here and I mean the first court appearance today for the suspect accused of gunning down eleven people\nIn Pittsburgh synagogue course monetary about land Robert\nBowers was a wheeled into the courtroom where the judge listed the charges against him he signed some papers and agreed to be represented by a public defender he'll be back in court on Thursday for a preliminary hearing when the prosecution will present evidence to back up the charges against him\nAnd hearing has been out for the man charged with sending more than a dozen pipe bombs to top Democrats and CNN correspondent Rosa Florence reports of Caesar saying I was very emotional and court\nWas crying when I hear in his hands were shaking he was sitting in the jury box in his hands young scenes on my hands and feet and its tail\nA place to place blame right\nIt is it's from because of his rhetoric you heard a lot of that this weekend but it it in a different way they looked at the bomber guy they kinda they they really tried to tie everything together it's tough with this even though some have been trying to tie it together because Trump's Trump's son in law\nJewish his daughter the murder Judy at his grandchildren Jewish his love of Israel the Israeli ambassador to the United states came out said look there's been nobody friendlier and better and a bigger supporter of Israel\nThen Donald trumps of even try to draw a parallel\n\nThat somehow he takes some sort of blame for this and he's the cause of it\nBut what you're not going to hear and what you should be hearing is he's a loser\nHe's a man who's failed life who was looking around at his failures and the only thing he can come up it's not my fault that I didn't get a promotion it's not my fault that\nI couldn't get a good job it's not my fault that nobody likes me it's not my fault that women won't date me it's not my fault\nFor these things is a collective\nSpirit the theorists mind of him sitting around with other people in the same situation\nGetting ready to figure out how\nWe can blame this on somebody else and that's exactly what\nThey did his act was even here in simple\nBut if you really look at it it's a simple thing to understand this guy is a giant loser\nHe's got a three bedroom two bath house with a wife and kids or a business or a great job or even a decent job he's got any of these things put together\nCatch what he's not\nIt's not really a loser and when you're not really a loser he got nobody to blame because life seems to be okay so you're moving on with your life what is seen as people across the board\nGet ahead and he has so there's got to be a reason for that right\nIt's got to be a reason I'm not play centerfield for the Yankees because the high school coach hated me totally ruined my life because I was the man\nLosers absolute losers but never let a situation like this\nGo without the opportunity to get a few jabs and at the president and in some way tired somebody semi back to him\nAnd I have to understand that there weren't matter I don't think anybody should know Donald Trump personally responsible for what happened in Pittsburgh series you know you have learned sex in our society or who are loose with guns [noise]\nUm but I Do think the best special responsibility for a shovel purchasing one super social responsibility for the moral tone of the country or what are we expect our presidents do especially in times of crisis to bring us together and Donald Trump has an effect on leash than the dogs of hatred in this country [noise]\nYou know some I look look the reality is some people feel emboldened because of Trump and the attitude yes that's true\nRight but the media plays a big part in it to write because hate is business and business is booming on both sides of the aisle in there and and in in in and they like fighting and they like arguing and it's more entertaining than sitting around and being bland and so they'll focus on these kinds of things and it's great right like it's it's business\nBut for a guy like\nThis he he wasn't living in a world of of\nYou know he didn't care about Trump and what he had the same if you read some of the stuff that you wrote he couldn't stand Trump thought Trump was was being used essentially a puppet by the scientist you know Israel and Jews they were controlling him in\n... I wouldn't be caught dead in America had I mean this guy is he was no fan of Trump this guy was singularly focused even the nurses just of the of of of of of a level that\nIs is different than the guy that thinks he's the bees knees in his life is great this guy's ... was the was the ... of the loser kind\nOne guy thinks he's God's Gift to the world and he's got a lot going for that's what keeps him from being a guy like this this guy is a nurse assistant thinks the only reason he's not that is because older people have kept him down\nYou can't latest at the foot of Trump or the people who feel embolden become Trump someone I Would assume yeah right absolutely there there there was some some people out there that feel emboldened but you can't hold somebody's ... him responsible for this guy's action\nThis guy's actions are all on him\nAnd this guy's action started a long time ago with his belief that he was being held down by whatever reason the Jews the people break coming from different countries all of these things and that they were destroying his world to get ahead and because of that he couldn't have friends\nBecause of that he couldn't get a real job because of that he had no wife no girlfriend or boyfriend no no job no career no no prospects for anything he was a giant loser\nAnd what he's a loser of that size you look to find out\nWho can I blame the sun and after a while you Janet up so much inside of your head and you get in the echo chamber like he was with other people like him and they feed off each other and they poison each other and finally something snaps and he thinks he's got to go do something and this right here is going to give him credit to a certain extent\nAnd because of that he won't be a loser at least in a certain circle of people know you're a loser\nYou always worry and if you didn't do this over the weekend you were still a loser because you're a loser actually I've been to show your Twitter C.
