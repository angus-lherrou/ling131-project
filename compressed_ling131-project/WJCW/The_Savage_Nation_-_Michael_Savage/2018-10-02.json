out everything that happened this is something that was awhile ago some\nWitnesses or potential witnesses may not want to cooperate [noise] um but for those that can and those who we can compel to cooperate or we've got to do a false from investigation\nA lawyer for a long time Kavanaugh friend mark ... says he has spoken to the FBI but the interview has not been completed the U.S has reached a pact with the neighbors\nWas in his future he probably couldn't have done this so this gave them the freedom to do this but also you know there were other there are other factors that were at work behind the scenes but the interesting thing is is is\nEverybody is like how angry he was how mad he was how how testy what's how dare he do this how dare he act the way he did how dare he be angry\nAt something like this I was really\nStunned by how we acted at that hearing this as a basically a job interview for the highest court of the land or her testimony was compiling incredible or both accounts\nCan't be true and so one one idea here is that he's simply was drinking more than he was saying over that time period\nAnd then he didn't remember what happened and so I was just simply trying to get at that and\nNothing Kobach from a a Minnesota and so that's one idea right that is one idea it's a job of well I mean it's a job interview I never got a job interview and they looked at me go so here you are rapists\nAnd these people over here who may hire you or may not higher figure right so you're an alcoholic ... think that you you you put people in positions to be raped as a child that was your job you were like uh the\nOh man it's like the movie taken right here at the airport here you're you're trying to get people to share rides with you and the uh tell your friends coming over here I drove them all up come rhythm no so how how would how would\nYou feel right how would anybody feel\nAny reasonable sane human being\nMan or woman black or white gay or straight would be pissed off would be angry and if you're sitting there for days and we think about this for a second\n\nHe had days of being called all kinds of things he had days of seeing his name dragged through the mud he had days of sitting there stewing in being angry and finally he had his chance to come forward and defend themselves and do I think at times he was a little bit harsh oh I can understand that yeah he probably\nWould but couldn't any reasonable sane human being understand that\nHe had exchanges with Senator Feinstein was center closure with others that I thought one over line um he was clearly a belligerent um aggressive angry\nAs anybody would now at the same time things you don't hear about\nSo I was just simply trying to get at that and really couching it in the fact that I'd alcoholism in my own family my dad in Ninety now struggled with and throughout his wife and finally got treatment and is sober\nI got help from a and so I was actually trying to get it the truth so that's why I was stunned by how he answered it but then of course he he later apologized\nBut you're trying to diagnose him as an alcoholic minus me I can name and no people I've ever met who didn't party as a as a high school producer Phil you and I are the same\nAge you're nearly the same age as our friend over here as I Am a judge Kavanaugh did you may be at times have a few beverages of the adult nature when\nYou were in high school I'm On the advice of counsel I Choose not to answer that question\nThat suggests\nThere you go there you know why\nBut that's what we're getting it well he you know I've got friends who are alcoholics or my dad was an alcoholic exhibited it that's that's the craziness of it all but this was never about and still continues to be never about\nThis\nPerson and his wellbeing or Dr Ford in her wellbeing this has only to do with the fact that they want to stop him at all costs by any means necessary that you know by any means necessary we'll see what happens\nOh God I saw people over the weekend a hammer toe you know it's because he's white you know like what yeah excuse angry white man what is in the white everything to do with this I'm sure if you choose the black men of rape\nAnd doing all these kinds of things\nRight for the sake of argument he doesn't get through this process and then they go a Amy uh Coney Barrett is the one they become after next and they go after a hard core I Would expect her to push back and if you'd call or a child molester let's just say right like this is hypothetical here do you think she's going to be pissed and angry\nRight if you say hey I hear you bite the heads off chickens that's what I heard and that at night you do say ten of worship in your house and that you are you know you may line\nOr whatever you think that maybe there'd be a pushback an anger I'm\nJust curious I think everybody has a right to be pissed off at angry that sometimes everybody has a right to push back then I Would expect anybody to be accused of anything to push back in that direction don't care what it is\nYou should should be pissed you should be angry doesn't mean it's well it's a job as a

necklaces anything more was viewed as showing off for being overly boastful a very negative trait attention a rap raps does out there\nAnd this is likely why almost all contemporary depictions of

to be communist as we learn in the Nineteen eighties wouldn't have known a papers were released you'll have to research that Venona papers it confirmed it almost all of the people accused by senator McCarthy were in fact fellow travelers in communist but putting that aside\nHow many times have you been lectured by leftist professors that McCarthy was a bad man\nThat McCarthyism which became

defended myself every time it I've won every case\nBut we're we're witnessing right now a form of defamation never before seen in American history perhaps since the Salem witch trials\nAnd in my book mass hysteria I have a chapter titled from Salem to CNN how hysteria taught us too and that's and that's the ties ourselves\nAnd I say we are at risk of returning to this medieval state as we allow the corrupted mainstream press agenda driven agitated if the game controller sections of the population\nThat I ask how is the nation's best interests or when the self serving New York race or Al

now what he did then spread mass hysteria that elevates them in the eyes of his community\nLike the inhabitants of seventeenth century villages people hear him speak with authority about subjects in

don't know who their names are so let's look at libel and slander if someone accuses you fall asleep and it causes you harm you have a civil remedy if those words ended up causing harm to your reputation or your livelihood\nLibel as a written or published defamatory statement while slander is defamation that has spoken by the defendant so you have to look at proving libel and slander I Would like to propose that anyone who slander as anyone in public even a public figure\nHas to pay the price in a paying the same penalty that the individual who was slandered all libel would have paid in other words if someone slander as let us say public figure and that public figure by being the famed loses a position\nAnd loses their money or something like that a certain amount of money and that turns out that there there was false based amount of false what's through the which on\nThe individuals who slander libel that figure should have to pay the exact\nPenalty that that

they ethically say they have different addresses and I'd like your permission to go over and a half the people are at seat to sixty over there in Concord, California what's going on and if you're one of the largest security companies in America\nOr why do you just have a sweet number you have a natural\nThey do what you're saying is what let's boil it down for the listener that when I raised the question is for tied to the CIA in some way and I only ask the question because people have been circulating these rumors are and making these connections are you alleging she is or she is not\nOkay but I Believe is now separate from all that I Believe that she has been teaching a class for a potential CIA agents\nOr how to basically get a job and it starts at forty three thousand dollars as an intern in the Central Intelligence agency if you intend to go into the covert operations area and she had\nWhere when she got the expertise on covert operations that we're talking about the accuser Snow White or a doctor fraud where did she get information about how to be a covert operations officer\nHow to take a polygraph test that's part of how you get to be a CIA agent you must pass a polygraph test and in in the advanced courses you have to know how to fake it and pass the test even though you're lying because you're a great deceptive spy and you can convince people\nThat are teachers that she she teaches that pardon she teaches ... or ...\nOf course for in terms of the Central Intelligence agency\nStanford now I noticed a in the media they mentioned only that she was at Palo Alto university which I'd never heard of but they do have a psychological right\nPaolo Alto university as a kind of a um a parking lot university a storefront basically\nBut she uses the words Palo Alto confused people into thinking she's a big professor at Stanford well in fact she does teach a course on how to get a job at this she's a gatekeeper for the CIA Stanford according to what I've been able to read do you agree with that\nAnd and that's not all there are so many connections here to the Central Intelligence agency her grandfather helped invent it along with well built on it in and bill Casey who made a nice speech after he retired a ... and he became law makes\nYou so interested in the connection between Dr fraud and the CIA ...\nSorry I don't think you can hear me and what makes you interested in the connections between Dr fraud and the CIA what brings you to be interested in the thing\nThat made me interested as I retired as a respiratory therapist about five years ago and I'm suddenly inspired to become\nFor the first time in my life an investigative journalist ... apparently there as you pointed out there aren't any out there not one senator has done a background check on this woman revealing the simple fact I've been able to accumulate over the weekend\nWell okay I posted on September ... doctor for deeply tied the\nCIA okay\nAnd her brother Raul third used to work for the international you saw this the new\nYes sir and also it here than just a couple of discrepancy is and what may be said on on on your website you can correct that we don't get caught you know making an error or he worked at Baker Hostettler but ah like nine years before they hired a they retain fusion GPS\nSo there's a kind of a lack of a connection there and also deep\nIt'll wake up at the same law firms in her brother worked that did create fusion GPS the company who wrote the Russian dot CA\nLeft he wasn't there at the time that they did the GPS thing or\nWhat does the same company isn't it\nYou're absolutely right and also that that's not the only connection with Baker Hostettler these guys had been involved with the CIA for a long time\nWell again I Want to say that I liked the CIA I've been a defender of the CIA I Love the intelligence services I think we need them desperately however if there is a connection between Dr fraud with Dr Ford whichever you prefer and the CIA wouldn't you think that this is something the American people should be aware of\nAny investigative reporter what is his salt would have made some connections\nTo know why do you think it's not been talked about yet on Fox News you why has this linkage from my my Twitter feed or my website been linked by any site in America why\nYeah very low but why why are they not linking him talking about it I I totally agree\nI mean they're quick to talk about a a cabin or the slightest hint of anything he ever did from throwing ice to drinking beer is suddenly a big

years and I have been the famed I'd been lied about slander and over the years I've defended myself every time and I want every case\nBut we're we're witnessing right now a form of defamation never before seen in American history perhaps since the Salem witch trials\nAnd in my book mass hysteria I have a chapter titled from Salem to CNN how hysteria taught us too and that's and that's the ties ourselves\nAnd I say we are at risk of returning to this medieval state\nAs we allow the corrupted mainstream press agenda driven agitator to gain control of sections of the population that I ask how is the nation's best interests or when the self serving New York race or Al Sharpton\nCause for federal the funding of the Jefferson Memorial and that was one example now here's a man who's background included vocal visible support for Fifteen year old to wanna Brawley\nFrom ... falls New York who in Nineteen eighty seven lied and claimed she was raped by several white men police officers among them\nAl Sharpton was joined by those are the pillars of the black community the racist nation of Islam had Louis ... and that famed booster of women's rights Bill Cosby well together with a complicit media they whipped up blind frenzy and mass hysteria all of it based on a lie\nTo water Brawley later converted to Islam change their name became a nurse and moved to Virginia\nThough Sharpton lost all credibility Fritz rushed to judgment he continues to do now what he did then spread mass hysteria that elevates them in the eyes of his community like the inhabitants of seventeenth century village is people hear him speak with authority\nAbout subjects in which he has absolutely no objectivity yet they share and follow uncalled for blood today it's mass hysteria raised against one of the towering figures of American history Thomas Jefferson\nToday's youth you see are the targets and cause of campus progressive ... children have always been victims of manipulation the testimony of

who perpetrated hysteria our immune from the consequences the essential question our nation has been forced to ask over and over again today who is pulling the strings and why while we finally have the faces of those\nIn injecting America with these lies and this hysteria\nThe names are to be seen in plain English the defamation has to be seen by all Americans\nDianne Feinstein Cory Booker Camelot Harris\nShy name all of them or you don't know who their names are so let's look at libel and slander if someone accuses you fall asleep and it causes you harm you have a civil remedy if those words end up causing harm to your reputation or your livelihood\nLibel as a written or published a ... or a statement while slander is defamation that has spoken by the defendant so you have to look at proven libel and slander I Would like to propose that anyone who slander as anyone in public even a public figure\nHas to pay the price in a paying the same penalty that the individual who was slandered all live all would have paid in other words if someone slander as let us say public figure and that public figure by being the famed loses a position\nAnd loses their money or something like that a certain amount of money and then it turns out that there there was false based upon a false sorts through the witch hunt\nThe individuals who slander ally build that figure should have to pay the exact\nPenalty that that individual would have paid had they been found guilty of such slander or lies what is wrong with that nothing so here's the problem the law itself as the ass the law is an ass said the great great British SAS\nSamuel Johnson and the Eighteen hundreds he said the law is an ass Shakespeare has some wonderful things to say about lawyers which I cannot repeat on this

about whether it's something I had done or not done\nOr something to that effect he wouldn't let me go he just wouldn't let it go it was drilled into me why does truth matter the truth matter in an age of media charades\nDoes truth matter in an age of fake news on both sides of the aisle tell me the truth really matter to you I'm asking you listen to your question I don't care if you're a ...\nA progressive or whatever you call yourself do you really care what the truth is audio only care about getting your side to win that's really the issue is it just a team sport if it is I'm Out tell me if anyone covered the fines thing China spy and how long they covered it for why they why did they brushed aside\nThe left does not even understand that they become very enemies of themselves here's a

charges against these innocent men were dropped but what happens to the liar what happens to the rapist the woman who write their reputations\nWell the men themselves are acting real good they're

isn't the Salem region was fermented environment of economic uh socio political turmoil does it sound familiar\nWell it'll be familiar to you after you investigate this a little a little bit more [noise] so what was what were the Salem witch trials what happened\nWell the minister of Salem Village was the strict pious Reverend Samuel Paris and he had a son Thomas and two daughters ages eleven at night in January of sixteen Ninety to the girls began having tantrums or fish as they were called at the time\nOr the girls through objects screen made strange noises and twisted themselves into bizarre positions\nAs with John good witness children in Connecticut\nA doctor was called and once again unable to cure the girls the physician pronounced the element to be demonic in nature well then another local girl eleven year old and putting them began having in a similar fashion a pair of magistrates are demanded that the young lady's name the source of there'll be which went\nOn February twenty ninth under pressure of the girls identified three women Sarah Osborne an elderly woman living in poverty Sarah Good a pregnant beg a woman and the Paracels Caribbean slave ...\nConveniently unpredictably two of them were among the rabble into that authorities did not want in their town good an Osborn profess their innocence to no avail and so did too but at first\nThose slaves were rare in the region she had been with Reverend Paris for fourteen years and she loved the Paris children for whom she was largely responsible\nBut Paris whipped er into confessing promising to secure her released if she did so the poor woman admitted to the magistrates that quote the devil came to me and bid me serve him an added that she was not the only local which wanting to harm the Puritans she also inform them that she had in fact bake they which cake\nFrom Ryan urine with which she gave the family dog just in case the pet was a familiar or help or of a local which what happened next [noise]\nThe three women worried prison the next day\nDespite his promise Paris bound to political expediency and allow the slave to remain behind bars we late spring before the governor finally convened the special court order and permanent as soon as the women were in prison the Salem authorities other took a program we know all too well the auto distraction pay attention Diane\nIf there were problems between the merchants than farmers if there were challenges to the local theocracy then leaders must create a diversion Diane an event that would dominate what passed for new cycle at sixteen Ninety two and that was which is right in their midst\nTo Juba had said there were others the word spread that they had to be found using the tactics have Dianne Feinstein and the committee\nTactics or mass hysteria and paranoia Europe had purge itself up tens of thousands of undesirable that way Salem and it's on ... had to do the same\nAs with so many things one can hold the media partly responsible for this hysteria and I give you some examples of how the media was used in that time through books in publications\nAnd so the hysteria gathered force throughout the early spring and the numbers of those accused continued to grow by the end of may more than sixty people would jail and awaiting trial for witchcraft that was ...\nThe governor was finally forced to establish a special court of all your and tournament and what happened then on June tenth that institution Dianne Feinstein hang its first victim Bridget Bishop a brass the widows late husband had run and then she was apparently accused of no crime in particular other than that she was a soft target\nThe woman was known for playing shuffle board and wearing red clothing which was considered to signify sexual yearning and prowess well it went on and on and on and what happened\nWell cotton mayor put his agenda ahead of justice he crafted the equivalent of fake news and contributed his own call to arms of the court riding the following\nWe cannot but humbly recommend onto the government the speedy and vigorous prosecution of such as we have rented themselves obnoxious according to the direction given in laws have gone and the wholesome statutes of the English nation for the detection of which crafts\nAnd so what happened was at the peak of the hysteria few citizens regardless of their standing or immune from accusation and they went on and they got one person after another under the Salem witch trials\nAnd so now we speed forward to today\nAnd I'm reading from a book that I'm sure will become a very popular book in America for many years to come stop mass hysteria\nI Want to make one important point\nAnd that's one that you're going to face today and for the next months and years ahead and that's the difference between mass hysteria unjustified concern\nIf for example the public had risen up against cutting them either and his cohorts that would not have been hysteria and twenty eight team this is something the mainstream media did not understand\nIf you look back through history history not agenda masquerading as history which is already get from the media today you would learn that the following\nThat for the last one thousand four hundred years radical Islam has been at war with the world that is not a slam a phobia as the mainstream media what have you believe it is fact it is history and urge you to read this without the bias I mentioned earlier in this book indoctrination versus truth\nAnd I give you a list going back only forty years for a partial lifting of the atrocities going back to Nineteen Seventy nine and the U.S embassy in Iran was taken over by radical Muslim males and I bring this up because the mass hysteria and our society is running in the opposite direction as well and what do I mean by that", "show_name": "The Savage Nation - Michael Savage", "year": "2018", "city": "Johnson City", "day": "02"}
