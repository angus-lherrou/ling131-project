for three different reasons even though I say W offensive it's actually traveling offensive they\nSay that anyone who attacks George Soros is doing it because they're anti Semite let me deal with that for a minute I'm probably more Jewish than George Soros that's number one and if you're going to tell me as a person of the Jewish right\nIs not allowed to criticize another person to the Jewish faith without being called an anti Semite I Will say that you go to hell how's that George Soros is the most disruptive individual in the history of the American political system\nNobody has ever spent more money to disrupt more events than this man he has funded on the far you\nKnow the good folks have been beating people up and attacking police George Soros funds them black lives matter don't tell me they're not a domestic terrorist group because I Will disagree with you that's my opinion what because as the word black and I can't say that their violence is something I should ignore sorry I see him and I call them as I see them\nDon't hide behind the Holocaust and anti Semitism Everytime someone criticizes you George that is a standard operating procedure on the American left I've seen it a thousand times in my life George and you know I think people are on to you\nAnd I do think that the government has an obligation to investigate any ... in there who sets out to disrupt the political system because that's what you do that is what you do for a living us funded that'd be testable group media matters ever since I've been in radio they've been smearing me\nAnd why have you done it to keep us off your back George Soros and your son your pee wee pitched squeak son there is never earned a diamond his life of his own sits there and as a big ... big tower they're throwing miss him down at the world you and your son and you'll have the nerve to publish an article today saying\nThe president in his anti Semite supporters on a plane for bombs being sent to his father's house says that the little son\nHe wrote a new op ed for the New York times called the hate that is consuming us this is ironic since George Soros funds hate groups I mean it's unbelievable to me sorrows funds the biggest the most powerful hate groups in the country and he says the hatred is consuming us and then he says his father has long faced anti Semitism\nOh really but something changed the twenty sixteen he called on Americans to stop demonizing politicians Diddy then why does your father fun groups to demonize Donald Trump once you start your own backyard Alexander Soros\nGeorge Soros the sun or nobody called against it as a threat to the future of American democracy and he hit out at the president in a New York times op ed entitled the hate that it's consuming us\nNow this kid Alexander ... in my estimation if he didn't have a father was a bit you know like his father he couldn't get a job or selling apple computers in in Zimbabwe I don't think you'd get a job selling computers anywhere then\nHe jumps ready to white supremacist an anti Semite ... this is stupid\nOr just stupid they're all trying to hide behind a standard operating things that they use so let me read you my latest headline and I'll see what you have to say but I'm sitting here waiting for them to release deli Harvey Oswald I Want to know who the Lee Harvey Oswald is\nAnd by the way this is all an attempt by the way if it's left or right wing who's doing this and we don't really know at this point but you've got to read my headline to to actually hear what I said I said\nBombs high probability they could be false flags to distract from hordes of illegal aliens\nThat's a logical statement high probability could be false flags high probability could be false flags to distract from hordes of illegal aliens who have been dropped off the news a screen Sanford thing though in the marching army coming from under us to suddenly disappeared\nRight so you know you don't put two and two together now I don't know who planted the bombs needed the you but I'm waiting to see who the Lee Harvey Oswald is going to be who's the pass either going to dig up\nWhen will the passing be shown high probability that could be false flags to distract from hordes of illegal aliens now we can talk about that if you want the phone number is eight five five four and a seven to eight too\nBut as I said yesterday and I was the first one to say this I thought it was laughable that four of those receiving these quote bombs or check their mail at the very same time\nAnd prior to the normal delivery time of mail in their areas I thought it was ironic and really suspicious to me I didn't say all of them I said three of four of them at the same time right\nThis plot was coordinated by someone and yet it of aided all of law enforcement in DC and New York Florida how could how could that be do you have a department of homeland security that looks for in these lone wolves\nAlso as I said yesterday and I was the first to say a copy today by America's on news blowhard none of the packages were stamped\nNone of them were posted marked rather meaning they were all hand delivered so they were hand delivered but we haven't seen one image of one surveillance camera on all of these high powered billionaires properties I was that even possible\nHow how is that possible\nWhy would they conservative give left this this kind of talking point two weeks before the most important election of our time\nAnd by the way any bomb expert who intended to target a hope a high profile individual would they put a bomb in an area they know it'd be checked by an assistant of the target not to target themselves\nI mean if you were a nut and your an evil nut and violent nut and you wanted to hurt somebody would you put your bomb in a place where you know the person you're intending to harm never even picks up the mail\nRight you know that Obama doesn't get his own there you know ... doesn't get his own male you know Hillary doesn't get our own male so do you have to have any common sense anymore is there any common sense left\nNow by the way where did they get the private addresses of these people where\nThey get the private address of George Soros and could tone of New York I didn't know about it until yesterday with the day before these addresses a non public information and ah didn't a democratic staffer recently got arrested for stealing Republican addresses from the office of Sheila Jackson\nSo who was that who stole these private addresses from the Democrat files that's where they got 'em from\nRight now what about CNN the most evil network in the history this is not a network this is out of the Soviet Union union CNN is the equivalent of is ... and ... the wrapped in together so they open their package they took a picture of it before calling the police of the bomb squad\nRight they open it took a picture of it before calling the police of the bomb squad I knew people that gullible to believe that a company like CNN would open a suspicious package without calling the bomb squad first or they're in on the scam\nRemember what I'm saying to you I'm human or using common sense and then the mainstream media outlets all had the same talking points uh at the same time\nSo I think that this is either a classic sigh op operation in order to distract us from the actual mob violence against conservatives\nAnd also to distract us from the army that us marching towards our southern border from a Honduras the Democrats had a disaster with the Kavanaugh hearings Dianne Feinstein little trick blew up in her face\nShe tried to crucify Kavanaugh was a false set of claims and the whole country turned against or accept Democrat operatives so that blew up in their face\nThen they figured let's get a couple of hundred marching in from Honduras women and children with carriages will do this again to Trump all of a sudden thousands joins then more thousands joined then more thousands joined and now it's an army mainly of strapping young men of military age marching towards our border with new sneakers and new clothing\nWhere are they getting their food from Diane how can they all have clean clothing on where the washing machines along the way this washing machines in the desert where how would they keeping themselves clean where are they going to the bathroom George or even the most ...\nDragging conservative can ask these questions we don't need the blank stare at anti coup what the answer is for us we don't need those stooges on MSNBC to answer it for us you know most of us are very intelligent George you may not know that living in your little tower their hatred that George Soros tower of hate\nWhere your number one product is dispelling hate against Donald Trump and the American people voted for George that's why you're despised in this country not because of anti Semitism well I better take a quick break because this is not a

usa away the worst newspaper and America loses money every day and the headline is a Donald Trump's nationalism isolates between hate and patriotism today's talker\nWere who wrote this garbage nationalism is now hate I don't think nationalism is hatred I think the opposite is true I think that nationalism and survival I\nKnow is anathema to George Soros the international is who runs an organization called open the open borders Institute no the open society Institute George Soros has funded\nGroups across Europe for many years decades perhaps to break down the borders the language and the culture of every nation in Europe in fact he's on the wanted list in Hungary for what he's done to his native land they're\nTrying to save their national identity then national is them\nFrom the hordes of Africans and Muslims that Soros once flooded into every European nation to destroy the nation's what do you think the intent of the international lists get anyone listening to the show telling me how bringing in many Muslims the European nations is going to help those nations\nWhat is it that you can't put so until they gather\nSo now nationalism is now a dirty word to the international is as it always has been going back to the Bolshevik Revolution which they all study and the Bolshevik\nRevolution is going on in America and they don't know why they can't break us the way they've broken France they don't know why they can't break the American people the way they broke in Germany they don't know why they can't break break us the way they broken so many other nations in Europe they\nAre stumped they owned depressed they on the news outlets they've got every stupid entertainer in the world dancing for them like Mary Annette ... they've got more honest\nLike Robert

us we actually think you're more deplorable than we are\nAnd we think you're closer to a totalitarian\nThan Donald Trump is George you were elected to nothing George Soros you're nothing but a money changer and Jesus told us about money changes George now that's anti Semitic I'm not going to apologize for what Jesus said\nBut you made your fortune by trading currencies didn't you George\nDidn't you almost break the bank of England George\nProvoking anti Semitism which still exists in England because of what you did to the British pound and while I'm at a George I have a very good memory and I'm a scholar didn't you go to Malaysia shortly after that it almost break the Malaysian currency setting off wave after wave of hatred towards Jewish people George\nDon't blame that on Donald Trump and don't blame that on conservatives like me look in the mirror George because we can see right through you\n\nSo you know there's a lot of anger going around but you can't sit here and just let them

responsible for the now ten suspicious packages\nFirst and foremost my message today is that New Yorkers are safe there are no current credible threats when individuals organizations or locations here in New York City\nAnd can you tell us how this individual got that package into your newsroom and why are people opened it up and took a picture of it before calling a bomb squad maybe that will go a long way to explain and go actually put it in your newsroom huh\nShe will not so stupid we actually can still\nThink and that's why we're not France that's why we're not Germany that's why we're not the countries that are already fall into your influence\nSo we're just asking logical questions you want to call it hey you can call it anything you want but we're not getting the answers that we want and I don't know that there are going to find this person by the way I mean I'm saying where's the Lee Harvey Oswald the patch the that the bomb plot will be a late on that's what I'm waiting for\nI don't know where that person is Taylor on kale I up in Dallas texas what do you think a tale of who's the who's the Lee Harvey Oswald going to be\nWell our summit in my article that this person or persons were laying ... for this reason they looked at is getting the the packages [noise] those are the some of these people are the ones that are tied into global is\nThat you know the new world order so to speak and so\n... so it's not even so to speak they stand for open borders and they hate nationalist so there is a new world order and they're behind than a thousand percent right and so I hate America to hate everything America stands for they deny American exceptionalism they hate white people let's be clear who they are\nYes I submit to you to suggest that\nThe same people that are getting the packages no more than than the than we know and a possibly the these packages admit sitting in this country for several weeks maybe several months because absolutely if you follow the fall of the the path of these idiots\nA clear back to when they got when Trump got elected this added up our things that have gone on that hasn't worked for these idiots okay\nRight they turned on they tried to make capital of the poster boy of evil it turns on Dianne Feinstein she has hate all over her face and it backfired on every poll says what I saw when I saw that poor man being crucified\nBy these enemies of the truth I said it's going to backfire on them because the women of this country all have a son has been a brother a male and the family did they know could be could be destroyed the way they were trying to destroy capital so that didn't work for the Democrats\nThen they came up with a big march from Honduras that turn most Americans against open borders so now all of a sudden mail bombs\nThank you for the call I don't I don't go for it\nI remain a skeptical of the whole story\nAnd the biggest question is CNN's offices how did the day after George Soros his mailbox and could tone in New York\nHow did it get to CNN's offices in a big company since it wasn't male to them it's not a mail bomb this was delivered by a hand hand delivered somebody brought it in\nSo you're telling me Mr ... as paranoid as he allegedly\nIsn't you tell him he missed the look of CNN the doctors Sylvana of the media for those of you in the comic books Jeff Zucker\nThe banner on CNN are you telling me the man who's made a fortune or hating Trump has no surveillance cameras in his mail room and couldn't show a picture of the purple brought it in I mean it doesn't make sense to me and you know why because see I'm not an actor I didn't go to the high school or performing on\nI went to uh schools of higher education higher learning I earned two master's degrees in a PHD from a great university and I published twenty nine books have several that have not been published I've been trained interest that Chilean logic and thinking so pardon me if I'm using common sense and logic to

they would vote that way for a\nWhile we know that the bomb that was found on George Soros his property was detonated by his his Gardner there on the other guy came out well the guy came out he was you know raking leaves by hand\nWearing probably a hat you know to keep the hot sun off his head up their keep the the autumn leaves office years and he went in the mailbox no cameras of course and lo and behold there was a suspicious package so George services caretaker allegedly took it out to a field in and detonated it did you remember that story\nNow that don't even while yeah yeah that was the first day detonated in their fields and there's no evidence of that you understand that one yeah where where where's the fragments that that bomb\nRight oh oh now you're talking\n... misplaced

a friend of yours as a friend of mine sent me this this morning so this came to me from a friend of mine about the history letter bombs and my the friend of mine said what might be the first recorded case of a device broadly similar to a modern parcel bomb was featured in the Eighteen century of fair known as the band box plot\nBand box plot on November fourth Seventeen twelve a band box which is a lightweight had box was sent to Robert Harley roller box for the British lord treasure\nAnd the box contained a number of loaded and Koch pistols to who's triggers was attached a thread\nWhich would have made the pistols fired the moment the box was open\nBut the plot was foiled by Jonathan Swift you can believe it or through on the color of his travels who happened to be visiting the URL of Oxford Jonathan Swift perceiving a threat or to be something tricky sees the package cut the thread dust disarming the device\nAnd the attack was laid out the door of the opposition wig party and through enormous popular sympathy be behind missed the Harley\nAnd guess what happened then the precise perpetrators were never identified or apprehended you know what I'm saying history is quite instructive and what goes around comes around the perpetrators were never identified are apprehended but populist sympathy went behind the men are receiving the\nHat box with the pistols in it so you know there's nothing new under the sun\nAnd it takes a doesn't take any great intelligence to figure this out so far but they made Dick summing up out of a trailer park in Florida\nSome lizard looking

doesn't happen at all with dealing in illusions and we all know that people live and die by what they see on television and they think that what they see on television is the truth we are in such trouble\nBecause most of your don't read books most of you don't read newspapers the only true that you believe is what you see on TV\nAnd in fact his entire generation that knows nothing that did not

are you going to find any real truth\nYou're going to have to try to dig it up and your own mind if you could still think you may try to figure out what's going on right now maybe you'll be able to think I don't know if people think anymore I don't think they can think I think the age of thinking is over I think the age of thought is dead\nAnd so now we have this thing about the suspicious packages and none of it makes sense to anybody could still think\nSorrows bomb was the first one the next day gives a speech thing Donald Trump will be gone by twenty twenty or sooner that kicked off the entire football game the very next day a multitude a plethora of such\nSuch a bombs or packages that looked like bombs appear and all of a sudden the whole country's in lockdown\nAnd what is the

immediately\nThere they were central casting psi ops from the top to the bottom right out of the communist playbook right out of animal farm clearly psi ops in the minds of anyone who knows what I'm

City\nCNN reports at least some of the packages may have been male fruit Florida three more packages were discovered today to set the former vice president Joe Biden in Delaware and willing to work to Robert De Niro in New York New York governor Andrew Cuomo's had several of the packages sent two high profile figures in his state\nAnd we think you're closer to a totalitarian than\nTrump is George you were elected to nothing George Soros you're nothing but a money changer and Jesus told us about money changes George now that's anti Semitic I'm not going to apologize for what Jesus said\nBut you made your fortune by trading currencies didn't you George didn't you almost break the bank of England George\nProvoking anti Semitism which still exists in England because of what you did to the British pound and while I'm Out of George I have a very good memory and I'm a scholar didn't you go to Malaysia shortly after that it almost wrecked immolation currency setting off wave after wave of hatred towards Jewish people George\nDon't blame that on Donald Trump and don't blame that on conservatives like me look in the mirror George because we can see right through you\nSo you know there's a lot of anger going around but you can't sit here and just let them role you over because they own the New York times editorial page because they own CNN and all the other outlets I'm not going to let them Romeo or because I'm only a pow all this talk show host I still have a significant following\nI have many best selling books for people who actually read books instead of just listening to the news\nAnd they can think for themselves\nAnd I'll tell you right now I'd be remiss not to tell you that whoever has done this and we still don't know who was done it I've told you what I think that if there's a high likelihood is still left doing it to distract us in the gang sympathy\nPoliticians they're just trying to induce unprovoked want in this country fill in the blank mass hysteria my\nBook is called America since Saturday from the Salem witch trials for the Trump which are boys that thing on time\nI'd even send the free copy to everyone on that list you know maybe if I could get George Soros to send me as address and Morocco Obama and Hillary Clinton the Robert De Niro I'd be glad to send a copy of free copy hardcover I'll even signed it it's called stop mass hysteria maybe they could learn something\nIf they are actually willing to read\nWhat an intellectual genius like I have to say about insanity on both sides by the way maybe there's hope for America\nSo I'm inviting Robert Deniro Morocco bomber Michelle Obama uh let's see who else was on the list George who else got got one in the mail bombs who else got one Maxine if if they if they would email us or just call a five five forty seven to eight to have your system call with your address\nWill be glad to send you a free copy of the book if you're willing to read what the opposition thinks maybe we can stop the anger in this country\nMaybe just possible\nNow back to the news crudely made package bombs will provide treasure trove of evidence that we use to catch culprits say experts okay\nThey're able to get DNA from the fingerprints found on the tape as well as the saliva from the postage stamps so called experts will also test the powder and look for specific chemical markers\nSo that's all good\nI Hope they catch the perpetrator whoever it may be in which side of the Iowa we don't know yet but I'm asking one key question if they're really looking for the ... why is there no bolo with surveillance tape of the person who dropped these packages informed mailboxes within a very short frame timeframe\nWe see they were dropped in New York upstate New York that were dropped a the Clintons Chappaquiddick not too far away from ... toner\nA CNN headquarters Columbus Circle\nThat were dropped it around the same time by hand all these high powered organizations and people don't have surveillance footage why are we not seeing it I don't understand that if they really want to catch the perpetrator why not release the ... the surveillance type that's the question that his begging to be answered\nDoesn't take left or right is to answer that question does it why they withholding this perhaps there is a brilliant left the works for media matters a can answer the questions that I'm asking today\nSince you're so smart you know everything about America's a survival why don't you tell us why they're not releasing the surveillance footage so we can all try and catch this person\nAnd none of the bombs went off you could say thank God but I'm not one bomb went off why is that\n\nSo much of this makes no sense to people with an IQ above that have Maxine Waters so much this makes no sense\nWith an IQ above that people that went to the high schooler performing God and make believe they're tough guys and movies and all that can do is imitate guys so much tougher than them with the ... the bum a mutt we could all figured this out for ourselves none of it makes sense\nAll your genius left is a let's all find the person who did it why don't you help instead of head during a spreading hatred you left his apartment you\nHaving studied the communist play book when I was Eighteen years old and having studied ... for the sixties I'm Sorry I'm suspicious of the suspicious packages now I asked this who was the only media analyst who questioned the George Soros claim yesterday\nOn now all of a sudden we have all these victims of a vast right wing conspiracy just in time for the elections and by the way the backfiring caravan stunt\nHave you noticed what's not in the news today on any channel\nThe army marching towards our border the strapping young men\nIn New Adidas and new clothing\nUh who'd just backfired on them they know that the cabinet or hearing attacked by Feinstein in competing seriously damage them for them in terms the exact opposite happened it's called the unintended consequences they know that the march that they organized from Honduras which is not what Eighteen thousand twenty thousand God Knows how many\nIs backfiring because most Californians Texans Floridians New Yorkers do not want twenty thousand more people in this country that we can't afford to take care of especially liberals who are screaming about healthcare okay so just in time for the ... back firing caravan stunt\nAnd for the elections to me and I'm a skeptic I don't buy it I smell a rat\nVegas I studied these kinds of things I've studied politics for so many years ever since I was a kid in college as a biology undergrad I was always interested in politics I Would argue politics and the little a\nCafeteria at queens college I was always interested in politics I read the New York times uh you know all the newspapers and we'd argue and I've always watched how things work\nIf I Am correct in my skepticism that this is all set up by the Democratic party because they're in really deep trouble for them in terms of the exact opposite of where they thought they would be as where they are so they had to come up with a stunt\nAnd if
