fact Trump's approval rating is now a higher than or tied with\nThree of the past six president at this point in their first term oh by the way right something you probably hadn't heard before\nHe's currently tied with Obama at forty four percent and\nAt forty one percent and Reagan forty two percent at this same stretch and the presidency and you know that\nYour approval rating this point than

yeah\nThat is [noise] I think for a second just for one second\nOf chopping somebody with a bone so I think about that for a second what it would take as a human being to do this\nWe're not talking about civil war battlefields weren't talking about something we're talking about looking at as somebody who's dead and saying I'm going to chop their body up into bits and pieces I think about that for a second\nWhat did he know what did he have\nHow big of an influence was he going to be how scared where they did it was going to be some sort of Arab Spring again part do\nI don't know but something happened something absolutely happen there and it is just it is awful it is absolutely awful and Trump is going to be facing his biggest decision when it comes to the geopolitical world that has nothing to do with just America and the stuff that happens here domestically\nGlobally in the world is watching on this one three two three five three twenty four twenty three and she had been some show is your Twitter Chuck Todd akin to join us here in a minute\nThat's not shut down here in Arizona with me I was going to be at this place called the big up the street here and he's he's meeting the midterms and the midterms are\nHuge uh last night we had a battle with mixed Sally and and cinema and then tonight you've gotten better when Cruz battling here the world is looking on what's going to happen to the Senate gonna flip is the house gonna flip is it going to be both is going to be none\nAnd ah you know he's taking it on the road so it's very interesting for me to press Chuck Todd how you doing Chuck\nI'm pretty good how are you\nI Am doing great so you're at you out here in Arizona you're going to be meeting of the midterms a very interesting uh it is a we've got a big battle going on out here but there's battles across the country\nYes you do I mean uh I'm doing going out west this week two days here and you guys and Phoenix than ah than today's in Nevada and then next week it\nTook a while since ever basically the end is I tell\nEverybody the the midterms are being fought in the sun belt right basically from Las Vegas Orlando uh but the sunbelt states are going to decide which direction of politics has had left or right\nIt is it is very interesting obviously we have we have a we have mix Sally and cinema who they didn't do the battle I thought they were going to do last night it didn't really it it looked kind of or just look robotic I'm interested obviously tonight to you've got the big one\nWith Beto in cruise but these things are I mean you know the world is watching here in America is watching big time because there's a few seats that have the potential to go from red to blue\nYou know it's funny in these debates and I think sometimes it's not fair to the candidates for Senate you know as viewers\nWe expect all of our candidates to debate like taking into candidates and the fact that these folks are not very uh you know they don't do this very often and so I Do think many Senate debates can look more robotic\nUm then you realize 'cause prevent him it's only the second or third time they've ever debated and in a format like that so I'm always a little bit I I Try to give each of them the benefit of doubt but I tell you this this Senate race\nFascinates me because the two members of Congress before they started running against each other we're actually trying to beat each other one was planned to being a centrist to the to the left and wonder is trying to be the centers that link right and then now they're both\nRunning as candidates that you're you're not quite sure if either one of them recognizes the campaign their money\nYou don't want that this last night 'cause my takeaway when I watch the the the ... the you know ... either using Sally in their cinema and they're going at it and here you know they're going to do which one's going to get flake seat I walked away from it thinking to myself self I didn't learn anything new and\nI don't know what to believe anymore and and for all the stuff of worrying about a Russia Russia Russia chunk of the reality is dark money and all of these wacky commercials and this propaganda you get thrown out of it is far more confusing than that\nI it is and it doesn't help when I think in in frankly I'm going to um go after both candidates both candidates duck the press they are they are interested in talking the local press um and and and they both you know they both been very hesitant about\nSitting down for for interviews whether it be our reporters imported from other you know it hasn't battered what network there from as a matter of any of that it is they have been\nLetting their money do the talking with voters and I think that is why you find yourself in the way if you haven't spelled as if you've been able to hear from either one of them in an authentic setting right know sickly you've only seen them in a prepared studying either a television set where the debate without or a television set with the commercials yeah\nIt's nuts it's nuts talking to Chuck Todd or from meet the press he's doing meet the mid term so you're in Phoenix then you're going to Vegas and then you're going to go out to the east coast you're going to go or Tampa and where else\nAh Dallas uh where I'm not just that Senate race really in Texas more for the house races and all these places there's usually and all these places there's two or three competitive house seats to go with the competitive Senate race or the competitive governors\nYou know it's funny that you say we shouldn't get used to I think so many people are used to Trump and the way he was in the debates and we think that every debate is going to be some sort of reality television show and it's not going to be that way it's never going to be that way the reality is is like you said these people haven't done this very much and and and everything is is very sterile dial\nIt is they're all you know and it strikes me as you can tell they all want to make sure they say exactly what ever they put up on our website and they don't give you more and and most most debate format\nFraternity to even get more right at the end of the day you're just finding out which one of them had better and articulate\nOr whatever they are the best\nTime jak candidates it isn't the unscripted setting and then they you know and you wish there were ten debates rather than just I think there's only been one out here and I don't know if they're going to have another one you don't know you know and you can tell the two of them don't even talk\nIt's\nEven looking at each other and that is that is a shame because you know the the\n\n... you know where you're you're you disagree without being disagreeable but if you're not even speak into each other um the two candidates running against each other on how you supposed to get used to work together because eventually you got to work with somebody on the other side\nSo true so you'd be at the big in Arcadia here in in Phoenix or we appreciate your coming on thanks so much we know you're really busy today but uh I think it's going to be awesome uh meet them in terms of trying to I'm going to be out there for this connection nowhere as my mentor is it's live radio there we don't work with and that's your check I appreciate them\nI mean I area I area you're picking the open desert sun here I'd have no problems [laughter]\nNever never Dave van presented that oh got you know what he is so right about\nLike what was the last um watching mix Sally and cinema last I never wanted to make eye contact never wants to talk and and to me\nIt just seems so we ... we were talking about earlier at times it Houston cinema she didn't look like sheep links and I see it across the way the one thing like that to the reason that people like better right so there's Beto out there the reason everybody likes him because he comes across very personable Ted Cruz that was his big not because he's a robot\nThe opposite side for for for Beto is he comes across personal but at least they feel like they're kind of in it in a way that a lot of other people don't and I'm just and I'm always amazed and neither of them will do press and that drives me crazy that\nMe crazy three two three five three twenty four twenty three ... and Joe is your Twitter zip recruiter so

Y. C. H. D. S. what's interesting about them they are amongst the\nThere are amongst the fossils of many geological formations dating back to them as as I work\nAnd the living species of cycads are survivors of plants which existed many millions of years ago there one of the most ancient species of plants on the earth and so in these populations and also in in regions of Japan and the islands of Japan\n[noise] and they use the seeds of the ... cat to make a flower but they also had it was found had high high high amounts of ale S. see what I'm saying\nSo I said wait a minute what the heck is this what does this have to do with health and how does this plan to have to do with a a less you know Lou Gehrig's disease when I'm Talking about it because of a Stephen Hawking saying there is no God well there's much to talk about and if I had three or four hours with you I could talk about a a a less\nAnd the ... the abduction of neural February tangles\nA with a towel ice are formed distribution similar to that found in Alzheimer's disease and associated with the lesions founded TD be forty three and our arcade too but what does it have to deal with ... the fall say go palm and what does it have to deal with you what foods you're going to ask me should you avoid\nTo avoid the disease allegedly related to the site cat also known as the light T go boating\nSyndrome LS again what is it what's in this food what is in it that does it well it may be a a a compound that is produced by bacteria\nAnd what's interesting is the traditional diet of the CIA moral people in Guam also includes are included the fruit bat you know bats\nBats listen to this show you how science works bats are a species that fed or feed on cycads she'd come out components and as they feed on these seeds from this plant they accumulate\nA compound called B. M. A. now what is the I'm a well\nIt's a type of protein that can cause this disease because the MA is reported in the brain tissue of Guam patience\nAnd data is suggesting that some northern American patients that would be you who are dying of Alzheimer's disease also have detectable brain levels of B. M. A. this is fascinating\nAnd so if you look into this in any detail you are led to you know the green slime it's found in lakes things like that that's the dangerous stuff\nAnd what has ... originally started as the discovery of a little known disease in Guam\nHas now spread to a list of findings about some of our most debilitating brain disorders and potential toxins that are laying and bodies of water around the world this is a fascinating study\nAnd this part of it is the part that you may be interested in but I don't want to alarm you into not eating shellfish or or shrimp but truthfully you should know a little bit about that especially if you study any of this because you'll see insights into the disease\nAnd you'll find that many of it is clustered around bodies of water\nWhere there's an environmental toxin again Coby am a that is produced by cyanobacteria that's the blue green algae that live in soil lakes and oceans\nNow what does it have to deal with you while the ... bacteria are eaten by fish and other credit creatures and studies have shown that big I'm a U.S founding seafood\nWhat does that have to deal with you it means that certain diets and locations may put people at particular risk\nFor neurological disorders like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's now you have your attention now because like I can go on with this or I can do if you'd like the the normal fare like you're going to ask me what I think about the Saudi Arabians situation like somebody's on Newsmax TV this morning talking about stop mass hysteria\nAnd ah my interviewer on on Newsmax John Bachmann said\nDr Savage what do you think about the killing them it's like a show in the Saudi embassy I said I have no opinion whatsoever I wasn't there\nAnd I caught him off guard he said well that's what makes you so popular because you don't claim to know everything about everything like everyone else in the media has an opinion on everything I so it's easy to have an opinion on it you know you might might have a computer uh let's see a trumpet some people do with the Trump had nothing to do with it\nThe Saudis did at the Saudis didn't do it I said I don't know I wasn't there I don't know killed him I don't even know how he died I I don't know them in so that's an example there are things I Know something about there are things I can make some judgment about and there are things I Know nothing about whatsoever and I chose not to talk about things I Know nothing about incidentally\nSo I Want to go on for a minute more if I may feel just give me another few minutes on this issue of uh Lou Gehrig's disease and are toxins that are found in plants like I mentioned the cycads\nAnd in certain seafood a related to a a less Alzheimer's and Parkinson's or I can do this at another time if you don't mind\nThis is the Savage Nation uh I I don't know what do you want me to do today you want me to go into there is no God I don't want to talk about that because all we're

have clean that place out like a clock Smith cleans out o'clock it as a running right I Would have gotten rid of all the dead weight stealing all of the money for bad science and corrupt science and political science\nWhy are we not seeing any relationship between where this polio like illness a FM is coming from what I mean they don't know wash your hands with soap and water\nThat's the best thing I best scientists can give us well let's ask ourselves some questions\nCouple of years back your good friends Iraq Obama flooded America with Honduran refugees remember he was bringing them by the train load through Mexico\nTrain loads of young women and babies and infants who will never work in this country never permanent or to the state now\nBefore that there had been no secret and America member that little disease called ...\nBut you see it was endemic in Honduras\nZika was endemic in Honduras\nAnd Obama by flooding America with millions and millions I don't know how many hundreds of thousands of immigrants he brought in the ... virus and nothing ever was said about it by the government in the media well now we have a FM a polio like illness go at destroying shoulder twenty two states and again the dummies\nEighty or ... as science illiterates gee I don't know that the CDC tells us there's no known cause wash your hands with soap and water you hear so let's look into this by the way welcome free thinkers wherever you are we are a dying breed in an age of thought control that's right free thinkers\nAre are a dying breed and thought control so the headline is Trump threatened to cut us aid to Honduras of immigrants right\n\nTrump threatened to cut us aid to Honduras over immigrants now I was asked this morning what would you do to stop the flood of Hondurans that are missing or to cross from Mexico into America and again some of the nation dry\nWell here's an answer to that question didn't we just cut a deal with Mexico called NAFTA wasn't a highly touted by the Trump Administration is a great cure all for all of our problems with Mexico yeah we'll tell others can be great to be wonderful for America\nWell since Mexico's now a partner in everything and everyone's happy we would say we we have to say to Mexico okay you've got to stop them in Mexico just after transit through your nation\nAnd we will provide the funding to build\nHousing and detention facilities for all the Hondurans in Mexico but they're not coming into America they are not crossing our border and you're going to stop them with the Mexican military and you're going to give them the attention that they need and the care that they need but we're not taking them now tell me what's wrong with that idea\nYou know nothing's wrong with the idea but I'm not in power I'm only a talk show host I should say what do I know I Know everything I Know everything about a lot of things or nothing about some things let me tell you that right now and so the fact of the matter is that is a logical conclusion as I say\nIt's a logical way to stop the flood of Hondurans all coming in horse amassing to cross the border and suck on welfare system dry and destroy your hospitals again again take everything from the American people the ... take everything\nWe may as well being invaded by a foreign army so you look at the Hondurans is an awful lot of young men in military age ... mile of the of the caravan terribly when they come into my camel although they're calling it a caravan no you're stopping in Mexico the Mexican stopping in Mexico we provide Mexico with the money to build\nSame logical you main housing for them of a very primitive order we're not giving them a a three level a three bedroom two bath color television house basic barracks like soldiers live in\nAnd they'll get much Medicare and they do in Honduras and then when they're better send them home\nThat's simple the world has to understand\nThat no first rate nation can take in all of the world's poor it's impossible\nNow that's what the communists would like you to believe that we should all share everything I Would say start with Bernie Sanders million dollars last year let 'em give it away then I Believe a word he says\nThe day Bernie Sanders gives away the money is making on his communism and if they all believe award any of them say but again okay so what's this rare polio like illness where is it coming from a FM you have to dig very hard to get any answers on us at all\nBecause it's very serious that can lead to paralysis in deaths in children\nOn October fourth health officials in Minnesota now says six children contracted a FM acute flash at ... which is ... polio like\nNow the CDC has been investigating\nThis increasing they up to him which begins twenty four team but they don't know why it's happening therefore I fired the head of the CDC I'd fire him yesterday when he doesn't know what kind of scientists doesn't know what do you mean paid for if you don't get out of there what you like to go to vacations in Thailand and study the sexual habits of horses\nSo every every article says the causes of FM are still unclear\nIt's unclear we don't know anything\nAbout its thought today if I may be a communicable disease really well as one link oh it may be a communicable disease\nAnd certain viruses including polio and Tara viruses and then of viruses West Nile virus may even cause FM where the west Nile virus come from west dial it doesn't say New York virus doesn't\nMean the west Nile virus when it come from or where you can pretty much see what I'm going with this right\nWell you understand what I what I like to see which is close the borders do health screening like was done when your grandfather a grandmother came your great grandfather when anyone with an illness was quarantine to prevent them from spreading it into the healthy population well those are antiquated ideas\nYou can quarantine any one of the matter with disease they have that would go against the uh the sensibilities of the American left\nAnd so the healthy population\nIs an increased risk of diseases\nLike this from these third world countries in plain English common sense would dictate you know let a diseased parts of and your country and common sense if you have a house or apartment we let someone with a communicable disease in your apartment unless you're a moron and San Francisco\nAnd San Francisco probably sleep with a person with a communicable disease to show the good life just they were that embrace them in a kiss them on the lips the show with good good people they are that's how sick they are but\nIf you have a say nation you say no I don't want to get sick\nSo what I'm saying to you there is a relationship between\nSome immigrants from some countries on some diseases and if you're afraid to say it then you're not living in the Soviet Union\nJustice summarized in a few sentences or less the outbreak of polio like a a a polio like illness that are really recognize children trying to suggest as a relationship to immigrants and I will tell you right now you say will come out what's the relationship between this polio like illness called a FM\nThat's hitting the children in America and immigrants or you're just doing this for hysteria because you want to sell stop mass hysteria I'll let you decide okay if you go back in the literature you'll find that epidemiologic data\nSuggest that this a FM cluster was likely associated with a large outbreak of\nE v the sixty eight do you remember the sixty eight you know even the sixty eight\nHad been endemic and still is endemic what you will not find in the media anymore Honduras and Central America I'll say it again this virus\n... these ... these sixty eight\nWhich we read about for a while has been wiped out of the main wiped out of the literature you can find it anywhere and you cannot find any science that shows any relationship between the sixty eight\nAnd the outbreak of FM because they will not fund that kind of research because as I said I've tried to tell you over and over again how corrupt on science has become in the west particularly in the United states of America in other words you will not get if you were a PHD students or young scientist\nAnd you said look I'm thinking about this this outbreak of polio like illness and the older relationship between navy the sixty eight which was endemic in Honduras you wouldn't get ten cents to study that\nThe CDC wouldn't find that the un I H wouldn't funded you'd probably lose your your post doc to be thrown out of school this is what happened in the Soviet Union under Stalin I should try to tell you the way it is I'm just trying to tie there's almost no
