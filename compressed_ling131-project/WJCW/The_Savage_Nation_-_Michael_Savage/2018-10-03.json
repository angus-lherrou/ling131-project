Bush trash Trump you heard Obama\nTrashed Trump Clinton trash trucks that that trial or statesmen are anyway sir I have to run and that's what that music means\nWe used to let our forces police officers firefighters emergency personnel ice foreigner for law enforcement please check out on the TV Tonight hate for foreign living TV it's a great one\nWonderful shows for any other any of us and I'll see you tomorrow God Bless\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYeah sometimes but the reality is people aren't we we've gotten so tribal that we live in these echo chambers and anybody who comes into her echo chamber we ... get outta here what are you it's it's like it's like\nTurf right this political turf\nIt's like that's my street corner you're in my area how dare you come over to the reds side or the blue side how dare you if you get caught dead over here you know man it's you're done now we're going to get you\nIt's and it's absolutely said one hundred and ten percent it's completely sad\nThe way that this is playing itself out and when I look at something like with what's happening with cabinet\nRight and I don't think we're going to find anything out other than you know she drank a little bit in college and apparently\nFor anybody else that's okay but for him that somehow he's he's he's damned\nBut the fact that\nNot the point now where we're not going to find anything out he's going to be can you know he's he's a serial rapists these uh\nAnd he's details puppy dogs in polar bears he's single handedly destroying the earth's climate and all of these kinds of things and we're not going to find anything else out and people have already made up their minds and if you support him somehow you hate women\nAnd that that's the that's the starting point for anything that's an ending point it's it at our tongues are in our mind tons is our mind our mind controls our town center of town it's our mind and that's the point I was talking about being open minded\nDon't tell me what color friends you have or what sexual identity they have what box you can check off for something I don't care about that\n\nWhat's in their mind what's in their heart that matters for more than anything else\nAbsolutely but in this world of red and blue\nWe can't do that anymore we can't and I feel sorry I look at this and I think to ourselves that we always been this kind of\nI don't know if we've always been this way obviously the civil war with something like this was quite huge and we can go back to that but as far as individuals\nRight the way that that that we now have that platform to say anything to anybody at any given time\nIt's it's it is kind of sad because we don't care we say things to people that we would never say to anybody else because we feel it made the right to say something because you I don't agree with you so I can hate you and I have I have moral high ground to hate you\nAnd we've got to always go that I don't have to win and you have to lose you know we could all have some victories how does that work in the confirmation process well five and I was going to be a win for some in the Lewis and we have to think about what we're learning from this that we had Gorsuch was confirmed that we have to learn why did that work why is this not working\nI Wonder\nHow many times if I said this over and over again the sad thing about the politics that we have nowadays is we've stopped trying to say hey we've got a great idea we think it's a great idea it'd be great for the country it's now just easier to say hey they suck\nA lot more than we suck let us tell you how they suck and boom and the and and when you hear people like Bill Maher who what a month or\nTwo ago says you know we got to hope for a recession and that and that everything can collapse it's it's that's the mentality you hope America goes into recession and people lose their jobs and their livelihood and lose their homes so we can get back on the ground that you think we should be on in the path that you think we should be on because somehow people know better\nThat's not a when I've said it all along and people ask me every day would you supported Hillary I would've as far as I don't want my president to fail if she did something wrong I Would criticize or she did something right that was brazen same thing I Do with Trump when he does stuff wrong I criticize what he does the right phrase it\nThis won't say because I'm a great patriot you're a patriot everybody's a patriot patriot where all the time you know how I hear is you have half the country right\nYou hate half the country 'cause they don't agree with you that's ridiculous doesn't a patriot\nRight\nYou're not patriot you you you only fight for your side and that's the issue with politicians that's why I tell everybody over and over again become a free agent every time your last vote is cast\nFor all of the people are going to cast a vote for come in November So every time you chicken you check out that last box or do whatever it is that you do and that's it it's gone you turn around and say I've got no allegiance to anybody they're gonna have to earn my vote its actions not words and become a free agent\nLet them work for you\nI learned about pressure cookers when I was a kid I said to my mother\nYou know when you make those potatoes wiser thing whistle she says Johnny if it doesn't whistle and blow off steam it all explode whereabouts of see the explosion and we are seeing some since the explosion American politics I Hope people will listen to me and think about it doesn't have to be when and loss there are ways in which we can get these things fixed\nAbsolutely it's not going to be perfect right we're still going to have some uh uh you know some awful people in positions of power but when you start holding them accountable\nYou start getting rid of them you start voting them out and stop being trapped by some sort of deer are by your name you know much better that's going to be for you and me and everybody else\nThey're still going to be times when they fall short of expectations are skilled human beings they're still going to be times with politics get away but the problem now is politics is all that matters the people don't matter it's it's it themselves it's the party and way down here it's the people outside of that they don't care\nThey don't and we need to start care we absolutely need to start carrying one hundred and ten percent\nIn a different way than we're doing it now we do it now when we go we say something on Facebook we say something somewhere and we are I'm only this or I'm only that and and and away we go and I defend my party and I don't care about no are you listening\nOr you're talking or you can versus the other people are you having an open mind about something I don't have to agree with you you don't have to agree with me we don't need to hate each other find some middle ground we can find some commonality we can sit there and talk and you know what's great\nIs when it comes to politics I'm okay if you have to give some stuff up\nBecause they're also Americans they are Americans just like me and sometimes you give and sometimes you get but we're in a position where we don't know if it's not all it'll be nothing and we're okay with that and that's not a win\nWho's winning on this no but we're not teaching our kids this we reach our kids\nYou win at all costs you know the Ryder Cup was on over the weekend you know what everybody like each team given each other a hug right do you play as hard as you can and you show respect for somebody because when you back them into a corner whether it's a human being or whether it's an animal you learn you back somebody into a corner and they'll strike at you\nAbsolutely and I will tell you this right now like I said and I continue to say go look up the names of every tribe out there a majority of tribes have people in their name\nRiver people our people the people because they want to see themselves only as the people and everybody else\nIs the serpent the demon the evil they are less than us these people that doesn't get us anywhere the minute we see red white and blue hey we're all Americans there regardless of color or sexual orientation who worship or don't worship any of\nThe better it is for everybody the better it is\nI'm not saying that you don't have your thoughts and and you should look at everything and you vote your conscience and the thing you want but if we don't stop for a second and start thinking hey we need to start moving things forward and we're not going to get everything we want and we can do this as as a group going forward and we can show the world what it is and who it is we are in a better

dollar loan from his father into a multibillion dollar empire\nI started off in Brooklyn my father gave me a small amount of a million dollars I came into Manhattan and I had to pay him back and I had to pay him back with interest\nIn New York Times reports much of his fortune is built on what the paper called dubious tax schemes and outright fraud the president's attorney called the story one hundred percent false and highly defamatory but state tax officials said they're reviewing the allegations which are too old to be prosecuted\nYeah too old to be prosecuted a and\nHis brother is come out and said it's a bunch of crap they put things arrest a long time ago they're\n... they're they're\nBad because look at all the money they had according to the New York times\nAnd their obsession with his money I find that to be weird right like he's not a drug dealer this isn't Pablo Escobar right\nWho cares how we got his money well he should be paying more it's at least four hundred and Thirteen million dollars she got from his father and these accord equivalent of that today's money and his parents dodged taxes\nHere's my question to the dodging taxes right because the obsession that the left has with what other people have money wise is really weird to me\nIt is that's like a sign of sickness I got it sets of what you have that I don't I Want to take\nOr talking to somebody

it comes to government 'cause that's all it is\nJust take bears and give it to you or you can open trickles down I mean how's that incredible it must have always said about the the greediest of all\nIs not a private corporation it's government wants wants wants what's yours and so this whole thing is apparently they had a lot of money and they paid about fifty two million in taxes on the money\nAlthough they're saying the dollar amount could have been about five hundred\nMillion in taxes according to the times analysis and the the times analysis what did they do well it was all wrapped up their ... their dad died in Nineteen Ninety nine that's spread the mom died and two thousand that's maryann and everything got sorted away and wrapped up\nThe way they think it should have been there was twenty plus years ago the IRS and everybody else signed off of it\nWhat did they do they had sham corporation snow which is what they did people don't like\nWrite you give\nAll of these

figure out how to read sand script and figure this out but some people have\nSo what they do is they figure out how inside and it's not maybe Trump didn't maybe we'll find out later he didn't and his family didn't\nBut a lot of times what they find out and this would piss people off is they figure out how to maneuver inside of the things that you give them so this is the game you create the game they figure out how to meet you and your game and that's still angers people especially people not because it's weird obsession with other people's money\nOPM\nBut don't you care why because it doesn't affect me I'm not getting the trophy I'm not getting some of it it doesn't affect me [noise]\nThis obsession with a somebody died they've already paid taxes on it so we need to take more money

recognition\nSo if the if the conservatives or the right wing\nAre lying about things like this they also lack credibility do you understand what I'm saying to you\nNow we can scream all we want to my doctor fraud lying and she's apparently lying she was set up in coach to lie by the fraudulent Democrats\nHer own ex boyfriend said she coached the friend on how to take a polygraph the woman committed perjury in front of the world and we're all outrage but when you get people on the other side of the aisle\nSaying that they heard her say they're suddenly up girl voice and they know and you know the man can't hear it all and it's very sad what does that tell you about people on the other side\nBoth sides are filled with fraudsters it's a terrible time to be the Switzerland of talk radio I'll tell you that right now\nAnd the phone number here is uh what's the difference with my phone number is what's the difference that I Am\nA producing a book that will be out Tuesday called stop mass hysteria what is a difference I mean I Know you're going to go buy it my hard core audience will buy it you'll never see it on ... on Fox News because they are part of the cartel which is a shame\nNot all conservatives are a member of that cartel they also are blocked from fellow news which by the way it's going through a big change now that Lackland Murdoch took it over you're gonna see heads rolling out of that studio he's a super liberal from London\nHe does not want some of the people who are on Fox News to remain and they've known the actual is gonna fall one day wait until you see what happens in the next few months\nI don't know what they're going to do once they get a phone news I don't know where they're going to go watch CNN MSNBC I don't know where they're going to find a job I guess they could always get to Dixie cups and the string and again a video camera and podcast themselves\nAnd then they'll find out what it is to be obscure in America when they had the chance to open themselves up to a man who tells the truth\nThe whole truth and nothing but the truth to help him gone and they chose to ignore him while so many people listen to him they'll find out what it is to be on the outside one day and as I said to you last week lead Godspeed vengeance I don't I never have it I never will\nYou know they are now accusing cabin or of being angry and not having the temperament to be on the Supreme Court where that one come from well Dr frauds themes Diane fraught stains false accusations fell apart on them\nSenator frauds things accusations blew up in their face or they they demanded an FBI investigation and the Republicans call their bluff and said okay we'll give you one\nNow that the investigation is about to be hidden and they won't even released that one that's a big one\nWhy are all the senators saying don't release the investigation what ally they're putting out McConnell now are saying no don't release the FBI investigation of cabinet we agree with Dr for US Senator frauds thing why one of those Republicans doing catering to her now\nNow in other words the FBI investigation probably exonerated cabin or from these charges of rape and such\nSo why are they not releasing it so what have they done they've now come up with a new tack to attack him he doesn't have the temperament to be on the Supreme Court and I want to ask everyone listening\nLet's say you were just excoriated in public ripped apart lied about destroyed and you'll get up now and you meet some of those accusing you\nWhat would you say to them thank you well you'd be angry so they're saying his angry meaning showing his mail is showing his humanity in essence is a sign that he's not fit to be on the Supreme Court how much crazier kind of get\nThan what these these are folks are doing on the evil Democrat side\nAnd I'll tell you the man who's ... these hearings have been good for America in many ways we've got to see the faces of evil we've seen the pure faces of evil and and that you are the camel or Harris they said was going to run for the presidency I can guarantee you America sees that she's an empty skirt\nShe seemed to be what she is a vacuous individual nothing there there's nothing there\nShe was a small town prosecutor who was picked hand picked by the Democrat machine and they were interrupted flagpole she's gone I can guarantee you should go nowhere she still vacuous\nAnother one who who flamed out is Cory Booker called themself Spartacus you gotta Spartacus moment but he went further he's shown himself to be an uh actually idiotic\nI Want you to listen to Cory Booker\nListen to this carefully he says that Kavanaugh's guilt or innocence doesn't matter he should be forced out right now irrespective of whether he's guilty or innocent now this means Cory Booker believes not in the rule of law but the ... in the rule of the lawless and then the rule of the market in Marlboro how can anyone vote for this man\nSo I think both of them have now disqualified themselves up for a any serious consideration beyond what they already are doing here is Cory Booker saying that missed the cabinet or his guilt or innocence doesn't matter listen to him and oh three astonishing\nWhen his temperament had been revealed in an emotional moment where do you use language that that frankly shocked a lot of\n... not whether he's innocent or guilty this is not a trial the ultimately had hung up questions the rain that we should not move on to another candidate for\nThis is beyond comprehension so they've been found out to be liars and attempting to pin the tail on him saying he was a rapist than it is to know that\nThat didn't fly so now they're saying because he reacted to being smeared he's not qualified to be in the spring court\nLadies and gentlemen the Savage Jerry let me ask you something if you had been publicly excoriated humiliated lied about and you had a chance to answer some of these questions what would you have done sat there like a moron you wouldn't have gotten angry\nWhat what do you want out of a human being and by the way what do you think the temperament as of Ruth Bader Ginsburg behind closed doors you think she doesn't scream and yell at people you think that which is not use the temper tantrums for the day they forces that are on the American public are you joking\nYou're telling me that the man overreact endear overreact and you imagine if it was me what I Would have said to them\nI wouldn't have sat there and take it uh I Would have shown that when the temperature is I Want to expose them for what they're vulnerable with I wouldn't have sat there and taking that after they ... me and my family to shreds\nSo this is the world we're living in a very difficult for all of us I Know many of you are past the point of no return with regard to your emotional stability right now because you're watching a public lynching of a man who you know never committed those crimes do you remember what they actually said about him a train gang rape\nAnd it turned out that she was represented by the slimy is thing with a law degree the world was ever seen some of the ... represented a

obscure point\nBut I was looking at the guidelines for beauty back in ancient Rome and look how things have changed I remember before I read this to you\nIt's not directly related to anything because my new book stop mass hysteria is somewhat of a mixture of politics and history listened to the guidelines for beauty now remember before you listen to this and say wait a minute I agree with that I don't agree with that\nA beauty is a cultural thing different cultures looking beauty in a different way so I'm going to read you the standards for beauty in Rome and women are as the picked it in the time\nFirst of all they ... they all ought to have had\nThe angelic look\nThey had to look angelic and so having tanned or dark skin was not regarded as attractive and pure white skin was seen as the sign of the upper class in ancient Rome\nAs a native Roman women would not naturally have white skin they use the white shark lead or arsenic too it's in their faces\nLarge eyes with long eyelashes or also prized why\nDid you know why large eyes with long eyelashes lashes where prices ancient Rome it was believed that women's eyelashes fell out from excessive into costs so long eyelashes became a sign of chastity now you understand where some of these beauty secrets\nAre still a operational in our society with fake eyelashes right wait a little more\nGuidelines for beauty in ancient Rome\nHair was a function of beauty for men and women in ancient Rome so thick curly locks were admired most women would die their hair black red or blonde\nTo emulate the lush thick styles of the goddesses they would also where wigs and you hear and not on the head was seen as an attractive and remove the by plucking stripping or shaving\nHere's something odd for those of you in America a modest ... very different today isn't it\nBut small round breasts were actually admired far more than a larger ones large breast was seen as being humorous or a sign of old age in fact young Roman girls was so determined to have small breasts\nThat they wore a kind of early ... in the form of a band\nOr excessively tight to inhibit the growth of their breasts\nWhat was the ... the perfect child bearing figure in was in the little skinny girl of today with no hips at all\nBecause being thin was not regarded as an attractive trait in Rome with so much of a woman's life focused on rearing children wide hips were regarded as very attractive\nAnd all the men didn't like that women excessively large a plump from body was seen as the ideal type one more point about guidelines for beauty in this age of a women\nLess is more extravagance was frowned upon although wealthy women that sometimes wear jewels and necklaces anything more was viewed as showing off for being overly boastful a very negative trait attention rafters out there\nAnd this is likely why almost all contemporary depictions of Roman goddesses\nAre quite simple minimal and modest that's Roman women in mythology from not from mass
