I'm telling you that this is how the scenario plays out if I'm writing a novel that's how I'd write the novel that the left wing is in deep trouble\nThis character Soros has had everything he schemes backfire on him from the caravan to the Capitol hearing say matched to so there's two cases there are renting we can throw in the third K. and then give the left what they really want this at three K lead\nSo we got the caravan even though it's where the seaweed guy Kavanaugh even those with a K we're waiting for the third K. and we don't know what that one will be but I'm starting to think it's their own cake I think it's the left Klux Klan behind this but if you want to chime in and I know all of America is very excited about this\nAnd don't think I'm taking it lightly I mean I'm a I'm a

then I'm going to run a small Institute of peace because I think there's always a peaceful revolution resolution that mostly there are peaceful resolutions to conflicts\nAnd I've talked all about this yesterday with regard to this crazy man who has in Vegas way into the White House who's looking to start a war with Russia but that's a separate topic if you will remain suspicious of these suspicious packages\nYou can call me or on the other hand\nLet's say you're a die hard leftist and you don't believe that my skepticism is appropriate right now\nAnd you think that I'm exploring this for partisan reasons even though you're exploiting for partisan reasons uh and you think I'm negligent and even questioning authority\nI Want to hear from all of you left us who believe that you can prove\nBeyond a reasonable doubt that this was in fact a conspiracy by those who hate those people who receive those are a pipe bombs can you prove it in any way no can I just prove it no but what am I using what am I using to present my position\nI'm using arrays the Chilean logic it's steel trap logic I don't think you're going to argue with it\nBut let's go to the other side I mean there are other ways to look at it as well what are your ways of looking this how can you prove that these bombs were sent by some right wing nut in order to hurt the wonderful generous George Soros\nAnd the kindly old lady Hillary Clinton who else got um I don't even a Wolf Blitzer guy who got on there at CNN\nSo who actually did it we don't really know but my position is based upon knowledge of politics which leads me to a skeptical position today but if you can take and none skeptical position make my day the phone number is eight five five\nFour hundred Savage a five five four hundred seven to eight to now remember George Soros has found that the last I checked he gave Ninety million dollars to black lives matter\nThe last I checked he funded the dangerous communists left on the far always

there was the inquisition it was a failure it's set out to eradicate heresy and ended up perpetrated perpetrating\nVery heretic it burned at the stake thousands of others rose up and why was that because the inquisition killed his enemies in the open and killed them while they were still unrepentant in fact to kill them because they were unrepentant\nMen were dying because they would not abandon their true beliefs naturally all the glory belong to the victim and all of a shame to the inquisitive who burned them later in the twentieth century they were the totalitarian ... there was a

U. I. C.

liberal and a reasonable liberal and you know when your heart of hearts you don't believe a word that the right wing would do a stupid thing like this for two reasons number one what's the point number two or none of the bombs went off thank God and the you know you want to get into this and really\nKind of dramatic way\nYou've got a lot of people on the right or ex military experts in the detonation explosive devices I don't believe that the bombs wouldn't have gone off the right it sent them and I I'm Glad they didn't hold things seemed like a Halloween prank\nAnd you know here's the greatest proof to me where have you seen today on CNN MSN any of them\nA picture of the uh uh ten thousand or twenty thousand young strapping soldiers coming in from Honduras\nThese warriors they're all war is you gotta understand something people from Mexico and those countries are are phenomenally great fighters by they went to separate story everyone knows for example even though they're not Mexicans that the Mexican boxes are about the best in the world because they have a rule they come from such poverty\nThat they have one rule which is always keep going forward they never back up the only way to stop and Mexican fighters to knock him out everybody knows that in the ... in the fighting world\nSo you got the same type of desperate people coming out of Guatemala El Salvador Honduras strapping strong young men and every day we're seeing at the march gets bigger the Democrats had a backfire blow up in their face you're talking about a bomb that bomb blew up as a Democrat face the bottom of the marchers\nNobody wants them here so what did they do I think this is a stunt that so I have to repeat this for you\nRan into a woman from Hungary two weeks ago in the street\nWe got to ... she said to me that people are more afraid in America today to express themselves politically than they were on the Soviet hill and the Soviet times I said I Know that here in San Francisco people are all terrified there's a small band of fanatical left the show on the newspaper and owned the media and seemed to control every one's thinking\nAnd it doesn't matter what the racist people are afraid to express themselves anywhere in the city I'm skeptical\nOf these devices\nDid anyone listening to the show ever read a book in high school or college called animal farm because I've I've told you I'm skeptical about the suspicious packages I have been since I read about them\nIn light of the fact that the young young army the marching army has suddenly been dropped from CNN's headlines because it backfired on the on the left wing so if you rent animal farm you need to see the piece on how they exploit\nUh the the acts of violence against one of their own you have to understand how this works but I suspect that tomorrow God Forbid happens they may discover traces of orange hair on some of the packages or they will say that the pipe bombs had\nThey been dusted from Princeton they found a tiny little fingerprints on them and it leads right to the White House\nAnd they will make him complicit in the actual execution of this plot that's tomorrow so what do they actually succeeded in doing so far look what we're talking about today\nWe're not talking about the marching army coming to America we're not talking about how to stop them\nWe're not talking about what it would do to our social services I Would overwhelm our hospitals instead we're talking about this and they've drawn your eyes away from this caravan of humans and they are inspiring they're idiotic base to go out and vote and perhaps to commit violence\nI said it yesterday I'll say it again today there is reason to be skeptical as suspicious and to me this looks more like politics than pyrotechnics on Michael Savage and I approve of what I think\nSo what do you think is the is the thing I don't have one left the sewers disagreeing with me you know\nWhere this stuff come from all of a sudden what on is is there a demo is there a guy out there was in the military you see the picture of the actual device looks like a the top of a wish broom\nLittle handle on and on and found that ... out of the top like that couldn't be my father he's been dead forty years so he didn't do it and ah there's some kind of device on it\nIs there anyone out there who could look at that picture and tell me what it actually is made of\nI I liked it a little bit more about the pipe bomb or do you mean they hand delivered them with Secret Service that Shafik why they got through the hand delivered and there's no surveillance photos and George Soros is the most hated man on the planet to the right wing movement even moderate conservatives noted evil man he is\nHe has no security cameras that would show us who put the bomb in his in his mailbox come on crazy I don't believe this not for a minute but I don't know maybe you'll buy it\nTo me it looks like a hash tag thing they're going to have already the only people who are in the real losers here are the Instagram slots\nLike those Justin Bieber in bikini types who every day they have to show them in a in a bikini like we never saw a woman before so tomorrow they'll have to appear and say oh my God how do I stay an Instagram I have to show I received one to\nWe all know that we don't want this to be real we're all glad that if this is a a ploy\nBut if you missed the opening to the show you're not going to miss one about the tide you again because I think I Hope I'm wrong\nI'm rarely are on the left is going to find out that this failed as well the left is going to find out that even the left a skeptical of this little game that the writers even more cynical over them middle ground says I had enough of the left wing with their scare tactics\nAnd what's going to happen is they're going to raise the stakes tomorrow the next day and I'm afraid that they are libel actual send wants to someone on the other side of the political spectrum and it will go off in Maine where kill that's I'm afraid of and who are they going to blame it on than most say well we don't know who did it", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Savage Nation
