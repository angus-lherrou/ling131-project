between us and them off\nAnd stop mass hysteria you heard me right is dedicated to the men and women of law enforcement who are on the front lines protecting the rest of us from the violent radical left wing street criminals who has a who's goal is to terrorists aside into pieces that's the dedication to my book\nAnd I have asked those of you\nWho believe in the police and believe in my message and the bigger message pleased by a copy of this book and give it to a local policemen or a local police precinct show them that\nDo you care and so my motto is donated copy to a cop\nI realize it's an uphill battle to get some attention in the media today I Know that seven books came out yesterday so we have an uphill battle to get our message across in a very short window with that and we'll talk about what we have to do to stop\nThe communists from taking over our society which leads me to the main question of the day\nIf you are attacked or harassed by left this as we see going on in this country whether it be congressmen senators in Washington DC restaurants or in hallways or in Portland, Oregon we're a bunch of black lives matter thugs took over the streets\nAnd directed traffic illegally while a cop stood by in Portland on a motorcycle doing nothing what would you do\nWhat are you allowed to do if you're in a restaurant with your wife let's say\nI'm Talking to you the whites of America because you are being targeted make no mistake about it\nThis is all aimed at whites in America is a race war it's a class war and it's being conducted naked Lee in this nation you listen to the rhetoric and don't accuse me of making anything up because when they were screaming at the people in the streets of Portland directing traffic these dogs\nWhat did they say get out get off the street Whitey you're an old weak Whitey get off the street Whitey they have whipped up the wins the Nancy Pelosi telling everyone to be a disruptor and now we are all facing the world when that I don't mean hurricane Michael\nSo I'm going to ask you a simple question what can you do within the confines of the law if you are sitting at a restaurant\nAnd the group of these dogs come up to you and try to chase you out of a restaurant one of your rights you know where this is going to go because I Know where this is going to go\nFirst of all in California pepper spray is legal\nSo if you live in California and you are a conservative and you want to talk about your politics over dinner which is you are right in America and some thug call some thug\nBy Instagram to come there and harass you you warn them that you will protect yourself if they do not get out of your face that you feel threatened\nNow what's going to happen here is that every restaurant that America is going to have to hire security guards that's where this is going\nBecause the liability here is in the restaurant by the way you have a right if you are seated in a restaurant to have a piece a peace symbol dinner peaceful dinner you're allowed to sit there and eat your customer\nAt a restaurant has the right to refuse the service to anyone by the way\nSo they have an obligation to protect you so it's the same applies in any place of business\nUh what's her name Maxine Waters the hater has been screaming for months if you see them in a department store if you see them in a gas station chase them chase them harassed them she is committing crimes by doing so that's not free speech if you cross state lines\nTo foment a riot you're violating several federal laws at once Maxine Waters belongs in prison for what she has been doing but we are cowards who are afraid to go near her for fear that was called a racist\nBut what are you going to do if you were in a filling station and let us say one of these sub groups sees you I don't know where the magma had in the back of your car or stop mass hysteria book on your seat and they come up and start screaming at you what are you legally allowed to do to protect yourself\nNow you're not seeing the book anywhere which is very sad truthfully\nBecause if ever there was a book that is on time it has stopped mass hysteria and yet people in the media said to me well we don't want to run because there's really no hysteria out there know hysteria out there there's no news handle for stock mass hysteria or why don't you listen to the following montage and tell me if you think\nThere's a news handle for stop mass hysteria\n[noise] the tractor in my view right here on\nThe [laughter] she's going [laughter] on\nThat would be a lot better than

that's why they're not running it on Fox News because there's no connection to the news instead as a connection to a cookbook or to a cartoon book but nevertheless we plod along doing the best we can\nYou know we've had faded all of our security for\nWe I sleep with a loaded gun by nine that ah you know and when I'm home alone a lobbyist play with when Randall up here and satellites that got

mass hysteria get anyone tell me what is\n... I mean that's a new story she says she sleeps loaded gun but apparently that's not news to people in the news business there are many other obvious connections between mass hysteria and today and then you consider that Fox News has that\nDonald Brazil on the other day on every show it's unbelievable to me how they get away with this and then you look at Portland, Oregon\nYou had total anarchy with thugs funded by George Soros called on the FAA they call themselves anti fascist when they are pure fascists they block the road they directed traffic and he wanted to listen to them was attacked sometimes their cars beaten with pipes\nAnd they were called white supremacists or take a listen to clip number twelve on the Savage Nation will listen to a little of it [laughter]\nHave a little white middle\nAged white guy down the\nRoad and turn right or did he said you know I Know\nThat the only thing to the blacks and whites in North Carolina we're calling\nEvery one white supremacist Ku Klux Klan and not have half a block away in the video is seen at Portland cop on a motorcycle sitting there doing absolutely nothing while the anti fought dogs funded by George Soros took over a thoroughfare in the city or Portland\nIf you think this can happen here you're insane it is happening here and if you are in your own car and you're blocked by left to slug you think they're going to let you through because you tell them that you're a progressive and you agree with them oh no that's not going to be good enough once the guillotine starts to fall\nAnd that's why I implore you my dear list there's the Savage Nation to wake up and understand we're way past the point of civil discourse where the stage of grave danger\nBecause the mass hysteria of the left threatens to\nOverthrow the entire Trump revolution my\nFlash flooding with heavy rainfall also devastating wins and not just in the panhandle but southern Alabama Georgia even into the Carolinas acre Italian man charged with murder cases on what's believed to be a self inflicted gunshot wound authorities\nFast Steve ...
