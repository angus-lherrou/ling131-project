G the brass Senator Ben Sasse\nIs a country that we need to have a conversation with about the future and they need to get honest real fast cars bought\nIt Barbara store report sources within the administration believe the U.S must take the high road\nIf something is not done to hold Saudi Arabia into account on the public stage this official believes it becomes very difficult for us diplomat for US military personnel and commanders\nTo hold that moral high ground around the world it is going to be very tough business it will reshape the middle east it will reshape relations potentially with Middle East allies Enron the consequences appear to be very significant\nIs this what it's all about why do you think we've asked a question what is the meaning of life since the dawn of time because we all have this whole that has to be filled and if you're not filling it with the only thing that can really feel it\nThen you always want more and you always get more extreme in more demanding\nAnd that's exactly what we're seeing with the far left and you're saying well some people in the far right too although I think some of the people that are that are actually called far right these are really far left these\nBecause if you're truly a fascist you're far less not far right far right is total anarchy\nSo what is it that really feels it\nWell for me and I really believe for\nAll humans it's your belief in God and affirmed face\nNow I Know a lot of people don't believe that don't understand that and that's fine but I'm I'm just telling yet from my personal experience I Know that's true\nAnd for others that can be a very strong family or a very strong network of friends\nThat's the closest they can get to feeling like that void is filled but I you know senator Sasse who I disagree with a lot of stuff he's written a new book where he talks about this problem of loneliness and America\nWith decreasing faith decreasing nuclear families decreasing amount of friends that you actually have real friends not Facebook friends not people who give you clicks on Instagram and\nTwitter and Snapchat you with the streak real friends that you talk with that you go to the bar with then maybe you watch football with or you go to the bowling alley whether you surf or hunt with or whatever it is that you love to do play golf\nReal friends that you can go to when something's wrong that you support when something's wrong with them the ones who help you move when you move\nThe ones who come to your house when you're sick real friends\nAnd we have fewer and fewer of those so when you you don't have a faith in God you don't have a strong nuclear family you don't have an extended family you don't have a close friends you're changing jobs every three to four years so you don't have really close work friends what do you have\nWell you have your belief in your tribe politically\n\nAnd so that void gets filled with all the crap that you hear from the far left professors in the far left media and the far left politicians telling you you're a victim a hobby that's why I feel so empty because I've been persecuted all my life I've been oppressed all my life I've been put down all my life and it's time for me to hit back and and these guys are so awful that I can do anything\nThese guys are like Nazis and you know what we did the Nazis we killed not these so therefore we can do anything we want to and that's why our quarter says when they go low you kick them that's why Hillary Clinton says how can you be similar to the people that you're totally disagree with\nAnd that gives you like me\nAnd now you feel like you're part of something you're part of something big you're part of something that could change the world and now that void is filled at least for a little bit uh it'll be empty again but at least it felt good for the moment in and and now I've got people around me who are who seemed to support me who seemed to be my instant friends\n\nIt's their new religion because they don't have a real one\n\nI think that's happened and continues to happen I think it's really dangerous and it's really sad\nLook at the increase in depression in this country over the last couple of decades look at the increase in the loneliness the last couple of decades because\nThe increase in the destruction of the American family\n\nAnd then look and see how it coincides to this tribalism and politics that we've been seeing and not just Republican Democrat but what is your tribe on black I'm white I'm Asian Hispanic I'm\nNative American well maybe I'm One one thousand twenty fourth Native American but I'm Still Latin America to some degree\nA five hundred Savage get you on board they pop I pointed Savage and that that gets ascended Elizabeth Warren thing I got to talk about it's are you kidding me yesterday I was like oh man this is amazing and it just keeps getting better because yesterday of course we learn about the test\nElizabeth Warren had claimed she was a Native American or places that she had gone to school claim that she had been Native American\nAnd they use that to look like they were more diverse than they really were she claimed it had nothing to do with are getting into law school had nothing to do with her getting hired to if you're very prestigious positions but man and by the way it was true because my grandmother told me about it\nAnd then we do the test and we find out a couple of very interesting things okay first of all we find out that the test shows well\nSomewhere between one sixty fourth Native American and one one thousand twenty fourth Native American owned by the way when you get to you know around won five hundred Native American that's less than the average European immigrants to this country [laughter]\nSo it means nothing but then you go back even further that we now we find out that the DNA test didn't even use DNA from Native Americans in this country I I don't know where they couldn't find that people didn't want to give it to them but here's what we found out\nThey use\nGeneral population samples from Mexico and South America as these so called Native American sample to compare to Elizabeth Warren\nSo what she has doesn't qualified or to be a percentage of any known tried in the United states and she claimed victory\n[laughter]\nI mean that's just an enormously hilarious she is claiming victory and it took the Native American tribes to tell her that she didn't know what she was talking about and Warren Elizabeth Warren is trying to troll Trump\nIs when the washing of this from navy dateline Washington\nTrump's mockery of war in this claim of Native American history he's called her Pocahontas and said it would offer to pay one million to charity if you took a DNA test clearly got into her head okay what's up right there he actually didn't say he would offer a million dollars to charity if you took the DNA test he actually said I watched it yesterday several times\nHe said you know if she runs for president and we're in a debate\nThen I'm going to challenge her and then he went on to talk about the test and the million dollars so she hasn't run for president there hasn't been a debate and he hasn't challenged her it was a hypothetical that he talked about at a rally as a joke\nAnd yet a little bit worn in some in the press are trying to make it seemed like he promised or a million dollars to charity if she could show quote one drop of\nNative American blood in her remember the old one drop slave rules for\nBlacks I thought that was a bad thing now are making it a good thing a good thing\n\nAsked about the promise to donate to warns charity of choice Trump said only do that if I can test her personally that will not be something I enjoy doing either\nTo which one are flies we all know why Donald Trump makes creepy physical threats about me right he's scared he's trying to do what he always does eliminate scare him call us names attack us personally shrinks down to feel better about themselves and makes his ego but it won't work um where was the physical threat\nA DNA test is a physical threat\nA Utah Republican Senator Orrin hatch who's eighty four years old he treated a photo of himself looking at his phone and his own DNA test results and it showed that he had a small fraction of terrain\nA source wrecked ancestry the rest of their dinosaurs [laughter]\nThat's pretty good pretty good and Trump is now gone after\nPocahontas to bad version sometimes referred to as Elizabeth Warren is getting slammed she took bogus DNA test it showed that she may be one one thousand twenty fourth far less than the average American now Cherokee Nation denies her DNA test is useless as what the Cherokee Nation said\nEven they don't want her phony or what do you mean what do you mean even day what do you mean Donald even they don't want or what do you say about the check

they're calling a migrants in here but they're illegal aliens there just crossing the border on their own and then you know it doesn't matter\nWhen they come to America but it's very interesting 'cause listen to this is the second paragraph ... volunteer assisting the migrants said Sunday that the group had grown to an estimated sixteen hundred people and that many in the group might not be allowed to enter Guatemala because they lack official identification document what I\nI thought it didn't matter if you had any documents I thought the whole point was undocumented is okay I thought the whole point was no person is illegal I thought the whole point was you know only evil America seems to care about borders\nGuatemala might not let them in Guatemala might not let them in and not just Guatemala\nMexico's interior ministry issued a strong reminder this weekend that Mexico does not issue entry visas for those who don't meet the requirements to transit ... neighboring\nCountry and Mexico Set of issues visas that the constants abroad not border entry points what is that I thought I thought only the evil America was telling people they had to come in at legal entry points\nAnd by the way if America is so evil if America so systemically racist that's America is the problem in the world\nWhy so many people want to come here why are so many of the poor people still want to come on and so many people want to claim asylum to come to the United states I mean if you're claiming asylum what you're supposed to do was stop in the first country that you come to and if you grab a map then\nThey shouldn't be coming to America I mean if you're leaving Honduras why stopping in El Salvador El Salvador's bleep hole to waste I thought President Trump got in trouble for calling these countries Lee polls I mean why would you want to flee Honduras unless it's a bleep hole country\nThink about that why would you want to leave your country unless it's a ... country\nWhy would so many risk everything leave everything behind risk their family being robbed and members of their family being raped or murdered on the trip unless you're fleeing a bleep hole country\nSo why wouldn't you stop in El Salvador believe all country why don't you stop and Guatemala bleep hole country why don't you just go north a little bit and stop and beliefs I mean Americans retired police\nWhy wouldn't you stop and Mexico ... they're all believe all countries I thought that was a horrible thing to say well why don't you go south instead of north why don't you stop in Nicaragua remote country\nHow 'bout Costa Rica again we've got Americans who vacation and coastal Rica go surfing and Costa Rica relocate and retire in Costa Rica\nOr go a little further south Panama Panama again that's another uh ex patriot retirement home community down there and ... they can't hardly bleep all countries can they so why risk all that and go so far just to get to the United states since it's such a horrible races country\nBecause we all know it's not that puts the lie to everything you hear from the far left\n\nSo they're coming again\nBecause you know people are poor and hunters that's not an excuse for you to come to our country illegally so President Trump is is getting out ahead of this and he said\nThat he will cut off U.S foreign aid to Honduras if they don't stop the caravan of migrants moving toward the U.S border through them easily lanes so here's the question do you think that's the right thing to do cutting off foreign aid is that the best thing to do\nWhen Honduras allows this many people to flee and what about the countries in between that are just allowing them to keep on moving to the United states of America when they know it's all about illegal alien a situation\n\nTrump tweeted out if the illegal aliens are not stop before they reach the U.S border no more money or a will be given to Honduras effective immediately\n\nNow there's a piece here from Mike in ...\nAnd he ... he tries to break down is is that something that President Trump can legally do can can the president say we're going to cut off aid well not if it's a it's been approved by the United States Congress that specifically for a country\nBut there are some things that he can do now according USAID in twenty sixteen the most recent here we have the numbers for we gave under us a hundred and fifty two million bucks\nAnd for twenty Seventeen so far we've given them a hundred and forty four million bucks\nAnd there's more to come and for every year since twenty Thirteen we've given at least a hundred million dollars in aid to Honduras so can Trump stop it if he wants to well here's what they say the president can and foreign aid without congressional approval if\nHe makes the argument that the recipient country has violated conditions that were placed on the aid now he did this in September twenty Seventeen to stop military going to Pakistan because they didn't follow\nWhat they said they were going to do now when it comes to spending all foreign aid to a nation when that ... I was not given with conditions then Trump doesn't have\nOne hundred percent power over that when he can do he can freeze specific foreign aid for forty five days\nBut if it's already been approved by Congress then he needs congressional approval to keep that freeze on beyond forty five days what do you get that you might mean you've got the house but you don't have two thirds of the Senate but you don't need two thirds unless they filibuster let me go on and on\n[noise] now one exception\nIf you're close to the end of the fiscal year if you're within forty five days at the end of the fiscal year you can freeze it for the forty five days a fiscal year ends and the money that so there are some options do you think you should use those options\nThis is one of the big things that he ran on that we have to have a law and order that you have to have borders it's one of the things that Dr Savage talks about all the time if you don't have borders you don't have a nation\nAnd the idea that somehow poverty is the excuse to violate the borders of multiple nations to come into our country illegally then\nWhy do we have any borders at all and why do we have any immigration laws at all and and don't we see how that impacts American citizens and legal immigrants and people are waiting to be legal immigrants it totally undermines the fairness of our immigration system and the fairness of what our government does for our own citizens\nLook if you really want to help the people in Honduras to help the people in Honduras and you can do that by going mission trips by donating money by donating food by ... you can do all kinds of stuff but my ... but what what what the liberals want to do\nIs to force everyone to break our laws and they really don't care what impact that has on the country in economics in our schools in our prisons and our hospitals they don't care because they seem as votes\nOh you don't you don't believe me wait till you hear this quote I have for you on what part of the blue wave as we're going to get that and just a second and love your thoughts on it as well a five five four hundred Savage to get in a five five foreigners Savage my name's Greg nap in for Dr Savage on the Savage Nation\nDrawing boasts Savage Nation coal no eight five or four hundred Savage eight five votes for Hubbard seven to eight to\n...
