Klux Klan member or a white supremacist you add militant disgusting so called feminists you\nHad anti whites in the streets directing cars and the way that gets worse\nA Portland policemen on a motorcycle sat there and did nothing\nAnd I couldn't sleep last night thinking about the ... that is raining in San Francisco and in Portland and in Seattle and an other Dennis ... of extreme left this and that is spreading like a cancer\nBecause of a mass hysteria where they think anyone or they've been told that anyone who opposes they're communist agenda is white supremacist\nWhat they don't understand what I Do understand is that this is a civil war that has been fueled for a number of years by Nancy Pelosi who at UC Berkeley that's University of California at Berkeley thank you are in a commencement speech three years ago said we are all the structures she encouraged\nPeople to go in the streets in cause chaos to block traffic what does she think what happened or how about Maxine Waters who should be in jail for what she's doing\nA encouraging leftist fanatics like those and on the five to beat up Republicans harassed Republicans a drive them out of restaurants\nI refuse to live in fear and I will not cower myself I'm a public figure I perhaps the most prominent member of the opposition in the San Francisco area I Will not\nCower to these people I Will protect myself at all times I'm an old boy scout I remember the boy scout motto I Will protect myself at all times and if I feel threatened I Will react accordingly I Will not be driven out of my own city in my own home and I hope you feel the same way what began with a Trump witch hunt\nHas now spread to anyone they disagree with so of course there's no tied to the news\nYou won't see any mention of stop mass hysteria on Fox News because it really isn't news hysteria there's always the area and the air what you saw against Kavanaugh that wasn't a a result of mass hysteria there was a witch hunt against Kavanaugh he wasn't a pornographer all white\nMale heterosexual Christians why she of course he was\nWell that's the fact of the matter is we're living in very hysterical times and very dangerously hysterical times and the purpose of my book is not for me to buy a new car or a new house I have a new car and too many houses no what I'm trying to do here is save America before it's too late\nAnd so I'm asking you the Savage army\nTo help me and that means have you gone to your local bookstore to look for the book\nWere ... were was the book where it's supposed to be I have a list of where it's supposed to be\nIn Walmart and Sam's it's in bestsellers and I heard this there\nAt the books and millions on making news table I heard it's there but I'm getting mixed answers from Barnes and noble it's a purchase to be on the new released table between the ninth of October which is today and the twenty second of October which is not today and I have gotten one picture after another of\nThe book not being on a new release table or buried underneath other books on the new release table so it's up to you to go there and demand that the book the put where the publisher of paid for it to be put because it's probably the most important book of our time in fact I Would say can you tell me of a of a more important book\nTell me what book tell me which book is more important right now because I don't know of one and so what happened when you went into the bookstores and what are you going to do with the book many of you are buying the book for yourself and friends to try to have a dialogue with them\nAnd that's the main thing did you buy one for your liberal neighbor to read will they even read a book you know I Am pretty active on Twitter since Trump started trading at first I thought it was for children only but I realized that there are many people who do turn to these\nOutlets for their opinions and for their for to to debate people so I put some stuff up\nAnd one of them was do you think\nFox News has blacklisted Michael Savage\nAnd why well I Know why\nAnd then I make another statement as the only major conservative TV outlets Fox News is like a public utility and yet they engage in the same censorship as Twitter and Facebook now how's that for turnabout we've been hearing that Twitter\nIs engaging in censorship that Facebook is engaging in censorship and we've said no that's not fair even though they're private enterprises and the argument we abuses that they're so big that they're like public utilities or\nShutting the same reasoning apply to Fox News\nThey are the only conservative TV outlet and yet they're blacklisting some people myself included should they be allowed to do it now don't give me the garbage about that there are private enterprise you can do what they want that will be true if there were three of four conservative TV outlets but there aren't there is only one\nSo they're doing the same thing as Twitter and Facebook and getting away with it because we haven't thought through\nAnd that's the opening to the program\nJudicious timing Michael Savage a new book mass hysteria by are more of world net daily I suggest you go and look at it's a great article by art and another one came out from the times of Israel which again you'll only find linked on a Michael Savage dot com apparently\nUh the times of

meaning Democrats and you have to sell or you have to ask him why I told her you know last segment\nIf I talked about America is insanity from the Salem witch trials in which Trump which on it's easy to assume that I'm only talking about supporting Republicans\nBut you're mistaken I'm Talking about supporting realists and national lists and I'm also talking about history\nThe most important part of this new book is that it's not strictly polemic or politics it's history and those who do not know the history as Santa Ana wisely wrote are condemned to repeat it and if you want to repeat the history of the Bolshevik Revolution\nOr of the revolutions in other countries that led to the deaths of millions go ahead be my guest\nLast night after the show I was sitting in an outdoor area somewhere and just watching the world go by there was not in San Francisco because I was just not there let's leave it at that\nAnd a woman came by and smiling said hello she said to me I've been listening to you\nFor years I'm from Hungary I said great countries you said you liked my leader don't your job and I said I Love him he's great very nationalistic he's totally against the influx of Muslims and Africans\nWho have several destroyed the Christian heritage and the makeup of Hungary and call them a white supremacist if you want but he's defending his own people is what he's doing and his own culture\nWell anyway we talked and she said you know I'm from the former eastern bloc and she said you know that there was less fear\nLess fear to speak your mind\nIn a Soviet Bloc nation than there is in the bay area of San Francisco right now she said people are more afraid to express themselves here in the San Francisco area than they were in my communist nation of Hungary before the wall fell I was actually stunned by that observation\nWe have now the Senate to the point of absolute in total fear because the leftist have taken over\nOur minds let alone our politics\nAnd this is something that you have to come to understand you for example listening to the show many rely upon me because I'm sort of your statue of liberty in many ways I express what you would like to express and are afraid to express let me tell you something you're actually a prisoner\nYou're more of a president than people lived under the Soviet\nRed scare you\nAre more of a president then people lived in Russia\nThe style in years you're afraid to speak out\nYou're afraid to call Nancy Pelosi what she is you're afraid to call us Dianne Feinstein what she is you're afraid to call Maxine Waters what she is you're afraid to say that not gonna take being called a white supremacist because you love America than your prisoner and you lost your freedom\nYou're afraid to go by stop mass hysteria because someone they see the book in your house you're a prisoner\nYou're afraid to speak the truth than you were a prison or what do you want me to do I'm only one man one man who won the whole not be here forever in in fact they may not be for much longer to be honest with you and I'll let you just consider that for a while\nBig things are happening in my media life because of political pressures\nAs you may know the show is moving to only a one hour show in January and a podcast\nDo you think that that's because of not because of political considerations I was taken off major stations a year or two ago even though I had very high ratings there are other people to pose as quote conservatives but they're not a threat to the establishment\nThey're very safe conservative it's easy to call yourself conservative and not be a threat to the establishment it's another thing to be an independent who was a threat to the establishment both left and right there is no room in America for the independent minded individual let me tell you that right now almost no room whatsoever none whatsoever\nYou got to play the game according to the rules and the rules say you're joined one party or the other it's an interesting that so many people who put Trump down for a year straight back to other candidates ridiculed you are now making believe that they're the greatest supporter of Donald Trump well he's not fooled by it\nAnd I'm not fooled by it so you know I'm not going to read and read from the book I'm not in the mood to read from the book I don't even want to read from the book you can read it yourself and maybe we'll talk about it tomorrow or it's the most important political book of our time I'll leave it at that\nBut I Want to do is take some of your calls and I

virtually everywhere but there's some some great news on the horizon Theo and for me for that matter Governor Huckabee has his own show\nAnd it was left off last year by those\nPeople in\nThe cable world certainly Fox News dismissed them and left them off\nThey thought he'd be marginal I've learned today that Governor Huckabee and his show\nHas one of the most loyal and phenomenally larger audiences amongst country and western Christian people\nAnd it's become as important as Fox News\nIf not more so in its own time slot wherever it is seen now last year Governor Huckabee was kind enough to have me on his show at the grand old Opry houses where it was broadcast for God's sake and reason in the book took off like a rocket after that\nAnd I'm going to be on Governor Huckabee show this Friday I've invited the governor onto the show to be with us today and I just got an email it can't joined me because he's prepping U.S House for the hurricane he's in the panhandle of Florida\nBut he's going to join us tomorrow granted as phones are not out from the storm and try to reach us either on the land line or on a cell phone again we want to thank Governor Huckabee for standing with the American people in these dark times especially in these times of media blackouts and remember he's been\nHe is himself has been a ... a blacklisted by many many in the media and written off\nAnd he rose from the ashes like a Phoenix as I Hope we will do as well on the Savage Nation\nCase of oh Daniel line to go ahead please\nDr Savage I just wanted to talk about how I went to

in front of the five boroughs what burg fear I Wish I Would have took a picture of it\nKind of yeah that's beautiful yeah the ... the Bob Woodward book isn't it a phenomenon that never should have happened why a liberal so supportive of their movement while conservatives are not mean Bob Woodward is a hack who wrote one book about Watergate whenever it was thirty or forty years ago\nAnd yet he's held up some kind of icon of some genius you sold a million copies the first day because he was an every television show in the country and of course liberal support their viewpoint by buying books unfortunately conservatives don't\nBut I thank you for moving stopped a mass hysteria up from the back from the depths to the front so that people might have a chance to decide for themselves

topic please\nMr Savage Mikhail resignation [noise] go ahead I'm I think it would be pretty much journalistic negligence not to mention the fact that she sent her a letter only one week after Trump made is embarrassing address to the un\nSlow down I don't know what you're connected what what embarrassing address you're talking about\nAre you talking about when Trump said America's great again and we've done great things that use embarrassing\nNo no they didn't say that he said my administration has done more than any previous administration which everybody laughed at and rightfully should ...\n... what are you saying I don't understand that you have to understand that America is now looked upon by the rest of the world in a new light and it's a positive light and that's why everyone's laughing you see again you only heard what you wanted to hear I listen to that speech\nThey chuckled when he said that in the beginning because they were laughing with him and then he moved in to talk to them I'll play it for you if you want and you can listen to it again they actually sharing um right after that\nWhat what did you only hear the soundbite from a Jake Tapper is that what you got it from off from the did you did you listen to it on the ... on the on the Pew better known as the view I call it appeal because it stinks I is that what you're is that what you heard your soundbite from the Pew or from a er Jake Tapper\n\nWhereas the I don't know where he went All right have a nice thing a let's get the soundbite if you can in this hour of the actual speech at the un where Trump makes what the left thinks is a fell upon the world laughed at them\nAnd listen to the entire context of them not laughing at him that's what I heard by the way okay\nWhat do you think about Haley's resignation do you agree with me that she resigned because she failed to ignite war with Russia She was put there specifically to ignite meaning to drag the U.S military in\nTo attack Syria and Russia look it's a very complicated game the middle east\nAnd you have to have a mind as complex as mine to even understand that otherwise you could just sit there and salute and say she was great because she's on our side that's the easy thing to do she was a disaster and the reason she's out as because she didn't she did not\nSucceed at what she was put there to do which was to ignite a war that would have dragged us aircraft if not troops into Syria forever that's what she wanted to do and that was so that there would be a buffer between Iran\nAnd the other forces that are aligned against Israel and I can't blame Israel for that not at all\nI mean if you're Israel and you're a little nation surrounded by enemies of course you want to do what you can to defend your own people\nBut I Would say that America First means America First not America second for any reason that's my point of view and I'm a devout Zionist that happens is um twelve years old\nAnd a great supporter of Israel but you know what Israel has the most powerful military in the middle east it's time to use that instead of using a uncle Joe you know I'm sick and tired of America dying for other other people's wars and I'm not alone in that that is why Trump was elected he was elected to keep us out of foreign wars not bring us into them\nBut I guess you all forgot that\nAnd a on a personal note we know that Trump is surrounded by several factions as are all presidents\nOne of the factions are global is like Nikki Haley like moustache Leo\nAnd then there are other factions who are nationalist and they vie with each other for the president's attention and then he makes the decisions obviously that's why he's the chief executive well he didn't listen to the global is who wanted him to launch Tomahawk strike against Syria\nFour weeks ago Haley was literally drooling ruling she was on the verge of success our greatest success ever of igniting a war and it made no sense to me\nNone whatsoever\nISIS had been beaten back into one city ... whatever it is and Russia and thank God for Russia and Syria and our own warplanes ISIS was beaten back into this one city\nAnd in order to make sure that the Syrians and Russians didn't go in to clean out the remaining elements of ISIS in that city\nThere were talks that Saddam was going to unleash chemical weapons on his own people which made no sense whatsoever none\nI mean you're winning a war of the whole world is watching everyone as an iPhone you're gonna unleash poison gas on your own women and children who would do that who wouldn't believe a story like that other than idiots\nWho would buy a story like that and I kept saying this weeks and weeks ago don't do it don't do it they'll do it I sent a message after a message to the White House whether they were receiving them or not I don't know I I Know that received them\nAnd they know one thing about the Savage Nation so long as I'm Still here as long as I still have a loyal audience which I Do you are the base that elected Donald Trump not the Johnny come lightly none of them elected Donald Trump you did\nAnd now that I've said that I'm going to say something else so it's not lost to history\nWhatever I decide to do come January whatever that may be whether it's what's announced or something else\nI Will rest knowing and my family knows and they're pretty bright people that it was either who helped push Donald Trump into the public eye and pushed them over the finish line he even said the same thing to me put his arm around me and said without this man I wouldn't be president I Am proud to tell you that I have saved the western world\nFrom the total insanity that day war and still are engaged in that is how I see it and then as how that is how my ... family sees it and I don't need the approval of anyone else in the media I Know what's right I Know what's true and I want to thank God for giving me the power to have help move\nThe west to save itself before it's too late but the game is really not over\nIt's only just begun you've got a few nationalist movements in Europe that are trying to wrestle with their own survival being fought by the international is the communist socialist the George Soros funded suicidal brigades just as we do here\nAnd the battle is still being fought everywhere in every outlet in this world in the west that we know of in\nThe battle for the soul of the west is being fought on a daily basis that's a form of the mass hysteria I deeply described in my new book now I admit that maybe it's too much information for the average Rush Limbaugh listener\nI don't call myself el Savage Joe or the great one I don't need to do that I Need you to understand the bigger picture\nI live in a medium called radio that is what it is I Love and I've been with it for twenty five years and I will tell you that it's very easy to fall back into\nThe tropes of left and right and just go along with the herd in

my show I'm sitting at a restaurant and the beautiful north beach Italian district which I've enjoyed for over forty years\nI take a break from might be able to get a little air I look across the street a man polish passed down a decade on the sidewalk is passive vice we're going by\nOh this is the new San Francisco yeah butler I've gotta thank you for ... or ... you and I have known each other since I think like two thousand four since I started in radio we actually never met until two weeks ago so I I have to thank you speaking of dinner and San Francisco\nIs a great night but it was not in the streets of north beach so I guess a bum decades industry in front of a restaurant the police do nothing their hands have been tied\nOrdinary passer buys walk around the feces in the street we are starting to accept this we have sunk below that of a third world nation\nBecause I Will tell you this behavior is that the low of ... it's below that of an animal even an animal tries to hide his droppings what a human being reached this point because of liberalism and ultra tolerance\nThe society a shot it's gone it's finished\nAnd so what is the solution there are many solutions that I don't want to go into the whole issue but the homeless and the dedication and the urine nation and the drugs are all several terms of the America that is fighting against Kavanaugh\nFighting against Trump in other words you want me to be very clear about it clear that I have been what is it about Cabot of the show agitated\nAll of those left us let's see\nWhite male check those two boxers white and male check three heterosexual let's strike three a check for married that strike for oh throw in Christian\nCombine all those five elements these ... these are the enemy points of the American left Christian white heterosexual male\nSo he's assembled by the way of that exact demographic in America which they would like to conveniently think has gone away when they don't know is that the heterosexual white male largely Christian is very much alive and well in America\nThe book is called a stop mass hysteria America's insanity from the Salem witch trials chew the Trump which on 'em and mass hysteria put on steroids in the last in the last few years but are are are we kind of becoming a nest it ties to this because we are becoming so used to it so used to also seeing\nYou know in San Francisco you use the\nAnalogy although it's a real of a homeless man deprecating on the streets and nobody says or does anything\nOr are you afraid that this mass hysteria under Donald Trump where people are so brainwashed into believing this stuff that we're becoming immune to it as a society\nYes we do become used things in society when I was a kid and were\nGrowing up I Would see pictures of India where there was massive poverty levels we could never understand\nAnd I would ask my father how could people step around people lying in the streets of Calcutta I see people lying there dead right an ordinary passive buys boardwalk ride around them right isn't that what's going on now in New York and elsewhere\nAre not the dead but more or less will walk around anything was show driven in

an age of hate which mental pollution is worse than air pollution the most accessible a comprehensive ... of all unifying agents hatred is spreading the virus into alter willing hosts\nAnd its allies knee jerk liberals no matter what their other differences hatred of conservatives of Trump hatred of his voters they're just one in many cases a mass hysteria infecting American society today but it's likely the most destructive\nAnd they're using it as the the left knows how to use this kind of mass hysteria as you pointed out in the beginning with the ACLU with these professional agitation organizations they know how to ... on and on the masses\nWith these key words and people really believe it and then use it as a political movement like for example this inflection point that we have seen with the Kavanaugh hearing and\nAnd me to uh the way they hijacked the issue of women and in the past of race in the past and some of gender and so many other things\nIn order to to use it for their own political aims so ... what what do you foresee heading into the midterms in one month from now um do you what what is your prediction for them in terms\nI don't know we're all hoping that it's not what the media is portraying which is that there's going to be years Democrats week I'm not so sure of that in fact the Senate maybe see more conservative especially after the way capital was treated I think that the secret voter\nSilent majority of the I got I have to define it again the white male in some cases the white woman has had enough of this they\nHave sons daughters that sons to have uncles that brothers and they know that the man and the male has been targeted in this country unfairly and they worry for their children so I'm not so sure it's a guarantee sweep of the left but I Want to talk for a minute Arab before we go about racism and bigotry because\nIn my book under a this topic in mass hysteria I said that racism and bigotry half to defining parts immorality and

witch trials which Trump which I found it's easy to assume that I'm only talking about supporting Republicans\nBut you're mistaken I'm Talking about supporting realists and national lists and I'm also talking about history\nThe most important part of this new book is that it's not strictly polemic or politics it's history and those who do not know the history as Santa Ana wisely wrote are condemned to repeat it and if you want to repeat the history of the Bolshevik Revolution\nOr of the revolutions in other countries that led to the deaths of millions go ahead be my guess I Would like to reference an article written by Cindy gross\nIn the times of Israel I'm going to read you a few paragraphs and I'll Try to stay away from the obvious she says\nSavage is the host of one of the most countries most streamlined radio shows but Michael Savage is also a fortune teller bringing want it that who else of Michael Savage would release a book on October ninth the first day of work for associate justice Brett Kavanaugh after three weeks of historic hysteria embarrassed our country internationally\nI spoke with Savage and he said the left is not just take President Trump they hate this nation it's nothing new but it's at its worst\nAnd that she says Savage delves into American history history of mass hysteria to prove it from Christopher Columbus the Salem witch trials and then he or she she quotes me and she says that these are being set in motion by sentence the politicians without Syria motives\nSavage provides vital contacts for the common elements of dozens of outbreaks of mass hysteria their causes they're short and long term effects and the tactics of the puppet masters who duped gullible masses interfering threats both real and imagine\nShe then went into the issue of Jews because she writes for the times they're Israel and she's very Jewish\nAnd she asked me a key question which was funny\nWhich was is this good or bad for the Jews what is being done to Capitol at that time\nAnd Savage said quote when Jews are good they're great but when they're bad they're very dangerous\nSavage pointed out adding quote the smartest yet most dangerous person today is Bernie Sanders he is so smart he knows exactly what he is doing he models his platform from the power man the so the Bolshevik Revolution he is energizing this frenzy among the young ...\nOf course we discuss the cabin on stereo\nAnd he said the check off to smear Kavanaugh was challenged in last male white heterosexual married in Christian the involvement of a Feinstein who was not Jewish Blumenthal Schumer affects Jews long term\nWe compared how Jews were treated during the alpha Dreyfuss are Leo Frank cases Savage also related how Jewish laws and ethics are the exact\nOpposite of what took place during the process of confirming avid or I thought that was the most salient point of our interview Savage related how the Jewish laws an ethics are the exact opposite of what took place\nDuring the process of governing cabinet and what was sad about it was that they were Jewish people\nViolating the ethics of their fathers Blumenthal amongst them Blumenthal in others amongst them using the exact opposite of the teaching of the Jewish people\nSavage a Trump supporter agrees that while he doesn't agree with Trump one hundred percent he thanks got every day that Hillary has it in the White House to any critics Savage says nobody agrees with a spouse or a friend one hundred percent\nAnd then he went on with other stuff Savage encourages opposition to read the book and debate him and of course my discussion with Savage included where to get some good food the Catskill Mountains in his involvement with\nAbout so there was a very good interview and I ... and it's worth reading by people who are interested in the deeper ramifications of what happened and how the effects of going to be seen for years and years to come\nSo many different topics there's an article

generation forget the older people\nI'm Talking about children who you know and I know are being forever warped I Am talking about couples who are in couples therapy because they can no longer have

because I was just not there let's leave it at that\nAnd a woman came by and smiling said hello she said to me I've been listening to you for years\nI'm from Hungary I said great country she said you liked my leader don't your job and I said I Love him he's great very nationalistic he's totally against the influx of Muslims and Africans\nWho have several destroyed the Christian heritage and the makeup of hungry you can call them a white supremacist if you want but he's defending his own people is what he's doing and his own culture\nWell anyway we talked and she said you know I'm from the former eastern bloc and she said you know that there was less fear\nLess fear to speak your mind\nIn a Soviet Bloc nation than there is in the bay area of San Francisco right now she said people are more afraid to express themselves here in the San Francisco area than they were in my communist nation of Hungary before the wall fell I was actually done by that observation\nWe have now the Senate to the point of absolute in total fear because the left us of taking over\nOur minds let alone our politics\nAnd this is something that you have to come to understand you for example listening to the show many rely upon me because I'm sort of your statue of liberty in many ways I express what you would like to express and are afraid to express let me tell you something you're actually a prisoner\nYou're more of a person that then people lived under the Soviet red\nScare\nYou're more of a president of the people lived in Russia\nDuring the style in years you're afraid to speak out\nYou're afraid to call Nancy Pelosi what she is you're afraid of called us Dianne Feinstein what she is you're afraid to call Maxine Waters what she is you're afraid to say that not gonna take being called the white supremacist because you love America than your prisoner and you lost your freedom\nYou're afraid to go by stop mass hysteria because someone may see the book in your house you're a prisoner\nYou're afraid to speak the truth than you were a prison or what do you want me to do I'm only one man one man who won the whole not be here forever in in fact they may not be for much longer to be honest with you and I'll let you just consider that for a while\nBig things are happening in my media life because of political pressures\nAs you may know the show is moving to only a one hour show in January and a podcast do you think that that's because of not because of political considerations I was taken off major stations a year or two ago even though I had very high ratings\nThere are other people oppose us called conservatives but they're not a threat to the establishment\nThey're very safe conservative it's easy to call yourself conservative and not be a threat to the establishment it's another thing to be an independent who was a threat to the establishment both left and right there's no room in America for the independent minded individual let me tell you that right now almost no room whatsoever none whatsoever\nYou got to play the game according to the rules and the rules say you're joined one party or the other it's an interesting uh\nThe people who put Trump down for a year straight back to other candidates ridiculed you are now making believe that the greatest supporter of Donald Trump well he's not fooled by it\nAnd I'm not fooled by it but let's get back to the news of the day and my opinion on it and I don't know whether you agree or disagree with me I said that Haley resigned suddenly because she failed to ignite a war with Russia and failed to get Trump to bomb Syria\nNow on what do I base my opinion she was bellicose from the beginning\nShe was bombastic and bellicose at the same time and very threatening she was the exact opposite of what an ... supposed to be an ambassador is supposed to make peace not war Haley went in there with one mission which was to cause dissension with Russia\nThrough Syria and by bombing Syria again based on the false flag of a chemical attack which I kept pointing out over and over again it's a false flag false flag false flag false flag or about to\nRelease gas and say that I saw that it I pointed out over and over again Assad would be an insane individualized would put in to do this when they're when they've got ISIS backed in a corner in one city they wouldn't do it and somehow people within the Trump Administration\nHeard this viewpoint and decided not to unleash another Tomahawk missile attack on the Syrians even though they were ready to do so they were on the verge four weeks ago I don't know if you remember and who was beating the drums for the launch of Tomahawk against Syria\nWell it was missed the ... himself\nThe man who gave us the Iraq War the most dangerous man in the administration is that the ... plant in the national security advisor ship\nPosition and Nikki Haley the two of them wanted war in the worst way they were bloodthirsty and they wanted war but for some reason the non global is around from\nWar of the winners and they prevented them from launching against Syria and from provoking a war with Russia which is a fantastic well as a result Haley's resigning that's my opinion maybe disagree with me and I don't know on what basis you would disagree with me\nAnd now we're talking about my book stop mass hysteria what you found in the book stores or on a more intelligent level\nIf you've gotten the book through Amazon in advance and you've read some of it what are the best things in it\nSo here we are on the day of the launch of the book and you're not seeing it anywhere in the media because of the blacklisting of Fox News which has now spread to virtually everywhere but there's some some great news on the horizon for you
