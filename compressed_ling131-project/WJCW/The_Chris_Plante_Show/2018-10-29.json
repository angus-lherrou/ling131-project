{"month": "10", "state": "TN", "station": "WJCW", "content": "So that the two don't necessarily go together and that's been what the the Democrats have been able to do is linked to um\nWhat do we do about this shooting urging well here's here's what you got to do one day as it said that the congressional budget office predicted that the deficit we'd go up but they predicted it based on growth never going above ... percent\nThey said this is the new norm we're never going to go more than that well that's clearly wrong after the tax cuts the growth rate has now gone up to what three and a half percent annual last year at least three this year for every\nOne percent of GDP goes up in this country it as almost four hundred billion dollars to the budget so it's if in three years or three percent growth there is no budget deficit\nSo the idea is is that you turn the American economy lose you get the um regulations reduced which we had done and by the way the president wanted reduce to regulations for every one new rule that was written we reduced twenty two and then when you have business people come in and they tell us she yeah the tax cuts are important\nBut the regulatory relief was as important as that was so you can help grow your way out and love we do have a huge problem with the deficit and going to be dealt with\nThe uh one of their economics question there the I'm sure you've heard this was you've traveled around the district too that are heads of manufacturing across the country are saying that the impact of these terrorists is beginning to uh negatively impact their bottom line is do you see a resolution of any of this yeah I Do and\nAnd if you notice a very quickly the at the the three countries that were involved in the former NAFTA agreement Mexico Canada and um [noise] in the United states that got negotiated pretty quickly I think you'll also see the European Union negotiate fairly quickly China's going to be different or and\nLet me let me go over that just a little bit you know how to how to terrorists affect us locally [noise] while\nHe's gosh reported on it a several months ago we had eleven dairy producers in this area that all of a sudden got a letter from dean foods is set in Ninety Days we don't need your mail\nWell what does that do with terrorists well it turns out that Canada has a three hundred percent tariff on many of our dairy products in Wisconsin's a huge they're producing state\nSo guess what what that happens that milk when it couldn't be exporting into because of tariffs unfair terrorists into Canada where does it come it came this direction and all of a sudden there was no need for a our products\nWhen the president ... the way for us to sell some milk to to export some milk without terrorists into Canada he look I think terrorists are bad either way free trade is absolutely no terrorists were there I totally agree with that China\nWe bring product into this country at two and a half percent we send the manufactured products back at fifty percent and so what he's saying is is time to level the playing field and and by the way\nOr the previous administration it's sad that manufacturing you know what are you going to bring that back you know may wave a magic wand\nWell sixteen thousand manufacturing jobs are lost in twenty sixteen we've added\nOver two hundred thousand manufacturing jobs in the last two years and I take the biggest challenge car we have right here and we've gone all bill dark and myself and others have dealt all over this history looking in manufacturing is finding enough employees they they're out desperate for employees their job wanted signs everywhere around here\nA wish we had more time to think out loud with Dr phil roe congressman and a candidate again

Gibson who he was the a loan officer for handled all car dealership alone so they would look at the he would look at the customers information\nAnd he would call the lady down at the ... credit bureau which happened to be an upstairs office an on off of main street in Greenville ... and she would go to a card file\nAnd she would pull out that customer and look at all their little loans said yep yep this person pays the bills yeah yeah yeah it looks like everything's good who who calls back\nTells norm are the two or he might call me directly and say yeah we'll buy this guy for thirty six months loaning no more than this\nAnd so that we have to structure the deal to make it happen all of that paper trail is gone then the fax machine came around yeah oh what a revelation that was where I could actually facts the credit that down to them I don't think identity theft was a big deal back then but one of them and so\nIt's going out all over the place of what happens after that what goes into file obviously and all of our finance offices or have keypads on them combination keypads to get it and you can't get him of the key you have to know the code to get in the doors are to remain closed unless somebody sitting in that office\nBecause that's where there's potential that your credit application would be a part of a file and opened up so once the transaction is done signed sealed and delivered you've got your car you're gone the foul goes behind another locked door with a different different pass code combination\nInto our main office where the deal is posted into accounting the\nDeal the transaction is posted into accounting and then that that a file is filed upstairs in another locked room\nThat does have a key ... and there are three case my service manager me in my

let's go he's like had like a total sex change operation when it comes to party a head things locked off I think to become a Democrat\nJoe Scarborough this morning I'm Talking about the president the president has talked about the caravan and MSNBC wants nothing to do with any of that\nAd in the news of the fish cooked up phony caravans story that's promoted by Donald Trump and Fox News\nMay trumped up phony caravans story MSNBC is not covering it right and he's on MSNBC um so they attack the idea that the caravan is even a story President Trump tweeted this morning\nMany gang members and some very bad people are mixed into the caravan heading to our southern border please go back you will not be admitted into the United states unless you go through the legal process\nThis is an invasion of our country and our military is waiting for you well that's pretty blunt for stuff from the president\nAnd a and it's the news media is outrage that the president said that there any bad people because the news media knows from aerial photos that they're nothing but good people in the care of events and that ... brought us with the highest homicide rate on the planet earth\nIn our world and\nAll of the murderers stayed at home I Know I saw it on MSNBC well I didn't really see it on him and so they just didn't talk about it\nSo it didn't happen so it's not true and it's a

mentioned that he's the number one funder of Democrat Party left wing causes that you're an anti Semite this is the new Democratic Party talking point and the news media but I repeat myself\nIf you mentioned Soros and there was a tweet it was Kevin McCarthy\nThe man who may become speaker Kevin McCarthy sent out a tweet and in that tweet Kevin McCarthy the ease that majority leader in the house um he um a maid mentioned before this weekend a George Soros Tom Sawyer and Michael\nBloomberg funding left wing causes now left he said aha all three of these people are Jewish therefore this is another example of anti Semitism and Tom ... father is Jewish but his mother is not Jewish\nSo technically it's not you know legally and the Jewish faith Jewish 'cause his mother's not church\nFurthermore he was raised as a Presbyterian\nNot Jewish as father I I don't know if his practicing a Jew or not but I think not\nIn any case Tom ... was raised as a a Protestant his mother is um a Protestant or you know as a non Jew and a gentile and uh and his father is Jewish but now he's claiming the Jewish victims thing so you can be a victim\nBecause the country is made up of two groups of people\nThe victims and the villains\nAnd the Democrats and the news media gets to decide who are the victims and who are the villains they're they're all the victims every everybody on their side as a victim there for everybody else is the villain because somebody's got to be victimizing here this\nIs why whites in terms of race has become a pejorative in America because of the
