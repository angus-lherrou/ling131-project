{"month": "10", "state": "TN", "station": "WJCW", "content": "Jesus and the disciples took her rest on hillsides somewhere near Ty berries not now ... says oh I guess seven or eight miles southeast of ...\nJesus ask Philip has decided place it fill up where are we going to buy food for all these people\nWill fill up he said a server we're about to be five thousand people and he said to Jesus it would take six months wages to feed people even a bite or two\nAnd they certainly did not have that kinda money well you remember then that Jesus took to five ... and the two fish that belong to a little boy and somehow miraculous they fit all five thousand people and the disciples in the tech says that they actually had all they can eat and plenty left over\nAnd the crowd was so impressed that they try to take Jesus by force and making king over them\nNow you must understand that Jesus fear this attack so much that he ran for his life up into the mountains as soon as it got dark he got into a boat in road eight miles to the other side northwest of ...\nIt's no wonder they tried to making king you know just just sick of it they did not have to do anything except the hungry any fed them I Want you to remember this that Jesus that those people because they were hungry not so that he could do a unique miracle they were hungry he fed\nThe reaction of the crowd was to take over it was as though they are not even see the miracle they only saw the food\nWell even though he slipped away and they found in the next day\nYou know this is where a lesson for today begins then Jesus as when did you come here that mean they asked Jesus when did you come here instead of answering their questions you get right to the heart of the matter he said look you're not looking for me not because you saw the sign the miracle of God but because you ate your fill the food\nThen Jesus literally pleased with him do not work for food parishes but for the food that endures for eternal life which the scent of Maine will give you forty is on him that got the father his city you listen to their response friends what must we do to perform the works of God\nJesus answer them this is the work of God that you believe in him who he has said\nJust now think of what it said remember this is part of the crowd that he had been fed from the five lobes and and the two fish and they had a full doggie bags take home and here's what they said well Jesus what a what signs are you going to give us and so that we may see it and believe you\nKnow you almost want to say come on folks get with a pay attention here you know they even quoted pieces of their own history that was over a thousand years old it quoted the place where Moses and Hebrew people were in the wilderness and they were hungry and they had no food and God sent them a bread like substance called minute\nAnd they want to Jesus to do something else well he didn't do it\nJesus wanted them to believe that he was the one that got had sent from heaven he was not the same as physical food that would perish or the experience of some supernatural act he was the spiritual food that would not only be a means for a return to lie for them he would bring them a whole new way to live life\nYou know I I really had to ask myself what what kind of miracle would have taken for them to bully\nThey'd heard his remarkable teaching they saw sick people healed of lifelong diseases and they witnessed thousands of people being fed with virtually nothing\nMore than that they knew something deep inside of their souls was saying yes but but they were afraid to believe did you notice did you notice that they wanted what they wanted was to be in control\nKeep doing your tricks Jesus and and if we see one that we really like we don't believe you but of course they they weren't ready to be giving their lives too trusting God because you see it would have meant a radical change in their lives\nWhat what kind of a miracle it take for us\nWhat kind of a miracle to take for us to believe that building relationships and not rockets is the way to peace I mean what kind of America will it take for us to believe that world hunger is everyone's responsibility because we're all God's Children in in what kind of a miracle will it take for us to believe that\nPoverty is a spiritual issue long before it's an economic issue you see you\nYou just meet the needs of the crowd simply because they were hungry\nJesus just thinking this Jesus could have said those silly people they knew they would be here all day and they knew that there would be no concession stand out here why didn't they bring some food from their own families it's their problem not mine\nBut you see it was out of his meeting their needs that the miracle came and not the other way around\nI must confess to you that we do live in a world that is already full of unbelievable miracle like phenomena\nIt would be hard for a guy to do something bigger to cause us to believe I'm and I'm sure he could you know we have a tiny machine on the planet Mars it's transmitting pictures and dated back every few hours I mean that was a big thing a few years ago and\nSome people still find it hard to believe that it's true and we can store millions of pieces of information in a small chip about the size of a postage stamp and do delicate brain surgery with a beam of light\nAnd you see today those are only basic things mean much more phenomena is going on right now but\nI think about that and I remember a few years ago I sat on a Sunday afternoon at a kitchen table with amenities eighties\nAnd the brown who's going to be with the lord now but on that afternoon we talked about his children his oldest daughter sixty five years old and whose health was already frail she had fallen from a wheelchair and crushed to hit\nThe doctors fear that she would not make it even through the surgery and she did\nThat on the fourth floor of St Joseph's hospital there she was this other daughter was on the second floor she was sixty years old her lung disease was so severe that she could not breathing passed now\nNot far away his third daughter has been laying in bed at home terminally ill with cancer\nJust before I left we stood out from the table after our conversation we joined hands and prayed his wife Louise took care to to make sure that and that could stand okay he wanted to stand\nYou know I remember in our conversation that we did not mention pictures from the Mars or computer technology or any of those things are the war any of that stuff not even what surgical procedure might be used on his daughter\nOur conversation was about life it was about his love for and the warrior reach daughters and his son in law\nWhen I told him that I Would visit his girls in the hospital that day and trade with him his eyes told me that that mattered more to him than anything else I could have said\nYou see Jesus said to them whoever comes to me will never be hungry and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty I'm In\nNew York\nThank you John wolf John the elderly man in the hospital with all those problems and troubles sixties eyes on life's most important issue to\nThank you where you know thank you for for asking I [noise]\nI think about him and brown and I realize that taught me a lot today because of all of his going on in his life and all that was happening in the world we could have had a long\nConversation about stuff but the things that really matter about life and that's what except in Christ is about it's about life and the security of life in matters center grave importance and\nI just pray that everyone who listens today will it accepted Christ and if you'd had not good friends which just going to help you do that right now\nYes John Deere listener Jesus meets the basic human need he offers human beings transformation regeneration new life\nChange from the inside out [noise] you'll forgive your sins as you give

[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nNoticed that you're seeing more drug ads you would be right\nNow the costs associated with the purchase a pharmaceutical drugs continues to rise everybody knows that and many people are going bankrupt as a result of the people cannot afford necessary and important pharmaceutical drugs they need\nAnd it is one of the major rises in bankruptcy as it relates to people having to deal with the costs associated with their health\nAnd our government is even trying to rein in the escalating cost of drugs because you find the same drugs and other countries they don't they just don't cost as much there are a lot less money and there's been resistance in the area of bringing\nGeneric drugs the marketplace excuse me\nSo why is this why is it that we have to endure those who need pharmaceutical drugs to endure the price gouging the seemingly goes on here in America and you asked\nSuitable companies because they've been asked why is it that you charge so much and they immediately point the finger at rising costs in pharmaceuticals related to the high cost of research and development\nAnd if you look into that if you delve into that\nYou find out that is just absolutely a bald faced lie it's not true\nThe primary cos driving escalating fees with pharmaceutical drugs\nTo a lesser extent is related to research and development to a greater risk extent and in large part it's mostly related to the advertising of these drugs\nThat's where the costs are\nThose costs are being passed on to use the consumer so if you'd be if you believe the big pharmaceutical ally that dished out you may have already suffered brain damage from water more of their toxic products\nAnd so and you don't how President Trump has\nPromised to\nDecrease the costs of pharmaceutical\nDrugs and I believe he absolutely means it however uh the statistics do not bear out that it's working\nYet but we'll see how that pans out\nIn any of it if you\nBelieve or thought that you are seeing more drug commercials over the last few years ago you would be right it's at nausea\nAnd do we as a nation show any\nImprovement in health as a result of it in other words more drugs\nEquates to better health no\nIt's just the opposite of that more drugs\nAnd we continue to statistically be the laughing stock of the world looking at mortality and morbidity rates and the uh it just it just a mess\nSo this is the call to action the takeaway has to do with what can you do and what part of it is your responsibility and taking charge of your health\nAnd doing the things that we all know we should do more of and if we do this consequences of\nThat lack of action that mole age that we think that okay well we can be sort of like at Christmas when you were a child we can be bad boys and bad girls but Santa Claus will still be there in the end to take care of us even if we uh do things we shouldn't\nDo and in the case of health care\nWe think okay so I don't need to exercise I don't need to be well I can smoke cigarettes I can do all these\nAre unhealthy lifestyles and my doctor will take care of me once I break down that sort of the belief system we have and when it comes to chronic diseases a that's a big role of the dice and it's always going to come up you lose in the end\nSo think through that and then find a healthcare practitioner who can help educate you on how to stay healthy both in your physical health\nYour chemical help your spiritual health and your mental health you got to have it all old wisdom\nAnd integrated care functional medicine these are there are plenty of healthcare providers to find that are trained interested ready to go on your behalf\nWill think about\nThat now coming up a little bit later in the program we

have this week's installments of the health alternative of the week health outrage and health ministry of the week\nWe'll get back to our special guest Dr Aimee Sarah and she's a narrow ... narrow psychologist and innovator and the inventor of touch points we'll get back to that conversation in just a little bit first is\nAsk yourself this question is it time for you to stop your beautiful hair from falling out and thinning prematurely if you're starting to see more of your scalp you're noticing more hair on your home and your brush their hair is starting to recede and there is not as beautiful thick and healthy as it used to be\nThat you may be very well interested in something called pro via\n... is a liquid all natural hair thinning treatment from ... that can change a unique

eight hundred five to five six nine one six order today one eight hundred five to five six nine one six for pro via\nAll right let's get back to inventor and chief science officer of touch points doctor Amy Sarah\nShe's a leading narrow psychologist especially in the\nSpecializing in the evaluation prevention a diagnosis of stress and mental and behavioral brain base disorders we're talking about something that's innovative that's helping a lot of people recover from the stress they're under\nAnd that's something called touch points are right back to the interview Dr Sarah let's uh let's see if I you know I Want to see if you can relate to the audience how you figured this out this\nThis touch points situation I have a familiarity with it and I'll share that with the audience the amazing results that one of my grandchildren\nHad with its use in just a little bit but I Want to have you talked to the audience about touch points how it reduces stress and how it works\n[noise] yeah now when I'm treating PTA the I realized you know we should be able to prevent that I'm like a vaccine you have to inject people thing\nUnity can build up over them but I don't need to inject anybody with stress people are going in and out of state to stress all the time what we need to do is restore the body's natural natural\nBalance after a stressful situation or during his strengths will situation and bring them out of it as quickly as possible and they're the network in the brain that if you add a gentle vibration that are non invasive and the touch points it will make a different decision about stress that actually divert\nThe stress response and it does so very quickly so we're getting about Seventy percent reduction and stress and about thirty seconds and this is very important for people not only want to feel calmer\nBut in performance situations we just did a study in athletes in Brazil and found that they were able to stay in Arizona performance and their cortisone levels were actually a lot lower when they were receiving touch points versus a placebo and it is very exciting research that we're going to the publishing soon but that's\nReally important for people\nWho want to not burn themselves out when they're performing at work or if they're athletes or even if they're going about their day if we're stabilizing cortisone the body is not an end in plain state and people can be healthier and better\nI I remember ah when going through both psychiatry and psychology in college\nHow you're really bringing up old stuff that uh I I recall and it reminds me of that you know the component that some people\nIn a stressful situation will either run and get away from it and others will just drop and be consumed some people would do a radio show like this and they\nYou know they faint or their blood pressure would go through the roof and other people would look forward to it they've sort of condition themselves so it's all about our response distress were not taught how to deal with that war growing up we just overreact to it mostly and then wonder how to get out of it\nAnd a lot of people Dr Sharon let's face it use everything from alcohol to cigarettes to marijuana elicit listen drugs to de stress or on wind so\nDescribed to the audience looking at the device the touch points device what it looks like and what they would expect should they attempt to reduce their stress by Seventy percent and who wouldn't want that in thirty seconds everybody has stressed\nYeah go the extra points are\nTwo devices and in order to divert the body's stress response one needs to be worn on each side of the body so they come with risk than than their small square they look sort of like an apple watch and you can wear them on your rent\nIn your pocket and your sock 'em or even hold them in your hand since they work very quickly some people just put them in their hands and then when they feel that er they turn them off and they synchronize with each other so that they're they're written that there is a rhythm\nTo the the gentle vibration and this is what diverts the body's stress response so they're very very easy to where in fact um we have a lot of medical students now speaking of your psychiatry days who are putting them in their socks and keeping them on when they're taking their boards because\nAnd they can handle a lot more in their live\nWell I can think of all the people that may be listening to the show as well as I'm sitting here listening to you how many people\nDo things to try to improve sleep or sleep quality by drugging themselves would with antihistamines Bennett drill and all these ALAN PM drugs where there's something that's non drug non invasive\nThat literally a reorient\nThe person's narrow

know having some other extraordinary problem for which medical drugs don't work or are not indicated and the answer is yes\nI've seen medicinal marijuana help a lot of people there's no denying that\nBut for recreational use\nA it's a total and complete disaster in my mind\nAnd uh oh yeah I have smoked marijuana in the past but it's always been slip stream secondhand marijuana where a while I was attending a concert\nAnd even some of it in an open air concert and there's the skunk ... wafting my direction the stunt or the skill smoke I Can't stand the smell it's bad news so I'm biased but let me report the news to you in a very unbiased way smoking marijuana\nAnd I may boost your stroke risk uh okay so by Fifteen Percent\nCompounds in marijuana may cause blood vessels in the brain to narrow who would want that I Want mine to be wide open not narrow\nSmoking marijuana may boost the risk of having a stroke researchers are suggesting researchers analyzed hospitalizations of more than two million talkers\nOr two million marijuana users between the ages of Eighteen and eighty four I guess that would cover Willie Nelson between the years two thousand ten and two thousand fourteen\nRates of stroke among non marijuana users didn't change however rates among recreational marijuana users jumped by Fifteen Percent that's recreational I guess that would be like maybe weekend talkers\nDonors which usually leads to you know daily uh use which usually leads to about every other our use I've seen it\nOver and over and over there's never enough marijuana eventually for Syria's\nA marijuana users\nSo think about those users of marijuana beyond recreational use what risk are they putting themselves at if their token up every\nHour or two or three times a day\nThe researchers conducted on adults marijuana users and the compounds in marijuana in their studies are showing that the blood vessels in the brain are narrowing and when you have narrow\nBlood vessels in

and uh oh help me with their um been suffering from hormone wearing for about Fifteen Years and it's continuing got or\nAnd where and you're happy and all that hormone Kareem were great uh you know a year at a time but you know are my guests and everyone here we are are\nAre getting close to retirement or or\nOr um gr and we're and I've been a by that may be good to have a real characters who were there and everything but I was wondering if you had any advice on a medication for that I\nThink it's unfair to direct them to get her help you know that's pretty at us right now uh\nWell I'm Sorry sorry to hear that you guys are suffering in this regard of ... an awfully nice to call on her behalf to uh I'm not against talk therapy for depression I Believe in that I also believe that a lot of people who have depression have other areas that they should look into\nNot just you know analyzing hormones which is very important when there's something going on in that area and needs to be fixed and I'm Glad you're under nature pad the care stick with that but you also have to consider there are many things to add to that like for example\nThe diet what are you eating and who's analyzing that are you on a whole foods diet reducing sugar and caffeine and alcohol those things will absolutely derail someone's efforts to shake away from depression\nSo that would be where I Would begin because study after study after study proves that people who imbalanced their body chemistry by using too much refined sugar in the diet junk food too much caffeine alcohol and other adults are rated foods eventually go down hard those same people\nNeed to be exercising on a regular basis in getting regular sunlight just those will often extricate the feelings of depression\nNow I like the fact that you're on your under the care and you're getting hormonal care I Hope that the rest of this side of the equation is being managed as well because if there are those deficiencies\n... whether it be in a certain narrow transmitted Sarah tone and their doping mean or something else you can actually get a blood test to measure this\nThese quantitatively\nA and readjust your levels naturally through supplementation and the problem gets saw but it's usually a combination of things it's never that you know gold and magic bullet pill potion or Potter you looking for one is especially when it comes to depression because depression can be very complicated\nBut stay doing what you're doing and start asking questions don't hesitate to seek out the talk therapy\nUh I'm I'm very much a concern

effort\nAnd um when I arrived an old one I read what did you want to do in Ninety six\nAnd one of the things you wanted to do was you wanted to start a recovery ministry\nWell let me tell you how I learned about a recovery ministry I was up in Richmond, Virginia in February January actually two thousand and one about seven months before I got to ... I was up in Richmond preaching at a church doing a men's retreat\nA friday and Saturday and my host was a guy named Bob Owen who's an attorney up and enrichment played football the University of Richmond big strong guy\nAnd a Bob and pick me up at the airport take ... to the hotel taking me to all the places I'd spoken and on Sunday Morning we went out to breakfast and I'm going to preach in both their services in Bob says I hate to tell you but I won't be there to hear your fridge\nThinking it already turned this guy off after two days it usually takes at least a week for that to happen and um he said I'm not going to be there to hear your preach I said well how come\nHe said I'm going to our recovery service I said what's a recovery surface he said I go to a service our church has because four years ago my fourteen year old son died tragically in a shooting accident\nAnd that place blesses me\nI said I Want to know more\nSo Bob and I spent the afternoon there's an island out in the middle of the James River enrichment I don't know the name of that island but I think it was a civil war prison camp I'm not mistaken and and Bob and I walked around that island that afternoon that Sunday afternoon and he began telling me all about this\nThing called celebrate recovery\nAnd I came to Kingsport\nAnd I met Ron Davis\nAnd run and I started talk\nEnron and had been having that same vision in his mind ever since the church thought about in Nineteen Ninety six and and as we do things here we formed a committee that's a running theme you're going to see throughout\nWe formed a committee and Paul asked the lead it we studied and prayed for a year\nCapable leadership to our recovery ministry for a long time in our recovery ministry like every recovery ministries headed to ups and downs the jak carpenters given really good leadership right now\nAnd we hope to expand\nTo some new areas and the new year but\nIf you volunteer celebrate recovery we call it now recovered replaced Reid if you volunteered if you've taken meals have you been security if you've been a guest\nHost if you've spoken if you've tried I Want you to lift your hand I Want you to see how many folks who participated in our recovery ministry thank you because that continues to bless people\nToday two thousand six we were doing a vision in Africa\nAnd the number one thing that came up out of that decision the effort of the biggest thing the most responses were that we we began a multi purpose ministry so we didn't know what that was going to look like but we knew that's what you believe in God was leading us to do\nSo we put together a team to think about how we're going to put this whole thing together\nAnd ah\nRight smack in the middle of that effort\nI got a phone call from a businessman here in Tempe says or would you like to buy a building that's adjacent to one of your parking lots\nWe had a team worked on things like that I call them and we began\nI called her I consulted up enrichment who was helping us with the visiting us in you know we're talking about this multi purpose ministry centers some guy wants to sell us a piece of property what do you think should we just postpone it two or three vision the eastern you never can tell a God may be in this\nAnd so we bought we called the clay screened properly\nAnd and with skillful help we renovated it\nAnd we turned it into what it is\nWhat are we going to do with this building\nWhat we had a felony and Griffin who was a physician at our church and it says I participate down at Churchill in a free clinic I'd like the first Baptist to see if maybe we can help with a free clinic\nWe did what we did we got a committee together yeah God works through committees here I Hope you see this we've got a committee to gather\nAnd we were making plans an ad comes in one day and says well uh\nI'm going to teach at LSU\nWas when we got to do we don't have a doctor anymore so we met back there in the Sunday school class so that's a conference room right back down the hall we met on a Sunday afternoon and\nAnd we said we got to pray about this we ... we really believe God wants us to do it\nBut we don't have a doctor anymore\nAnd we sat around we prayed and we talked to somebody said we ought to ask Dr Marta like she was a young doctor in our church\nWe don't know maybe she'll do it we don't know\nSaid wow\nBut then we need to somebody to\nKind of put the pieces together\nAnd sharing Cody\nChance that I'll I'll do that\nSo things get up and started we we\nBorrow extensively from the Churchill clinic how to do things and we get started and then shared says well we're moving\nAnd uh what are we going to do well\nYoung lady named van de France steps up says I'll I'll rent a\nFew years later banned and her husband moved Johnson City what are we going to do in the shell Campbell steps up to the plate\nRuns things now here's where I Want to get a little statistical with you\nSo that so you got\nWhat I Want you to see the team\nTwo thousand twelve just six years ago we had a total of six hundred and fifty patient encounters this year we will have\nVery close to fourteen hungry\nAnd we tell you about that\nAbout a year and a half ago we enter data would agreement with wholesome valley hospital\nThe people who are being discharged his patients\nUm if they don't have a family doctor and they can't afford one we've become their family doctor\nAnd we worked out an agreement with the hospital\nAnd we get to care for those ...\nI Want you to see some of the number\nTwo thousand ten we had well providers that doctors and or nurse practitioners today we have forty five\nWe've gone from sixteen nurses to thirty five we have seven hundred and eighty five total patients we have two hundred volunteers those volunteers do everything from a do a eligibility screening to see if the people while fine\nThey do things like a violin they call appointments in they call prescriptions in\nSome framed with people everybody who comes to Providence has to files one is their medical file which is confidential kept in a good place\nAnd the other is their spiritual file where they we we ask everybody there would you like to see somebody as a spiritual counselor in and just a few folks say no but we we keep them as patients we don't turn them away\nBut most of them come in and and we say you know what are you a follower of Jesus you know the lord\nAnd the overwhelming majority do\nWould you like to know\nAnd then we say what can we pray for you about and we keep a file\nSo if somebody came in August and they had these problems how's that going\nIt's somebody praised with him again\nTwo hundred volunteers ... if you've done anything with Providence just lift your hand I Want you to see the number of folks like you\nAnd it continues\nWe're looking at some modifications at the building down there to help things grow even more\nCommon and counseling center\nThis was Ron's dream as well\nAnd a better catch Miller has taken over is giving capable leadership\nCovers it meets\nIn a part of ... some of the numbers from them\nOr two thousand Fifteen three hundred and eighty two clients this year\nAnd let me give you some stories 'cause I ask each of these folks to give us some stories and Beth gave me these are like a couple I Want to highlight
