Tennessee in the nation as a whole a Chevrolet Toyota Nissan has pretty much on that market since the uh the ranger went away in two thousand eleven gosh we trade it for a range or the other day\nThis was a two thousand eleven model ranger only had twenty eight thousand miles on it I mean it's really hard to believe that trucks sold new for around Twenty one thousand dollars it's still worth about Eighteen\nThis is what I mean that's not why people by trucks but trucks are right\nWhen it comes to investments made cars in general are not good investments unless you're talking about one like I'm

couldn't understand why people bottom [laughter]\nBut they did and um they are still out there and and really I guess\nSome people like stuff because you can't kill him\nYou know 'cause they just keep going yeah\nYou know but I don't care if it does keep going there sometimes I'd just soon it die you know and move on because of that and that's one of them but that truck did not and and\nRangers are

wasn't taking out the garbage fast it up and called her the B word in the ... the word that as he is dragging her\nThere's video the son seen the video plenty of corroborating evidence and in case that's not enough a second woman ab Alexander has come forward to say that Keith Ellison also physically abused\nThe Syrian threatened her administer and all kinds of things on the news media and the Democrats but I repeat myself\nCouldn't give a fly in hoot about carrying Monaghan or Amy Alexander or Juanita Broderick core Paula Jones because those are just bimbo ruptures and then oh they care very deeply about the the pixilated confused troubled\nDr Ford and her claim even though she can't remember how she got to the so called party can't remember how she got home from the so called ... nobody else that she says was that the party remembers the so called party her gal pal says that she has no recollection of ever even meeting Brett Kavanaugh\nYou know none of this phase is the news media it's it's a if you take the\nThe um the evidence supporting Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd the evidence supporting Christine Blasey Ford there is a good deal of evidence supporting Brett Kavanaugh and there is no evidence including her father including her mother including her brother's supporting Christine Blasey Ford who is obviously pixilated pixilated\nShe can't remember she came into that came back to the east coast even though she's afraid to fly remember she was afraid to fly\nActually talking about being on the east coast after flying here and now she had to catch another flight up to New Hampshire Vermont or some left wing place and uh and nobody even raises an eyebrow at any of these these glaring inconsistencies\nFrom Boise for it and from her from her legal team of course being paid by Democratic Party apparatus tricks and so on\nThe Washington Times today so now they want to extend other Democrats they said oh yeah one week investigation and as soon as you agree to at the moment you agree to it they say um well that's not nearly enough time where you couldn't possibly and besides the White House which gave the go ahead on friday\nFor the FBI to investigate a and told them on and then with the uh the parameters that the Democrats agreed to which they immediately then are under agreed to they immediately and I mean without\nHesitation they immediately I said no week isn't nearly long enough and the scope needs to be brought in to include okay\nYou know he did a Brett Kavanaugh when he was Fifteen Years old ran a a a group of it was like risky business with Tom Cruise the at a house full of partiers and they had punch bowls that punch punch she said and uh they they apparently put so many ... in this punch\nThat only certain women were passing out say just certain women not everybody at the party with the punch but just one or two women and then Brett Kavanaugh and mark judge there were standing in line waiting to pull the train for a sloppy fourth and fifth nights\nBecause these girls were passed out because there are the only ones that were dumb enough to drink from the punch bowl that was so sick and quaint loads that it made you pass out it was like soup that was like a billion based\nAnd we're supposed to believe this and the news media ... if they pretend to believe it because that's how dishonest they are that's really how how dishonest and how trustworthy they are\nAnd a President Trump has been busy on Twitter as well I'm going to get into some of that this money but some of the histories that these people are coming up with and John Brennan or the communist voter from the bronco Obama's CIA\nWith his attacks on Lindsey Graham and Brett Kavanaugh here's this guy is filthy is just the scum his ...\nAnd I apologize to hacks for comparing hacks to Jon O'Brien and what an awful horrible person this person is and James Comey has friends at the New York times I Wonder if he had the leak um his op ed [laughter] through has a law professor friend in New York\nLike he did the uh the secret memos of the top secret briefing with the president the United states and the FBI Director\nWhich Kobe corrupt lay on illegally\nFunneled to the New York times throws now so I don't think he had the leak his op ed in his op ed he reveals that is just a frosty sort of Bernie Sanders anti Trump Democrat and all this BS about him being a Republican\nWas just that maybe it was at some point but as soon as Trump came along he did like a Joe Scarborough in rent for the hills over these people the Washington Times which is your newspaper of record in Washington DC unlike that rag owned by Dr evil the richest men in the world\n... witnesses stick with stories come up bolstered case for Kavanaugh\nAnd Trump slams Democrats mean and nasty approach\nThat says ah again your newspaper of record on unlike what's the slogan of the Washington Post to get\nIt looks like a newspaper but it's not and the New York times member Eli Watkins she puts out I mean ... is that the Democrats reporters have sex with men on Capitol Hill in exchange\nFor scoops alley Watkins is her name New York Times She's in good standing look her up she's just a she got the hose or award I think from the Canadian\nJournalism association didn't she get the ... word because she's a she's will put out that the the New York times their slogan is we'll put out for scoops\nSex for scoops she would alley walk because she would stand on a street corner in front of the Capitol with a sign says we'll put out for scoops and that's how she got a lot of her scoop\nThe town name or LA right out of the time and and she works hard for the guy can\nThe old fashioned way man in the real old fashioned later on in the world the way [noise]\nWatkins award winning journalist or the New York times and a show and then they promoted or when they found out that she was putting out getting naked and doing stuff you know sex sex in exchange for scoops they've promoted her\nActually brought her up to New York and they lied about it they said oh this is so we can keep an eye on her it's because you found out she puts out like a you know like nobody's business\nSo now she's up there and I should probably working her way up the ladder at the New York times the old fashioned way\nI haven't seen are getting a lot of scoops though since she got called on this uh you know offering up she's she gives a acts of journalistic gratification in exchange for tips\nTo see whether the alley Watkins tip line that's a different that's a different ball of wax altogether and she just gets a free pass from all their pals and the news media because there are all hoping to get laid one day when\nThey run into her at a party or something but I'm guessing\nThe Washington Times reports but I digress the Washington Times reports [noise] key witnesses have renewed their definitive statements that they did not see any of the sexual misconduct that a few women have said they suffered\nAt the hands of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh bolstering his case says the FBI gets into the heart of its investigation\nOr the Washington Post as a completely

vote to confirm confirmed judge Kavanaugh yes of course well that's what I Would expect\nAnd I would come from him too so um [noise] the big lie continues to get bigger\nAnd the Democrats were there a
