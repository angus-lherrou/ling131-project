{"month": "10", "state": "TN", "station": "WJCW", "content": "They had planned for a stopover in some areas they enter the town of ... Jesus heads straight for Jacobs well\nThe disciples are instructed to go into the town for supplies and Jesus sat on the edge of this very deep well Jacobs well probably eighty to a hundred feet deep\nA woman whose name we do not know enters the scene and John skiffs any preliminary conversations that might have happened and gets right to the heart of the matter\nWoman Jesus said give me a drink or a marketable event is about to happen thing in these few words Jesus said give me a drink and then began the longest recorded conversation DeJesus head with anyone in the entire New Testament\nBut now here's why it's so remarkable you remember the Jews were very protective of their denominational and cultural heritage one's family history and family of origin was so critical to any Orthodox Jew now this Americans were Jews who had married or movie outside their race or nationality\nIssue went so deep and as was always passed down through generations the Jews were still very patriarchal and cultural they were a male dominated culture\nNow you have to kind of get this picture Jesus is talking to a woman in broad daylight ride in the middle of the towns gathering place a woman with whom he should never have been speaking\nJohn the writer not only tells us this story he lets us know that this is a very important story because of the setting and the link to this conversation I keep an eye on the screen\nIs there something about to happen here that almost goes unnoticed Jesus said if you knew who you were really talking to you would ask for a living water she didn't understand of course then Jesus confronted her with her own lifestyle she'd had five husbands and the man that she was living with was not even her husband Dan\nAnd finally the conversation is about the messiah\nNow before we get to see a logical to keep in mind that this poor woman was coming to the well at noon because she was not accepted by the other women in town they came at the regular time which was about mid morning\nEvery one who was anyone when at the mid morning time and this woman obviously had a bad reputation and did not fit Jesus came at the noon hour and chose to speak directly to her\nNo good friends I doubt very seriously that she had any thoughts or questions for that matter to meet them aside she didn't know he was coming in but all of a sudden she is in an emotional tailspin\nJust as a conversation really gets interesting the disciples return Jesus they said don't you know who you're talking to why that this American Woman if we get ... caught talking to her why could ruin a reputation while\nThe woman left your water jugs next to the well and literally ran back to her part of Kenya began telling everyone what had happened to her\nCould he be the messiah well everyone seemed less ... and went out to sea Jesus John says many Americans from that city believe in Jesus because of the woman's testimony read that John chapter four versus thirty nine to forty two now that I can tell you that her words were not eloquent or polished\nShe did not have a prepared speech but the effect of what she had said and what happened in her life was life changing to the whole community\nYou know most of us do not realize just how powerful a witness in our lives can be to others how how much what you do can mean to the whole community by my dear friend John Angus my stellar has gone to be with the lord he and his wife even were just so so significant the Judy and me\nBut I tell you his witness lives in the hearts of many many people far more than you can imagine even in his seventies Angus struggled with health problems not I don't recall ever hearing him quoted scripture praying public Hanoi must yeah but I Do know that he rarely miss church\nI Know he was one who prayed a lot and was very serious about his fate\nAngus had a friend named Gene Gene wasn't honest hard working man but she had a terrible addiction problem often gene was out of money are struggling with some family issue on an occasion he would go to jail not for breaking the law but mostly for his protection when his addiction was out of control\nIt early dawn of a summer friday morning genes little house caught on fire by the time the fire department arrived there wasn't much left to say genes whole life\nIt's life savings went up and smoke that morning\nHis meager belongings were reduced to black ashes strewn across the stench of wet burn wood and fabric his daughter and granddaughter who live with him survive the fire but they lost everything too\nI learned that day that there was a lot more that happens to a person who loses everything in a fire than I ever imagined you may know people who've lost everything\nBut it's not only the loss of property there's an enormous emotional loss and I saw a gene looking through those ugly ashes trying to find pictures of these children and some of the personal things that are reminders of important events in our lives\nGene realized that it was all gone closed papers while their classes all melted and made it into kind of a smoldering black\nGene called his friend Angus\nBy noon gene had some close in some money in a place to stay within a few weeks Angus had made sure that his insurance company was on board and and a friend that his he was a contractor was in charge of rebuilding genes home\nWithin Ninety Days ... was able to move back into his home this was the first new home the gene had ever had\nAnd I want you to know out of the grim horror of that fire they came a witness in God's presence that it touched the lives of so many persons without anyone even realizing it\nLate one afternoon I stopped to see how the construction was going just as the insurance adjuster was leaving she called me aside she said ... I've been doing this work for a long time and I've seen many people's lives destroyed because of the laws and and the misuse of insurance money\nThis man has ended up with much more of a home than he ever lost not because of the small insurance claim that because of what has been for him it's like in there because she said do you think Mr Pruitt realizes what's been done for him\nI hesitated and I said no probably he does not but I Do know that he is so grateful but you see then he has a friend named John Angus must Taylor Angus is God's person and Angus for gene what he believed God would have him do\nAnd um you know I saw tears come to her eyes\nAnd I spent a long time since that happened Jean died prematurely as a result of his addiction\nAnd my hunch is that Angus in gene or friends in heaven now too\nBut they witness at what happened is still being told in that community it has been told and ... and on the street corner and you see well he's been told is not what was done but about the spirit in which he was done on the\nUh\nThank you John wolf John God's love in us and through us is a powerful life changing witness as you said it's not what we say but what we do in the spirit of love that tells the true story about our faith [noise]\nYou may say to the poor and desperate to hope all goes well with you I Hope you will be warm and have plenty to eat\nSafe that does not lead to loving deeds is dead the Bible says praise God for the loving deeds and the witness a brother John I guess he was crushed like\nWe see Jesus reflected threw him their listeners give your heart to Christ and be an instrument of his love in this last and suffering world the guilty payer about down with care God gave his son to win\nHis airing child he reconciled and pardon from his [noise] God's love is reaching out to you [noise] don't reject that love and grace God wants to make you rich with eternal riches\nReceived his gift his son given to you and for you lead Jesus come into your heart John Will find though you've got another word share it with us now\nThank you very much you know I think the prayer started in Alcoholics Anonymous goes like this lord grant me the serenity to accept the things that cannot change the courage to change the things that can and the wisdom to know the difference a began in Nineteen thirty five by bill Wilson and Bob Smith that was in Akron, Ohio\nMillions of men and women across the world have been rescued from\nThe tri cities talk radio station am nine ten W.

alcohol and become alcoholics more likely\nTo smoke cigarettes and other drugs just by the exposure early and often to eating sugar or how many bags of Halloween junk sugar will you purchase and

people that responded to it that took umbrage with the concept of\nChildren eating tons of sugar and junk food and being more likely to be violent and abusive alcohol and tobacco\nOne of the uh responders that I'd I'd value it and I certainly encourage the responses\nAnd I won't give her full name her name is Jana she responded by saying\nNot true she didn't believe that there was a connection between even though these researchers went to great lengths to determine it that doesn't mean that every single child\nLeads a lot of junk food I eat sugar and candy are going to be violent are going to be abusive of alcohol and tobacco it just showed a higher propensity in those children who\nWere at risk or susceptible to it through careful observation research and scientific study\nBut Jana\nShe didn't believe that she says not true I smoked and hated sugar ... she was saying she didn't buy into the relationship between eating sugar and smoking cigarettes or violence or alcohol abuse\nMy response back to Jana went like this uh Jana a reminding you that most tobacco\nThat is available today in the form of cigarettes is cured sugar so you know news flash to you you

this televised story and how and why we can actually drive our own uh the Longevity Project\nWell here's the idea of\nMost Americans take a multivitamin and certainly a a supplement your users it's it's a very high in eighty Ninety percent of the studies now the idea was this\nWe know that we've known over the last twelve Thirteen fourteen Fifteen Years as we track the research coming out on\nParticular nutrient any oxygen in spite of nutrients and how they impact the straight delayed the telomeres and so we we felt that my ... my my colleague professor gene Bruno from the Huntington university to help but just the concept was look\nPeople are already taking a multivitamin so\nLet's create a multivitamin that's really choice for a century ... the concept really hasn't changed with the multivitamin over the last eight years eighty plus uses it new ingredients or what have you with the concept of the game it's like a fill in the the the the the the gaps a wellness kind of product\nThis televised is not that we're we're into a whole new area of nutrition ... so we can use nutrients and natural ingredients to impact your chromosomes telomeres DNA so what we did was\nWe were searched out the absolute best\nIngredients would the best research in human clinical research on lately telomeres so we came up with four ingredients and combinations of ingredients that late than your telomeres pack them into a multivitamin into three pills a day three small pills a day\nAnd so the idea is swap out the old school multivitamin\nThis product will deliver it impact\nOn your health and longevity that not only know what the multivitamin has or Ken but any other product that talked about is you know I've been in the life extension games since Nineteen eighty two and I worked with their peers and said to show up\nAnd they're the office or this is a phenomenal bestseller life exposure which launched this whole thing\nAnd we've been looking at and and and I've been attracted to many good ingredients\nThe hotel in real science category is it a major breakthrough we now can actually get in\nAnd reverse the aging of cells and we can document that and we have documented it not not only in the studies that we we based or product formulation on but the studies we've done our product itself we have a publish\n... human study in a peer reviewed scientific journal showing how middle aged and senior of men and women from from forty four to seven eight to an age\nWeight than their telomeres an over all\nFifty six percent ...\nAnd even the ones that are in the late sixties and seventies we're getting a phenomenal lengthening you know so the idea is we can redo or we can turn around much of the damage that we've accumulated through the decades by late

and do and saying and read\nBrings lower your name\nWe pray to Christ or\n\n[noise]\n\n\nYou know [noise] [noise] oh my God oh\nMy God [noise]\n[noise] oh\n[noise]\nOh [noise]\n\n\nOh my God\nOh my God oh my God oh my God [noise]\nOh my oh my [noise]\nOh no no no no [noise]\n\n\n\nAh [noise]\n\nAh [noise]\n\n\nOh\n[noise]\nOh oh oh\n\nOh oh [noise]\n\nJust something about the love of Jesus and now we have a chance you all seem to gather about how the left\nIf you will take your family and number three hundred sixty one my Jesus I let's see I Know now we're seeing if we think\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n\nSo liquid meet what Jesus said in Matthew chapter seven beginning with versed one do not be judged\nOr YouTube will\nBe judged\nFor the same way you judge others you'll be judged and with the same measure you use it to be measured to you\nWhy do you look at the speck of sawdust and your brother's on pay no attention to the point in your own I\nHow can you say to your brother let me take this back out of your eye when all the time there is a plank in your own a\nFirst take the plank out of your own eyes then you will see clearly to remove the suspect from\nSaw when everything to to others what you'd have to do for this sums up the law and the profits American American history used to celebrate he rubs\nBut in our time it seems we do our best to cut them down to size and maybe even destroyed them\nAnd so we've been conditioned to remember our leaders not for their successes before they're frail seasons failures\nThe presidents of my lifetime\nAre probably remembered as much if not more for the things they did wrong and the things they did\nSo John Kennedy is remembered more from Marilyn Monroe then facing down the Russians in Cuba\nLyndon Johnson is remembered more for his failure in Vietnam and his success in bringing helping alleviating poverty Richard Nixon of course is known a whole lot more from Watergate than he is opening the doors to China\nJimmy Carter is remembered by many for the failure in Iran\nMore than his wonderful work\nFor habitat for humanity\nAnd it goes on and on and on someone who's written a critic will always find what he's looking for I Want you to hear that again a critic will always fine what he's looking for and if I put my name's there as the critic I find that\nQuite often true\nDon't do it if you look back at first one is this is not even please don't judge if not maybe you shouldn't judge looking what does this do not judge it's imperative for an English teacher don't do it\nI Want you to know that in Judaism in his day\nIn Judaism his day there were six great virtues\nSix great virtues that were said to bring credit in this world and the next and I want you to see what they were because I think they're instructive as we look at the ministry of Jesus to see how that ministry developed out of\nHis raising and the synagogue so the first one\nThe first great virtue of Judaism was to study\nNow you remember\nWhen Jesus goes home the natural\nHe goes to the synagogue as was his custom\nAny oceans scroll from I say\nIt's a scroll he'd been learning\nAll is law\nOne of the great teachers have his day to study\nWas one of the great opportunities to learn\nAbout the works of God's second\nHospitality sorry visiting\nThe sick now if you if you're listening you're going to know that every one of these echoes in the ministry of Jesus visiting the sick and Matthew twenty five or six thirty one to forty six he tells that amazing parable we called the parable the sheep and goats\nYou remember that we're we're told who really hairy God's kingdom and who will be left out and one of the things is what\nYou cared for me you cared for me when I was\nOr you didn't care for me I'll just\nTo virtues right there followed in the ministry jeeze third one\nNow they didn't have a Hampton Inn and every exit\nSo what you're doing is you're safe if you're traveling from Bethlehem to a\nTraveling Beth I'm Jericho\nYou might ask around you got any cousins in Jericho\nKind of place I can stay\nYou remembered the parable Jesus tells about the power of prayer\nRemember a man knocks on the door at night I've got company showed up I don't have any bread you got any brand I can borrow\nReflected in the life of Jesus\nI Want you to see devotion in prayer\nAnd if you're watching these I Hope you're seeing a every one of them has Jesus just grew up immersed in these virtues of Judaism and reflecting the gospel stiffed\nThe education of children in the law\nThat goes all the way back\nTie them on your or\nPut them on your forehead\nThe teachings scripture and sick this is the one that's a little surprising thinking the best\nQuite often if you ask people outside\nThe fellowship of believers they might think we think the worst of everybody else\nIf you watch some people espousing to be preachers\nThey do more ... than anything else\nBut look at that one of the great virtues that Jesus learn this is one of the things he learned that synagogue in Nazareth\nIs thinking the best\nPeople you noticed how many times he gave people second third and fourth chances he stands by the well in some area placed his folks didn't leave and go and he talks to a woman\nWho is living a life that is so far from God\nBut he sits down and engages ring conversation\nHe tells her everything she ever did\nAnd she leaves that place that day\nWhere the presence\nOf God you see when we start thinking the worst of others we may think we know\nWhat they ought to be doing all the time\nWe become their judges and then taken to an extreme in Islam\nThat becomes tears\nAnd the other person is not a human being they are\nYou see what I mean you see the extent this can go to if we're not careful so what does Jesus said we ought to do about it what does this business about not judging me and I want to give you for ideas the first idea about not judging is this\nWe can't judge because we never know the entirety of another person's life one of the things\nOne of the things that I discovered is how little I Know about\nAnd it's something I Wish\nI Wish I knew more\nI get to know people a lot of times\nWhen I'm sitting down with the family planning a funeral and they'll start telling me tell me about your friend your loved one and they start telling me stories\nWe should have known that\nI Wish I'd known to talk to them about that\nAnd I like to get those you know where I hear most stories\nI go to the hospital to visit and people just start telling their stories\nYou all remember how Miller in our church set right back on the back row back there when house in hospitals the last year Eighteen months of his life I Would make it a habit\nTo go to the hospital the last thing I did\nDuring the day because I wanted to block out an hour to sit and talk to help\nIf you don't know who I'm Talking about he was a great football player Dobbins minute and a great football player at Georgia Tech and he went on to the San Francisco forty niners\nAnd uh he was a gentle giant and if you didn't you didn't know how it was\nAn all American you wouldn't know from talking to him you had to point out of him\nAnd I'd go over and say how\nTell me about Bobby died kings for legend\nCoach at Georgia Tech tell me about Bobby died\nAt a deacon ... who was Bobby dodge backup\nAt UT in Nineteen twenty nine Nineteen thirty in Nineteen thirty one\nTell me up and how would tell me about\nBobby died for Fifteen or twenty minutes tell me about\nTell me about playing for the forty niners\nWhat was that like to play in the NFL\nTo LA one much\nAnd and I don't know if you remember the day of his memorial service if you hear there were pictures right over here Phyllis brought pictures\nAnd there was a picture of him with Bob Hope\nI Hope\nYou're too old to John good we've ideas it was a big guy Bob how", "show_name": "The Chris
