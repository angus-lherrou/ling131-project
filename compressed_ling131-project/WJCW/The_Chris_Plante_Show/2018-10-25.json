a lefty\nThere will act as though it's now a non story now it's not a terrorist attack now it's nothing now ... you know I I don't know what he was the false flag thing but that they won't view it that way they will just say that now it's a non story now it's not what we thought it was now it's not really a terrorist attack\nIt was just a scare I Know start using different words to describe it again in the New York times and the New York post not on the same page generally both saying based on sources that these devices don't look like they could be detonated under any circumstances that's\nFrom the gyms motorcycle sales studio this or W J cw Johnson City kinks were Bristol accumulation gyms motorcycle sales on the motorcycle mile west markets re Johnson's any\n\nSpecial report

de Blasio responds after the NYPD bomb squad contained a suspicious package address to actor Robert De Niro but the latest in a string of delivery center prominent Democratic Party officials and supporters is that of a package address to former vice president Joe Biden\nOf notice how that package was stopped by postal authorities\nIt appears that there was not enough postage on the on the on the package and so therefore\nIt was return to sender affairs correspondent Evan ... the FBI says the packages have banned potentially destructive devices yes I Do suspect they will be more of an her Cuomo of New York says the mail bombs were capable of detonation\nBut I've been around a lot of bombs I've been around you know real bombs and a homemade bombs had been around bombs that go on airplanes and I've ah ah on aircraft carriers loading bombs in and out Airforce bases voting bombs on B. fifty twos and\nI've been around a lot of bombs I was in northern Russia one time at the\nSoviet slash Russian submarine base et cetera ...\nA standing in front of the nose cones of of retiring nuclear warheads for the I was under the start agreement\nAnd I'll let me tell you something if you've got something sitting on the table in front of you that's full of gunpowder it's not really dangerous unless there's a detonator there to blow up the gunpowder that it becomes dangerous without a detonator or it's not really dangerous it's inert it's black powder and it is in Newark\nFortunately the rice ... just days ago or the white powder turned out to be a ... black powder inert white powder inert targets last time around\nA president of the United states secretary of defense chief of naval operations CIA director we had Senator Susan Collins we had Senator Marco Rubio\nA last year we had members of the Trump family with the white powder news media treated all of that basically like it's nothing then of course we had James Hodgkinson who was a Bernie Sanders volunteer Bernie Sanders irregular who shot Congressman Steve Scalise\nThe Bernie Sanders volunteer was a huge Rachel Maddow fan MSNBC fan that's where he got his rhetoric he was a big fan of the Southern Poverty Law Center which is America's leading terrorist organization and hate group they're tied the more terrorists than oh just about any group\nBut they're Bernie Sanders volunteer went out onto the baseball field\nStarted up his activity because he was that was a terrorist attack was an attempt to mask political assassinations news media dropped it after about thirty six hours as kind of a non story why would that\nBe a story that's not a big thing and and now the news media boy that whole it was said it's a threat to the freedom of the press know the press is a threat to freedom of the press the biggest threat we have the freedom of the press in the United states of America is in fact the press it really genuinely is\nAnd what we know about the mail bombs again the evidence um\nDoes say a a right wing Unabomber living up in the mountains put together these nine devices that last jak a Robert Deniro got one this morning at his place in New York kept the tri Becca grill\nAnd it was caught and and interestingly enough it was apparently received there at one of ... Robert De Niro you know he's an actor and he says beep from ... like the pump punch Trump in the face and and all this stuff so uh we're supposed to believe that some\nSome right wing hillbilly making bombs which aren't designed to go off\nI hated Robert De Niro so much that I sent one to Robert De Niro in his restaurant\nIn New York where he also has a I happened to go to a birthday party at the Tribeca Grill ah last January\nAnd a private room upstairs and there's a theater there and and all this stuff and it's very deniro right but who cares sees that beep Trump if you're going to go down you know that far down the ladder whereas Kathy Griffin wears a\nA Saturday Night live produce whereas Alec Baldwin wears a ... and they all want their they all want bombs to come to them\nBecause now it's a it's a thing it's\nA feel left out at MSNBC is obviously feeling very left out this morning that they didn't get one of these apparently ... devices\nBecause it'll be a badge of honor for life\nOh it was the victim of a terrorist attack that took they'll say they'll say things like that or we were vaccinated and by the way the ... in New York the overreaction to the mail room incident at\nAt a Time Warner tower and Columbus Circle in Manhattan was extraordinary they cleared out an area that would be appropriate for a small thermonuclear device\nNow get back get back I mean again it's a pipe bomb if it went off in a car or if you were in the car behind that you'd be fine but make clear it out shutting down Central Park west and Columbus Circle and that it looked like it was September eleventh and and Andrew Cuomo the den where to go better of New York is that there say\nOh we do terrorists to change our way of life or we're going to put National Guard at the tunnels\nBecause this is an invading army apparently coming now ah and and I'm a marveling at the absurdity of it all and\nAnd he wanted one uh Andrew Cuomo wanted me he desperately wanted a device so he claimed yesterday oh we got one in our place we got one we got one where we're in with the in crowd and then an hour later ah the plays given all clear there was nothing there was nothing there was it wasn't on anything of the ... or a newspaper in San Diego\nEvacuated their offices because they said they had a suspicious now this happens a lot everybody starts panicking because everybody's a little girl in America and two thousand Eighteen\nSo they evacuated the building because somebody saw package you know and there was nothing and uh so they all went back to work but a lot of hysteria yesterday there were more incidents as well of these false alarms false alarms public panic\nAnd uh and all of that\nAnd and the I honestly it's it's it's gonna be like oh you didn't get one we got one\nWe're cooler than you because we got one\nEspecially when you learn they're all ... now they're at a at MSNBC instead they're saying oh it's like nine eleven [laughter] they were treating it yesterday the reaction was like I I was waiting for Time Warner center to fall to the ground oh no it's nine eleven all over again as the buildings are going to collapse because somebody got a thing that would blow up a car\nI honestly it was a the the overreaction has been a shorter and then once you learn as the New York times on the New York post both have\nThrough their sources in New York law enforcement and so on\nThe devices are not actually designed to detonate they don't have the requisite\nParts the ... if you will that would allow the devices to detonate and when I was looking up at the ... the um yesterday I get texting with my friends and and with my friends at work here as well so well how are they going to detonate how are they going to whether they on a time so the timers so they're going to go off in the mail room how does that\nThey the package already been opened a and the pictures that I saw so they weren't designed to go off when you open the package so when we're these exactly when exactly where there's going to go off\nAnd and now the New York times and the washing the New York post excuse me\nThe New York times and the New York post both saying based on sources\nThat these look like fake devices and uh and uh between the two of them there is no blasting cat there is no detonator there's no electronic detonator there's a red wire and a black wire there's occupied the clock boys digital clock in there because they saw on TV and they made a a a plastic tube pipe bomb which is fine that would work\nIf you had the right detonator and all of that\nBut it looks like they're ... they're just scares right\nAnd whoever sent them got the big American flags stamps and stuck him all over the place even though they were going to be delivered by courier why would you do that\nWhy would you do that with a writer you do that\nWith a righty misspell Florida when he printed up the mailing receipt on his computer and not notice that the computer was saying hey you're misspelling Florida with the reds quickly line ah okay that's possible it's possible that some right wing Unabomber is really really dumb\nAnd a smart enough to build these devices without blasting caps and detonate or\nButton dumb enough to misspelled Debbie was mentioned it's his name just misspelled a Schultz misspelled Brennan that's not a real hard one to spell and misspelled Florida you're computer will catch on that and so these all went through the the giants stamps that and then I honestly the the biggest clue\nIs that every package has the return address of Debbie was a man Schmitz of Debbie Wasserman Schultz who hasn't been in the public eye for months so that's a big clue why her\nWho is angry with her Bernie Sanders people are angry with her that she was angry with her\nThe Republicans aren't angry with a right wing or is it living cabins on mountainsides aren't sitting there stewing about Debbie was mentioning is that ain't happening I and if you look at who's included on who was excluded Robert De Niro gets one but Alec Baldwin doesn't get when I I mean look there could be more in the pipeline of course so to speak\nOr there could be lots more but now we kind of know that um\nNew York times reporting of the New York post reporting that these things were never going to explode there were never going to go off\nSo now we're dealing with a person who is so stupid that they built these bombs that are incapable of going off or somebody who was never really planning on causing any harm to anyone but wanted to create this panic and this news media\nThing on an interesting way on the lead up to the mid term elections which the Democrats have said are so important\nWhile there is a big debate about civility and who's aside as more violent and obviously it's the left\nI mean throughout my lifetime the left has been blowing things up the the Unabomber was a radical left wing environment\nThis academic want to be and uh the weather underground rock Obama launched his political career in the living room of William Arizona Bernard indoor and they blew up government buildings were bombs on police headquarters in New York and uh and on and on\nThe STDs or the Puerto Rican and you know FDR now or whatever they were a blowing up Congress and blowing up things all left wing or left wing mad bombers all over the place from

hearts that's how you murder a hundred\nMillion people as you you start you're just begin with Haiti and your heart and murder and you start thinking about all the people you'd kill and then eventually they get around to it and the New York Times Book review while they lecture us about civility they had this a woman's always somebody type up a story for the party\nAnd in the story or Russian is about to assassinate President Trump with a gun and his gun miss fires\nAnd uh and the secret service agent right next to the president then pulls out his go walk and hands at but first to the Russian assassin and says here use mine these are the kind of fantasy is that the left has about murdering presidents of the United states not rush hour of North Korea but over the United states they hate\nIt's all about the hate well I've got a text from a friend of mine Secret Service run and he said Hi that's funny\nWe don't use blocks\n[laughter] do which I responded yeah well it's the

insane\nI'm now if you need to let him for whatever reason depression or your emotions are wacky then by all means you know take a little bit yourself I don't think it's a terrible thing or anything like that could take a little yourself but the idea that these mental cases not want to inflict this upon the whole country because they've got issues\nAnd one of the things I've learned through all of this since the uh Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing and Christine Ford\nChristine Blasey Ford is that apparently half the country's in therapy [laughter] I'm not because I get to come here and do this and when I Walk out here I go [noise]\nUh as good as I Know have a turkey sandwich perhaps a little trip defense well let's go with a lot of oh we've got a we've also got this Jim\nCarrey you

standard\nActor turned cartoon as Jim Carrey is trying to place the blame for wave of attempted bombings they're probably not actually attempted bombing of all the bombs are capable of going off\nWhich included devices center former President Obama and the Clintons squarely on Donald Trump\nAnd his latest piece of political satire is that what it is\nKerry has posted a cartoon on Twitter of Trump's mouth wrapped around a pipe bomb once again they've got murder in their hearts don't they just like the New York times they want to shoot the president of the United states and they had not North Korea they want to murder the present and this is normal and this was in the aftermath of these pipe bomb things\nEr which were either sent by a righty or buy a lefty or by the Russians one one

responsible they always blame their political enemies no matter what happens\nThe people are ... while there wasn't his fault it was somebody else's fault and they go forward from there it was a communist he killed Kennedy by shooting them in the head because he's a communist and he hated\nEverything American and loved Castro and Cuba and the Soviet Union and his comedy wife marina wasn't her fault she's a and he's still got kids you know there's that Lee Harvey Oswald still has kids living in in the United states America yeah get what he was before he was killed he had kids\nIt was harder
