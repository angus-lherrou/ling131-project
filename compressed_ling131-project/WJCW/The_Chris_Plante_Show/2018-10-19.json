and giving to the rich because they've redistributed wealth to the point of absurdity\nAnd finally a John Cleese Robin Hood looks at the camera and says this redistribution of wealth things more

but interestingly they give themselves they give the Washington Post three Pinocchios\nNow if they they great on a curve it shouldn't be four\nBut he admits that in the news reporting on the DNA test was a complete joke\nAnd in the end he circles back and says but it's still shows that she's part Indian and what she's always claimed as true so it it again it makes no sense they he spends four pages saying everything we wrote about it was wrong\nEverything the Boston Globe wrote about it was wrong everything the RMC set about it was wrong although all they did was referring to in New York Times article and the New York times article made a point that the Washington Post now says is wrong because they'll sacrifice than New York times when they're defending Elizabeth Warren\nHe'd types

way ahead you know you can't tell what what we're headed into by looking at the street\nJust like when you first talked about violence in the streets there was not right but we could see it coming

their investigation which I'm sure they're working to work out as a detailed a cover story to sell to the world\nPresident Trump said yesterday he threatened is very severe consequence consequences that is if Saudi Arabia is found to have killed the man new details from the Pentagon suggests just how closely in American General was caught up in a firefight in Afghanistan yesterday here's Barbara starring role\nHe's they're dealing with truck now so now they're they're starting to some of them and secretary of state Mike Pompeo pale just back from his travels to Saudi Arabia and turkey dealing with a that ... thing and and that's a that's to show the thing that's where this or walking Castro guy is going\nUp but the secretary of state Mike Pompeo is headed down to Mexico City\nWhich in Mexico is just called Mexico in the country is called Mexico the city is called Mexico we call it Mexico City in Mexico they call it Mexico that's it's like in New York and then you've got the city of New York we call it New York city but it's actually New York also kind of sort of\nBut that event the president is taking action there the president last night in Missoula, Montana went after the Democrats went after the government's down they're making it perfectly clear that he's not going to put up for this beep and I'm a like a like the previous beep president did and uh so we got that going for us because Trump\nDoesn't play around you know what I mean and he's on our side unlike ...\nGuy and then the or could show you stuff or is it hooked she'll go Ho Chi chi chi because CNN has come up with a variety of different pronunciations\nAnd they're an embarrassment do we have the or do we have the walking Castro stuff because I Want to get to that Joaquin Castro stuff\nWe just found that moments ago under a rallying to ah bring it to you also while we're talking about Mexico here's and the caravan while you might want to have a border here's a here's the thing while you might want to have a border\nWhen it comes to our neighbors to the south merry old ... here's the headline out of Acapulco\nBodies lying popular ... late ... beach in Mexico bizarre footage has emerged of tourists relaxing at the beach in a popular resort town just meters away from bullet written\nBodies are warning graphic at says warning graphic and sure enough here's this picture and there's a beach and I've been down here I've been to Acapulco and I had some interesting experiences there and my own self worth my best girl\nIt's studying resort town once frequented by the rich and famous champagne wishes and caviar dreams\nBut these days it's become the scene of unimaginable horror time and time again the latest incident sought to men murdered on college sub beach in Mexico's Acapulco origin\nBut such scenes of bloodshed are becoming so mundane here that tourists barely bandit in Iowa lead\nSure some beachgoers initially ran for their lives when the gunshots rang out but it wasn't long before they went on with their leisure activities summer even filmed dining at the beach side restaurant while the bodies lay just meters away\nWith the bizarre scenes caught on camera by the local sites el sold day Acapulco\nThe footage shows\nThe crime scene being cordoned off by investigators that that yellow police tape like we have\nWith tourists scene relaxing in the background and sure enough there the chairs and umbrellas and they're like hey guards are not enough do smile is Margaret readers for for for and um and they're just sitting there and there are two dead bodies all shut up\nAnd I'm not kidding you you could throw a gallon of milk that far or they're they're like twelve feet away and people are just sitting there in their lounge chairs on the beach\nWith the shot up dead bodies a few feet away the police that they've got investigators and people are just sitting on the beach few feet away because\nYou know why would that be a problem that shouldn't be a problem at all\nAnd they have a really fun they put out a tip she how to stay safe in Mexico it's very lengthy it's a very lengthy do not accept food drink gum or cigarettes from New acquaintances\nOh they they could be like Bill Cosby or\nSomething like that could be like that are so there you know why would we have a border why would we have border security the president's talking about setting the military down to the border\nAnd they are rattling Mexico's cage and making it clear in no uncertain terms and the president has put the new renegotiated NAFTA back on the table remember when the media said he couldn't renegotiate it and the Democrats said he couldn't renegotiate it oh it's a treaty we couldn't possibly be renegotiated\nFirst with Mexico painting little Trudeau into a corner and little Trudeau had to come around to President Trump's way of thinking and then he renegotiated with them at NAFTA is all new and renegotiate it and it's not even after anymore\nNow it's the U.S MCA the U.S Mexico Canada agreement and uh and he renegotiated now he's thrown it back on the table again like pump\nAnd are just there it is whipping out NAFTA again slapping it down on the table and he sold Mexico you really want to open this can of worms or do you want to stop this convoy from coming to the United states this caravan it's the caravan\nUm ...\nIt's caravan and uh the president is ah is taking a different approach than rock Obama and the Democrats\nWere taking I think it would be fair to say and I'll uh I'll get into that also and the next couple of hours a remarkable stuff out of out of the uh the apparent killing of ... as well who keep in mind was a pile of Osama bin Laden was on a ... of the Muslim Brotherhood ensure real law\nNot that the Washington Post is going to talk about that because he typed up a few articles for them\n[noise] one of the Fifteen\nMember hit squad as there are being called\nDied in a in an unusual car accident yesterday and Saudi Arabia and that has raised some suspicions\nWhether he might not be the last whether it might be like ten little Indians are missing marble train ride or something like that ah but will love will get into that too is that this guy died in a mysterious\nCrashed it might have been suicide\nAnd again that might not have been well let's go to a walking Castro Joaquin Castro is a Democrat member of the house of representatives\nHe's he's in the in the United States House of representatives here in Washington DC in the capital you know over there whether Democrats name that building after the racist segregationist Richard Russell and they love working in there because that's who they are\nRepresentative Joaquin Castro floats conspiracy theory\nThat Jared Kushner\nYou know the president's son in law gave a Saudi prince and you know as a mom had been a ... a hit list with ... name on it they went on CNN this is CNN that this is CNN they\nInvited this ... this joke of a human being this fraud this this person who should literally and I'm not even embellishing he should\nBe expelled from Congress for this outrageous scoreless slanderous filth that he's peddling and now let's play it so the nice people can uh enjoy along with us\nIt was on the television with with a puppy Harlow poppy Harlow\nThat's her porn name that she thought she was going into porn but she ended up on CNN kind of a strange turn of events that are first well I think well we had a little a little dog named poppy when I was a little girl when we were living on Harlow avenue\nAnd are they going to make a puppy Harlem\nAnd puppy hello was on with Joaquin Castro the Democrats and listen to this outrageous claim that he threw out and even poppy Harlow with her porn name was shocked\nShocked I say by what the congressman said he's a Democrat ... he's in the I think he was like in the leadership Disney he's the head of the I Am an oppressed minority cock his I think something like that walk in tax the Castro democratic member of the house of representatives\nI Know that there's been a lot of discussion about that they'll be more discussion on CNN and all the other networks today [noise] let me get to the point that I think is most disturbing right now the reporting that Jared Kushner may have with U.S intelligence delivered a hit list an enemies list to the crown prince the NBA or in Saudi Arabia\nAnd that the print then may have acted on that\nAnd one of the people that he took action again\nI took a soldier getting kicked out and we have to find me there\nFound me or we do not have that reporting I'm not sure where you're\nGetting there hadn't been recording to that effect\nOr not I according to that effect\nHe's seen reporting today he can he doesn't know where it is he can't say we're any pronounce his name he mispronounce his name ... she or something that's because probably CNN was mispronouncing it form their reporters and anchors mispronounce it too because they're idiots\nNow what he just said was he said I I I I let me get to the point that I think is most disturbing right now\nThey're reporting there is no reporting\nThat Jared Kushner the son in law of the president or the United states may have with U.S intelligence there's a vast conspiracy that is showing here\nDelivered a hit list is that like Rocco bombers disposition matrix because you're a guy

Kennedy and the grass or you know daily plaza that day Nineteen sixty three in Dallas texas\nApproved good it's not true you got ... where where was he showed me as calendars from Nineteen sixty three\nShow me throw the daily mail had a piece in April and the piece in April and the daily mail said claimed that Jared Kushner and by the way it was denied by Jared Kushner that Jared Kushner showed up in Saudi Arabia and shared intelligence with perhaps print so much fun\nAnd the Saudi Government\nNow we share intelligence with the Saudis all the time\nAnd when you share intelligence with people it's about their enemies not about their friends it's about things that they should be concerned about\nAnd the Saudis have many enemies al ... is a sworn enemy the Muslim Brotherhood is a sworn enemy a I'm a ... lifelong member of the Muslim Brotherhood and a longtime friend of Osama bin Laden himself going back to many decades ago\nWhen they were quite young but they stayed friends like Osama bin Laden and the head of all ... the master of the September eleventh attacks ... was a close friend of his that I mentioned that that is a close friend of Osama bin Laden because he was a lot\nFront of Osama bin Laden\nAnd uh and what the daily mail peace says is that I'm Jared Kushner came he shared intelligence U.S intelligence with the Saudis are naturally that would include intelligence about things that men is them\nBecause we're doing them a favor doing them a solid so that they in turn do salads for us do favors for us maintain the bulwark as they say against the uh the Iranians across the Arabian Gulf or the Persian Gulf depending on which side of the Gulf that you're on the biggest threat to\nCivilization may in fact be a nuclear armed armed Iran which Brock Obama Brock Hussein Obama actually helped facilitate with that ... neck deal\nRather than keeping them from getting an arsenal of nuclear weapons it ensures that they'll get an arsenal of nuclear weapons and in the meantime here's a hundred billion dollars so that you don't do it while I'm president\nAnd you can keep working on your ballistic missile program with the death to America nose cones on them and the depths of the Jews nose count you go ahead and keep working on that we wouldn't want to restrict you in that regard in anyway so you just continue with your\nYour program so it's apparently a a Joaquin Castro has some little weasel sharp tooth whistle working for his left us cause\nThat found that daily mail piece that suggested a kind of vaguely I might add in terms of the reporting that Jared Kushner shared intelligence with the Saudis\nNow why Jared Kushner\nWe share intelligence with the Saudis all the time we have military people person permanently stationed in Saudi Arabia\nSaudi Arabia has military people permanently stationed here they have an embassy had an ambassador who is a very high ranking ambassador in the Washington press corps by the way or the Washington or excuse me diplomatic corps\nA very high ranking very serious person and one of the great mansions in the region as you might imagine for the Saudi ambassador living it's really something on the Potomac River big gates guard towers you know it's it's crazy but in any event\nWe share intelligence with them now walking Castro just as we do with Israel just as we do with Jordan on occasion\nAnd with other allies around the world that's what we do and uh so there's this tabloid the story from April that says that Jared Kushner is there and shared intelligence and then because they want to sound like they're in the no the article says intelligence\nAbout their enemies as opposed to dinner\nWhy would you share intelligence about dinner or deals you might get on key our automobiles now obviously when you share intelligence it's about\nThings that might be an issue with them that's what intelligence is for chess by the way that ... shirt so he has taken that simple
