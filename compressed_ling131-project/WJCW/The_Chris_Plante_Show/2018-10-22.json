D. power for premium cars it's even worse\nAbout fourteen percent for light trucks it's about nine point seven percent of the sticker so in other words\nFourteen percent of the sticker price is or\nIsn't the incentives are fourteen percent of the sticker price so that in itself as a discount and then you've got the dealer margin\nWhy lawmakers are could keep spending to retain customers um according to Mr banks um that is not sustainable\nAre we all saw what happened when manufacturers tried to give money away to sell vehicles and they end up going bankrupt so what are the auto makers today will mark Benet who's Ford Motor company vice president of us marketing and sales\nSet this month that Ford is using data for more targeted\nIncentive deliberate uh while Ford has offered zero percent financing on a variety of vehicles for most of two thousand Eighteen\nWith interest rates rising it's just more expensive to do some house a Nissan also which is a tradition of offering some of the industry's most Christ competitive bottles as closely watching for signs of consumers\nAre grappling with affordability a transaction prices are up\nAnd payments are going up\nAnd that's not a good sign for\nFor consumers so you really have to shop around more are the only other place to give is we're like we're talking about the very outset dealer margin\nYou know it this was going to put a lot of pressure on car dealers to be able to hold a profit\nOn cars so you know there's is there are several ways to get a cat when you're a consumer and you're going to have to be even more frugal and more watchful dealing with people that you know and trust\nOr when it comes to buy a car or you could easily get manipulated by aggressive overly aggressive sales person or hurt dealership so anyway we'll take our first break can be back here and just a minute\nReason we invented things like the same day delivery and TV and Jay in the same jar we lost convenient which is what makes sense

Kaiser Permanente together we try to keep the Ukrainian conditions when ... when when you listen to\nOn this Monday edition of my car guru I noticed over the weekend watching TV the way I did that

weekend built so we're proud\nSo you know um marketing\nMystery and a lot of ways what works um you know\nDo I want to buy a Ford product because\nUm it was built for proud\nEven if it was built in Ontario, Canada I don't know ...\nWherever whatever place in Mexico where a lot of them are built built for crap\nIn Fort built scrape products are not everybody does though you know I mean it it's really hard to buy a bad car\nToday it's a you know I think it's not that people buy bad cars is that people make that decision buying cars and um\nThey go into it like they're buying a refrigerator or some type of clients\nSo many of them these days I'm emotional purchases are are usually\nBad purchases when ... when somebody wants something or by something um because of a fleeting emotion excitement for example mount a Mustang when really you don't need a ... you don't need it to ... or a car you need a Ford or car\nUh people can live to regret decisions like that and then they try to trade\nWithin a fairly short period of time and\nThey find out that the cars appreciate it more than what they owe on it and we get in that situation what you're talking about earlier\nSo it's better to slow down as I said I'm sitting in the aquarium\nA gateway the ah Internet reception center and uh looking outside the window and their sits a Nissan Frontier\nNow the Nissan Frontier is a\nI guess

honestly there are the Associated Press I saw the pictures and I was like well I Want to double and triple check that they're really burning the American flag and spray painting swastikas on it and sure enough in Honduras\nAnd I don't think they're part of the actual Caribbean itself but\nPeople supporting the Caribbean or a burning the American flag in Honduras and spray painting swastikas on it and that's because they're looking to win friends and influence people in America\nFunny thing is that the Democrats love that they burned flags and spray paid swastikas on it too they carry flags of other nations to remember at the Democratic national convention where they nominated Hillary Clinton to be the loser loser\nAh they forgot to bring any American flags murder they uh they this is true I'm not making this up\nThe day one of the Democratic national convention there wasn't that American flag in\nThe hall not one nowhere\nNo button thing nothing for the pledge of allegiance because they don't do the pledge of allegiance they just condemn Israel and Jesus and the Bible and then get on with their Planned Parenthood business and the Oregon harvest things like that\nBut they literally had no American flags and it was pointed out it might have been the Daily Caller that first pointed out it might have been Vince calling as a first pointed out that there were no flags\n'cause sometimes it's it's more difficult to notice the things that aren't there rather than the things that are there it's a it's an old a detective thing\nBut there were a new American flags that the Democratic national convention until stories were written about it and then you know what they did they went over to where it was a Philadelphia right\nThey went over to Philadelphia city hall and they took down all the bunting from the building I Believe this is actually true and brought it over to the convention hall so they had the oh I Can't believe we forgot that we're supposed to pretend that we liked in this country for a couple of days so\nThey went and got a couple of 'em a American flag bunting strings from city hall and dragged him over while somebody wrestled up an American flag from have probably had to fly it in because the [laughter]\nThe Democrats in the hall they did there were a full size giant flags you know six foot flags of Mexico and the Palestinian flag which is not really a country at all\nAnd uh but the Democrats had they had Palestine that everything but the ISIS flag inside the conventional but no American flex so these guys at least have American flags sure they're burning them you know after a spray painting swastikas on them\nBut but that is what Democrats do that that movie the American president with a\nA Michael Douglas and Annette Benning one of the big themes that movie is that the Democrat liberal liberal Democrat president Michael Douglas\nHis girlfriend wasn't enough bending it was Annette Benning I think um she was a famous lefty or advocate in Washington and pictures emerged verb burning the American flag and the movie I think it's a Rob Reiner movie uh turned the burning of the American flag into a celebration of the burning of the American flag\nBecause you know they don't they never met anybody who served in the military\nAnd they don't know anything about anything they're just sort of but these are the people that are coming and they're burning the American flag I think to put themselves in good with the Democrats just in case the Democrats are wondering whether these are the people they weren't coming to our country they're burning the American flag and spray painting swastikas on it\nTo prove that they are the kind of people that the Democrats are looking for [laughter]\nThat was that the Democratic convention in Philadelphia where a Democrat man\nSort of wearing a dress\nCaught on fire while dancing on the American flag but they were burning at the Democratic convention where they forgot to bring American flags not\nA problem why would that be an issue\n[noise] a\nBoy oh boy oh boy and of course we have a ... G and uh and we have this this woman is just as dumb as Iraq\nThis uh Alexandria Ocasio Cortez says that fighting global warming is just like fighting the Nazis that we have to just like fighting the Nazis it's very funny and we have an audio of this really didn't witted woman she is she is dumb she's let's just go out and said\nI Believe the woman she's dumb every time she talk she proves that she's a dummy\nAnd uh she was at a public event with a microphone talking serious about how um you know global warming is just like the Nazis Ben Shapiro humorous leach waited I don't have it in front of me or I don't think bombing the Germans will do any good something like that\nBut we are going to bomb the Germans over global warming\nRight we're going to invade Normandy to change though whether it is people are there are mental cases they've all that it's a coalition of mental cases and they called themselves the Democratic party\nWe have that will be getting to that this morning as well and of course cuts showed G G and and um and people on immigration we have the um [noise]\nWe have the caravan headed our way and I mentioned the uh the headline I Believe a little bit earlier [noise]\nMan deported six times charged in California homeless killings\nWell what's the problem with that well the Democrats like this open door policy you deport somebody's six times they just keep walking back in\nOut of Los Angeles the Associated Press from September twenty six\nWhich is less than one month ago a man who was supported six times and is now suspected in a string of killings and beatings\nThat targeted sleeping homeless people in Southern California was charged Wednesday Wednesday with murder attempted murder robbery and um or various other crimes authorities say suspected Ramon Albert though Escobar\nHad a long criminal record in the U.

confront and harass everybody it's the Democratic party they really want a civil war\nAnd I I just I'm I marvel at they're whining and complaining now what exactly is wrong in the United states right now other than you rep rebates\nThat the economy is and ... go it's just smashing records all over the place\nRecord low unemployment rates for black people what's the government's supposed to do for black people or you have the Democrats are supposed to throw other people's money at them and apologize for something happened to somebody else centuries ago at the hands of people that died centuries ago thanks for that you know you're like Bosnian Serbs at this point\nThe Democrat Party look at a pick fights from the battle of the field of black birds centuries ago mental cases that they are\nAnd I'm a\nWar and peace how we do it on one piece\nNorth Korea was fire again a record low Hispanic unemployment black unemployment right near record ... or low overall employment right or the women unemployment rate a decades long the economy is steam and it's women were really not in in a you know ISIS has been smashed we haven't had a radical Islamic terrorist attack\nHere or for that matter in Europe have you noticed is the number of attacks has really dropped off a cliff\nBy the truckload diets and in large part because Brock Obama send them food and and a ... or something and they murdered and committed genocides and he golf with his buddies from ESPN and didn't lifted a finger to do anything about the rapes and the setting people on fire and the slavery and\nAnd all that block Obama didn't do squat\nPresident Trump came in spoke to the military they said well we know how to do it Obama just tied our hands to our ankles so we couldn't do anything except you know want one and um and President Trump came in and and Secretary Mattis\nAnd do the joint chiefs and the various commands and they just might have had\nFrog with diets of ISIS\nOut of Iraq ... might have them in Syria there are still some triglycerides and Syria of course but they had spread to like twenty four countries or something under Barack Obama and are now they've been pretty well crushed so how's President Trump doing on the radical Islamic terrorism from\nThe Democrats are upset that you call it radical Islamic terrorism\nThat's what really hurts them ah North Korea was firing missiles over Japan and Guam and and terrorizing the people of Hawaii well really that was a Democrat but terrorized the people in Hawaii with the tweet about the incoming nuclear missiles but what happened to all that like\nPresident Trump's done great work oh he's he's he ... about a bit new uses verbiage that he should do is use\nUh and and that's you know that's the way that is so what they look at the stock market look at the economic growth numbers look at the unemployment numbers this was the actual role of government by the way not\nRedistributing wealth that's Democrats believe the central role of government is stealing from one group of people and buying votes with those dollars from another group of people that's how they operate\n'em and one of those people and so I mean again what are you complaining about what's what's your big complaint about it is it the way he talks is that his tweets is that it because operationally and in terms of all the practical pragmatic\nConsiderations that you might take into account when you're going into the voting booth on election day\nPresident Trump not withstanding some coarse language from time to time has righted our ship\nOn all kinds of levels uh yeah they they said he couldn't get to three percent you can Rocco bottle laughed at it Hillary Clinton they scoffed at it the old chunk Todd and the Democrats boot Lex posing as\nJournalists tall scoffed at the idea of three percent economic growth because they're idiots and their party ... and they're happy to lie all the time and then when they're proven to be stupid and dishonest or they shrug in there I Wonder why care I'm I'm cheating on my wife at work and\nUh you know what what what's the what's the difference what do I care\nSo Alexander one of these people and I I'm just wondering about what what they're unhappy about what they're complaining about an answer as they are unhappy about the whether they're terrified of the climate they believed that they can elect to people that will change the climate and make it better for them\nWe decrease our CEO to output and read the bad guy Europe and China and India increase their CEO to output and they are the
