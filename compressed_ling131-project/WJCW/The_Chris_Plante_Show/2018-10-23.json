... found or\nLet 'em in or else and that's kind of what we're getting this is what we're getting from the Caribbean and from the Democrats and Mexico is a they've decided to screw us I guess that's what they've decided and I think that President Trump should launch cruise missile strike against the central government in Mexico city\nAnd then see what they have to say about it do I'm kidding shouldn't really do a cruise missile strike against Mexico\nAbout Mexico should be helping us out here or we should uh kick them firmly in the box and politically of course an economically as a means of correcting their behavior\nIs there a behavior need some correction and I honestly do believe at this point that the Trump Administration should be looking at we we sent secretary of state Mike Pompeo down there the other day to talk to the Mexican government\nAbout stopping this travesty and they apparently decided they're not going to do that they sent some ... down there and they were a paper tiger the federalized they're dressed all like black ninjas and uh you know they can beat up innocent people on the beach but if you actually call and then to stop the caravan coming into Mexico from\nThe south they're not capable of doing that we should look at all available punitive options\nFor Mexico for Mexico for allowing this to proceed economic political sanctions whatever sanctions we can inflict upon them if Mexico screws us and they're screwing us right now the president United States should uh take it out on them they should beat him\nLike a teenage girl at a Taliban party they should give them a give them a little bit of ah what what was going to get to um to president former president I'm happy to say Obama and all of that good stuff there are other things going on in

assailants they're white guys that are left these there are liberals they took a big rock they threw it through the window of the congressman's office because political violence is now\nAn everyday occurrence thanks to the Democratic party and the left and Brock Obama and Hillary Clinton and Maxine Waters and the rest of them calling for conflict and getting in their face and\nAnd all of this good stuff so it was a there are thousands of dollars in damage they stole some things from inside the office after a smashing the a big plate glass window picture window kind of window out with the big giant rock\nAnd a and you know that's what we get from the Democrats these days\nRepublican Party office in Wyoming was also set on fire in September so ah you know weeks ago\nThe Republicans office in Wyoming was set ablaze by leftists who are violent vandals also attacked the metropolitan Republican club in Manhattan on the Upper East side and they smashed out a windows and things\nAnd

of\nGeorge Soros the Hungarian billionaire who funds left wing causes\nAn explosive device was found on Monday the New York times says in a mailbox at a home of George Soros not\nHis home but one of his homes the billionaire philanthropists that that's what they call they never called the Koch brothers the billionaire philanthropists because the New York times is filthy corrupt they're a horribly

don't have to sign a at a politics to him and they they don't say that he funds left wing causes now he's a billionaire philanthropist ... that's a those are positive words when you're a philanthropist\nThe Koch brothers than ever described that way and how they know it's an explosive device I think they removed it and they don't know whether it's an explosive device but maybe the New York times knows more a\nLaw enforcement officials confirmed that advice was found near ... near Mr Soros as home it did not explode on its own hey Bob squad technician proactively detonated it\nAh
