{"month": "10", "state": "TN", "station": "WJCW", "content": "Now here's the reason why the taxpayer lectures were so why they hated this was an incredible thing\nThe Jewish people were already heavily taxed by the room and government\nA farmer had to give one tenth of each crop and grain and one fifth of ... a crop every man had to pay income tax of one percent and every person from age fourteen to a sixty five was required to pay a poll tax you went through a booth or across a bridge or something you pay the tax\nIn addition to the state of taxes are all kinds of extra taxes for example there were taxes on imported or exported goods or there was usually attacks on entering a marketplace or if you had to pack your you have to pay tax on it now this is only a partial list of the taxes people had to pay tax\nCollectors like man if he were hated but they had very secure jobs you see the governor who appointed attacks collected gave me a specific quota for the tax that he had to collect\nAnything that he collected in addition to that would be his so you see um it was an incredible opportunity and often wealthy people tried to bribe the cash collectors to lower their own tax rate\nSo here's a man who had a business collecting taxes he could cities own race and if someone did not pay he could call Lindy Roman army to enforce the law\n... he was hated yes but he was a wealthy powerful and influential man Jesus called him Matthew knew that when he walked out of his tax office he was walking away from an incredible amount of earthly security can you imagine somebody doing that\nWell he was CEO of course receiving eternal security did you notice that Jesus called Matthew right out of these workplace he did not get Matthew attached or even find out anything about his family history or if you had been baptized or what temperature was attending\nIt's my belief that Jesus knew that Matthew was claiming his faith in God when he left that attacks office and all his earth and security just to follow him\nBut something changed Matthew attitude about what was important just like\nHe met you knew what Jesus was teaching\nHe knew that he Jesus people were more important than things I keep in mind that math you knew the Jewish law he was a Jew and according to our less than the first thing that happened after you Matthew began to follow Jesus to hit a dinner party and at that dinner party there were other tax collectors who were being witness to never centers people who would who were ousted from the capital\nAnd you see it was a fair sees you were there immediately and they were asking questions\nYou remember that the pair of shoes were the ones who their job is to make sure that everyone kept the law\nWhatever happened to ... we don't know for sure but it changed his life we also know that he began to help other people find out what he had found I've learned more about a person's faith in God by the way how she or he lives their lives than anything else they say isn't that true\nWhen someone begins to trust God it makes a dramatic difference now dramatic influence on their attitude about all of life\nI remember a few years ago and met alley in England his real name was ... but he says just call me alley while I was a building contractor when I when I met him and he had just not long before that and that Christ\nHis life had been very secure and his abilities were excellent and he he was a good building it was about Thirty years old and he told me that one day he discovered that he a burden for young people who were from poverty areas you'd volunteer to numerous areas in working churches with you and so on and a sense of compassion is just remarkable\nWell not long after I met alley he told me that he was leaving to go to work with using very poor and tough places in England\nMost of those kids lived in not only poor but basically a band places they lived on the streets and they were homeless and he said my first job will be to gain their trust\nAnd I'm going to live in the streets with them he said Johnny said I've seen where they live they live in cardboard boxes and under bridges and blankets he said it's incredible but I won't be able to take any money with me you know had to live in a box like they do and do whatever they do\nI don't know if the work he said but I don't know how else do you get close enough to them to tell them about Jesus please pray for him he said I'm really afraid\nI can tell you I Would be afraid to imagine going into a major city and living outside in a cardboard box located in the highest crime rate area in your city I cannot tell you I personally do that except except I Do know that when a purse\nAnd I said Jesus Christ in their lives it changes what's most important to them\nNot long after I met alley I met Helen Helen was an emergency room nurse in England her specialty was very highly paid and he was then twenty eight years old\nShe lived in her own home life was very secure for her she worked hard you love your work at a great network of friends but but not long after she met cry she began to think about the things that were the most valuable to her and her life and she began to ask yourself what am I headed where am I going\nWell then they mix of all that she learned about the plight of than if you live in coal mining towns she told me then that she was leaving her work in the city hospital and she was going to go live in a mining town for at least one year\nShe said there were nine minds operating in that community until two years ago because of new regulations seven in the minds had to be shut down and more and more of them will close and less than a year and that's been about eight years ago she said there is so much poverty in so much hopelessness\nShe said I don't know what I can do but I'm just going to be there well I said are you going to open a clinic no she said I'm just going to live with the people I work for free or go to their churches I'll do whatever they want me to do I want to get to know them and help them and this was so important she said I Want to help them regain their trust in God\nJohn she said I Can't imagine anything worse than having no hope in your life can you\nYou know friends that was a powerful powerful time and that's not near Allen or Helen have really any specialized training for what they're going to do but they do have enormous faith in God their faith gave them the courage to leave with they were doing and follow what they believe God was calling them to do\nYou know not everyone does that from time to time God causes in a dramatic new direction that most of the time it's right where we are we began to think through what is most valuable how we spend our time and how we speak and it's amazing what that transforming power\nOf Christ can do in our lives and we were responding to call\nYou know Matthew last August ... life security but did you realize this is so incredible you realize that that ... you got to write a chapter in the most important book in all of history\nYou know it makes me wonder what would happen if if you or I could learn to trust guy with everything like that it's amazing isn't it pregnant\nOr help us to trust you help us to know that no matter where you lead us that you will be doing what's best for us you will allow us to write a chapter in history that will be the influence on another human life thank you for Jesus I mean\nYou know [noise]\nJohn Will find though you've got another message share your work with us now\nThank you very much you know in the Nineteen thirties when Adolf Hitler began to change the course of human history he did it by gathering huge crowds or scores of radio stations those broadcasts cause millions of people to accept the unsinkable and stand back he murdered millions of people\nAt the same time prime minister Winston Churchill in England use the power of the BBC Radio to encourage people to stand against the power of evil and led his country to victory\nThe human loss in World War two was horrible\nBut had it not been for radio it would've been a lot worse you know in spite of every option radio was still the most listening to form of communication\nThis is why we continue to share the gospel each week on twenty to broadcast stations we know the power of radio and we know that thousands of persons living the shadow of despair\nSometimes just hearing the word of encouragement found in the scriptures makes all the difference for forty

to read something in a paper a correlation between uh taking ibuprofen Advil stuff like that and all very cancer when\n[noise] no I don't know if there was a crew that but it does have a correlation what about man\nWell it's it's long term use when you're talking about ibuprofen the drug ibuprofen and it's an Advil and various other things I've read not only about what you're talking about the ovarian women but also a ratcheting up again we're talking about long term used here in which these\nDrugs were never designed to be used on a long term basis five to seven days at the very most in a run uh I've also read about lung cancer being associated with a ibuprofen and also I think a brain cancer\nSo uh you know when you're dealing with drugs they're there for a reason they help people to improve quality of life but the most important the bigger things on the ibuprofen if you read it if you look it up is irregular heartbeat\nPeople take this because it got low back pain or they've got to shoulder pain or an ... and they take ibuprofen thing and well it's over the counter must be safe right these same pain\nKillers can also raised a person's risk of heart attack that'll get you

to take a look and God's word see what he might have to say to us this morning and we also want to share some of what we do some anti will come at the appropriate time and share some of what we do along with you as well I invite you to turn in your Bible is with me to Matthew chapter sixteen\nVersus one through four\nMatthew sixteen one through four God's word says\nAnd the ... came at the tests and they asked him to show them aside from heaven\nYou answer them when did his evening you say it will be fair weather for the sky is read\nIn the morning it will be stormy today for this guy is red and threatening\nYou know how to interpret the appearance of the sky but you cannot interpret the science at the times\nAnd evil an adult first generation six for a sign with no sign she'll be given to it except the sign of Jonah so he left them and departed while the thank you for your word we prejudicial speak to our hearts this morning from it and Jesus name him and\nThis is a great little story and you know we all have these things we look at the sunset cycle it'd be nice out tomorrow\nOr we we look at the sunrise and saying what about today is going to be like we might have other things I had a great aunt who told me how to tell if it was going to continue raining or not by whether the ... ah raindrops stayed on the branches or not they were farmers and and that was what they use to determine if it was going to continue rainy or if the rain had stopped and they could get out start doing some things\nAnd we all have these things that we used to interpret a nature interpret what we think is going to happen but it's interesting that sometimes\nWe're not really paying attention to what it is a God is doing\nAround the world and what he is trying to do and how he might want to use less to do it so this morning we want to take a look at that and we saw how he told the ... and the sad to see that they know how to look at the sky and read it but they're not very good at reading the signs of the times and\nBefore we get into another part I Want to mention immediately after this uh there was another passage here that's an interesting story that you may not related to this I think it is highly related to Jesus and the fibers get into a boat to cross the sea of ...\nAnd on the way Jesus Says it and be aware\nOf the eleven of the ... and the fear is\nThat just like I said I forgot to bring bread\nOr they they make this leap in their mind from the eleven of the ... is the first and they're thinking bread we forgot to bring bread\nHow I spend five thousand\nDon't you remember how I met the four thousand don't you think I can take care of twelve guys in the boat\nIf if need be but somehow they hit or miss what he was teaching them they had really perceived it and he had to bring it to their attention and I think sometimes we were in the same situation God is trying to speak to us through events were oblivious to\nWe're not paying attention to them we think they have nothing to do with us and and you know he's I'm just doing my life here I'm doing my thing here and we forget to God and may be wanting to speak to others through us he may want to bless others through us as well so we had these these stories here in Jesus Says to them I'm\nCareful of eleven the teaching\nOf the fair sees\nSide just as you know there are lots of people out there whose voice is a twenty four hour news they're trying to trying to affect us one way or the other and we have to be careful that what we're guided by is God's word\nIs the teaching of his word and not by these external voices that are trying to convince us of one thing or another we shouldn't let that eleven come into our hearts and affect our thinking it's God's word that should affect our thinking\nAt the time that this happened uh there were several things that I think this is such a season the viruses could have noticed if they had been paying attention and one of them of course was the Roman soldiers everywhere\nAre there in Jerusalem that were Roman soldiers you know and they\nThey should have noticed them it would have been hard to overlook them All right but they didn't really think about what that was meeting for almost six hundred years under in ...\nThey had been dominated by different governments are the Babylonians than the Greeks and then the Romans and they'd been under domination by all these different groups for almost six hundred years\nAnd they were somehow not able to to proceed what God might be trying to do through that previous to that he had taken a bunch of them outside of Israel to a new place\nAnd that was Babylonian and they didn't realize that he was trying to do something in and threw them there either but then he he had the Roman domination in previous other nominations as well that they should have noticed\nThis also included bringing in a lot of foreigners when Babylonian conquer them they took out the leadership of the nation and took them to Babylonian\nAnd others came in fact if you read the Nehemiah you you see some of these uh foreigners are coming in and trying to wrap power and trying to have a voice in in the ... over the people of Israel or at the time and so\nThese gentile are coming in and as you re throughout the or touch them you see the gentile arriving in the window after the battling the Greeks came and then the Romans has all these foreigners you know the Jews had this idea of we're God's chosen people because we're special\nThey hid ignored what he has said to Abraham when he told them I Am choosing you and I'm going to set you apart and I'm going to make a great nation of you to bless the nation's\nPeople of Israel had forgotten that part they thought they were special because they were special they didn't realize they were special because God was going to use them to reach the world with his message and so they weren't they weren't able to grasp that and that was one of the things was reports of all these strangers coming in they resisted them\nThey resent and all these foreigners\nThese towns around us and they didn't want to accept them so that's another sign that they could have noticed also there were there were a great number of Jews who were your religious\nYou know they were Jews by birth and they maybe went to the temple once a year and you know but really it's God's will I had not much of a an impact on their lives and it's still there they might have talked about God every once in awhile sprinkled their language with with religious terms or something but they were not following God's path\nWere not following God's work\nAnd then lastly there was a group of people who would already come up at that time in fact one of Jesus twelve disciples was of that group was sell it\nWho who they believe that they were willing to give their own lives and they were willing to take the lives of others in order to continue that religious tradition that they had and things were as outlets that that were working against the Roman government Roman army\nAbout forty years after this happened\nThey brought about through their actions in and other actions the destruction of Jerusalem the destruction of the temple\nAnd the nation was dispersed at that time and and that was because they were the way that they were working and these are some of the things I think that if the if the the ... season versus had really been paying attention they would have seen some of these things coming across on the horizon but they weren't really paying attention to them\nNow Nancy and I also see some signs of the times and we want to share that with you as this morning or as I said we you know we felt called out of the church and we went to live in in another part of the world and why don't we were there um\nWe were invited to attend a meeting in the middle east and we when we met some folks and and uh they talk to us about helping Latin Americans get to the nation's with the gospel Willis you'll see in a minute for those who don't know Nancy\nShe's from Latin America so we went over there and an interesting thing happened we got to a country and North Africa and they spoke to her in Arabic\nThey can tell that I wasn't going to speak Arabic but they spoke to him because they thought she was from that country\nIt was in a little I came out we begin to say oh this is interesting so we interviewed some some Latin American missionaries who were in that country and they told us yet we sit right in we looked like them you know we act like them or you don't know they basically is what they were saying to me and they were right I don't look like them I don't act like that we don't act like that\nAnd so we don't fit in quite as well in our Latin American spit in a much better\nSo we got very interested in this and this was sort of a hinge for us in our ministry before that everything else had been local church planting type stuff and from that point on we were trying to help Latin Americans get to the nation's so I Want to share with you this morning for signs of the times that we see the first one is communication\nCommunications or re most of us are probably have a a cell phone with us right now I've got mine and my back pocket and and we keep a cell phone with us we can chat Nancy in our blessed to have a contact with people all around the world so we chat with people regularly in other parts of the world\nAnd uh and apparently this is going over the Internet and so there are some things that we're\nNot going to say today precisely because we don't want those people who are looking for I'm\nPutting the Dutch together to be able to recognize names and such so the faces that you see will not be seen on the Internet today but we we want to be able to utilize communications as best we can but there is a a draw a downside to that as well\nSo communications today is one of those things that God is using some creative things that that people are doing with the gospel I'd love to have the time to talk about some of them but um some things that are happening with communication and that's one of the signs of the times that I Would like for you to consider", "show_name": "The Chris Plante Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Johnson City", "day": "07"}
