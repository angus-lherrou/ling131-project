Do uh\nI I Do think that it does make a difference on the customers look at you differently you know if you wear one every day it just becomes a part of you part of your uniform and the people around you see you all the time don't like any differently of it but if you go from a casual mode like I Am most of the time through a formal boat people say well\nWhat's different here who think they know that kind of thing so [noise] um\nSo anyway I get to wear a suit that's how this weekend for\nAnd um we're excited about getting up there on the um\nAdvantage starts as we can be we're doing a dice role that gateway no I'm not much of a gambler except I Am a car dealer mhm which in and of itself is a gamble I guess anytime you're independent\nOr you are a gambler mhm to one degree or another but I'm never been one to really play blackjack if I go to a casino and walk through it\nI might put you know\nFive dollars on a red and spend the roulette wheel but\nThat's about it I'm not much of a\nA card player but we are doing a dice role\nThis uh this month\nI'm I'm putting a hundred thousand dollars on the table that's not pocket change I bought insurance bill this is how this works\nI buy insurance\nPaying insurance premium\nAnd a four people\nUm can wind up to twenty five thousand dollars each a gateway this month all they have to do come in and\nEnroll and take a test drive and then I'm like a vehicle out driving come back in roll the dice and and uh we're doing this uh obviously is an advertising\nUm idea to get people to come in and see our new two thousand and Nineteen and\nIn a product that we've got we just got the new two thousand Nineteen Nissan ultimate came in\nYesterday and bail it is\nIt is a phenomenal car ...\nBig you know it's a ... those cars the Honda Accord and you know the competitors are the the accord\nThe fusion I guess which will be going away and late\nIn early to twenty twenty\nUm we've got the you know you that Toyota Camry those cars and the ultimate has been at a great seller for Nissan and and this is going to be even better we've also got the new ah two thousand Nineteen Ford Ranger it has in Iraq yet but it's coming\nAnd we had a lot of new products that we're trying to entice people to come in and and what to check out what we've got so we're doing this dice role and basically I've got\nUm seven dies\nOr die which would I say die\nIs one di di\nDi di di but more than one is di ...\nOkay I've got seven I'm given a uh the why is it for a gateway all you have to do is roll it and spell the word gay rights and the Y. is uh the wide die says why all the way around it so you get free dicey you just got a real get that those letters\nAnd you can win twenty five thousand dollars a for potential winters total of a hundred thousand dollars for the rest of this month just getting on down the gateway and and you'll get your role so that's exciting in bill\n... out every day yeah it's very exciting I think\nThe odds are the odds like if you the lottery odd like for the Powerball and stuff like that or one in like three hundred million some some kind of crazy odds like this this is one in I think she said thirty six thousand\nSo that's pretty good that's pretty good yeah yeah pretty good that's lottery odds\nYes it does mhm\nUh you know speaking of a gambling if you buy two thousand Eighteen or Nineteen jeep wrangler Jay el that's the new one um\nThere's a major recall on these matter of fact you won't be able to even bought one right now because if you have bought one you need to park it you'd probably not been notified\nIf you hadn't been notified\nUm you will be and um if you go into buy one today he won't be able to because they can't sell them\nOr apparently\nThere is a whale ... on the frame which is very important\nAh that is an improper weld it connects the track bar on the front\nTo the frame which in certain situation\nCould cause the track bar to separate from the frightened now what's that ... what\nHappens when that happens\nIs that you have no steering\nUm which it says here in this article which greatly increases the risk of an accident really\nI think if you have no steering it more than greatly\nEnhanced increases the risk of an accident I agree yes we\nWould wouldn't you agree right\nAnd so it's a rigid bar that connects the vehicles actual\nTo the frame in it and it does I had to print or prevent unwanted lateral movement of the action so it's a it's just a bar you know that that is connected to the frame and the actual that that keeps it stable but when that bar breaks you could lose steering control so\nIt really is unclear how deep is going to a remedy this issue but um it's it's pretty serious and or any time you start welding on frames\nThat is supposed to\nUm basically be listed on car facts as a frame repair mhm\nGosh I don't know I mean that that that sounds like I'm\nSome vehicles could have to be bought back I've seen the new ... have you seen any of the new games I don't know that you recognize it\nAs one of the new two thousand Eighteen jeeps if you did see it they you know it's still looks exactly like yo jeep except they make a lot of little subtle changes with lighting LA de lighting and I love them I mean I think they look right\nAnd probably probably if I was just an independent\nA person and I wanted it off road vehicle that probably be the one I Would buy I like the the unlimited the Ford or cheap but I wouldn't be able to buy one today so if you think about buying a jeep you might want to just\nHung up on that so
