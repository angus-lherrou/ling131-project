pretty stiff but he's he's fixing the get remedied here that\nGoing under their not he's going under the knife going to get them to get some uh get that spinal cord all fixed up\nI Hope the hopes that needs to get some some of those gaps sealed up so that they don't squash down on his and are so I'm I'm dealing with a lot of people right now in my business of employees that are struggling\nWith lower back pain and I was um\nLooking at a piece of property beside my dealership we're gonna when we build a new Nissan show room I'm going to have to um [noise]\nI I'm going to have to make another entrance\nDown on on the ... and I see a because the way my building is situated on a lot\nReally the the front left ... as your face in the building in front right corner of the building\nPoints directly at at the road so I actually have almost like two facades to the building you know for those who don't know what facade is that the front of the building okay why don't they just called at the front oh no you know\nSo I said sometimes I play at all of the Cade side don't okay you've got to have you got to say but anyway um so the the right front kind of ... faces to the north east and the and the ... kind of faces to the north\nWest and so that's going to be my Nissan front so I've got to have\nOne of the things I promised them is that I Would have a new entrance I did not promised them that I Would increase by lot space mhm but there is a lot that's available beside mine and so I I've been\nLooking at it and ... and I can't walk around it right now because or I couldn't because it was just so overgrown and there was a pretty steep banks yesterday at ... this past weekend I pay somebody to come in and clear me a path I said I Need a five foot wide path to get down to here so I can see what I'm dealing with and they they did a great job\nI'm problem is I'm I'm In dress shoes dress pants [laughter] um I have my briefcase around one shoulder in a coffee and the other side will go check this out so I start walking on the hill it's a very steep bank\nI fail mhm uh-huh yes [laughter] I'm just glad nobody saw because it was not you know is not one of those falls where you just kind of go down it's a stage thing you'd go different stages you know there there's awareness and that you have lobster equilibrium\nAnd then there's the actual defying gravity that takes place at certain points and then the overcoming uh the gravity overcomes you and then you hit hit the ground and and avoid the the the rock so it but it was just a couple of little minor stains\nOkay ... got some mud on my dress shoes in but I was able to to hold the briefcase up and that the coffee was pretty much down the hill okay yeah so anyway but I did find out\nA change in strategy and and what we're gonna be able to do and I'm excited about that I'm looking at the numbers\nFor um the month they look pretty good on on nice on end and the Ford side I don't know I haven't seen the numbers from uh other brands but I think the the weather was very conducive to good month mhm the um the\nLike I say I haven't seen any of the numbers nationally or um internationally for that matter but it looks like I'm from from Stanford just look at Nissan ah from Chattanooga all the way out\nOr as of about eight pm last night they were only sixteen units off from hitting their a twelve hundred unit objective so sixteen cars\nSo you know they were scraping the bottom of the barrel this are are we sure we reported every delivery we found one we didn't get reported so we were we were able to add one unit to the got it down to Fifteen okay so anyway let's take our first commercial break and I'll be a a maybe to get organized here\nI think it's harder than ever for businesses to keep up with today's evolving alphabet soup of regulations much a company to do\n... with criminals you can minimize compliance risk and track HR policies making sure they're applying consistently and fairly HR payroll talent in time keeping in one unified system all with a proven implementation approach and simplified transparent pricing learn more acronyms dot com slash compliance\nCriminals workforce innovation that works\nTuesday edition of my car guru as we work our way through with you kill a robot knows Fifteen minutes or a or so what is that it are you more organized now no not really I pulled out my eye pad\nYeah this is an ... this is one of my consumer auto network I pay as you can see because it is consumer auto network on the back [noise] I'll give you an update on the network we have a new app that is getting ready to launch\n'em that's not an easy thing\nTo pull off ... ... let's just be Frank\nTo get into the apple store you know or to get into the Android whatever their stores called\n'em and their app stores you know in order to be able to be a part of that you have to either have a really deep pockets and tremendous ability to build you know that kinda stuff or you got to hire a company to do that we have found a company\nThat has access to been approved by both apple\nAnd Google Android yeah and um so they are able to provide us with a platform that we can use for the consumer auto network\nNow what what are the issues that we have is with with car dealership and I is one is that they have you know an entire culture that they have to deal with employees is a lot of\nYou know when you are our dealership is we have ... uh well at the Ford store probably in the half fifty fifty eight employees and you get your frontline employees that are the ones that interface with the customers and and they have to be there they're constantly bombarded with I mean it's like\nLike a fire hose you know especially in the service strap and so when you're in there it's easy to forget certain things\nYou hope that you had the systems and the organization where you don't forget the customer mhm that's sitting in the waiting room don't want to do that for an old change and do our later later they're saying yeah I was just here for no change and I'm nobody's can we get we forgot about you oh no no you don't want that kind of thing to have 'em\nBut sometimes they forget about all the other programs that they have you know car dealers have their own\nA prepaid maintenance programs that they that they sell in the finance office um they have other products that they that they offer and sell extended warranties you know you have a customer drive in they've got a problem with their vehicle and they know they're not\nDealing with these issues on a on a consistent basis and they forget what they've got\nYou know they forget well I think about an extended warranty you know that was like three years ago and\nOf course everything that I've had fixed so far as it has been under the factory warrant yeah so now I've got this problem is that covered well in the service advisor has to make a phone call if you bought an award from a dealer and that what we call them after market warranted which is not one provided by\nFor you know like the Ford or extended warn you that we sell 'em or the GM protection plan whatever they call it now a year warranty is backed by somebody else other than the auto makers so\nPhone calls have to be made you have to find out how they're going to pay so there's a lot of hoops you have to jump through\n'em but if you're a member of the consumer on a network\nAnd and you go in and of course you get this counts as one of the advantage of being a member but what has happened is a there's a lot of turnover in car dealerships and sometimes the the sales person or the person in the service Dr just\nDoesn't remember what does it remind me again what the consumer on a network is\nSo they are they show him their member card or the person forgets their member car ... so we're a lemonade and member cars with the app oh okay so what you'll be able to do is pull out your smartphone device and just touch the app and there will be your member number ... dealerships owners that and what what their discounts are\nNow one of the things that we're also doing is allowing dealers to offer greater discounts than the standard discount\nFor the consumer on our network so instead of getting a ten percent discount for example in regular maintenance and a twenty percent discount on a all other mechanical repairs and the shop\nIf a dealer wants to offer more they can and there are some that have request that uh some offer special deals\nLoner cars so they will be able to have their own program that's really hard to communicate on a low membership card yes it is uh-huh it's relying too way too much on human memory so the app itself will be able to have all of the information and if you get\nThe sea class Mercedes you know these cars are these are alternatives and and those people like technology you know they like the big screens and the switches in the dolls and yeah you know I'm In a Tesla model three will smoke a\nA R U series BMW because of the all the work that engine has\nSo um maybe this maybe this will work I don't know um we shall shaped like I said I've seen about three or four of them that they may area just within the past\nTen days or so we'll build quality is ... is still suspected at best a there's a lot of\nIssues with the cars they ... they rattle they they moan grown but they're quiet some of them that see here I mean when you're driving electric car there's not much to here as far as murder noise and stuff so all you can hear squeaks rattles in ... sort of looked at Vegas that\nYou had a few years ago yeah very similar to uh Vegas so [laughter] so ah the Tesla is just a modern day Vega\nAlright on that note that's kind of scary too ... though we will wrap it

nine six two five but Brett Kavanaugh handed out red solo cups at a party in high school then he's disqualified he can't be on the Supreme Court\nMaybe they should die a slow miserable death like this Georgetown professor says and should have their gender do shared and fed to pigs\nBecause that's what these Nazis are all about make no mistake the name of it all Hitler's party was the national socialist German Workers Party and there are a lot closer to Bernie Sanders than they are to me I'll I'll tell you that right now are also the Washington Post\nThat they've got this um there there are mentally ill they really are I mean this hatred for white people wouldn't for men we should really beat the hell out of 'em don't you think are white men should just get together and just just where's

hatred and rage for the Democratic party\nType to by Philip Rucker and Robert Costa Robert cost I think he might have had lap band surgery or something you see this guy he used to be like a cartoon of a of a pool table and are now it looks like he could die at any moment from now malnutrition I don't know what's going on with the\nFilth broker and Robert Costa they they hate their self loading white men and boy they are both white man let me tell you\nAnd here's the headline from the Washington Post today\nThe trauma ... for a man that's in quotation marks that's in the headlines Colin ... they love ... they're called into their favorite things\nMale fury and fear rises in geo pie\nIn defense of cabinet Hey Geoff why just are just sort of as a shorthand thing there\nThe sexual assault allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett am Kevin I'll have sparked a wave of unbridled anger and anxiety\nFrom many Republican men where we should uh I Know we should do ha ha ha ha ha\nWho said they are in danger of being swept up by false accusers who are biased against\nThem what really you're hearing a lot of that or you know that's a lot that's complete fabrication that just Philip Rucker Robert costs are lying here they they sat at a keyboard and they decided to get together and lie a lot\nFrom President Trump to his namesake son\nTwo senators Lindsey or Senator Lindsey Graham the halls of outrage crystallized a strong current of grievance within the party this is a complete fabrication it's a total lie you know you guys live so much that your new allies are designed to

can't be a victim anymore you you have to curl up in uh the fecal position on the floor\nAre hoping somebody will beat you up so that you can claim that they were mean to you because you're so pathetic\nThis is about truth justice and the American way this is about the truth first and foremost\nIt's about not lynching people like you Democrats had been doing since you started the white nights of the Ku Klux Klan and started lynching Republicans and the blacks that Republicans had fried look it up\nThat's called history Nathan Bedford Forrest versus the Republicans big Democrat Confederate soldier\nFounder of the KKK and a big Democratic Party leader and elected Democrats\nThey gave us the KKK and the kind of bank of Nineteen twenty four and a and you know I got to get this this uh sort of speaking of Glenn Beck she get this half baked professor from California to come out here and she can't remember things that happened two months ago on the day of her grandmother's funeral\nAnd she's afraid to fly but she flies all over the place and she's pixilated and confused and bereaved and and\nAnd uh she's let's face it she's not reliable and no prosecutor would take up her case but the news media will because of fraud like Philip Rucker and Robert Costa that write those mental stuff I mean it's just mental\nThe eruption of male resentment now it seems likely to play a defining role in the mid term elections just five weeks away this is all about the mid term elections and Robert ... sudden Philip Rucker doing what they can for the Democratic party [noise] you

their lives were going to go round and destroy them now I mean really this is this is projection again what this says is projection\nSee these the Democrat women need\nTo feel like victims Republican women don't\nJust say that Republican women support Brett Kavanaugh eighty six percent Quinnipiac poll eighty six percent of Republican women support Brett Kavanaugh\nDemocrat women I just need to feel like victims and I guess if they hang out with the likes of Bill Clinton their whole lives then maybe they are victims maybe you should hang out with a gentleman who are confident in our men Leno center masculinity are Muskie\nMuskie manually mental illness and ah you know where where men were real men were comfortable being men and we're proud of being men and it's great to be men and men are great and you know what else are great\nWomen women are great especially when they love men and they love men who love women which is why we are you see where normal people you people are all mental cases at this point and you really need help maybe Dr Ford has some opening on her because she's a psychologist and she's got all this stuff figured out she was given a lot of thought\nBut this is more this is more projection from the ... on the on the left in this insane piece that Victoria spotted this morning\nThe rallying cry was Kavanaugh's enraged\nPlea of innocence before now I mean there are how about you guys do a story on whether he's actually at a center not\nThat'd be that'd be worthwhile instead of this sexist miss injury this this racist anti white racism which the Democratic party has their history is steeped in racism there the the only racists in the conversation our every single Democrat involved in the conversation\nHow's that I have faith in white man [laughter] do you think white men can ask good questions I Believe they can ask that question [laughter]\n[laughter] ah\nWe had to take the we just take everything away from them it's like they're
