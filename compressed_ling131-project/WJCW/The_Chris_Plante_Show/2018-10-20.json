well when you eat the whole food in your ... your body does have to do a little work to digest it so you have kind of a a pro and con they're broken down and I'm arguing while you absorb more nutrients where other people say well maybe you should eat more whole foods because\nJust like every other muscle in your body or got needs a little work out too\nWell and it's kind of a catchall term because juicing can mean the juices extracted out and there's all this fiber stuff left behind or ... you could put it all in a blender mhm just blended up like crazy and there's nothing left behind it all goes into a glass\nOr do you mean when you Jews you lose the fiber fiber is going to set up at the bottom and don't drink that no it's not even in the glass if you do juicing you put it through the machine and then all that fiber and pope and stuff is left behind whereas I put everything in a blender mhm and just with it up like get even with carrots in there\nHe likes them 'cause they're sweet well and I think there and I think that's a really good point because there are some vegetables that adds some sweetness you know with ... and depending what your ... taste preferences are if you know some people want to eat more greens\nOr keep the calorie content of their smoothies down so adding vegetables as a nice way but some people don't necessarily like the better of the greens are some of the vegetables so pairing that with a sweeter fruit like pineapple is a really a nice ...\nIt's a different shy their holy okay either an ideal combination of fruits and vegetables um it it it can you make such a thing can you make is an ideal concoction or does it really\nWell and I think the idea would be in in maybe the eye of the beholder um and maybe what their and their needs are now somebody say we're trying to get more iron in their diet I'm and absorb more I and I might say with your leafy greens combine it with something that's going to have more vitamin C. likes to address or the pineapple\nUm that's a nice combination because you have the vitamin C. helping somebody I Indians are from that\nSo does juicing help you lose weight I mean did you do tend to get full when you do this and eat less\nWell and I think it it probably depends how it's made and and so\nLike anything what goes into it and the portion matter\nAnd so if it were said just just the juice the pope extracted and you could drink a lot of juice and a lot of calories if there were many many fruits and they're now granted it's nutritious but um there it is a significant amount of calories\nUm and even if it were a whole foods smoothie there is a chance that\nIt could be extra calories for you and so you just want to keep that in mind and that's where some people are finding the combination of the fruit and the vegetables lower than the calorie content of the overall that bridge\nUm and then I think just the idea of just keeping the keeping the portion check you might want to share it with somebody mhm\nSo some of the recipes actually called for a little bit of added sugar but that's not a good idea is is\nIn it wherever we can cut out added sugar in our diet is probably a good idea because we're eating far too much of it so any chance you can cut back or cut it out it's a good idea and with the natural sweetness of fruit and some vegetables it's probably not necessary at\nThe secret is an avocado which makes them really really smooth sounds weird guilty South Dakota when you do it or what is easier is really right bananas\nBecause that makes it sweeter and it makes it very smooth mhm so I've got so many frozen bananas in my freezer right now too many I should I mean the party and you can come over\nAre you really convinced so this is better than a chocolate ...

flu with a virus that attacked\nYour respiratory system most people get better on their own but for some the flu can be serious Mayo Clinic family medicine specialist Dr Tina Arden says that younger children an older adult definitely can get more sick from the flu\nPatients who are already sick with other chronic conditions or are undergoing chemotherapy are more likely to have complications\nNow complications include bronchitis pneumonia and even heart problems Dr ... says the vaccine for influenza is one of the best defense as we have and that some people don't get the flu vaccine because I think it can cause of flu\nThe flu vaccine is what's called a dead the vaccine you can't get the flu from a flu shot\nFlu mist while safe for most people contains a weakened form of the virus so people with certain conditions you get a shot in dead everyone who can get it shouldn't get it Dr Martin says it takes two weeks for the vaccine to work so get your flu shot and now and in other news\nLet's talk about the head got faking hiccups is pretty easy but getting rid of the real ones can be difficult\nDr Mark Larson a Mayo Clinic gastroenterologist said hiccups are an involuntary contraction of the diaphragm followed like closure of the vocal chords that leads to the characteristics sound\nThat you hear Dr Larson says most take up triggers are associated with temporary bloating of the stomach from something like overeating or rapidly eating\nGulping down big drinks especially carbonated ones can also cause tickets even being suddenly excited or scared can cause that repetitive involuntary contraction of the diaphragm\nLarsen says most people who experience had God's will do so for only a very short period of time usually less than a minute or two rarely hiccups can last for days or even months and that may be a clue that there is an underlying medical conditions\nAs for hosting the heck I Dr Larson suggest simple remedies that just holding your breath gurgling or simply sipping cold water you should do something that interrupt that activity of the diaphragm\nAn airplane use that word I'm duty and William [noise]\nWelcome back to the Mayo Clinic radio I'm Dr Tom shot at I'm Tracy McCray poly cystic kidney disease or ... is an inherited disorder were clusters of cis developed within the kid next to this cause the good news due in large and lose function over time\nThe other sister benign that is their non cancerous or their their socks they're filled with fluid ... you can also causes to rebel up and other parts of your body mainly deliver\nThe disease can cause serious complications as well including high blood pressure and kidney failure the FDA recently approve the drug toll wrapped in ... and who it's for patients with poly cystic kidney disease\nMale clinic was instrumental and the research for this drug and will be one of the only a few places to initially off of the treatment is part of its clinical practice and here to discuss as male clinic neurologist Dr fraud should be welcome to the program Dr ... thank you for having me doctors should be\nGreat to have you here and it sounds like a real advance a poor people who have publisher to kidney disease absolutely tell us a little bit about the condition itself so both the kidney disease um there's two types there's one which was called up his ... and the other one is a little more dominant\nThan the rivers to the inheritance pattern first through the inheritance or the first one that excessive uh\nUsually affects the ... the children and then the people who couldn't you favor and from a liberal issues as well but the most common type which we will talk more about does Oklahoma dominant which affects mostly the adults are the most common inherited kidney disease and as you mentioned\nSo these patients actually are born with some fluids food socks uh so what are called to but they don't go the major issues\nOr early on uh mostly high blood pressure so hypertension sometimes that can cause bleeding and then later on uh the to grow and kind of a damaged the kidney\nAnd you can you figure so one kind that the ... the one that's probably less common can affect you as a child and the more common type a will affect you as an adult but they're both called poly cystic indices rocky how common to normal dominant as a as I mentioned the most common\nSo it's one in five hundred to ... thousand in the population\nSo there's about six hundred thousand patients with ... or ... the\nBill doesn't with them and type in the United states and about twelve to Thirteen million worldwide\nAnd what happens if patients aren't treated I mean if it starts off shut wrecking your kidneys and then what happens\nYeah so for decades the patients who are have some history so they've seen their great grandparents their parents going through uh the the disease they've never imagined that there's a kind of something to slow down the disease progression or the good from growing\nSo for many decades the only thing would be treating high blood pressure making sure you're healthy and then once you reach the end stage renal disease where you need either dialysis or transplantation\nA that's usually the the treatment so there was no treatment basically and for the bus to the kid and a half about Fifteen Years or so if you're a Mayo Clinic a lot of tourists in his office on the tourists\nIt found what the basis of a distance from uh the kids to the system be growing and feelings with a with fluids or and found that if we target are the ... after so\nThat's the receptors at the source for a moment acts on on the kidney if you block that receptor than you lead to lower what's it called again the so it's a molecule that drives the for the tries to this for a an growing and finished with just so he found if we block that then we can slow down the disease progression\nAnd then we we took that over to clinical trials and then found that this is the medication that would slow down the disease progression\nSo it's not a cure but it slows down or the disease or from so it's kind of delays the need for a kidney transplant or dialysis at earlier age and hopefully they gain more years of good kidney function with the treatment\nEven more than what previously would have been a line of treatment which would be try to control your high blood pressure still do that but this medication now can push off any potential problems years decades what\nSo yes so treating high blood pressure is very very important for these patients and there has been some clinical trials did not show that it's going to be too much the progression so we needed some kind of treatment that would really slow down so often is the first a treatment for this disease\nUh so usually the best is to start the patients on these on this medication early on so when the kidney function is to normal but their kidneys are still making these says so if we started early on they have to be on it for several years for decades\nProbably twenty twenty Thirty years and they would gain hopefully several years back and usually we say if someone is progressing fast usually every four years of treatment or with today the the need for doubts by one year\nOr so if you're on it for Twenty years it's probably an extra four or five years uh there's not a big a long long studies because it's a chronic disease that need many years to study but so far this is kind of the expectation that's how it's gonna it's gonna believe\nThat this loud fantastic so how do most patients find out that they have this disease and have you ever seen a case where there wasn't a family history\nA so mostly are the majority of the patients would have someone in the family that has this disease and they've been so familiar with that usually we diagnosed by screening with an ultrasound\nOr so you actually look at the kidneys and see this is exactly so we look at the ... and we have kind of criteria is and how many system depending on the age\n'cause the ... the older you are the more says you'd have\nA so to diagnose first we do the screening by ultrasound and then we can do ask you to scan or MRI to look more at a kind of the the kidney soup and how big is the kidney and then we can uh give a prognosis or how the patient would do depending on how big this is our\nAnd if the patient wasn't aware that they had a family history of poly cystic disease what might be their first symptoms what might lead them to come in and see\nAt varying strengths of magnification to figure out what hair disorder you have\nAnd some of them can be inheriting the passed along to your family\nIs it a heritage order or or is it the hair follicle that actually produces there was a problem\nThat's a great question so it's a genetic abnormality or structure abnormality from the bold hairs like to uh to live so I always tell my patients when you grow hair it's like growing up to let you have a ... that sits in the ground which is your scalp and it has to be oriented in the right direction and a half have growth factors around it to then grow a shaft\nThat if it were a flower would be a ... but instead as the ... so it gets composed and the ... which is where things go abnormal you can also have abnormalities of the protein structure that supports the hair that keeps it anchored into your scalp\nAnd if you have problems with that you'll grow normal hair but you won't keep it simply because it gets pulled out with regular things such as wearing a hat or brushing your hair and that\nProtein structure or the change that you were saying if people have a disease of the hair is that something that they develop over time or if it's our family one of course you're it's inherited\nYeah so you're you're born with a tendency for the most part if it's inherited some of them can accelerate with time\nAnd get worse however for ones that have anger problems with the support of tissue that just doesn't keep the hair that's healthy into the scalp those actually improve with age probably because we get crushed the earth and our skin to get stiffer and so you just simply have more peripheral supports it doesn't get yanked out and were able to teach you\nSome basic common sense things to allow you to keep your hair you know no type braids no dreadlocks be careful with hats things like that\nThen there's the other set of hair conditions that are much more common which is where you get an inflammatory disease that comes to your scalp and eats away the little tulip bulbs that are sitting in your skin and if an inflammatory disease eats away those bulbs and its surrounding structures\nYou will no longer be able to grow any here in the future if if it results in a car so if something is inflamed we tried to turn that process off immediately so that you retain your hair follicle her unit so eventually your body will hopefully remember how to grow a bold\nWhich then will become hair is that the L O P show when people lose their all of their hair yes so the term ... means hair loss\nAnd there are multiple reasons to lose hair and so if you have a section of your scalp\nThat is literally bald as if somebody you know shaved it down to the scalp or it's nicely cut out like a circle and it it's in a weird pattern or the skin turns really shiny\nAnd look very thin or leads very easily or you notice that when you brush one part of your hair many many more hairs come out of that side then when you brush on other areas\nCome to the dermatologist because these are all very time sensitive diseases and time is of the essence when it comes to the hair clock when it starts to tech because once you destroy the hair follicle her unit and its scars shut we cannot grow that hair back\nWell so good to the German soldiers are supposed to get an update on the new treatments that you have four ... is\nThe first thing I like to tell people is they're not alone at something that people feel very embarrassed about often time than men and women will go through all sorts of great lengths to try to hide their thinning hair\nTime is also of the essence because the more we can block those hormone receptors on the scalp them or your hair will be able to grow the best things to do our to use over the counter ...\nWhich is available and two percent strength or five percent there's no reason to use two percent when you can use five percent traditionally it's labeled as being marketed for men but it's just as good for women you can use it and the shampoos a foam or a solution\nI personally recommend a solution and sometimes a little harder to find in the stores that you can order it on line that simply because when you use a shampoo you wash it in and it washes out and when you use a film\nIt oftentimes gets absorbed in the hair you have\nAnd so then it doesn't get to the scalp which is where the action is versus\nMuch easier to use a solution and simply make sure that the liquid gets on your scalp as if you're getting yourself at a medical treatment\nEverything you want her to know about hair and more with Dr Don

just a big engine guy and I think that's the way classic cars will always do good because we are going to keep getting smaller and smaller engines I just got done driving the new Volvo ass sixty Sudan and the the v the wagon that they're making\nThese balls or they're talking about making everything electric but right now they only offer for cylinders you can either buy a four cylinder turbo where you can buy the four cylinder turbo charged in super charge\nAnd then you know of course and hybrid do it and you got four hundred and Fifteen horse power so with smaller engines and electrification of the automobile they're they're just not going to be doing as many V. H. and I hate that Brian\n[noise] yeah I agree and I'll tell you why like it's not about power because some of the cars that you just mentioned for another great job of giving and you can get for horse power more out of at your job is to be fixed\nSo it's powerful I'm not against them but here's what I think you're responding to it I think because of our respond to also for one and the sound you know it just\nThe music out of the exactly by yeah\nAnd second I think one of the important things is is that like those be eight they deliver the power from a place of abundance you're not maxed out yams\nYou know what I'm saying yeah like that's the part that I think I think I really love about it's delivering the power from a place of abundance and if you're one of those people that want the VA instead of a V. six\nWe found a bunch on auto trader that were like hey these are some serious cars maybe a year or two or three old with a V. eight versus a new car that has a V. six\nI'll give you a couple of examples the Chrysler three hundred is is a good example the\nDodge challenger s R T H if not the top dog\nBut if you get a twenty fourteen you're looking at a pretty good deal on a very powerful car yeah the previous BMW in Ninety two and three amazing that the one with a V. eight that's what everyone says right and here's my favorite the Chevy SS the forgotten\nMuscle car I Know right in car though what a great\nWhat a great sound it makes it's almost like people joke and say well that's the um five that we should have had\nRight right right now so the Chevy SS are you talking about the uh the Sudan right\nYeah right and I don't even see it twice a day where I was the one\nUnder thirty grand oh for twenty Fifteen Chevy F F\nYou know what and it's funny I I Wonder I bet that's a low production vehicle because I don't think they did a good enough job telling the world about the U.S I mean listen if you're a classic car guy you're like\nIt's it's an ss ooh what's in it is it really is is it a Claudette says and then they made an ss and now I think they just they did away with it and we're real quiet about it I think that's wonderful\nI think so too yeah when I think the um I think another one is the Chrysler three hundred S.\nIt's not you know not everyone knows about it but it's kind of like the sport version it's kinda like remember they used to be a three hundred and thirty eight and I stopped doing\nThat I read right and\nSo if you don't want to be six and you want a powerful VA look for like a twenty five Fifteen for example Chrysler three hundred death has those cool sporty styling cues\nWheels black grill right that kinda stuff under thirty thousand dollars for a VA power Chrysler three hundred I think that's a pretty good deal\nLet me ask you what do you think is\nGoing to happen like the Chrysler three hundred a good example will just stop right there yeah here's a vehicle that for a little while dominated I mean that vehicle brought Chrysler from the brink of death\nAnd you know great job to Chrysler for you know pulling it off making a car that was kind of gangster looking for those guys and but we're still you know they made him with the sixes and and got pretty good gas mileage a pretty good car all around rental car a fleet pat him you can have everything from one that looked like a Bentley\nTo one that looked like a neighbor's rental car if you know what I mean there's nothing wrong with the national guard but sometimes they just looked like rental cars right hub caps or whatever but here's the vehicle I I I don't know what the future holds for this vehicle I think they've stopped building it\nBut I mean I don't know if that's a mistake Ford going away from cars altogether other than the Mustang is that a mistake in your opinion\nI think there's a place for those cars and when you look at here's a perfect example when you look at ... the example Alexis believes that the Arab rented a luxury brand will always have a place\nFor a large luxury sedan because that's almost like to hang your reputation on even if you don't sell a bunch kind of like the Mustang or the ... I think what's going to happen with the Chrysler three hundred is it's going to be kind of like the Ford crown Victoria right I'm going to realize hey wait a minute we still want those\nAnd I think after market and collectors are going to have all kinds of\nThere's so many of them I think the average person can still get a great veto power sedan\nOr at least the next few years but after that I'm not sure they're probably going to go away because they'll get worn out no one's thinking of those collectible right now right\nA collectible ones will all be snapped up\nYeah kinda like the mercury him or Autor hum yea exactly right and and the funny thing is the car that we blow right past is Lincoln Continental which I've heard rumor that they're going to discontinue the car I but I don't know if it's a rumor of it the truth you know the the grapevine talks\n[laughter] that is a car but it's again you know if it if not what people are buying people aren't buying luxuries that answer buying big luxury s._u._v. is like the navigator or like the M. K. extra the novelist is what it's going to be called that's what people are buying but if you like to dance\nAnd you like the eight there are some great options if you just go back a year or two or three maybe three years or so and and look at some of the cars that you can afford now for the price of basically you know like a loaded Camry\nExample give me an example or two\nI'll give you an example so loaded Camry can be about thirty five thousand dollars\nAnd if you were to look at and this is this is now just reserve your snickering I'm going to use it anyway if you were looking at something that was the eighth our car and he wanted a super charge da let's just say you can get a jaguar ex K touring coup for under thirty thousand dollars\nThat's less than the price of a new loaded the six Camry right same with Chrysler three hundred\nSame with if you can find a clean one twenty Fifteen Chevy SS yeah and those cars they're good cars\nRoad ahead in polls\n\nAre you putting your retirement savings in a four O. one K.

Brian moody executive editor auto trader dot com you guys seriously now that they are so ah yoked with Kelley Blue book the the um the Bible of the pricing guide you know in the industry the auto industry for forever and ever I mean it's like a hundred years or something\nUm you now don't have to look nearly as hard to find out what things are worse because\nOf course a this big company and Cox Communications owns both of them and that's what creates the pilots taco trucks we've been talking cars and be a guy on the truck world\nSo here's where we came up with where it came up with this kind of challenge ourselves what's the best Chevy Silverado you can get for thirty grand personally I like the Silverado I don't know that I'm going to say but it's the best truck my professional opinion but my personal opinion is\nThat I like GM stuff I like the new GMC here I like the Silverado quite a bit\nIt's just one of those things where you know that's my personal preference for thirty grand here's what you can get you can get a brand new Chevy Silverado short at the base trim so not much going on but you do get a five point three or ... you know that's pretty bad little truck short bad standard cab I like those that's kind of to my liking however\nAgain with the depreciation that you just step back a year or two so let's just say you get a twenty sixteen Seventeen you can get\nLDC Silverado which has all the bells and whistles he didn't see the lights trailer package you even get into the Seventy one off road suspension under body protection hill dissent control all this kinda stuff\nAnd that's the way that you can get you know the most bang for your buck if you have about thirty grand has spent now some people are just going to say oh I just want a new car okay well that's fine there's a couple of Silverado as you can pick from brand new twenty Eighteen model\nFor about thirty grand but if you really want you know all the bells and whistles go back a few years going to certify free on like you said\nAnd then you get like can you imagine a Silverado LTV that's like\nThat's like loaded for about thirty grand that's pretty nice trucks so that's the way to go if you're shopping that's what I Would do you know everyone that their opinions about new versus used but man certified makes it hard to argue against a good use truck for about thirty grand like the Silverado you\nKnow and and I'm I'm a person that can speak from experience because I just recently bought a a a ramp thirty five hundred cruise cab four wheel drive a van or whatever the top of the line deal is\nAnd it had a window sticker which was in it of Seventy grand and I bought it with three thousand miles for fifty four thousand right so\nI mean I literally took that first hit of depreciation it was a I bought it in the early part no wait a minute I bought in December of twenty Seventeen\nAnd it was a twenty Seventy models for somebody bought it took it on one trip and went wow this is way too much one ton duly for my little trailer and decided bucket truck for me yeah they could and they put air they actually added airbags in air suspension too it's on top of everything else it had extra extras and running boards and some other things\nSo yeah so then yes you know probably another two or three grand\nSo uh the the certified ... thing and then I bought a bumper to bumper hundred thousand mile um Ninety\nYear extended to eat because I get around right I'm not kidding around it was because it was a bargain so these these amazing warranties you get so here's another story\n... those are maybe more of these are really awesome by the way um my my son in law just body twenty Fifteen ... um Z Seventy one L. T. V. and I did not know those had he'll he'll dissent control on them and he showed me that cool yesterday I was like whoa\nYou know they have exhaust spring and he got the diesel with the ... check this out though it had a hundred thousand miles and I go what\nAre you doing by a truck with a hundred thousand dollars he goes are you kidding me\nThis thing of motor transmission are good for half a million miles that's nothing and we had this huge argument 'cause I told him he was crazy 'cause he spent thirty thousand but he says look at some the the the book value on the thing is thirty nine thousand dollars for a used truck when I was\nJust you know you know that's how those things are holding their values and they are amazing trucks man people are buying and get like who are looking\nFor new trucks here's what I say for the Chevy are fine\nTo yourself a favor go out and drive the ram and drive the GMC yeah there are two brands not everyone is thinking about top of mind always those trucks are amazing trucks it'd be getting a Ford great good for you but\nDon't skip the ram for the GMC they're both excellent trucks and they deserve a test drive\nAbsolutely you can find all this stuff that we've been blather ing about it on a traitor dot com and there's a whole editorial section on there and videos and all kinds of great stuff Brian moody is the executive editor does a great job very passionate\nNice job right and it was a real date I Do my best [laughter] an investigative\nReporter he is All right we've got another hour to go on a traitor dot com not a sponsor of the show but it's where I've always gone for twenty five years to make sure that the car I Want them paying market value and I use Kelley Blue book\nSee what the markets do and see what the Blue Book says I Would come out an educated buyer\nAlright again thank you Brian I'm Alan Taylor later this is a dry [noise]\nAny given moment in America the baby is taking a\nStand up mental milestone for too many carrying a baby so they came to mind and there are these parents babies who were born\nPrematurely or we think it's a crisis affecting more than half a million belief in the United states each year you can help too many fallen tests like\nToo much to be\nMaybe overcoming challenges pointed to\nOut the strong healthy\nTry cities talk radio station am nine\nWG cw\nSkeptical\nSenator mad migrants I'm Christopher cruise Saudi Arabia has finally admitted that Washington Post columnist and Saudi Government critic ... was killed in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey earlier this month but Saudi saying it happened during a fist fight with\nCorrespondent Sarah Westwood this morning says a leading Republican senator is among many who don't believe the Saudi explanation\nLindsey Graham a close ally of president than spreading this on Twitter to say I am skeptical of the news Saturday narrative about Mr ... is an understatement first they were told that Mr ... she supposedly left the conflict and there was a blanket denial of any Saudi involvement now a fight breaks out and he killed in the consulate all without the knowledge of the crown prince\nIt's hard to find this latest explanation credible\nCNN is reporting this morning that ... she was strangled about three thousand Honduran migrants trying to reach the U.S with a caravan surged across the bridge between Guatemala and Mexico yesterday before they will push back by Mexican police corresponded bill we're is almost seen this morning\nOne thing too because you know and and not just having that the ... the ... is a well known popular and yet but it gets good fuel economy and it helps reduce emissions as well and it's like wait I mean they can get a really small a packaging that he could boost engine I mean so they're putting in in truck you know I mean we're going to aluminum bodies\nSo everybody's got to chase weight because of the government comes down hard on them I mean they haven't decided whether these um CAFE standards are going to stay in effect for twenty twenty five where they have to get fifty four point five miles per gallon on the corporate average fuel economy\nSo you know diets maybe in a world of hurt because you know selling small cars I don't know\nI just saw a lot of small cars you know the dark went away and I know that they've got the the I have that ... that\nA law here so and I know I Know they've got like as if they take your\nComments off this logic logic on me I Know they could break the record that's a VA suffer I Want to go [laughter]\nNoises I make in the studio alright B.

Jackson down in [noise] in Florida when we were down there in West palm and then that's when we decide that when we were there that Barrett wanted us to\nIf we were done with the use of that car that you know this\nFall in September we were going to bring bird out to Vegas and\nSell off a few of his pieces along with a um uh the the truck the ... the big Chevy duly truck that was actually a a recreated\nThe look just like the one that was used in the cannonball run and then also the red trans Sam with the jet motor and stuff in it and I'm from the Hooper movie ... uh was recreated cartoon those were basically three vehicles that\nYou know if they all weren't with him at different events they were randomly available\nAnd stuff there and then the eighty four trans them that we sold it burns was a a black eighty four that was actually a car that uh that he was a partners with for his ...\nTeam the Tampa Bay bandits that he was a part of a back in the day and they had two of those cars and this was one of them and it was one that we had had here at the shop that we had\nTook through a a mild restoration and stuff to kind of bring it back to life and had been sitting for quite a few years but it was signed by Jerry read and Bert years ago and just to a neat you know kind of an all\nA different style of of a of a band a car so to speak so\nWill so let me ask you something there what was Burt Reynolds like to work with you I mean you worked with him for a number of years\nAre over a decade really very well yeah yep I'm Bert\nAnd I you know years ago when we first started the band at Ron event um you know we kind of got involved with\nWith him because we started taking the band around you know he um you know to you know to him or he would get involved in the like to know what we were doing and and stuff with the event traveling across the country and our ... and basically kind of recreating what he did in the movie [noise]\nSmoking in the band it and now the band it run was just a way for us to get our cars out and drive I'm On the road and ... really liked that we were doing that and and you know felt a big you know part of that and at the time a year one was creating the Reynolds edition trans am and so that's kind of how\nWe teamed up with them a little bit we helped a was building some of those cars that were\nUm basically taken you know and uh Seventy seven train them and making it modernized with all modern drive train suspension and stuff like that it was kind of a year one project that they had outsourced some of the the custom work to us and then they would finish them up down there at their facility\nYou know and as the years kind of went by Burt no and I kind of worked together on whether it was different cars or or ... you know situations that he was and he was not involved a lot in the car community\nOver the years ah you know being an actor obviously season\nYou know end of the movies and in in that circle so getting him involved in two car shows and signings that car events and auctions and things of that nature was something that basically myself and\nAnd some friends of mine from the band it run and another a business that a burden of informed called a band that movie cars that we used to help basically keep you know Bert involved in the classic\nCar world and introducing him to those people and at different events and car shows and the auctions especially so you know people started to reach out to us to [noise]\nYou know when they run across some of these cars that were a part of a movie that was a part of in and wanting him to be involved with it and so we helped [noise] you know\nHelped him understand you know how it all worked and started taking them to ... Jackson and you know we sold a few different cars out there whether they were ones that\nAre that he was either involved within a movie or or ... or is that were used with them some different events you know just just on on\nThe er at all ... ah Burt Reynolds you know wow I think it was a shock to all of us that uh [noise] you know the man passed and\nHe's like he's one of those guys that we knew we wanted him to live much much longer selfish ...
