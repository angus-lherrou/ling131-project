sounds like the opposite of the smokers [noise]\n... eighty eight months or to talk to someone without noise today\nIs a back here we are back here on this edition of my car guru with the ... he lost them gateway for Lincoln a gateway Nissan\nAnd green there you go yeah yeah I've had to get used to seeing that instead of saying the other that we monitor yeah we were in laws that many years many years and and and that has been somewhat of a transition um\nThere there have been people that we still service um most of our mouths the customers are still coming or the gateway we stock all the miles to parts and stuff like that because we didn't we didn't want to abandon them you know we can't do warranty work anymore on most is they'll have to come to Johnson City to be able to get that done but\nYou know sometimes you make business decisions that that ah\nAffect more than just you you know it affects other people but\nWe had the opportunity to get the uh you know one of the top selling brands in the country which is Nissan and and I'm the only way that we could bring Nissan in was to move Mazda out um you know it was a a again just a business decision\nI'd say one of the interesting things that we've had happened since that that the data that we bought Nissan franchise from ...\nUm what I had a program that was a prepaid maintenance program I won't name the program but it is a it is one that that pays for well the customer purchases on this program ... okay and um it takes care of their oil changes for a period of time so\nI'm maybe for the next two to three years some in some cases five years people can go ahead and pay for all their oil changes their break jobs and and it's all pre packaged at a discount right on contract so they have a card which which enables them to be able to go into the dealership and just show the card and then\nUm then they're able to go on well the problem was is that that was a program for them ... for that dealership right when it was four and a half miles down the road it was named something else and uh they were the Nissan dealer well um when I purchased\nA that that Nissan from him what I purchased was his Nissan assets okay so I bought his parts I bought his Nissan special tools\nI also bought all of his inventory okay ... did not by his company I did not buy anything that he offered to his customers\nYou know such as his prepaid maintenance program right okay that ... he kept the money for the prepaid maintenance program mhm that's supposedly in a bank somewhere and he uses it to pay for all these all J just not really how it works but just imagine it that way mhm okay so we bring the Nissan franchise\nUm once Nissan approves me as a dealer so you don't buy the franchise you were awarded a franchise and you have to make certain commitments to manufacture in terms of capitalization you know how much money you have in your business\nInventories programs like all the Nissan programs we had to sign up for a bunch of different things is that like an application process it is it is that you know huge advocating on process and it took me a month\nTo just complete all of the paperwork wow to become a Nissan they you know and then based on those facts they don't sell you the franchise they award you the franchise right you don't tighten the you don't pay Nissan anything for a franchise you don't pay for it you don't it's free basically mhm\nBut you got to do all this other stuff which is not free in order to be awarded the franchise do does that make sense to you got yeah\nSo we had people coming in the head purchased Nissan said yes I'm here to ah get my free maintenance I've already paid for my maintenance\nSo how did you handle that well what we did is I you know it'd be nice to know this going in a cow you didn't know oh no okay no I didn't know anything about\nAnd so we had a meeting we had we got all these people coming in with that had purchased prepaid maintenance and and what are we going to do are we going to send them to the other day there to have their oil changes done\nYou know here we are a brand new Nissan dealer and we're sitting down there had nothing to do with this program they have all that money for the ... we don't write and we had these customers come in so I made him an executive decision well I said let's honor it\nFor six months let's just go ahead because at the last thing I Want to do is run people off so let's tell them up front we're going to honor this program for six months but after that ... um we won't be able to um I I was hopeful that they could cancel\nYou know they're prepaid maintenance program that they pay for but they um\nDidn't have copied contract so I didn't know what what they could do finally I did get my hands on a copy the contract and unless that dealer totally pulled out of the market which he still had other franchises them they could not cancel the contract but now since then that dealership has been sold\nTo end up to a third party the crush or dodge jeep half of that at the dealership has been sold to another third to a third party and so now these people can cancel\nTheir prepaid maintenance program if they want to buy another one that can buy from us but they can get their money back now okay but they couldn't until that dealer pulled completely out of the market so that was a that was a difficult period it was Costa may\nSomewhere between a three to five thousand dollars a month I was real say roughly how many customers did that affect ... figure coming in about forty percent of the customers that that they had sold Nissan to over new sounds too over a period of about Eighteen months to a year\nOr two years had purchased the prepaid language there are pretty good percentage a good number yeah and so we were ah we were doing the free world changes you know there for ...\nSo we're trying to convert those folks over to our program which is grudge genius and um they can they can you know by prepaid maintenance from us now and and his six month period gone by now\nYes okay and I thought at him and it has created a you know some people that they have a hard time understanding this this whole idea that well now wait a minute I bought a Nissan\nUh bought prepaid maintenance and now you're the knee Sunday or my prepaid maintenance should be good with you\nYeah you know it's the same thing you know there are two different kinds of um\nUm extended warranties or after market warranties um sometimes they're called ... in in the industry there called service contracts because it's really not a war idea warranty is something that a manufacturer that people who made the product\nUses to do a warranty their products against effects in material and workman ship yeah okay so if something fails they're supposed to stand behind it and\nA service contract is what you buy two uh and again there are often referred to as extended warranties um\nThat uh will pay for repairs based on the contract for a period of time and a certain um mileage yeah yeah so if you have a uh\nIf you have a a car that has a three year thirty six thousand mile bumper to bumper warranty from the manufacturing you can purchase a service contract\nAll right that sounds good that's going to be this edition of my car guru on this Halloween ... edition we appreciate you joining

rabbi Jeffrey Myers was or he invited Trump he was on television\nAnd they said that um that he invites the president ... president the United states he said as welcoming my synagogue any time and of course now he is the target of threats and hates and I hate speech isn't it but but that's okay because\nBecause it's coming from Democrats I guess so that makes it All right and then as we know the news media they air brush out all hate speech of the left and and it never\nSinks to the level of hate speech just wholesome political rhetoric to call your fellow Americans deplorable as an era deem a bowl and racist or homophobic can massage therapist and Islamophobia and whatever else it is\nA big cause uh that's just the these are the rules there's the rules of the place that's how it works so\nI'm going to have audio of the rabbi to who um who is now having threats the usual it's the original stuff it's it's oh al ... al it's all Al Gore's fault if he hadn't gifted us the Internet's in

way here that's actually the horrible genocide that again the United nations and Bill Clinton stood around with their hands in their pockets and\nThat effectively nothing about\nBill Clinton has said he regrets that I and of course not cheating on his wife more there are two things that he regrets\nWatching the Rwanda Genocide happening not lifting a finger to do anything about it and not cheating on Hillary more\nThe two things\nThe first one is set in public the other he you know when you send a I saw there was a uh the Clintons were invited to a um\nGathering recently in in in in the invitation noted and pan and the bottom of the invitation was pants are mandatory for this event\nPants wear pants\nSo President Trump yesterday this is just a great example of of how filthy corrupt the news media has become President Trump tweeted yesterday ... you heard he has a Twitter account if you heard anything about this a a tweeted yesterday he said [noise]\nAnd I read this yesterday there is great anger in our country caused in part by inaccurate and even fraudulent reporting of the news he wrote the fake news media the true enemy of the people\nMust stop the open and obvious hostility toward him and Republicans and his voters and so on report the news accurately unfairly\nThat will do much to put out the flame now here's the thing I agree with him I Do agree with him\nI wouldn't personally use the enemy of the people think and I've said this from the first time to use that that particular phrase I'm not a fan of that phrase I don't think it's it's helpful and I'm all for punching back and all this stuff that I that's just not a phrasing that I Would just\nIn any event he very specifically as he has repeatedly in the past although I did I Do believe that he wants referred to the news media is not the fake news media as the enemy of the people I think that's wrong I don't think that's right I think the news media is horrible an awful and corrupt and there should be called out at all the time but uh but I'd stop somewhere this side of\nOf that phrasing that set moving on\nFake news media the true enemy of the people well then Jim Acosta he's got a Twitter account too and he says we are not the enemy of the people I guess that he is embracing the mantle of the fake news media because he quite explicitly\nReferred to the fake news media comma the true enemy of the people come must stop the open an obvious hostility and report news accurately and fairly well CNN and Jimmy ... nothing to do with any of that reporting the news accurately unfairly is not their thing he's serious she's bitter\nWith President Trump very specifically and personally apparently\nAnd again when I was working at CNN there is no way my bosses would've allowed Jim Acosta to stay at the White House and do what he's doing not a chance not a chance that my bosses and Turner no relation to Ted Turner who was the kind of the big boss at CNN in Atlanta\nNever would have allowed anything like this my boss bill headline his name was bill headline the bureau chief in Washington for very long time\nNever would have allowed anything like this to go on for a day much less two years so it's just not a news organization it's a fake news organization Jim Acosta is not a real journalist he's a fake journalist\nSo I guess it's appropriate that he that he take on the fake news media mental the yoke and carry it because it's his to carry\nSo he tweeted back in response in a bitter thin skinned sort of way we are not the enemy of the people that is the fake news he's the fact that of course\nI Am not your enemy no actually you are President Trump's enemy you've made that abundantly clear on numerous occasions and to pretend otherwise it's just more fake news they now I Am not your enemy that's a lie that's not true\nJim Acosta is lying and this week we are not the enemy of the people if you are fake news then you are the enemy of ah of journalism let's say you know the enemy of civil discourse you're the enemy of the truth you're you're the enemy of honesty\nAnd ... and you are gender cost is all of those things is anti honesty his anti truth he's an anti truth and reporting an honesty\nAnd reporting you are not my enemy he says\nWell you should treat them like your enemy and I've got to say that all evidence to the country Jim\nThis is we are not the enemy of the people there is something wrong with that sentence because he's weighing claimed to being the fake news media All right I guess you could do that that's good for a laugh but he's not smart enough to realize that he's taking on the cause of the fake news am I right of course I Am\nHe says I Am not your enemy clearly you are you are not my enemy clearly he is just based on the empirical evidence that I've collected over the last two and a half to three years\nIt is wrong to kill call your fellow Americans the enemy or it's also a wrong to call them ... deplorable it's wrong to call every one racist Islamophobia become a father every slur or you can come up as if you've got to\nThe menu of slur as available in the English language Hillary Clinton referred to her fellow Americans as all of those slurs and then on top of that said\nWe are deplorable and ...\nNow ... is a big word that has a lot of connotation and ah this woman refers to us that way quite regularly and we learned after it became public after she started saying in public\nThat this was a big hit a Democrat fundraisers that she had tried this out again and again and again among Friendly's in Manhattan in Beverly Hills who hate everybody in between on and like the fly private when they go back and forth\nUm because they see America that way I got I I Believe this is true on some level the famous New Yorker magazine cover that shows Manhattan and you know then the St Louis arch and a cactus and then San Francisco in Japan the Pacific ocean in Japan\nThat's the starting point of the Trump revolution\nBecause the New York the coastal elites says they like to refer to themselves they're bi coastal too and that's a double entendre and in many many cases\nThey see fly over a country as a a swath of land they want nothing to do with filled was deplorable iridium of all races bigoted stupid ignorant people ah that that they you know flush while they're flying over\nAnd that's their view of the American people that is on some level the starting point of of the age of Trump\nAnd it is wrong to call your fellow Americans the enemy\nShall I go down the list Jim Acosta how about Dan Rather as ... over the weekend that all Trump supporters are guilt and it's again it's the rise of fascism and Nazi isn't minutes Hitler and and this is the reading we get on CNN on your network Jim you can't disown it it's your network\nHe says we're all in the same team you know what Jim you and I are not on the same team we're not on the same team were not in the same team on any level I really don't think oh if there were a giant meteor coming toward the earth then we'd be on the same thing until that happens I really don't think we're on the same time and it's a\nI don't I'm not the problem here because I'm actually quite reasonable and easy to get along with [laughter] we're all Americans he says well you know uh I guess half of us are deplorable era ... racist blah blah blah so President Trump is actually\nYou know it says that will do much to put out the flame it says of anger but at the flame of anger and outrage and we will then be able to bring all sides together in peace and harmony fake news must end\nHonestly President Trump is really onto something here there needs to be a reformation in the journalism business\nThere needs to be a major and I don't I don't know what will prompt does ah I mean again I with all the hatred\nThat CNN and MSNBC put out I marvel at the fact that President Trump and I hate to even say this out loud that President Trump is a shot at every day by some left it\nThere was one and we don't know how many how many death threats have been lodged against President Trump but I'm sure the number is extraordinary\nRemember how they tried to claim that Obama got more death threats because he's black and on the head of the secret service came out and said no that's not the case under oath on Capitol Hill and the news media and the Democrats just kept repeating it anyway because they don't care that that's sort of their bag baby now I'm guessing that prison\nDrop you remember there was one English illegal alien that tried to
