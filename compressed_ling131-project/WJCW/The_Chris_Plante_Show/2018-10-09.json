line as it doesn't this show it says you asked me this question but that question was asked an act one and we're at the end of act too and I have to kind of streamline it\nMy way interesting and they've been back to you a course talking about lines or you're just a moment ago from Gleason the um the you you mentioned learning how to memorize lines and of course anybody who's ever acted you know you got to do this too so what are what ... what technique do you use or did you learn or have you developed on your own\nI I've used many techniques it just depends on how many lines I have and how big the character is now with this one I didn't want to mess it up at all ... and I\nHave a very short amount of time to do this is the shortest amount of time I ever learn how to learn my lines and so I hadn't flash cards and so what I Would do is write my cue line and then I Would ... my line\nThen I Would just go you know like I read the Q line I'm like okay this is what line it is and that's how I learned and beforehand I just had the script and they'll learn everybody's lives and focus I just you know I always I was a\nAnd like my senior year I was helping my director out a bunch because he was my a drama teacher sat up Peggy Russell but uh she\nWas like each one of the seniors to help out and see how the show when and make sure the show state of floating so I Would try to help out as much as I can I just you know ... kinda familiarize myself with everybody's lines mill\nA Gleason same with you generally or do you have your own technique approach\nI use so many different techniques for this folk um [laughter] I I did the flash card\nThing for the majority of back to the act one it was just I'm going to read the line I'm going to\nRead it to myself I'm going to look away from the script make sure I got it right and look back if I don't make sure I get it right five it right move onto the next one um there's different techniques where you could memorize how many words are an alliance of you know the number four three eight\nYou start feeling it in because you know you have that many words a sentence or you can remember what's the first a letter of each word in your ... or what's the first letter of just the sentence coming up because sometimes especially with the script\nAs the characters are getting more and more immersed in the plot they're not as coherent as they were early on so they're saying things kind of off the wall to using these different techniques I use whatever it helped me learn that specific line mhm yep uh\nTina from your perspective because you've uh you have a directly the number of the productions as well to do you have any tips for aspiring actors or actresses who would uh uh maybe have never memorize something before but still want to get on the stage\nAnd really just depends on your your learning technique for for anything anything you've used for school too you know memorizing facts are figures or anything on a lot of what the boys say a lot of what I Do as a similar to Greece and I'll get the first line\nHad the first line than add the second\nKind of like a trigger sort of thing yeah yeah just\nKind of well kind of like building blocks you get the first one down and then you add the second line on and yet a third sentencing you just keep going that way um that that writing it over and over a a lot of people say in a Muslim to what the voice said is a it's something that helps them a lot\nTo ride it out and then just becoming a character in rent and and not trying to remember lines that were written for you but to make them your own helps a whole lot as well\nVery good uh thinking out loud right now with folks from things for theater guild great guys ... production tell us about

and inland\nBut National Hurricane center warns Michael May be labeled a major hurricane by landfall tomorrow and Florida governor Rick Scott is warning residents to obey evacuation orders\nAnd I'm One of the things they talked about\nWas something that I ... and it's called the marketing Hubble\nThe marketing funnel people who are in this bizarre is not just the carpets but in any business has to think about and just a badge and a final and at the very top of the ...\nThat's where you have marketing campaigns that's where you\nTry to get um the attention at people and the first phase of that is called awareness\nAnd so her first of all you have to appear on somebody's right our bill\nYou know that's why we advertise on television I'm that's why you know you'll see a billboard from us occasionally or other dealers you just said a lot of dealers try to just do things to get people within their final uh you're trying to create top of mind to where it is\nA lots of ways to do that I'm a social media videos direct mail\nUm a lot of a search engine optimization now these are things\nThat that we talk about today that we weren't even talk about Fifteen Years ago and then once you build awareness you have to\nDevelop interest that the next phase\nAnd the final and um be beyond that you have to get them to evaluate what you had\nYou've got their attention or you are working on them to keep them thinking about you\nAnd then you get them into the evaluation say as to which product of yours\nThat they are going to buy\nAnd uh then the final\nUm to phase is our commitment and sale\nAnd so you know and then then you have an arrow that goes all the way back into the top of the funnel again so you know it's kind of like a a pipeline that we're trying to create\nA to keep people in the family so to speak you know I look at\nI look at our a customer base and know\nIf you draw concentric circles like a like a target\nI'm In very center of the people that that do the most business with us when they think about\n... are getting their car service they automatically think of us and they come to us when they think about buying a car automatically they can't go out one more rang\nAnd there are a little less loyal you know that there were there\nAnd they do buy from us but they maybe don't use this as frequently maybe they're torn between us and another dealership in town\nGo out a little bit further even less oil\nI go out beyond that and\nThey may not have even heard of you\nAnd so our goal is always to push him\nTowards the middle and towards the center and that's what we did with this a\nMarketing funnel so that's that's how marketers are thinking\nAt the beginning of ... beginning of every quarter a beginning of every month you know what are we going to do even this week you know to draw attention to us and that's quite a challenge bill mhm um it used to be radio TV newspaper\nAnd ... and billboards and that was pretty much it I mean that was the only way you had to reach\nThe buying public and now this whole Internet thing um you know people are abandoning traditional media\nAre in favor of the more direct approach which is to the little hand set that I'm Talking on right now\nThe cell phone so it is kind of an interesting a\nWorld that we're in the things we have to pay attention to we'll take our first break and be back and talk a little

world\nMhm I'd probably picked the wrong one I'd probably go with Honda\nWell it's actually a actually a Franco Japanese alliance\nWhich Franco stands for France yeah\nAnd it has to do with Renault\nNissan and Mitsubishi ... so they are now there were no Nissan a law that says now number one they barely out so the Volkswagen so far today Toyota is third and General Motors\nIs fourth those manufactured how do you keep track of five billion two hundred and sixty eight\nNow what pushed run out of Nissan over the top was they added Mitsubishi the thirty four percent stake in Mitsubishi so\nYou will see some shared product with Mitsubishi\nAround the world you will see for example the new Nissan Kicks\nIs a there is a Mitsubishi version of that car not so in the United states and I think it's ... she doesn't do very well in the United states they're doing better\nUh they were one of those companies that came on strong and\nBlew up um\nRight after I bought the franchise so my time and stuff mhm\nYeah they went from selling ... five hundred or they might sound three hundred and fifty thousand cars to two years later they were selling forty thousand ...\nYeah it was it was a not not a good or not a good thing\nBut when you look at at market share in the United states General Motors is number one is sixteen and a half percent Toyota\nNumber two at fourteen point seven\nThen forwarded fourteen point for Ford and Toyota kind of\nGo back and forth there than the at Chrysler\nI'm at\nTwelve point nine Nissan Mitsubishi non point three they that group those two together for some reason\nHonda is way down there at that point too yeah and Hyundai key a Subaru\nVolkswagen and BMW not folks wagon is doing so well in the world why aren't they doing well you\nI don't know what the answer that question is other than reputation um the diesel gate\nI maybe I don't maybe so hurt yeah that hurt 'em a lot\nBut they had just never been able to put it all together in this country a Volkswagen is really big and China number one in China as a matter of fact\nAnd that that is one of the reasons why they're number one in the world is because they they do so so well they're the class of two thousand Nineteen is looking pretty good they are a lot of new and redesigned cars and trucks\nA Chevrolet took the plunge with the new Silverado\nIt's already
