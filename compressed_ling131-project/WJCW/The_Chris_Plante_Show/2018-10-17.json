left wing regimes\nHave populations that live on two dollars a day and and they don't want to call that an abject poverty so they lowered it they move the bar they do this all the time and you'd think

left just loves not just Michael Moore they all love it it's a slave ship it's a plantation\nAnd uh the average Cuban lives on less than two dollars a day less than two dollars a day\nAnd and they don't want to say that I live in abject poverty so they moved to the bar\nThat's that's what they do in any event Honduras Guatemala moved to stop migrant caravan after Trump threats oh no Trump is

for a second\nYou know the infection that is the left um has spread it spread to the United states under the ... of rock Obama administration\nAnd then Brock Obama sought to it that it spread also to

and where do you think all the people got briefed on what they need to say to customs and border protection and and and to ice you got to say oh I'm leaving because I fear for my life because of the violence in my country I'd be ... and they get briefed on it right now is true for some people it's true\nBut not for everybody and they bring them up on it so they've got this community organizer that's marching a caravan of about three thousand people toward the United states they're going to walk they don't they're not going to take a boat they're not going to take a plane\nThey are going to walk and guess what the plan is to have them walk and walk and walk and then they get here just before election day oh you see election day and the Democrats are work and I don't know if you saw this story a couple of days ago the Democrats have pulling this came out about a week ago the Democrats have polling\nThat show that the Latino vote in America which they expect will go to them because they're racist\nWill be weak will be fame will be less than what they want on election day for the midterm elections when they must win back the house so they can and pizza and up in the American government and and bring the revolution and the civil war more rapidly than they are currently able to bring up\n\nThe Democrats\nHave a dog in this fight and the organizer down there I'm going to guess he knows people here I just I don't I Can't say that for certain but I'm going to guess that the organizer of a migrant caravan from Honduras was detained in Guatemala on Tuesday as the U.S government that's President Trump\nThreatened to withdraw aid from both countries and El Salvador if the flow of migrants north to the United states was not stopped\nTake that\nUp to three thousand migrants courting organizers estimates crossed the from Honduras into Guatemala on a trek northward after a standoff on Monday with police in riot gear\nThe Honduran foreign ministry called on its citizens not to join the group\nNow the news media's been fanning the flames stoking and say oh it's growing every day it's doubled in size and it's because it's drama and it's a TV show it's made for

since Saturday\nHe moves followed comments by US President Donald Trump those his administration would hold aid\nIf the Central American government's did not act his latest effort to demonstrate his tough stance on immigration the on that's not really the tough stance on immigration but it's true they present the United states made it clear\nThat the governments will be held accountable and Central America if they allow this be asked to continue and you know because we throw money around all over the place like we're a diamond Jim and we're not twenty trillion dollars in debt\nWe throw money to Honduras and El Salvador Guatemala and everybody else and to Saudi Arabia gets us into that and you know it but but listen because we give aid to those countries the president was able rock Obama could have done this too but he didn't\nThe president was able to say listen you guys are sitting here watching this and you know that you're being a pain in our butts and we're going to pull the plug on the aid that we said you are harder and taxpayer dollars\nAnd unless you stop them and guess what's happening\n[noise] and guess what's happening and guess what's happening\nAnd just in case that that isn't clear enough the president is a busy on Twitter this morning is reinforcing this because he's going to make it stop unlike the ... and the little girls of the Democratic party in the media and um\nI repeat myself Donald Trump on his Twitter account Donald J Trump president United States not Hillary die on route him put\nThey treated the United states has strongly informed or the president of Honduras that if the large caravan of people heading to the U.S has not stopped and brought back to Honduras no more money or aid will be given to Honduras effective\nImmediately you
