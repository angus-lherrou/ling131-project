I said Katrina what were you study in college you know without hesitation she said I Will become a nurse\nI was frankly will surprise by a quick response I had spoken earlier that day to a medical doctor had and he told me the doctors and nurses had a tough time and they were paid very little\nWhich is kind of amazing thing but I guess this is my confession to use a pastor and the father of two dollars but my first thought was to cancel this young girl and challenge or to look for a better paying job I said ... why are you choosing to become a nurse\nAnd she said I had prayed and I believe that God wants me to come back here so that I can care for all of the old people in our church and in our town you know friends what I heard in her voice and when I saw on her face in the bright smile on her face was the reality of the living Christ\nHer decision came from the roots of her faith in God it was not a plan for a career to see how much money she can make it was a plan for a career that would be calling to serve now of course don't miss\nThey send me a career in accounting could be the very same thing but for her it was a response to needs that she saw and her faith in God\nYou know as I listened that afternoon to those young people I was overwhelmed by their concern for other teenagers in the community they told me a story about how to young men had been on drugs and they're using their church had surrounded those boys with love and care\nAnd you know what today those young men are in the university one plan to work with teenagers on drugs\nAnd the other was headed to be a pastor in a church\nThe faith of those young people was so deep and so rich I I just I wanted a little bit of it myself\nIt was a kind of faith that came from experience you see there was a town next to them called the city to raise Ian ... remembers where the Germans made the dreaded panzer tanks during World War two it was also one of the worst concentration camps and the Holocaust\nI was told that the people have to raise the and at first did not have any idea that there was a concentration camp or is it the horrors happening there\nThe Germans just said it was an arsenal for building tanks\nAfter the Germans came the communist\nBothered right behind him that people were beaten down and they were shamed in their faith in God came at a very high price some lost their way\nBut what I read began to realize is that these young people had seen and experienced the fate of their parents and their grandparents they're Seventy four year old pastor had lived through right through the middle of some of those horrors and their ...\nAnd you know what he told me that his faith had sustained him he was frightening scared but they kept on going and\nThese young check students could not mistake this kind of fate as fake are phoney\nAnd Jesus knew that the fate of the world rested on these young men and these young women before him that day they had to have a belief that would be an ... an ... wherever you would be sure there was no room for doubt\nI think Jesus did three very important thing you know this is not a three point serve and but it's three things that he did once he showed them the scars and the moon's from his body he came to them to show them the crucifixion and then he ate with him and did something then very very powerful did you notice what it was\nWell before I tell you I Want to remind you the loop was not a Jew our best understanding that Luke was a gentile there was a doctor and a loyal friend of the apostle Paul your company Paul and his second missionary journey he kept prolific notes in his diary and I think we believe that he is responsible for not only the gospel of loop\nBut also for the acts of the apostle\nNow here's the third thing\nJesus took these disciples to the roots of their fate\nHe reminded them of the scriptures looks at these words he said Jesus said these are my words that I spoke to you while I was still with you\nThat everything that was written about me and the law of Moses the profits and the sons must be fulfilled it says then he opened their minds to the scriptures dust that is written you said\nThat the messiah is to separate the rise from the dead on the third day and that repentance and forgiveness have since yesterday proclaiming his name to all nations beginning from Jerusalem\nYou are the witnesses of the things he said no friends we do not know what the disciples said but we know that they were convinced that it was Jesus to whom they were speaking and that they could trust their lives to the resurrection\nYou know faith without a history as they say is like a loose cannon on the deck they without the scriptures can turn into all sorts of terrible things there's been in our history in this recent history people who have taken poison I remember thirty nine men and women just a couple of years ago\nWho took this poison because they thought something was going to happen I mean I can remember all of this terrible\nThat the thing that happened in Texas so many things that can happen without a solid foundation both witness and the text\nI can tell you for myself that that there are times when faith just gets kind of thin but I can take my scriptures and sit down and ... even the song\nAnd read and remember the witness if they and what the foundation of the scriptures have in my fate is restored I invite you to try that if you're if you're wavering at all remember we had a solid foundation in the text and then the witness of others or man of\nYour news off

yet when you study other cultures you just don't see this especially Asian cultures these are people who live longer and have less diseases\nAnd in large part it has to do with what they're consuming in their diet which is primarily a diet that is centered around see vegetables in fact I remember Dr why should you may recall reading studies about how these Japanese men\nThere are over there are one of the biggest populations of smokers in on the planet and yet they get less lung cancer then other people in the world who smoke less and of course some of that has to do with the green tea they drink all day long but it also has to do what they see vegetables that they're consuming that our\nAnswer doting or ... the adverse effects of their smoking habit\n[noise] yeah yeah what you're
