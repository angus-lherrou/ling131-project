there is no West Virginia I just envy you were born in Bluefield, Virginia count me no it was really digging at a bar and I have\nA big big on\nAnd even through that we remained good friend over the years [laughter] but uh yeah so anyway I thought that was kind of a nice story now since you left a channel eleven in two thousand nine mhm and then you went to Erie, Pennsylvania\nMissouri I did and they let me banker up there and that was a different world I didn't get to report there I was just an anchor\nWhich is a great job if you can get it but it wasn't my favorite job\nMom and I like Erie was a nice place to be for a short period of time and I always said that it was kind of like a good place to go I wanted to be closer to home but once I got there I realize that just want it to be home [laughter] save and I was there for a few years and they went back to West Virginia did TV for a little bit and radio for a while and now I work in higher education\nYeah due to West Virginia I

some morning radio but I got to do talk chef for a brief period of time I was there and ... was from like eight thirty to ten or if they could sell at eight thirty half hour then we can go we only had to work nine to ten oh okay and then the rest of the day was news for me sad very probably there certainly\nYeah it is kind of similar to what we have here yeah and I told her when she first got the job in in that particular radio show I said in that something we both did TV and now we're both doing morning radio talk ... and I said that's kinda how things are happening with all these really strange\nAnd we didn't predict that no I didn't see that kind of known on\nThe well I mean I kind of always felt I'd go back to radio and I told you this many ... wrote it after the kids got grown it was my desire to get back to radio and I was stupid to people that when they come up to me on the street in a\n... you know I look I must say don't you know who I don't know when they say things have kind of a big deal and tries to do it at the radio audience laws then\nYou know they say you know uh\nWhy are you doing radio or whatever what did you leave the TV and that kind of thing and I said
