the fifties and sixties seems to kind of gravitated I found out from these records from the John ... what have you\nBack next year talking about the twenty nine session how that would be wonderful well go ahead and put it on your calendar than thinking out loud right now is Dr Ted Olson with Appalachians studies that eat the issue and they very very fervent a proponent of Appalachian music old time music and so on\nThe um and as this began to accumulate a in a in history I mean we have the sessions taking place twenty seven twenty eight twenty nine I'm pretty soon they were in Knoxville sessions which you've been involved with right\nRight there was a parallel session a you know it happened in Nineteen twenty nine in Nineteen thirty two sets of recording sessions in Knoxville\nWhich were very different from the Bristol sessions which of course influenced a country music and measurably in the Johnson City sessions which influence the urban folk music revival heavily ... and then what happened in Knoxville\nI Would say was perhaps less influential per se but he's a wonderful document\nOf you know the diversity of musical farms in Appalachia including a lot of African American music and a lot of\nUm shall we say I'm certain styles of novelty recording then we're not hurt spoken word and that sort of thing that we're not heard really in Bristol or Johnson City so [noise] um than Knoxville sessions are very different from the John ... sessions which are very different from the Bristol\nRight so there you go in I Would imagine with the uh the outpouring of great music from this kind of a region other areas of the country going wait we got great music over here to ... was there another groundswell if you will of uh of recording sessions across the country\nWell unfortunately what ended up happening is what everybody's heard of a great question exactly the great depression put an end to a lot of the location recording sessions that were happening throughout the twenties\nAnd and you know very fortunately people like Ralph here and and Frank Walker ... came to Appalachian before the depression hit and put an end to this sort of recording\nBecause just at the tail end of the twenties we get the Bristol sessions the Johnson City sessions to Knoxville sessions\nThe three great written a location recording sessions in Appalachia which documented so much important Appalachian music\nAnd then it all stopped it all stopped nationally very very little a location recording continued after that point there there were some sessions primarily in the area of the blues recording\nFor example Robert Johnson was reported in the mid thirties at a very small location recording session and in Texas I'm at that happened twice in Texas so a ... is the practice continued but not at the at the level as it had happened in the twenties and\nAppalachian recording sessions tended to and you know with the with these three rage or eat out tendency recording session\nBut until that happened till the depression came along Johnson City that was a ... place\nOh absolutely and so much what's going on here who is the\nUh you know twenties boom time and of course\nThe a myth of Al Capone being you know kind of any us in the area well Chicago the interesting thing about the Johnson City sessions recordings is that they're\nThey're like an historical

fourth and then that job stops at the factory was going to pay three tenths of an hour um it took him an hour and a half you know to get it done\nSo this is the uh the power that that the manufacturer has over car dealers most dealers will not turn away warranty work\nA warranty work can be profitable and it's important part of our business but it has become less and less and less so over the years warranty back in the seventies we had the Chevy store over on church street in Greenville lost in Chevrolet that uh\nUh the dealership probably made fifty percent of its revenue came from warranty repairs um now it's less than less than twenty percent of our revenue comes from warranty repairs rest of it as customers are paying for ... or extended warranties and that type of stuff\nSo um you know vehicle breaks we have to go by this labor time guide but a California I was having a problem with the the way this was being calculated that it wasn't fair but\nJerry Brown who is a up on apologetic plea or so a liberal Democrat and a sided with um consumer somehow I mean he saw that this this would benefit consumers any sided not with car dealers who were in his state\nWho are generating sales tax revenue and stuff like that for the state of California in\n... he sided with auto makers they're\nSaying that by this new formula it was going to increase the cost\nOf repairs and therefore harm consumers somehow even though the manufacturers are paying for this under warranty [laughter] he said because they were going to have to increase their warranty cost the manufacturers more cost\nWho are the manufacturer is going to pass those cost increases\nTo ultimately the consumer\nSo they're gonna you know consumers are going to have to pay more for cars because of this so that's why he decided against them so I'm auto makers\nWere happy I bet car dealers are not so I'd say Jerry Brown is not going to be able to get some as big a donations from car dealers as as he might have you know before state franchise laws are designed to protect\nDealers and also protect consumers in terms of competition um I Can't I Can't come up here\nAnd a pitch a tent at the Johnson City mo and start selling Ford's mhm or nay sons or anything else um\nNumber one I don't have a license to do that number two the manufacture strictly for hip it's my ability to to do that we have to protect ourselves you know from our ... you know dealers from dealers but also state franchise laws are designed to protect dealers from\nThe manufacturer from arbitrary um restrictions and guidelines and stuff like that that not only harm dealers but ultimately harm consumers as well so it's a delicate balance you know I'm sure in all other industries there are\nThings that you have to deal with with the you know the the company's above you and uh the ones who control and then government regulations Trump was talking the other day about you know just the power of regulations\nAnd

says all the laughter it's up to the ... all because of the left or we've got a federal judge with a decade decade and a half of service and the\nDC circuit court the second highest court in the land or were they still are record a pristine record who just stated right through the congressional hearings and the confirmation process until the Democrats and their machine dug up the\nChristian Ford

Harris say well I Believe her and she with a big smile well and that's because you're an idiot I guess you're dishonest you can't be trusted with the position\nWith which you have been entrusted and uh and if\nYou make decisions like that based on that then you're not a serious person and I have no respect for your whatsoever if you'd be willing to destroy a man's life he carefully built a career as a lawyer and a judge over the course of many decades\nAnd and you would be destroyed because senators like Campbell Harris come out and say I believe her\nBecause I read a couple of sentences in the Washington Post today what a disgrace she shouldn't be allowed to serve on jury duty much less the Senate Judiciary committee\nHow embarrassing for all of us that we have senators with sexual reprehensible a low standards\nAnd then you have the the weeny wagging up our Ramirez woman from Yale University Yale College when I was a freshman and I think I even printed that out again today\nThe New York times when I was a freshman Z Brett Kavanaugh wagged as weeny in my face you know like Bill Clinton did with Paula Jones which Bill Clinton did with Paula Jones and ah and told her to kiss kiss it and they all love Bill Clinton they'd you know they are well I'll just leave it at that\nThe New York times destroyed her credibility by investigating her claims\nAnd discovering when they called all of her friends they talk to they said more than thirty six people trying to get to the bottom of ms Ramirez claims that Brett Kavanaugh ... and\nThey said that a bunch of her friends were contacted by her by Ramirez in the week proceeding the New York times contact and and and and that Ramirez told her friends I don't remember who it was\nThen a week later after talking to her lawyers she went to the New Yorker and Ronan Farrow and that other awful person and said yeah it was Brett Kavanaugh and they were when they published it\nBut if it didn't meet the threat threshold for the New York times which has remarkably low standards when it comes to reporting on Republicans on Donald Trump but I'm Brett Kavanaugh incredibly low standards very low\nYou know they should have sent alley Watkins out there to sleep with a bunch of guys and tried to get some information because that's how the New York times gets a lot of skills you know handing out sexual favors in exchange for scoops\nAlley Watkins is her name she's a reporter at the New York times she got a promotion moved her to New York when they found out she was sleeping around for scoops it's a good deal no problem\nThat's journalism today she is she going to lose sight block shaped like a shaped like a ...\nAnd then we have the the third one come along good old what's her name\nWith the claims of gang rape yes what Julie sweating it Julie sweating it comes out with the creepy porn lawyer and she has this affidavit for which she should be sentenced to decades in prison because she confessed to a series of felonies being of the age of majority\nAs she was at the time when she was watching Fifteen year olds dragging little girls and gang raping them and she didn't do anything about it those are felonies that she admitted to and that creepy porn lawyer\nThing and then when she was interviewed about it she said well what I can really say is that I saw Brett Kavanaugh handing out red solo cups at a party and then they were standing around talking to each other\nThat's what it boils down to when she was on camera critic foreign lawyer should be disbarred and maybe I'll go to jail and then he can run for president as a Democrat from prison he can share with Anthony wiener I'm sure they have a lot in common\nAnd this is what everybody's resting their coup fees on here their their uh this is the this is the scope always a sexual predator oh don't forget he threw a cup of ice on somebody during a scuffle at a bar at Yale and Connecticut and sometime in the Nineteen eighties and they don't really have much on that\nAnd that's what they have that's what they did that's what the Democrats and there's a kind of um you know unstable woman from California who is naturally a college professor what else what you do who who I don't know I'm afraid to fly except what I'm not\nAnd all of the information that's come out from ex boyfriends and people that know these people that have undermined their their stories or rather than bolstering their stories even people that they they refer the news media to these people these people will corroborate my story there for the government to these people these people were corroborate my stories and then they don't\nCorroborate their stories\nAnd so if you're buying into this you're too easily fooled you're too easily deceived\nAnd now comes the vote in fact in just a short time they vote begins about Fifteen minutes Thirteen minutes they vote is supposed to begin on the floor of the United States Senate now this is not the confirmation vote this is a procedural vote that will move the process forward\nOr has to do with the ending debates on the subject of confirming Brett Kavanaugh allowing for a certain number of hours and blah blah blah then it's over it's an arcane procedural votes were expecting that to begin at ten thirty I can expect the Democrats will seek to disrupt that's\nTo deter railed vats\nTo derail democracy and our democratic process sees the Democrats are going to be ... hurt when all of this and said and done their uh their faithful fanatics are going to be this spirited their ...\nBack we'll be broken their spirit will be crushed and when that happens President Trump should come out and uses he'll to grind them into the ground and to squirt lighter fluid all over them and set them on fire metaphorically of course\nWe should uh when this is Harvard has not over and I don't want to count my chickens to ah to gleefully before it's all over because the Democrats they got tricks up their slaves and they got a corrupt media working for them and they're still what were they pull it out today well does Dianne Feinstein pulling out today and the Washington Post that uh\nSome fake uh they've got they've got new fake ones but there are grasping at straws you know that he had an overdue book at the library or something we cannot have some on a library as a symbol of western civilization and learning and you have over drew book fees\nIs not this is not someone we can't allow to serve on the Supreme Court this is a lifetime appointment they'll keep saying and ah and yeah it said it calmed down it's an overdue book fine okay and yeah he threw a cup of ice on somebody in Nineteen eighty four get over it that's okay [noise]\nUh I you know how many people I Know that are not qualified based on in this criteria ... you know we had somebody\nCalling it earlier I asked uh what are the lessons learned here and somebody called in was hanging on the line I don't think he's on any more set of what I've learned is that I better not ever run for office [laughter]\nAnd that's a fact jak with so many of us now it looks like and it's all tea leaves at all this stuff but just as we were getting off the air yesterday morning twenty some odd hours ago\nUm we learned that senator Collins the Republican a moderate middle of the road Republican from Maine a lot of pressure to vote against\nReviewed the FBI documents said she found that documents the FBI review it to be thorough\nI'm senator Collins and um and Fox News is now reporting that senator Collins is a yes and and that is good news now is that on this procedural vote or on the uh the final final I think it's on the final final\nAnd that's very important because you know the balance in the Senate is fifty one Republicans and forty nights\nAnd Democrats one of them as Bernie Sanders he's a communist he calls himself an independent he's really a Democrat what's the difference\nSusan Collins apparently now a yes according to Fox News and then we have Jeff Flake the aptly named Jeff Flake\nWho caused the ah the delay and um I gotta tell ya if Jeff Flake votes against the ends up being the deciding vote bringing down the cabinet nominations or he'd better learn to speak Spanish because uh this is going to be no country for him after that I Believe that Jeff Flake will vote yes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter him and talking about all the frauds they pulled him alive and he said facts matter one of those\nThings are in the sex matter not to Democrats not to the media they don't but also I'm\nDianne Feinstein out there the this morning and she's upset she's just coming up with stuff that\nYou know that Lindsey Graham soundbite from yesterday that happened just we unfortunately it happened just as we went off the air yesterday but it was such a great Lindsey Graham soundbite now Dianne Feinstein today came out Senator Feinstein from California Democrat liberal ... case\nI had a Chinese spy on her employer for Twenty years until about twenty minutes ago and apparently that's not very important to not even a news story Chinese find yourself for Twenty years from New York Times is fine but CNN's good with that not a thing it's good to be a Democrat\nBut she was out there today railing about a judge Kavanaugh on guns they they like to say guns it's the second amendment to the bill of rights the constitution of the United states America vitally important to the preservation of a free\nPeoples plural around the world I was like the world with the word people's yeah sounds like it's a a fake word but she's out there and she's attacking him over what she calls guns what I call the second amendment\nAnd and that's her latest reason for opposing Brett Kavanaugh because I guess I don't know if she actually feel you believe the gang rape thing see nobody even asked these questions hey senator you believe that Brett Kavanaugh was gang raping teenage girls after slipping quaint loads and the\nPunch like a creepy porn lawyer said that's exactly how the question should be asked every two and then she could say over ... ask your Chinese spy\nMaybe he's got an answer for it so Lindsey Graham yesterday was tearing it up and he was a he was having a good time and and and he got you know the\nWhat is that it's the money python um is it the holy grail I guess it's search for the holy grail where they're trying to find out whether someone's a witch and they decided to find you know

that's kind of interesting for a couple of reasons [noise] the votes now the balance of the Senate again is fifty\nOne Republicans forty nine Democrats and the Senate of one hundred senators\nAnd the vote was in fact fifty one to forty nine but it was not a straight party line vote it was not a strict party line vote to senators crossed over what happened you might want to know\nSusan Collins voted yes now this was a procedural vote that ends debates on the Brett Kavanaugh nomination and starts the clock ticking thirty hours now most transpire before a vote can be taken\nAt on the confirmation of the final confirmation so that brings us to tomorrow afternoon and a one senator is going to have to get back here from Montana from his daughter's wedding\nBut in the vote that just went by Susan Collins voted yes to move the process forward\nJeff Flake voted yes to move the process forward however Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski from Alaska voted no she voted against moving forward\nHi you have a\nDemocratic Senator Joe Manchin from West Virginia voted yes to move the process forward now it's not the final yes vote or no vote but it looks like you have Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski who was a note today\nThat she would likely also be a note tomorrow it wouldn't make very much sense to vote\nNo when you're asked whether we should move it forward and then vote yes when you have a final vote so I'm going to go ahead and put on the board that Lisa Murkowski is I Know that brings the Republican vote [noise]\nDown to fifty because they only have fifty one vote that brings them down to fifty [noise] as long as Susan Collins votes yes and Jeff Flake votes yes then\nBrett Kavanaugh becomes a the associate justice of the Supreme Court because the vice president United States my parents can come in and break the tie in the United States Senate because as any school child can tell you the vice president the United states is the president of the Senate\nKind of a strange thing but that's what they call them and uh so that would bring it across the finish line even without Lisa Murkowski\nThere is a bit of a wild card when it comes to Joe mansion he voted yes to move it forward as a Democrat but that doesn't mean he's going to be a yes tomorrow afternoon\nBecause the Democrats are going to threaten him and ... they're going to threaten the murder of his family are going to threatened to burn his house down you know threatened to ruin his political career Joe Manchin has a pretty tough guy the fact it might just or Kim if you come in and threaten them like that\nSo that's a a a big big step but we're still on the edge of our seats it's a it's like a drag race Senate smoking a U.S thirty drag strip will sell you the hold seats but you'll only need

the U.S Capitol police officers and are these crazy shrieking not case women\nWere were yelling at him and are waving their hands Adam ends up and a Senator Hatch getting on the elevator kind of held up his hand and went like just like ... where does enter\nOne of them and they're screaming and they're angry because that's what they do police officer and then these women are trying to get on the elevator like Jeff like Jeff Flake stood there and took it\nAnd I I don't think any place where the ... the ...\nAnd and these women are getting their hands in the elevator doors keeping the doors open and police officer said to one of the women\nYou're about to be arrested I'm going to arrest you are right and then she backed off a but a little little slice of what's going on on Capitol Hill

like these mental cases and jamming their hands in the elevator door and yelling you ... piece of that and all that stuff [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] sure that's it that's a that's the new civility they do that at restaurants they do that an airports they do it they do it this is the Democratic party vote for them if you want a civil war or put them in power Orrin Hatch was great yesterday actually not just in the elevator where he gave him a little bit of what for back\nBut they held a press conference the Republican leadership and uh the snap or was there and a lot of them were there or natural great though he was as a fire I started writing stuff down as soon as he showed up\nLike I'm disappointed by democratic colleagues for what they're doing they're so excuse for a but they're doing it\n'cause I'm I'm disappointed this was this was like the old rules of the Senate of politeness and civility which are not observed by the Democrats and never have been a modern times I'm disappointed and my democratic colleagues are that they're doing this but they're doing a\nSenator Hatch you know you got anything that disqualifies a federal judge from moving up the Supreme Court\nMany of us who said that if a judge cabinet did what he's been accused of doing by some of the Democrats and outside people some outside people should be disqualified but after investigations for both the committee\nAnd the FBI and the media we have found nothing absolutely nothing to cooperate accusations against him and we need to confirm him\nRight away and we need to confirm him right away it takes a while about the role of the Democrats and this\nThis confirmation will be a victory for the Senate isn't institutions through reminder that the politics of baseless personal destruction has no place here\nYeah well it's got a place there Schumer is office that's the place that it has there a Senator Hatch on I'm a I'm Kevin ... and this is entirely appropriate the Senate should apologize to Brett Kavanaugh for this horrible slander\nI think he's one of the best nominees I've seen in my forty two years in the United States Senate [noise]\nThat's how I judge to him for the way he's been treated\nWhich is entirely appropriate they should have an official apology from Schumer and the slime crew that pulled this job off which is what it is is that Chuck Grassley who will say you know I I I he's he showed up\nMan he showed up he uh he seems like an old ... ... with a long have seeds taken out of his mouth or something but uh he made it happen and he's taken from

to the uh for two weeks now both for Kavanaugh and against Kavanaugh\nAnd a one time the people at work for Kavanaugh wanting to be interviewed\nAnd they said we only enter we're only interested in view interviewing people against\nKavanaugh now is that that's a fire that none of you shouldn't be calling us [laughter]\nBut they are they are [laughter]\nSenator Grassley was that on the Fox news
