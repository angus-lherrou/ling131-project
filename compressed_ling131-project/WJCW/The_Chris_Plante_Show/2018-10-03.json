Blasey Ford's testimony last Thursday was blocked by President Trump and his rally in Mississippi\nThe story of to kill a mocking bird is destroy a small southern town what it was called make coal Mississippi I Believe a black man named Tom Robinson was accused wrongly and falsely by a white woman of raping her\nAnd he didn't do it but the town was up in arms about it because this young white woman said that Tom Robinson a black man had raped her\nSo they put together a trial and everything and they were going to Lynch them that much should certainly Democrats looming around outside spool enough rope get ready to Lynch Tom Robinson till as Atticus Finch came along\nAnd he wanted to do the right thing and teaches kids good moral lesson in the process and he's one of the great heroes American literature Atticus Finch\nAnd I'm looking for Atticus Finch in this story because I the way my mother raised me in this society I was raised in there are two kinds of people in the world\nI met see a Lynch mob and want to join it and then there are the kind that see a Lynch mob and want to stop it\nAnd I'd like to be part of the group that wants to stop the Lynch mob because the truth is that if Brett Kavanaugh jumped on Fifteen year old Christine Blasey Ford when he was Seventeen and scared the bejesus out of her well\nThat would be a terrible thing\nBut I've got a whole lot of reason to not believe that that happened she said it happened I Believe that she believes that had happened\nI don't know whether she came to this conclusion and repressed memory therapy which seems to me would be one of the first questions that should be asked about where weeks into this now and nobody has gone through the ABCs you know they've investigated in a ... a logical sort of way Brett Kavanaugh and his past\nExamining his high school yearbook and Senate committees with idiot senators pointing to doodles what his boot thing what is I don't know how to pronounce that what is what is blue fin it's something you apparently doing your office with your staff on a regular basis\nSenator but you know in the in in my high school mind at that time it was a reference to flatulence and this is what they're covering view I don't know if it's a book or boost how do you pronounce that\nI don't know how do you pronounce it senator or you're the booth for in the room you well you go ahead and figure it out yourself but he's part of the Lynch mob that was Sheldon Whitehouse he as dumb as a doorknob that guy and um and and they're putting all this other stuff now and again the the second one we've got this uh\nJulie sweat Nick whose boyfriend has now come out now former\nDemocrat candidate for Congress and said that her own father is what next own father said that she's too crazy\nTo work on a Democrat house campaign crazy nuts her own father according to her ex boyfriend a democratic candidate for Congress at one point and he told her that she enjoyed\nGroup sex with multiple mad at the same time that's what he told he said he's got to be believed because he's a Democrat that's why the New York times just didn't cover the story the most insidious power at the news media has the power to ignore\nThe New York times is ignoring the story the Washington Post is ignoring the story NBC ABC CBS CNN MSNBC they're ignoring the story because it doesn't help the party line\nBut it looks pretty darn credible to me and he of course submitted this this a lesser the former Democratic candidate to Congress Dennis cat her who was a weatherman for channel seven in Washington DC for many years I remember him being the weatherman on channel seven in Washington DC\nIs no longer but he used to date\nJulie sweat Nick\nWho explained to him that she enjoyed group sex with lots of man and her\nNow this is the problem I think when she's one of the kids are she shouldn't be kicked to the curb she's a joke you shouldn't pay any attention to her at all\nThat that she just she was just one of our callers pointed out yesterday while she was doing an interview with will obey or Kate Snow or whoever I she was smiling and laughing and betting arise while talking about her own gang rape which doesn't make any sense\nIn any context and certainly not in the context of the last couple of weeks\nAlan Dershowitz said that have Julie sweating to glide she should be tried for perjury and go to prison I think the church is trying to destroy someone would fall so it's I think it's pretty clear at this point nobody even knows Julie sweating\nShe gave foreign names to NBC News when they did this big blockbuster interview with her which they said they couldn't confirm anything that she said but they went with it anyway because they're on the team and they're here to take a\nKevin down they're part of the Democratic effort\nSaid that sweating it gave NBC News for names two of them they got a hold of them they didn't get back to NBC News one of them said she'd that they had never heard of joy sweat neck and the fourth was dead\nWhich makes it hard to get any confirmation out of that one and a trip to believe her as a joke so boom kick that would just check that box throw it out the window that's a joke\nThen you've got the second one the Ramirez woman from Yale who says that he ... the New York times looked it up they interviewed at least three dozen people that's thirty six people\nSeveral dozen people they said at least\nMany of whom told the New York times that they had spoken to ms Ramirez in the proceeding week\nBecause you know the New Yorker had been talking to her and they had been shopping the story around to various news outlets that would publish it and only the New Yorker bit because what do they care and what what are they a news organization or something there'll be ridiculous and um the New York times said they talked to a bunch of repels that she had spoken to just in the day's proceedings\nAnd that she had told her old friends that she couldn't remember who it was ... when she was a freshman at Yale\nBut then she said what the heck after talking to my lawyer and spending six days thinking about it I'll go ahead and tell the New Yorker that was cabinet so you can forget about her because she has no credibility\nThat's a joke just throw these people out you know you don't have to be a lawyer that you just play one on the radio and it's good enough\nAnd then you're back to of course a doctor Christine Blasey Ford and her accusations her allegations and President Trump a battered her a bit last night with some uh stuff that didn't make\nThe Democrats and by the Democrats on the news media very happy President Trump let's actually go to President Trump since where here ah and President Trump last night what does what does that start number nine\n[noise] um he was talking about Kevin Oh this is the big rally a last night President Trump where a man yelled I Love you and President Trump responded I Love you to you're not really my tight but I Love you and that was fun a President Trump that the big rally last night\nTalking about why the Democrats hate and that's apparently the right word it it will suffice anyway\nHey Brett Kavanaugh said this is also part of their crusade which has been ongoing for many years to make all things normal appear abnormal while simultaneously or making making all things abnormal appear normal\nI mean that's that's their program that's it and to subvert the constitution and of course the will of the people whenever the opportunity presents itself\nDonald Trump last night talking about the Democrats and their relationship with judge Brett Kavanaugh\nFor all of the Democrats know and all they really know how to do is a strong reason demolish destroy and delay [noise]\nThey judge Kavanaugh said\nBecause they have an will follow the constitution as [noise]\nThat they don't want that to happen that could be a big problem for them the constitution that's a quite a nuisance to the left wherever you go big problem President Trump then the news media went after he did point out a few things about Christine Blasey Ford's um\nMemory issues I think it would be fair to say that she has memory issues and since this in tire fiasco\nIs based on a test of her memory I think it is relevant and valid to suggest that questions about her memory are hurting inch to a what we are talking about here\nAnd a President Trump last night\nThirty six years ago this time I had one [noise] right I Want to be [noise]\nWell do you think it was you know it was one day I'll do it\nHow did you get home I don't remember how did you get there I don't remember where is the place I don't remember how many years you don't want I don't\nKnow [noise] what\nWas it and I

shattered his daughters who\nAre beautiful incredible young kids [noise]\nThey destroyed before they want to destroy these are really evil people\nNow the news media of course went berserk because they're the mouth piece of the Democratic party in fact ... so many of them used to be spokesmen for various Democrats across\nCongress and the Obama administration and and the Clinton Administration so so many of these phony journalist these corrupt I I don't I don't know how they could live with themselves I really don't know where you're paid to be a journalist and you're supposed to be objective and you go on television you tell dozens of people every day or\nOne person's then another seriously injured after a hit on a crash involving to pick up trucks and Scott County
