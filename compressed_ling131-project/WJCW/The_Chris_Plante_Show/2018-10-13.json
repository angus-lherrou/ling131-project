the structure of injured connecting phones joints nerves ligaments just really pretty complex\nBut lower back supports the weight of the upper body and it provides flexibility promotions like bending and twisting\nTwo of my favorite thing to do it and yeah all those moving parts that you can also mean trouble almost anyone who experiences low back pain at one time or another might agree with that\nAnd it's one of the most common causes of disability in America luckily you can take measures to treat and even prevent low back pain here to discuss is physical medicine and rehabilitation specialist after ... welcome to the program Dr Gates nice to meet you\nThank you glad to be here that you get good to have you on the program so it's it's interesting isn't it that and this is so common eight out of ten people will have back pain at some point during their lives is the leading cause of the disability for men over the age of forty five what is the problem with the low back\nUh the problem is that we're all aging as part of it but low back pain concerns people of almost all ages we see significant low back pain in adolescents\nAnd young people are the most common age group for discrimination is between the ages of thirty in fifty we're seeing a lot more people who are living longer and trying to be active so many more people who have spinal to know says\nHow can you tell us what that means you know what I said his final ... means narrowing and you can have to notice of many structures in your body to notice of your arteries that go to your heart\nTo notice of the spine has to do with the canal that the nerves go through and there was a main canal that goes down through the middle than there is too small at each level between\nThe vertebrae they're too small canals called frame and and they can become narrower is to nose to swell the common spinal to know says is to notice of the main canal that can cause pain when you stand in walk because that can now get smaller at that time\nAnd you get painting your buttocks her legs typically and you sit down and goes way so that's a common cause of\nOf broken leg pain and sometimes back pain as well and more elderly patients and then we all are aging and our spine ages are spine starts aging\nOn a microscopic level by our late teen years by the time we hit our twenties we start seeing just ... and ... disks\nAnd it just gradually ages as we get older we don't know exactly why this is not something where it's a bad gene\nWe do know that a lot of it is genetically determined based on twin studies where we can look at people who have identical DNA is primarily done in northern European countries like Denmark where they can track people throughout through life but\nA lot of this is genetically determined and we're living longer and wanting to be more active and so we see back pain throughout the course of\nLife so is this a skeletal problem because of that ... Stein or is that in muscle I always think my low back pain as a muscle problem but it doesn't sound like it is\nWell that's a very good question and it's one that we don't have a very clear answer to when you look at studies that try to isolate what is causing back pain as far as a specific issue is it a joint does a muscle or is it a nerve\nWe can't do that very well and some of the studies which suggests that no more than maybe ten to Fifteen Percent of the time can we isolate a structure\nThat we know is causing the person's pain\nMost often it's multi factorial if you have in arthritic joined in your back and it's aggravated the muscles get tight and they become painful were very good at at finding nerve problems pinch nerves\nOr injured nerves but when it when we get out of the realm of the nerve to issue into\nThe muscular scale will do to issue as we say\nThe bones in the joints and the disks were not very good at isolating exactly where the pain is coming from and it's very difficult to do that clinically there are a few of the issues that we can\nWithin reason say is are causing pain such as the small joints in the low back that often are affected by arthritis\nUp but there are other structures that we know cause pain such as the desk and we have no way of going in and nothing it up and proving it that's where the pain is coming from it's all on clinical impression\nIf you get back pain after a weekend do the heavy lifting or a lot of golf or whatever uh and it's not bad enough or hasn't lasted a long enough to you for you to think that you ought to go see the position of what's the best thing to do for\nThe common recommendation or the current recommendation is that we don't go see a doctor right away as you've uh incinerated are the best thing to do is a rest possibly take some of the ... or Tylenol\nAnd you can use ice or heat there's no science to tell us which works better\nYeah that was a question we all we all want to ask what do I use I sure he didn't there's no right answer huh\nNo we we uh we depend on extrapolating from a joint problems are joint injuries such as sprained ankles where we theoretically believe that we not theoretically I'll say we believe that\nThat uh if we put ice on it to reduce inflammation from an injury well that's not necessarily going to help the low back because the the cold from the ice doesn't get deep enough to affect the physiology down around this fine and the same way with heat the heat doesn't get down there far enough\nAnd so it's probably affecting the nerves in the muscles that it can penetrate more than anything else and affecting the pain that way certainly ice or heat can reduce or some pain and it can help with muscle ... some of your having spasm\nBut I Can't tell you that there's a ride in a wrong application of ice and heat in that situation if it's a cute I Would go with the ice first I Am I at first and when you say rest what do you mean by rescue domain laid out on her bed no arrest has relative rest\nAnd we know that if you lay in bed for three days it's going to be more damaging than helpful\nOr when we lay down we lose muscle mass really lose bone density and it doesn't take very long and not being active before those things can become measurable\nI don't think that any of the women that were in the class with us there was eight of us um we're too worried about ... up too much but some of the ... mothers of people said well how how much you've been left you know you don't want to bulk up are there still women that are afraid of that or has that message ban that myth bend dispelled\n[noise] um I have a fifty fifty I mean that's one of the first questions I or one of the first things I'm told that I'm designing a program for a female I don't want to get big so oh\nWe're not in order to get big you have to eat calories a lot of calories men have to eat more calories when they want to put on size\nBut women don't have as much testosterone and their system as men do so typically we're not going to get big off but we my program focuses on lean mass we don't even worry about ... percent body fat so we're just looking to see our we helping women in the program\nNot lose muscle and hopefully gain muscle\nOkay and do you know we have a new results yet strike well we don't for me 'cause mine isn't until later but our producer Jen had hers done earlier today and boy did she it was very really live yet but that's not unusual is it that is what I can look forward to hopefully as well\nYes most nine I Would probably Ninety five Ninety six percent of the people go through my program have maintained or gain a\nMuscle after a period of sorry twelve weeks club which I'd say you're you're going to do what they said sitting on the wedding\nIn uh this is to intimidate you this program has heard over two hundred stations around the country and so people that can't come and work out with huge Terry I'm what should they do when they go to the gym that his nearest to them did they just Google me go [laughter]\nYou got to program so you've got an app\nI'm starting right here I ... I didn't get the memo\nWe're got to that but they shouldn't definitely not be afraid of doing strength training\nKnow and if somebody was just starting at first thing I Would encourage them to do is do some form of body composition tests just to find out their lean mass so that you have an idea OK here's where I Am and then meet with an educated and experienced a trainer\nTo go through a extensive program that they would follow and then I go back and have a another test on later to see I Am I making changes that I wanted to\nDo so not every program or the program that you outlined is not the same for every woman well it depends on goals like\nI could meet would you do and you have the same goals and that could potentially right up the same work out because it work out I write up for a guy can also be the workout I write up for a woman\nWith a lot of I ... I Want to look like her used to weather years of progress well get up get your hair curled\nAnd that's it [laughter] I Know I wanted to do it because I wanted to have stronger bones because I've heard the message that as you go through menopause your bones start to get weaker so how does lifting strengthened my bones\nBecause your muscles are protecting your bones in as a muscle contracts it puts forced on a a bone which helps the healthy bone remodel to get stronger\nSorry for your bones get stronger you look better or you got more muscle mass or you burn more calories\nMore energy when I'm running I have tons more energy now than I used to I'm not dreaming that I might go sleep better but\nWhen you know outside of the physical benefits the mental benefits or what I Love to see in the program because I have people who are are not very confident and one woman wanna quit after week one and didn't and it's just really really rewarding to see them\nGain their confidence and all of a
