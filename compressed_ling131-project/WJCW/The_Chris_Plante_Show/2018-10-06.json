Supreme Court correspondent Linda Kenya on he's on Capitol Hill for this afternoon's big\nBoat mentioned as a Democrat running for re election in red state West Virginia he's also the only Democrat who has said he will back Brett Kavanaugh for the U.S Supreme Court he\nDid so almost immediately after Republican Susan Collins delivered a lengthy speech on the Senate floor where she said she would vote to confirm Kavanaugh Collins announcement gave the nominee enough votes for confirmation and gave senator mansion a certain degree of comfort that he would not be the one with cats the deciding vote\nAnd so as it turns out this deep brain stimulation is now approved by the FDA for these disorders now in the case of Roger fresh what he has it's a little bit different from this movement disorder\nYou know he is a one of the concert master's with the Minnesota Orchestra\nWho is a master at\nPlaying the violin now I suspect because he practiced so much probably hours and hours every day\nThat he developed what is called more used dependent tremor so somehow his brain circuits unlikely because of how much he plays the violin develop an abnormal circuitry in his brain oscillation is what we call it which is basically\nManifested asked tremor and his and his hand kind of an overused syndrome kinda yes exactly you know you probably heard of um like in golfers certainly offers because they're so good to have what's called yeah yeah where right when they're ready to pot they very easy whole\nTheir muscles tense up and they have a movement problem and they miss it's similar to that yes you're on ... ... yes yes yes from her with us and so when he developed as he didn't know that there was anything that he could do he went to a riot of physicians but that was really nothing that\nIt's offered now when he came to see me he had his violin with him he walked in I saw him\nAnd I like my other patients Parkinson's disease essential tremor dystonia where I can pretty much tell what they have right away I thought he looked perfectly normal and then he said well wait and so he then proceeded to take out his island\nWhich by the way it's a very very expensive violent that he brought to my office and he started to play this music and I'm not a musician I don't fully understand but when he plates or notes you could hear of I brought a lot of shaking I didn't know he didn't mean to do that\nBut he said no he's trying to hold a note perfectly still but he can't do it because he's he's having this this primary only when he play certain kinds of notes\nAnd so um we presented him to our neuro modulation committee because this is an unusual kind of situation and he was approved by our neuro modulation committee to undergo this surgery which at that point we were not hundred percent sure that we could help them\nAnd so in the operating room typically for the deep brain stimulation surgery I Do the surgery with a patient awake particularly in situations like this because I I don't know beforehand whether or not\nWe're going to be able to treat this and we need to know whether or not the tremor goes away with the stimulus she'll need to be awake during surgery yes and and in this case was unique because not only did he have to be awake but we have to have the violin he had to play violated has we have to have the violent because that's the only time that the tremor comes out [noise]\nSo how does a deep brain stimulation work that I got to ask you though you say the patient is awake but you've got to put a hole in the school has to get this needle and yeah they're not or wait for that when you drill a well known that they are away for that you are you do it at our local yes\nSo um you know just like a dentist would use ... up the teeth in the same type of anesthetic that I use that number's up the skin and throw a tiny little hole in the skull but by the way the surgery is incredibly precise it's done using a what's called a stereotype the cat frame\nAnd we get an MRI so even though we don't see inside um you know like through an incision we actually can see the brain through the MRI and we have the ability to target very very precisely a within any area of the brain\nSo how did you know where you want her to put this needle yes so so you there's a little play services can't play violin and you stick the needle in there\nYes actually this is I'm the one area of research that we've been doing research on in the mail neural engineering laboratories exactly what you just ask so how does the brings to Malaysia and work and we have developed several uh technologies to figure out how it works and\nIn particular were very excited about technology called the ... system that we have now tested\nThat shows that it appears that deep brain stimulation can release different kinds of neural chemicals in the brain that stops abnormal oscillation or these are a isolationist that ultimately cause the tremor and TBS appears to release those chemicals [noise]\nUm that causes that kind of tremor and furthermore we now know we haven't marvelous map of the brain circuitry we pretty much know all of the\nVarious circuits that's causing this type of trauma and in this case it's coming from an area the prank call the elements which is center of the brain deep that's why it's called the deep brain stimulation and more specifically\nCalled the Wii I Am and travel center media is part of the album is\nNow this case is unique because that's the usual area for essential tremor when we did this surgery on that area he got you know pretty good from our control but it wasn't perfect\nAnd the interesting aspect that's also Ken Burns picked up on is that we had to then at a second lead that is not so unusual so we needed to find that\nAnd he okay is it in the movie that that was great\nWell I mean you know let me be clear this is sold brain surgery editor for it has inherent risk and I of course had to discuss all of this with Mr fresh and all of my patients\nThat it has risks such as causing a bleed hemorrhage stroke and so forth so we have to take those risks\nBut in this case the potential benefit far outweighed in our opinion\nThe risks that he'd talk for his quality of life it was a deal breaker yes absolutely you know the amount of a trauma that Mr fresh has actually would be considered you know not so much in the sense that you and I I if we had it it would not affect our life but\nFor him because he's a concert master this was actually devastating\nAnd now the other interesting thing is he as a remote Chanel where he can turn these electrodes on or off if he does not using that movie's not playing the violin right\nThat is correct so he can ... and and as soon as he turns it off all of his term or comes back now yeah he demonstrates in the movie now the other interesting thing is is when we added a second lead in another area just in front of the the I Am\nWhat we discovered is his tremor control actually is almost Supreme physiologic meaning that you know everybody you and I under certain conditions would have a little bit of tremor\nPhysiologic trailer\nWell interestingly she can now hold on no almost\nSuperhuman meaning that he can place had violent [noise] even better than before what fair [laughter] that is wonderful [laughter] All right we've been talking about the

McCray Tracey as we just discussed with a neurosurgeon Dr Kandel leave Mayo Clinic researchers have made a truly exciting breakthrough in the treatment of spinal cord injuries through electrical stimulation\nOn and injured spinal cord and intense physical therapy the first patient implanted with this device Mayo Clinic is no strong enough to be able to stand and make movements that are resembling steps the Beijing has actually able to exert some control over his legs again legs that were completely paralyzed\nThe latest update on this research was recently published in nature medicine\nWe've heard about this exciting advances from the nearest surgeons perspective but an equally important part is a role played by physical medicine and rehabilitation and here to tell us about it is after Christians out and make an guilt doctors always the director of Mayo clinic's assistive and restored of technology laboratory\nAnd Meghan is a physical therapist and doctors are lab welcome both of you to the program\nThanks for having us You're good to have you both ... must be exciting for both of you to to work on this project who's most excited\n[laughter] I like Meghan\nSo yeah and you know being a clinician and having that experience and working at this population for fourteen Fifteen Years now it's really exciting to be able to finally have something that we can tell her patients are patients families that we're making progress towards\nUm recovery for those who have such a devastating injury touches a complete spinal cord injury so it's it's really life changing for me as a professional but also the experience you know the ... on the horizon it's really really amazing\nDid you know for a while but this was coming something like this would ultimately become available\nYou know I had been kind of following the literature um that had been coming out from a to UCLA climbers from LA as well as the University of Toledo\nI was aware of this type of intervention and what it was available to the individuals backward injuries and what their options were which were really promising but I think this paper and I and our our results really kind of her home run compared to where it started\nAnd so you know we knew there was a possibility but what was the level of ability and what was the level of recovery\nWas really beyond my belief at that point so it's really amazing to feed the progress we've made to this point\nAnything to add doctors out I guess I Would like to just add that I mean I think it's exciting that that we at Mayo get to have a team that that is able to replicate this work and push it forward and and now are really excited because we have this great team together\nAnd the possibilities are sort of endless now for ... for what we can do next so\nWhich is what role does this therapy play and rehabilitation play in this whole process and how important is that we know about the ... we know about the simulation um but didn't this patient also have a significant amount of therapy but for the implant was ever answered [noise]\nSo what part of the trial is for the first five or six months we did just called there'll be alone and just worked on the type of activities that were attacked as addictive banning in that being imbalanced training which is why we continued with that after the surgery but we really wanted to do this\nBe intense ... just to find out what kind of recovery as possible and just the therapy alone\nUm this individual that um where we've published in the in the paper had very little physical therapy after his injury\nI'm three years prior other than the traditional conventional compensatory strategies um so it wasn't to the level of well we introduced in rehab program at this trial so he did five to six months of intense therapy with you know maybe minor improvements in terms of his endurance and his conditioning but no recovery below his level of injury\nSo how do you what sort of physical therapy do you do on someone whose legs were\nParalyzed our goal was to regain Bushnell activation and movement which means it's time to be able to intently move their legs or activate their muscles okay when you\nWere trying to get him to be able to move something that would move the credit which you can relax\nAnd we were we using strategies that we use with other individuals with neurologic conditions on to try to engage the than aroma killer um activity of the legs and the trunk by loading them and by going through the repetition of the Fox and extension moments of the legs so it's\nA standard of care that we typically follow for people who have some motor and since you activation but it's not the standard of care for people who have a complete paralysis injury such as these individuals\nSo you were trying to strengthen the muscles that you knew the patient would need to walk\n[noise] partially yes\nI remind you that when there's a spinal cord injury there is no damage to the muscles the damages and the spinal cord but rarely atrophy atrophy definitely so our our purpose was trying to send sensory information up through the nervous system by loading the legs and providing tactile cues and movement of the legs that can be sent up through the to the central nervous system\nTo then tried to make the connection and the nurse\nTo then send them order out put to the muscles\nSo does this type of therapy continue indefinitely for the patient\nSo we quickly realized that you know you can't have an epidural electrical stimulation without physical therapy we feel they're both in are going to this type of recovery so we know it's really important\nTo you but you can put the employer it in but that it won't do any good if you don't have the therapy\nWe that's our theory that has yet to be proven as well but um we know physical therapy itself wasn't the answer so we had the implant and we added the therapy in the nation together and we got these miraculous result\nUm what goes on from here a little tricky because number one like I said this is not the standard of care for someone who has a completely I'm a severe spinal cord injury so to be able to send the individual out to the clinic now without the standard of care will be tricky because our clinicians don't know how to manage to me later\nIn conjunction with a therapy which we feel is really really valuable\nSo we're at the point with this trial where we're really trying to integrate the home exercise program by identifying activities have been really proven safe impossible for the individual to do on their own at home with minimal assistive devices\nAnd then let them do that stuff at home on their own um and then and then it it's our job to figure out you know who is this appropriate when is it appropriate if it is appropriate and how to implement into standard of care\nUm and we actually published a research study with the help of integrative medicine to show that our patients on guns attend that received caring hands massage prior to their treatment they did better they were less stress they had less anxiety\nSo we know that this works and we have a published research now to back that up\nAnd are massage um are caring hands massage volunteers they absolutely love what they do and we provided over eight thousand of them last year\nYou know next time you come you should bring one of those are great I should have raw one today right exactly are there any age restrictions with regard to being a volunteer of a oh can you be two younger ...\nSo you have to be at least fourteen but we do not have a cap on how old so right now our oldest volunteers one hundred\nWhat about um one of your other popular programs they carry the carrion canines in dog years how many uh how old are some of those one which is okay I won't make you figure that out and tell us about carrying canines\nSure that is a partnership that we have with integrative medicine as well and I'm Jessica ... who is our partner in integrative medicine she kinda handled the requirements for the dog because that's a little out of our wheel house but we recruit the volunteers she takes care of the dog piece of it or the canine piece of it\nAgain there are certain requirements the dogs have to have certain certifications because whenever you're bringing an animal into a hospital you have to make sure they're vetted appropriately no pun intended [laughter]\nAnd um there are about thirty teams of volunteers patient a love the service it's actually something that can be ordered through ethics so care providers will order the service and we get obviously great feedback on that sort of it as well All right other services you provide\nYou know you may have seen some of our volunteers at the welcome death or providing way finding um so we tried to take it one step further and walk the halls you'll see that deer in headlights look where people just obviously are not sure where they're going\nSo we wanted to provide volunteers to actually just walk the halls and say can I help you find where you're going and they will take them directly to the area they need to go so that's kind of unique when and we promote that is if you want to get step then\nWe're big campus if you want to get fit and healthy patients this is the service for you\nI'm gonna do on official you finding that I've done that lots of times absolute someone has that look on their face right\nOne of the other things that's kind of a a Sikh best kept secret is our handicrafts volunteers we have um we we made almost twenty thousand handmade items last year and that's everything from pediatric surgical kept\nTo toe ... so if you break your foot in the winter a little needed 'em ... to go over the cast\nUm stuffed animals you might see kids walking around with little stuffed\nAnimals that are volunteers have made and I always say when I retire I Want to come back and have a backpack full of those and just hand them out to kids all over the cameras so that's going to be my volunteer role when I retire and that was the gift shops absolutely yet two of them and we have sisters crossing and then the Methodist campus gift shop so\nUm and a lot of people don't know that our proceeds go back to the practice so the ... the good Samaritan fund and then we also find a lot of institutional requests um for example an area needed I pads to better communicate with tracheotomy patients and we funded that uh initiatives so\nWe tried to give back to the organization any of the profits week so if you shop there you're really helping our patient\nAs I mentioned uh this program as heard on over two hundred stations around the country so let's say that someone is far away from Rochester, Minnesota right now but likes to help out likes to volunteer in their community and is maybe getting an idea of some way they can help out at their local clinic or community\nIf they want to reach out to me I'm more than happy to share\nBut our model looks like I Would suggest reaching out to hospital patient experience as a first step of getting into the door and than really with to oppose correct

they absolutely get behind it like all the changes will ever changes we make I embrace it\nAnd they look forward to what we do in every week on average a difference between the two audiences but in a

I I was laughing all the way through the commercial break a you also talked about a lot of cross the rallied around across yeah there are only project yeah that's\nIt if you remember last year and probably for the last five or six years we've had the red bull global rally cross series you know where they they take a stadium they'll do it in the middle of Daytona you know they built attract is maybe a mile and a half long this park pavement as part dirt they go wherever jobs\nThat series basically went out of business there was a lot of unpaid bills a lot of lawsuits so it looked like we're going to lose rally across but the company I Am treated owns everything I mean they have on the professional bull riders on this universe bill and all kinds of stuff\nThey own the really cross series in Europe where it's huge I went over there for the first one they had like sixty five Seventy thousand people there so that was one of the smaller vouch filed\nSo they decided over Christmas that they're going to try to save rally crossing the U.S so they\nPut together a quick schedule of for racist the first one was in England which was a weird place to debut something called America's rally cross but uh it went over well the second one I think was a dentist circular the America as it was the rally cross guys by themselves not very well attended\nNext race up a tour of errors in Canada a lot of people there and then the other finale at circuit or the America's the formula one track this past weekend and\nOf course that's attract you know where it's the only one that the hosts of formula one of them in the U.S right now and they built a rally cross track in the middle of it which they did basically for the X. games for five years ago so they're used to it and the rally cross guys from Europe came over I mean those are the big the big names\nWhich you probably wouldn't know but they're still big names like Sebastian low dose you guys are famous over there\nAnd uh they had both those guys on the bill and they also had a concert with ludicrous and DJ jazzy Jeff that night which are they kind of help the crowd but the problem was right after they announced that Willie Nelson announced a free concert in Austin for ... the candidates running against Ted Cruz\nAnd he bought a bunch of Brits are friends so you know you're sitting there thinking am I going to stick around for a ludicrous I Am I going to go see willy Nelson or am I going to sit in a hotel room and order ribs service so I just turned sixty five she can guess which\nOne I did at least I got to watch Saturday Night live which that was pretty funny with a seat you know Matt Damon playing a cabin on but uh you know I I\nLook back or they should have got all those concerts but man I was really comfortable in that in the west in downtown Austin racing which grade a Scott Speed the former formula one racer and NASCAR I sure one is fourth straight title and rally crush in one of the anti Volkswagen Beatles Tanner fast a guy that you you know\nFrom their television ... yeah yeah yeah\nA ... a great driver Scott basically just club baby seals all year and that\nSeries a ten a blockbuster he ran well uh they're all over again I well\nI was at ten blocks place just day before yesterday and I saw that yeah\nYeah Ken was there and then ran very well and one of the Ford Focus is that a ... and a half so he must have made a quick trip from Texas back to work with a Colorado\nYou know a Utah well anyway the who'd again they're going against shop in Utah Salt Lake city up a Kennedy in Park City uh only has a beautiful job I mean to tell you what and I got a couple of pictures in there and it was and I was wondering why it was kind of you know vacant they weren't too many cars in there and and the reason why\nYeah they must have been a must been trailer him back but I'll tell you can is a big star he's got a reputation\nShould just be an kind of cross but man I've seen him several times stand there and sign autographs for hours and hours they did the same thing at Texas a\nYou know he's a genuine star or even though Scott Speed is running formula on a big star to a lot of guys from Europe or big stars but can block list the guy with the longest line for autographs of\nTipping out to him for a for driving a got a two cars Ford Focus team that Ford is not really ready tobacco politely they're giving up some help out the back door you know with parts and a and a technology and that sort of thing but\nI'm not really sure what's gonna happen next year they're trying to put a schedule of five or six racist together one of them up in your area and Seattle\nSomewhere up there a round the Turkish rally across a school\nWhich would be great and uh probably starting the season again in Montreal during the winter because they've got a place in Troy there\nThat is covered and they're going to bring in some ice and race rally cross and when it's freezing outside inside it'll be a little bit warmer but the cross guys may be racing on ice and that's enough of reason for me to go to Canada and the middle of winter if they do that that's going to be a great great way to kick off season\nYeah nice well I you know rally crosses fun I think with the um the the ... the waning an audience of NASCAR and and open wheel racing maybe you know the younger audience kind of ... is leaning into this little more because they they can all see themselves possibly being you know a driver of that ilk some day you know it's not as intense\nAnd they're using there isn't a recognizable cars I like the right you do like the super WRX like the focus you know cars that that people younger demographic can or can't recognize and and actually buy in the last time we were certainly America is I got a ride with a ... who was racing was super so\nThat's a guy who ah you know he's he's at one of my absolute favorite people either just on that evil can evil ah a jump show and you know he still just as as modest and humble and as much fun to be around that he was when he was a kid so\nI'm I really I'm really hoping rally across those kinda can make a comeback in the U.S to go there there's a lot of fun to watch\nA um and and I agree with you on that or just a question it any news anything going on and NASCAR after France got that DUI is there any been any fallout from that I just haven't talked to you about that and\nNow he's a he pled not guilty we haven't heard anything else from them and uh they promoted a guy named Steve Phelps to where he is now president of NASCAR which probably felt it was a good job might have been in my choice\nBut uh I think we've seen the last uh Brian France you know he doesn't own any of NASCAR he really had been pretty hands off the last year or so\nI don't think he's got to be hurting for money so I don't think he's got to make a comeback at the level we've seen before it's a shame for NASCAR because you know there's no secret that the ratings are down although as I mentioned they were up for the role of the race of Charlotte because it was kind of a novelty but\nYou know they're going to do over the weekend Dover is not a real big\nRace on the schedule so hopefully they'll be able to to write out the season the way they are\nGoing now right on our give me a couple more minutes on the other

but he was I Will say even after in the commercial break before I run you up\nHe was like you know what he goes who doesn't love ramble because just the best stuff in the world and like I Know I Know you're not telling me I Know the glad to hear that he knew he was really he was very complimentary and look at Steve used to be a cop he knows it ain't good ally you go to jail for lying\nAnyway so what can you share with is that he could not you got something new coming out of the the trade show coming up Sima and can you share a little bit\nWell obviously you know we make breaks [laughter]\nAnd our goal is to try to you know obviously get the our breaks into the into the corners of as many people as possible right or the vehicles and we have a new brakes system\nAs you know we've sold kits for a long long time that can be added on to cars of course everybody knows ramble these days because you can get your rumble breaks and the cars that you purchase day to day right\nBy the way I Want I Want to tell you one thing he said because you didn't hear it he said and for those who didn't catch the last segment he said there's one thing that makes the value of a vehicle built up is one that has rumble breaks on and I thought isn't that interesting\nBecause you automatically go oh oh it's got ... brakes and uh that was a big thing to say said that on the air well you know things\nGo very fast these days and I think people are starting to realize when they go fast they have to stop fast so that's where we help out so it's FEMA we're going to be talking about a new break kit and a new ... specially made caliber that will be able to fit on I Can't even see that that might be our\nPeople are like no other pointing down no no so why would I Would tell you people the state to through your seem a show\nThat you're doing and uh it's going to be really exciting though it's going to be a uh I'll tell you it's a reasonably priced caliber that will enable people I Can't talk about just lots of them to be able to know I Can't say that either well\nWell you know and here's what you're going to have to do once you can tell the world about of course I'll tell him we need to remind them and stuff because the reality is that people go in and they just you know whatever breaks but it isn't really whatever break if like if you really care about\nYour family members and you want to get the best breaks you can get brand but was it period and now you're making it I think from what you're saying more accessible to\nThe everyday work a day Joe cars you might say absolutely okay well that's good All right All right let me ask you before we go because I you know I Know I I only give you like five minutes here but\nElectric cars everybody I mean it's like man everybody's coming out with the electric car what's that going to do to you guys breaks breaks are still breaks but there's you know I mean how involved you guys get would that Rambo\nWe're getting very involved so just about every electric car that you see on the market now we're probably talking to them 'cause you know those cars number one or heavy because it got batteries in Iraq you know everybody knows so heavy that is but the torque that you get off the line\nWith those cars is tremendous it's almost continuous talk you know terrible lag no you know if you hit the pedal boom you're out of the gate and of course if you're out of the gate fast\nYou got to be able to stop fast too so yeah and those cars got to be light\nAnd we have the latest breaks systems in the world and so
