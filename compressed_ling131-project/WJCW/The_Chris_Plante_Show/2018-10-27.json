S. wow that's always\nThat's interesting isn't it yeah that's pretty how involved and and why do you think that is their system compared to ours\nYou know their system of care that access to care every woman has a has a primary care doctor every woman is going to get the appropriate care that's not true in the U.S\nSo what should women do uh before they become pregnant particularly up there are obese or have diabetes\nWell I think they should see either they're obey or their primary care doctor if they have one and to have some preconception planting what does a healthy pregnancy look like what are my risk factors\nIf I'm really overweight and my ... you know in general we don't advise those women to have the same thirty pounds weight gain that or an individual who is normal weight would have\nTo what is it healthy pregnancy it looked like for me\nAnd then monitoring through the pregnancy to make sure that we identify those individuals who develop hypertension new hypertension during pregnancy or new diabetes during pregnancy\nAnd importantly and a slightly off topic but definitely related is individuals who during their pregnancy women who during pregnancy develop hypertension or diabetes even if it goes away after they deliver are at higher risk for heart attack threw out their entire life\nAnd so that marks a woman who failed to stress tests the pregnancy and we need to watch or maybe they need to see a cardiologist maybe they need lifted lowering therapy or greater monitoring for their high blood pressure so pregnancy it's such an important time for women's health and babies health as well as her future heart health\nHow does pregnancy affect the heart\nSo a normal pregnancy are um the woman's blood volume increases I'm a by about a third so that means the heart has a lot of extra work\nUm blood pressure typically actually in a normal pregnancy goes down um think about the uterus where the baby it goes from a fist sized um Oregon too big enough to have a nine pound baby ended so women actually have this ability to make new blood vessels and ... which\nAt so when they prove that they can do that that's a pretty healthy thing if they have a preterm birth or a baby that doesn't develop fully because they're placenta isn't healthy enough\nThose are all markers of risk for that pregnancy but also future pregnancies and future heart disease and that women\nBased on the statistics that we talk about you suggested that maybe there are some things that we ought to be doing differently\n[noise] well I think that preconception planning is really good talking to what are the health risk but I had that I can correct before I even get pregnant what medication semi on what medication shine I if I'm On medication is what should I switched to\nI think making sure that women recognize that heart disease that they are at risk for heart disease and so that they pay attention to symptoms I mean one of the areas and it it was a sizable number of the individuals who suffered a heart attack after um a birth in this study that was reference at the beginning of the segment\nUm had a condition called spontaneous coronary artery deception this is an area of interest of mine this happens and people with healthy hearts with healthy vessels with no cholesterol or anything it is I'm so there's nothing to prevent it but he got to recognize the symptoms right away\nSo you get in and get the appropriate treatment so it's multi level it's pre it during and making sure that we address the issues that arise and then making sure that everyone on the team including the patient knows what the signs and symptoms are of heart disease I think that's a great point\nBecause it's been a while it's been a while since I was pregnant but I only thing the only thing that I thought about before we got pregnant was to start taking folic acid that was the only ... planning\nThat we did it all and even as someone who's got some heart issues I didn't even think about heart health when it came to being one of the things I should be watching out for when I was pregnant exactly\nSo the big issues are obesity increasing rates have diabetes and women having children when they're older would you suggest that if you're thinking about having children maybe you ought to think about it early on\nWell that's great to say in theory because in general healthier pregnancy is they're going to be in in a woman's twenties on the other hand the reality is um women find partners later or whatever so I Would say to that older woman the woman who is thirty or thirty five and coming into their first pregnancy\nIs that is even paying more attention because that's also the age in which we're starting to see more risk factors and and so\nI Would probably be healthier to have pregnancy at younger ages yes but the reality is we're going to have older mothers and continue to do so so making sure those older mothers are as healthy as can be\nAll right we've been talking about heart health in pregnancy with cardiologist heart specialist Dr Sharon ... short break\nWhen we come back we'll look at later in a woman's life a heart

Tracy McCray your gall bladder it's a small pear shaped Oregon on the right side of your afternoon underneath your liver you get to the rise of the Goldwater stores fluid called by all that is released into your small intestine to\nAge I guess your information at the gall bladder is known as coal leases Titus artist meeting information and it can be caused by several different things [noise] gallstones blocking the two leading out of the gall bladder can result in the buildup of by which is a frequent causes inflammation\nOther causes of an inflamed gall bladder can include problems with the bile duct itself tumors which can sometimes be cancerous and even certain infections here to discuss gall bladder diseases Mayo Clinic gastroenterologist actor Brad Peterson welcome to the program Dr Peterson is nice to meet you\nThank you very much it's a pleasure to be here with you\nTell us a little bit about the gall bladder where it is what it does\nWell the gall bladder is a recipient for ... coming out of the liver during periods of fasting and it expands and in the ... made by the liver which is being made all day long and storied there and concentrated a lot of water is sucked out of bile while it's they're\nSo when you eat a meal the goal butter squeezes a muscle at the bottom of the duct relaxes and ... that's now very concentrated is expelled into the untested\nTo mix with your food for the Justin what tells it to squeeze a there's a hormonal stimulus and when food and thought a or a company at the time of the meal the a and food arriving in the do it in a tells us to squeeze\nTheir duty and him as a little portion coming right out of the stuff\nThat's right the upper small intestine\nWhat do you do if you don't have the gall bladder because if people have problems with it and it's removed than what do they do\nSo um the gall bladders the most remove all the goal butter is the most common operation in America today ... and so it's sort of tend to say yes it's very very common to live without it all better perfectly healthy lives\nThe bio that's important for our digestion than resides in part in the ... during fasting and in part it just arrests and is present within the entire length of the small ball\nThe bio that's created in is in the small boat is recycled by re absorption in the lower small bowl and comes back through the bloodstream to the liver and goes through multiple cycles losing just a little bit with each cycle into the large intestine\nYou know it used to be when people were to have their goal butter I remember when I was a kid there would be in the hospital for two weeks\nA big incision remembered the picture of Lyndon Baines Johnson showing his gall bladder scar and it seemed to me like people who had had their gall bladder out had to change their diet\nBut that's not true anymore is it\nNot particularly no that's correct your digestion works fine with without the gall bladder the ... still active and still functioning the way it should\nThe major consequences long term of having your gall bladder out as a small proportion of patients develop a chronic diarrhea maybe two or three percent which is easily managed with agents that bind the ... that's spilling into the cold and\nSo it's the it's the bio in the colon that causes the diarrhea and ... and just a small percentage of people that\nAre in a small percentage it's irritating and a stimulates a sick of\nIt inhibits it irritates the color and inhibits absorption of fluids in the intestine so\nMost folks or if they have a little bit of softening or it's a don't appreciate it as a as a major consequences but the small percentage has enough diarrhea to require some intervention but that's easily managed in a modest issue\nWhat most commonly goes wrong with the gall bladder\nWealth most patients uh who developed gallstones which are underlying most problems in the gall bladder a or a symptomatic in most stones don't cause problems\nIf we look at uh the entire population somewhere around five to eight percent of men will develop gallstone somewhere around ten to Fifteen Percent of women's about twice as often and women\nAnd eighty percent of those who do develop them are a symptomatic we sometimes find them unexpectedly when looking for other things but we just leave them alone and they do find\nSomewhere around twenty percent of patients will develop pain we called ... colic and this is a\nVery typical pain that comes on fairly abruptly over five to Fifteen minutes sticks around for a prolonged dinner of all of a half hour to several hours before resolving somewhat gradually so\nAbility or a colleague however can then Rick or if it's developed one so that's when we start to entertain intervention a small portion of patients who've had bill Eric colic will go on to develop more serious complications of ... where the pain persist\nThe gall bladders very inflamed and removing it is I'm less selective and margins\nSo I Want to ask you about the risk factors for developing a gallstones when I was in medical school it was a female that forty fertile now I don't know whether you can still say that maybe they've changed the words but is that still true\nThat still true women developed gallstones twice as often as men because of their Emilio estrogen and pro Justin's in the bloodstream\nWe know that a certain ethnic groups developed a gallstones much more often American Indians Native Americans are the probably the highest prevalence of gallstones Hispanic populations fairly high Caucasians below that and and African Americans are less than that even\nYeah there are several reasons one is athlete age we tend to be on medication as they get older that they may not be on\nWhen they're younger the other thing that I ... I meant to touch upon and thanks for reminding me as more sedentary lifestyle so if you're not as physically active that also has adverse effects on your digestion so you know if we're less active as we age of people's particularly spending a lot of time sitting\nThat can lead to more difficulties with comes to patients so how do we help these people yeah so I approach things and multiple area we always talk about the importance of diet scanning dietary fiber and we'd really like people to get in the range of\nTwenty eight to thirty grams a day [noise]\nMost people on in the United states probably get twelve to Fifteen grams a day so not as much fiber it I'd have to yeah it's a struggle\nBut with a conscious effort that can happen the other thing is making sure that they are staying hydrated and choosing fluid that such as water\nThat are going to help with your digestion and data things that act more as a diabetic and make you urinate such as like caffeinated beverages make you you're in a more\nSo little caffeine is good it can stimulate your bells but a lot of caffeine will have a direct effect and ill year in eight more and there'll be less flew to fail a vote for your digestive system so the first thing is to talk about diet and hydration\nAnd then I talk about sleep wake cycle because our colon is that most active in the morning when we wake up\nJust like we have our sleep wake cycles as part of our circadian rhythms are about to have a similar read them and you're colon is that it's most acted in the morning and that's why most people have about living in the morning\nWhat can be done to accentuate that eating a meal do not skip breakfast breakfast is the most important meal for people who are struggling with cell problem another reason why breakfast is so important yes and that's how we talk about that and\nA medication in general really usually start with an over the counter lax attached that as just plain old magnesium salt can be very helpful which you can get over the counter\nAnd then we might talk about\nThe occasional use is necessary\nFor the stimulant lacks a death like physical at all for it uh the is that an and I'm ah depending on what somebody's needs are so we kind of step it up but the first thing I really like to get at is diets physical activity staying hydrated\nAnd if you don't certainly are uncomfortable but what can happen if you don't address on it comes to a patient\nYes certainly you're uncomfortable and a lot of people experienced pain and bloating and\nSometimes even nuts yeah an upper GI symptoms people who have reflux reflux symptoms can get worse if you're comes to a patient is poorly controls and so that can\nLead to a lot of distress but as you touched upon there can be problems with the public for Mike Hammer riots or which can be painful they can believe that they can also get from both which is a very painful conditioning requires surgery\nThere can also be from straining the development and you know Fisher's which again can be it can be a very painful will cry and is he a fellow at cracker tearing the canal which can be\nVery very uncomfortable and can take weeks to eat and sometimes a couple of months to heal\nWe also worry about with excessive straining symptoms of tells like Oregon pro laps and women\nWho are either the butter the commercial come outside and about it\nWell they may not necessarily come outside the body it coming outside the body of the worst case scenario that's a full pro laps [noise] that's\nAnd things can pill that Ernie and still be in the body by ... problems with pressure or feeling of incomplete brown and the the type of things\nSo none of that sounds very good you know so that things to do but bore you may need to try to do this or other medications are twenty to thirty grams of fiber per day critical hydrate exercise and don't skip breakfast\nAbsolutely All right we've been talking about chronic comes to patient with Mayo Clinic

back\nWe're glad you're here uh this is a harsh of car enthusiast [noise] yes [noise] yes\nA little bit beyond the lunatic fringe we admitted we know we love cars far too much you know it's little things in life didn't matter though to us\nCar crazy people called Brauer is joining us from Kelley Blue book out a traitor dealer dot com means executive publisher Carl so North American cars a year explain to people why that is important in and who are these people that are voting\nThey wouldn't let me about why what is the important about I can vote you know\nBut no there's some pretty high standards there I think so no I got to be careful who you lead into this exactly we we review your application\nAnd I didn't know why I just called me through my vote over the fence you know anyway you talk about and who is on the list who are these people\nSo you've got fifty seven or fifty six jurors right now a it was fifty for years and it went up sixty uh we're still kind of figuring out what the exact number she'd be the final number I'm On the organizing committee I'm helping them\nKind of run through all this but regardless fifty plus jurors from across Canada and the U.S and Mexico who vote on the north American contract with the air and the fact that they're from all different countries and publications is what makes the award so you make\nA lot of people that rightly or wrongly depending on the circumstance look at various car the year awards and wonder how much they manufacture had to pay to get that of the year award from that particular publication right and\nYou can't even suggest that here because there's fifty people from all the different publications that are out there so you'd have to have a really well funded and a and a industrious\nAutomaker to go buy off all you know whatever forty fifty a represented hum publications to try to influence this thing and of course none of that happens that just\nJurors funding missing themselves with an annual fee that we all pay we all pay a fee to create the ward and pay funded and pay for the trophies and all that and so we're all independently deciding that this thing and that's why it's considered really the most prestigious all the awards out there\nSo when did they actually make the announcement\nThey make it every year traditionally at the Detroit auto show or the first press conference of the year or in the Detroit at the Detroit auto show and a we'll have the finalists down to like the kind of three in each category 'cause there's car there's utility in their truck earlier\nAnd uh right now he's still got like thirty plus vehicles between all three of them about ten each actually there's only three trucks and we've got like Fifteen or twelve of the other two\nCategories but we'll get a little down to three and by early December and so you'll know one of the three for each of those categories and then we'll make the announcement at the Detroit auto show\nSo January okay\nJanuary I think it's the wants the seventh or eighth I have to look at the counter\nBut what ... what is the automaker I mean obviously it it benefits them but how big of a benefit is it I mean do they really feel a tremendous uptick in sales if something wins in North American car truck in the year\nI think it's a benefit on multiple levels you know I think if you're an automaker and you've got a team working on you know you're all new vehicles members got to be an all the redesigned vehicle right so\nYou and I both know island there's a lot of competition industry there's a lot of ego in the industry I think you know last year for instance the Lincoln Navigator on a one of the awards and that vehicles going up against very premium\nSUVs from Land Rover and Cadillac and BMW and so for the Lincoln Navigator to win that's quite a feather in their cap even if it's just a kind of industry known thing and a lot of consumers aren't aware of it but\nThe truth is a lot of these auto makers will advertise I see ads for the uh the Honda Accord talking about how it one car the year I see that on TV right there honestly saying that one North American car the year and I think that if you're a consumer you're like wow\nIt didn't even win this publication or that publication at one North America and it's just that are that this wide band people picked I think that makes a difference to people who are shopping\nYeah I think sometimes too there are and I've worked for motor two and a car driver both in so they both have their car the your stuff and some people have said in the ... so it's an advertising thing at the end of the day there is no advertising in this North American car the years so it has to be like it's purified by fire in essence\nYeah exactly I mean the manufacturers in advertise after they want it but lately there is no publication that do North American car and truck the publication right that lives and dies on sponsorship\nOf manufacturers like most other publication also yeah if it wins it's 'cause fifty plus people who are experts in the automotive world decided it was the best car and none of them could have gotten paid\nTheir way to really get ... listening in and you can whisper if you want\nDowney who's ahead who's winning\n... just whisper well\nWhat's beautiful as I Want a fifty plus people so I can tell you I got to wait and have been nothing actually a lot of people say well given Carl's history we know is opinion\nStuff in it but I can listen I could sell the insider information [noise] okay\nAnd please just whispering [laughter]\nThe period of time and ah right okay so here when we come back we're going to talk about how\nThere's a big shift going on with these harsh of the north American\nYou know of what is it like the LA auto show which is coming up in Detroit auto show New York uh what's your opinions on that we've been talking about this for a while but it's really asked if I were talking about the

but uh it's called revive or auto revive or auto dot com you can check it out revive or auto R. E. D. I. V. E. R. auto dot com bubble Boston that'll what is this come on just legal\nIt is the world's first digital electronic license plate we've been working with California you know for for a while now since two thousand nine so we pass legislation and we started selling these on the road June first\nYou're kidding me explain for The Mind's eye it looks like and how it works\nOK think about it I had on the back of your car we use a by stable technology and the uh nc display it's like your candle and basically it's attached to the back of your car it's the same form factor as a regular license plate or six by twelve but its digital\nSo it seems like it would be a bit frail though I mean you know somebody could smack it and break it or you know oh no no no so it's\nYeah it's it's well built so what we do is we have a backing plate that we put on where the normal license plate would go and then we told the plate in there and then we have a safety fasteners on the side right so in order to take this off it it'd be like taking off your bumper it's really really secure\nGotcha [noise] now how visible as it is it as visible or more visible I mean I was only ... well I mean is it because it's what are what\nYeah it's back with you know for nighttime driving but during the day I think that's amazing about it is is that the beauty of using a by stable display is that it operates just like a metal plate so you can see from all angles ...\nA hundred and eighty degrees you know the side the front you know top down doesn't matter it it is extremely visible what we do when we take it out is that the the plate we go to the test track the seeds test track and we tested it and it tested you know off the charts so it's a it's fantastic that way\nSo where do you put the stickers\nFor much takers anymore my all digital man it's over airs\nWe have an app on your phone both Iowa and Android and you update your registration by going to Europe\nWhile I was so that takes care of that nasty line to be\nThere you go my friend Choi wow so I Do have more questions but one of the cost of this\n[noise] okay so the costs are are based model\nTo violate let me stop you there because I live in Oregon but I grew up in California and I and I'm In\nCalifornia you know a lot California is that state where everything is like eight times higher than most other states in Oregon it's like two hundred and fifty bucks for two years in California it's a face on the car value and so I I Want to say that before you got it out because you know I mean there's so many factors in there but yes what does it cost\nSo so are based models are based play is for Ninety nine and then the model that has the TPS excel or on it or you know all the goodies is seven Ninety nine so two different models oppressing\nSo this plate does it stay with\nMy car the way I mean because if it was a personalized played I get to keep it but most license plates in most states stay with the car how do you deal with that if you add treated like it's a personalized plate I take it\nYeah so I mean before we could if you think about it a metal plate is something that you know that the state downs but our digital plate you on the plate the state owns the number so to Jay picks\nSo whatever your number is is what the state don't if you want to get especially plate you basically would go an updated and then we would you know present that image to the plate\nIn California and a twenty Nineteen they're going to go to kept tax so when you buy a car you'll have a temporary tack we can do attempt to when you purchase the vehicle and then when you get the the the actual number we update over air so you never have to go back\nHere we go people it's happening we're becoming a digital society [noise]\nOh my gosh well so here's another question for you then what about you said C. H. B. California highway patrol um what about some of these states in California has some of these cameras does the cameras see it as easy or can you turn it off or something like\nNo no the camera sees it as well if it's reasonable and the funny thing is the name the modeling\nThat yes the thought that you use on the place is called penitentiary gothic so you know if you recreate\nThe fought than it's visible to those are ... license plate readers right and it's funny because you know places still made in Folsom\nSylvana centuries [laughter] apropos [laughter] when you're right\nWow okay so this is the first digital license plate in the world and yet it is it what's it called\nIt's called the ... the our plate you know the our city are played well see it starts for fiber okay\nYeah you know we were trying to be cute I mean you know you know apple has their high we were doing the little\nAre ah got ya got sketched out All right so um when in California it's amazing that you got this through in California California can be the worst or the best depending on where you're at in your case it turned out to be the best 'cause I always thought that would have been very difficult but where do you go from here\nWhere we go from here is that will be in Arizona before the end of the year and then um we passed legislation in Texas Florida\nAnd um we had an initial legislation or run in Washington for study next year\nWe're looking a to B and I'm On the state on the west coast in another state and then another four on the east coast and so um it's going to be a busy year we look to be in a minimum of ten states next year\nAll right here's the devil's advocate stuff what if the plate goes out and I'm driving without a license plate and you know\nSee this is this is the beauty of using technology it's at once that images there it's there permanently it takes power for you to remove it the reason why we use you know this by stable technology is that it it takes no Ambien trough for an hour or so when there's an image they're it's it's basically frozen\nWhen you apply power then you have the ability to change damage so worst case scenario would just be a license plate ... and that's what we needed to be we needed to be you know as good as with a metal plate would be\nAll right the devil again what if my wife got me at the hotel motel it takes a baseball bat to my license plate\nWhat happened well the beauty that it is is that it it operates like you're\nLike a windshield so it it would ... the image would still be there it would just be you know cracked you know so

E. dot com\nWhich are more open you know it's hard because nobody wants to be faced but because it's big and all your friends are there but the only way to move in and make Facebook change it to go someplace else and make that big so a lot of people are are migrating over to me we you know what I don't have ads they don't have\nNobody censored you can say whatever you want and people can comment as much as they want and you can have different groups and friends and it's basically based but but without the uh big brother all over\nYeah and the problem is I'm you know I'm dyslexic and the problem is I poked instead of me we I put in ...\nOh my God and you know what you get when you\nAnyways I don't want to do [laughter] not at all\nAnyway yes the world of advertising and marketing has changed and there's more things you have this at a I artificial intelligence\nThat I mean there's actually there's things that are going on behind the scenes in our world I mean if you think autonomous cars are weird dip into the world of advertising with artificial intelligence that's a whole nother subject\nOf course I the reason why I Know some of the stuff I Know you guys I Know what you're thinking out there Allen Taylor\nYou are weird and you're right I Am weird and the reason why I Know about the stuff that I work with entrepreneur magazine and I'm interviewing entrepreneur is that are doing\nThis stuff and I'm like really and I said the one guy go does it is kind of scary you a little bit and he says it scared the shit out of me\nI Know they beep that but I that's what he said this is a guy that doing artificial intelligence advertising it's artificial intelligence advertising and don't even ask me on this show what it's about but\nWorld is changing and that's why for BJ to go to conferences like the Judy powered associates JD power by the way you said earlier\nJD power is the voice of the consumer the voice of customer and and the reason why it is so important is because when you buy a car or a washing machine or whatever it is because there are categories\nAnd you get something in the mail from Judy powered associates of how did you like your car how did it performed for you in the first week month year whatever and they're different categories of that goes into so initial quality study\nThat's one of them they do and\nAll these things are your opinions so when Judy power comes out with one of their studies\nIt's because of you folks have replied to their surveys and said yes this car was fantastic for the first three or four months so we have a lot of friends who work here because we we have friends in every auto manufacture and we're very proud that our friends at key I've done a fantastic job because they took a car company that was\nI think doomed by Americans when it first came to America Hyundai and key above was doomed to be\nYou're not going to make it in our country and they just said you know what we're going to build such great little cars were going to get designers make beautiful designs were going to make safer cars were going to give you a hundred thousand mile warranty we're going to really make sure that we built a quality machine and we're going to give it to you for a really great price\nAnd guess who's winning the Judy power surveys right now\nIs key and Hyundai they're like\nTop over above receipt easing BMW and all these car companies will hats off to the folks that kid and Hyundai for doing a great job or at least we come back she is going to hear [laughter] be just going to talk about not about to you but a Hyundai she's driving a Hyundai Sonata\nS.

now here's your host Allen jeweler\nJosh and God joining us right now the man in the Hollywood that matches the car with the character and all things film and television he's our car guy consultant\nWorks with the movie industry very closely\nUsually has some kind of\nGot a logical humor about movies at least that's how I see it\n[laughter] I actually wrote a book about it and I'm interested in what way do your own introduction by Hollywood car consultant Josh and Josh ...\n\nAli ... this week but it's funny I in preparation I kind of jotted down from things that have been on my mind\nGet your reaction okay\nHow about a four cylinder Silverado pickup\nTruck full size yeah wow\nIt's a thousand dollars more than their trust TV sick\nAnd the numbers are staggering for how much it goes up and fuel economy you know it's funny I've read a lot around at him and I can't find anybody that thinks it's a great idea [laughter]\nYeah I think that you know but here's the deal it maybe is it a mild hybrid or anything that\nYou know it's like what you know\nVery solid organs are very solid motor it's just that\nYou know for going forward actually got I got lucky with the ego booster waving named it right the fact that our motives are pretty fast I'm sure there's a very good motor out as they say and the reviews I ever driven it they they say\nIt's a nice motor\nBut why would you choose it when you good to have their non us fired the six apprehended me sick but very solid and trustworthy\nYou know it may be and I am a let me just play devil's advocate cause like only thing I think to do is they must look at their fleet of vehicles\nFor their ... okay so you have all these municipalities running around not going over probably fifty miles an hour and not going more than a few miles outside of their you know meter readers or I don't know God Knows what is this like a short bad standard cab to will drive I think\nIt's unfortunately the live er and er during this from memory I should look it up right now\nBut with price on a standard six soldiers in the twenty seventh thousands and the only way you can get this force owners to go well into the thirties\nWas R B was because it interesting though that knock you out of an argument about it\nBut why would it make sense out our fleet bases right in the vehicle yeah yeah well I mean listen who knows but\nI think they're appealing to fires or realize they use their trucks to commute you can haul climbing where that enough but the primary reason that they use their trucks as a commuter vehicle and they're like oh I'll take that for so on or off yeah\nYou know it's to me you know me I mean I got a ten cylinder sports car with fiber right [noise]\nI Can't get enough cylinders if I could get you know the the W. twelve I was actually going All right to those baby\nYou know we are and why we know more soldiers really equate to highway high speed you know I just sat as the me alive and you get that thing out and you know hundred and twenty miles an hour with it it it's not breathing hard\nYeah well he got rid of lugging around\nI gotta I got on the freeway and my vibe or the other day and you know the vibe\nOr is just this it's just ridiculous machine it's it's fantastic and ridiculous all seem to I\nGot on the freeway and I think I Would like sixty five and first year my buddy goes\nI'm gonna I'm gonna check\n[laughter] and it's like it's like these things are ridiculous we got sixteen hundred a horse power John in and see in his new venom F five he says he's going to break the three hundred mile per hour mark sixteen hundred horse power\nAnd and yet they're putting a four cylinder with you know probably got two thirty five horse power but\nFor ... you were talking about their ego boost their little four cylinder ... it was like three hundred some auto horsepower for cylinders so I don't know what you know you obviously you don't have the deal in front of you but yeah I agree I don't why do you you're going to do that unless it's\nElectrified in some fashion you know some mild hybrid or extended range electric vehicle so they can use it as a generator on a job site or whatever I mean I don't know it just\nWas I got to throw something else out here why are we calling the new health cat ratify\nNow that no no no it's a it's actually called the red eyes they're still going to build a hell cat they're going to have a red eye and then I think they have one called the Thirteen twenty I'm just telling us\nAir they're literally going to have the candidates seven hundred and seven horsepower\nCorrect seven Ninety seven for the red eye and I don't know what your Thirteen torn I don't know if that's a special dread icing on the\nRed eye is listed as they can talk to a hundred miles an hour\nYeah well probably so tire rating I mean look at no problem you've got eight hundred ...\nHeading up the model that you know it's like health care holds its own and then you know the um\nWell yeah it's you know if they cannot build them fast enough and here's a platform that is a decade old if it's a day old and they can't build up fast enough they're selling every one and I want to get a red eye\nIt's like seven hundred and Ninety seven hours that you know what I mean I'm going to sell my demon for like a hundred Seventy five\nGrand and the profit and go buy your own anyway anyway I I Love what I\nSee I don't love the little itty bitty ended I don't love it I don't hate but I don't love you know there's a big difference there but don't love electric cars I just to me it's it's like a dream I Want the real thing I Love dreaming but I really would rather\nHave the real thing if you know what I'm saying I just leave it at that All right\nWell that really doesn't make any changes in\nYou know and that all I\nJust the real thing is that electric cars are like silent\nAnd and and they're not as response and all those people that drives Tesla's will say you know crazy but I I Love hearing and feeling the raw greedy nature of a big V. eight or v tent under the hood", "show_name": "The Chris Plante Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Johnson City", "day":
