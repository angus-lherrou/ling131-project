Michael weaker but still dropping rain and parts of George as it moves through the Carolinas Michael has left behind mile after mile of wreckage in what we're seeing a beach towns on the Florida Panhandle Jason Gunderson is where the volunteer Cajun Navy out all night rescuing people trapped by floods surge\nAnd also incorrectly believe that the systems could monitor the roadway behind the vehicle\nOr reliably detect the bicycles pedestrians and vehicles passing at high speeds\nAnd that's just not the case\nAnd so lack of understanding\nOf technology even though it's their you know could cause people to make bad judgments you know when it comes to driving also they found that nearly forty percent of drivers did not know the limitations of forward collision warning\nAnd automatic emergency braking\nAnd that they are confused as to what the two technologies are capable of doing um you know this is something that\nPeople need to take their time and sit down and then they buy the car you know always recommended by a car on friday or\nWhatever that your first day off you need to sit in your driveway with your owner's manual open\nLearn about car there's a lot of things on that car that are different\nMost new vehicles come with a a\nA quick guide a quick step guide to get you through the basic fundamental things but sometimes the only way to really understand\nWhat's going on is the dive into the owner's manual\nYou know that would be unusual for me to do that as well bill I mean I understand the excitement\nGetting the vehicle but somebody needs to know what every switch and every light means on that vehicle because eventually\nThey're going to come on and we've got a customer right now with the electrical issue\nOn their Ford Flex and I've been working with him\nUm she called me or an or I saw her in the service drive the other day and recognize the vehicle bill it was a Ford Flex that my wife used to drive\nAnd these folks came down from one of the towns in in the ... cities I won't say which I don't want to identify too much but I'm Bill when she\nIs backing up of course that you know the ... camera comes on but when she goes forward the backup cameras state\nAnd uh we've just had a fit\nTrying to figure out what's going on with this vehicle again it's the technology\nIssue that has to be diagnosed and and repaired\nAnd then also there's a little glitch\nWith one of the the thing had to rear entertainment system and there's a little glitch that happens with one of the a DVD players in the back\nIf you pull out the carpet\nAnd take out the dash and look at the cluster of wires that are in every\nNew vehicle these days you would be amazed than you would wonder why more things don't go wrong with vehicles\nBut um you know I think it would give you an appreciation of sometimes how difficult\nUh these problems are to just to track down in and fix 'em\nYou know it it is a it's something that\nYou know you run into situations sometimes that you just literally cannot find then we have to bring in engineers from Ford or you know if you're at a Chevy store that you have to bring in engineers from Sherry and sometimes they can't fix them and that's when vehicles get bought back\nBy the manufacturer so\nYou know make your self aware of what's going on in your vehicle 'cause you don't want to rely ON Technology thinking it will do one thing and that and it actually won't it's just like the lame keeping have you ever driven a vehicle bill that has lame keeping technology\nOkay so you know if you're going down the road and um you've got that on and when you start to drift over\nUh the string well about right and it actually got the vehicle back to the center mhm but when it does that it if you don't read the steering wheel and and the holding onto it it'll take you to the other side and then I'll do the same thing again some people have mistakenly thought that that\nIs like an autopilot\nAnd that they don't have to keep their hands on the steering wheel but that's not what it is you know it is not a self driving car\nEven though it kind of tends to act like one\nIt is just a very minor type of a

equipment\nManufactured manufactured yeah that's right right uh-huh\nIs that is that those are the parts that were put on your call it the factory\nOr when you have an accident in a car there's a lot of insurance companies that mandate after market parts\nAfter market parts or do not always meet the specifications matter of fact rarely meet the exact specifications of OPM parts\nOr you need to read your policy and see what the your company\nAllows for when you have an accident\nYou can imagine that repairing\nMost a Chevy Silverado\nWith the right front fender damaged\nAnd you put a fender on their from China\nOr from some other country that is not\nWas not made by General Motors\nUh on that and you replace that fender it's gonna be different\nUm they don't have the exact specifications\nUse of those parts\nIs okay as far as a lot of insurance policies are are concerned\nUm there's a big\nFight going on in in legislatures across the country\nI'm specifically in Indiana they considered\nBasically some legislation that allowed some workarounds\nTo some older vehicles you know if you've got to something that's uh\nIn years or older maybe it doesn't matter quite as much it would still matter to me if they put after market parts on my vehicle but\nYou think about I had a customer at bottom vehicle in a month later they had an accident and the insurance company it was a telling them to use after market parts it's ridiculous\nUm you know they should be able to use at least for the first five years or so of ownership\nI'm just read your policy and make sure you understand what what they're going to do the insurance policies\nOn cars are are all very different\nAnd um you know just because you're able to buy a car insurance and you know you might\nGo on line or something and switch because the price make sure you know what you're getting because you may not be very happy if you end up having a car accident\nUh Rhode Island you know very small state obviously but they're going after after market parts\nWith a vengeance those Illinois\nA lot of states are are saying that this is something that that can cause people problems and dissatisfaction\nAnother thing that you need to make sure of if you have an accident is insist\nOn a pre and post\nA laser measurement inspection\nNow we bought I bought this a\nDevice that cost about twenty five thousand dollars to measure frames and I talked about this a few weeks ago that\nUm we can do it is a really cool little device in that we can raise the car up on the list\nAnd targets different metal metallic targets around that big on that this laser reader in the center\nAnd uh just tell the computer system what type of vehicle we're looking at in a van number and all that is very specific\nAnd it will analyze\nThe entire um the measurements on that vehicle to make sure that it is within factor respect\nIf um if you have a vehicle that has been in an accident and you want to do that on a pre repair basis and a host repair basis to make sure that okay was it meant to begin with\nIf it was at the end of the repair is it right now\nBecause this can affect a lot of things I'm\nFrom the performance of the vehicle the handling of the vehicle steak\nWeekend and I've got plenty to do there you go and on that note do have so much to do that you can't be with us tomorrow
