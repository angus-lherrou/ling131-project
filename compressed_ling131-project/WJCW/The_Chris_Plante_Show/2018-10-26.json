back here on a Sunday Edition of my car guru wrapping up the uh the weak and lots of money that's not till next week the week and ah when you don't force\nYou know there's a lot of people that think that the best way to\nBy a car and especially when you have a trade unions to not traded mhm I'm\n... and it's to try to to sell that car yourself\nAnd um I guess there's some people that are successful they have a big enough network\nOf friends and stuff I've seen people advertise cars on Facebook\nUm you know\nThey call their friends and relatives\nDo different things to try to\nTry to market their vehicle\nI've seen people park them in the front yard and you know but it's better for sale sign on it uh there's a large group of people\nAre different different folks on a regular basis go down here to the former bank of America on the on how we'll ebony and green building just park it there with the for sale sign it's almost like there's a\nA new car locked in Greenville and the and you know\nDifferent reasons people\nNeed to sell the car I mean I'm very common one these days is a\nUm they have more cars than they need they they inherit a car from somebody who's passed away or whatever\nBut lots of times people think that they can sell their car for more than\nA what the danger is going to be willing to give up for it and and that may be the case that may be true\nBut you've got a lot of competition\nI'll just tell you if you've got a common everyday car\nAnd you try to promote it and sell it yourself\nOr you're probably not going to be as successful\nAs you think um\nYou may look up and find a neighbor that needs to be a cold or something like that but how are you going to pressure car I mean how do you know what what a good value is some people look at\nYou know Kelley Blue book and they look at the\nRetail price or they look at the private party they look to trade in\nYou know ... how do you know where to be\nYou know you have to know the market and most people don't\nAh families to dance for example um\nAre just common you know and and\nPeople who want\nA basic transportation\nUm you know they they sometimes can uh\nUh find these vehicles are advertised in different places maybe down here at the bank a bank of former bank of America and you'll see a a card that you'd like to have that thing is price\nMay had absolutely nothing to do with the what the market is a you know we know what the market is because we have tools that have been developed to help us know that\nFor example if you bring it up and say you have a very common families today and you have a Honda Accord for example um I'm going to stand up being on the carpet the miles and put all the equipment in clothing sunroof leather whatever special features that had I'm going to\nEstimate what is going to cost to get that vehicle ready to sell let's say the front tires were worn out that it's got a dent in the last quarter panel star in the windshield you know it needs to be service the brakes are worn out so I'm going to evaluate all these things bigger what it's going to cost to get ready to sell\nThat I'm a little look out on the market place\nAnd um let's see okay what her Honda Accord\nUh ... what are people asking for them online and that that's the marketplace\nUm we have a program called pro vision and it allows us to see\nWhat the market is what people are asking for cars like yours\nIf I tried for your car or if you're trying to sell your car yourself and you ask more for it\nThen what somebody could\nA paper that same car\nOn the market you know on the Internet and you're you're not going to sell your car it's just not going to happen\nAnd uh people are so much more informed today as far as prices concern\nThat uh it's not just going to work and you're just going to get frustrated uh-huh so you you've got to know the market\nOr you've got to know the seas analogy of the market and understand that you know okay you've had sun with your convertible\nUh you're done with it and you're ready to sell it and then it's October you might as well wait till spring\nYou know before you do something like that or you know trucks and vans are pretty much you can sell them any time of year\nUh understanding that if you have a collector car or something that is somewhat rare\nUm then it takes longer to sell them are also more difficult to find\nFind a buyer and you have to be able to use the tools necessary to\nMake those cars go away\nThat's one of the reasons that I started\nMy car good ruined started the website and make my cell phone available um uh you know so that people can contact me as the help them\nFind a way to navigate\nTerrain for them and and that that includes selling servicing by trading all that stuff when it comes to cars so\nUm I'll be glad to give you some insight\nOn your car if you\nAre concerned about\nSelling it or trading it before you go trade doesn't matter if you're going to trade with me I'd love for you to trade with me but if not I'll still give you the\nThe information that you need to be able to walk into a\nA dealership confident that you know\nUh what's your car's worth matter of

now that of all that top Democrats and the media was the target it\nMade it almost I Know well then how do you explain the death threats against Brett Kavanaugh how do you explain the vicious death threats to rape and dismembered Brett Kavanaugh's wife and Brett Kavanaugh's little girls how do you explain that was that Trump's rhetoric about the rights to Senator Susan Collins house\nTheir dog had to be quarantined ah her husband had to be quarantined in addition to the dog not to but the dog first\nWe had death threats being leveled against every Republican member of the Senate Judiciary committee over the cabinet thing cabinets family cabinet as friends threatened men is Susan Collins getting the rice and and blow up shortly after\nThe uh rice in envelopes were sent to the White House the Pentagon the CIA and elsewhere all the senior not all but many of the senior administration officials and the Trump White house and the Trump cabinet and of course there's no one who's rhetoric cause that I I guess that was Trump's rhetoric too\nBecause that's the way this works with these with these people these people\nAren't they amazing and that was a Mika she ah she doesn't have a brain which is not her fault she was born that way\nAnd her parents probably didn't have brains either I Know her her father was um an incredible incompetent to gave us they know they consider me here on the left who gave us the or the era of the ayatollah in Iran's thanks very much\nIsn't it the great Sarah let's go to sound bite number one um where did it eight six three zero nine six two five there are there are um gosh oh also we have the GDP numbers up this morning which is kind of fun now it's not for point two percent as it was for the last quarter\nBut the new GDP numbers US Economy grew at three point five percent pace and the third quarter\nFaster than expected\nGross domestic product expanded by a three point five percent annual rate economist Paul by Dow Jones expected the economy to expand by a three point four percent annual rate so it\nThe projections by one tenth of one percent but we're well beyond the three percent economic growth rates that the Democrats said we're unattainable and on achievable keeping in mind that rock Obama's eighth year as president we enjoyed at one point six percent economic growth rate\nThe last quarter was of course for point two percent\nAnd that's pretty darn good to uh and uh the the left if the if they take the house if the left is take the house\nIn the mid term elections in a couple of weeks they will do everything they can to destroy the economy for the presidential election\nWhich will then be a scant two years away and they can't have a booming economy when Trump is running for reelection so they will ah look to destroy tax cuts and undermine economic growth so that they can point to it and say see their numbers aren't so good this is this is what they do\nThat's how they work so that is a a big deal that means millions of jobs the difference between one point six percent economic growth\nAnd three point five percent economic growth represents trillions into the economy and it represents millions of jobs in the United states of America the Democrats would seek to dash that because there are political fortunes are at stake here\nThe New York times has the gentleman that types for the

blow the aptly named Mr blow to be some stuff out of there are big [noise]\nOne thing I find profoundly disappointing about modern liberalism he typed on behalf of the left\nParticularly as it now stands in opposition to Trump ism\nIs the degree to which it is reactive governed by what is going to be done rather than by its own positive vision that's because you're positive vision has played out in Venezuela and it doesn't work out very well\nHe tried to another one to rhetoric mobs and terror say it's a terror now none of this was happening with the rice and letters with the death threats to to the Republican members of the Senate Judiciary committee to Brett Kavanaugh as family too as children to his wife\nNone of this was done by the news media for any of this because they're filth because they're corrupt because their Democratic Party ... journalists at all\nFirst is healthy and then the president is that that he believes he's being unfairly linked to the package bomb in his credit\nNo come on unfairly linked to the passage package bombs centers critics they're actually not if they're if they're not capable of blowing up or they bombs\nOr it's just another macro ally ... but it's still all his fault because they want him to change the way he talks\nAnd and and they're going to blame him for hurricanes and for Bernie Sanders people an for everything else until he stops criticizing them this is really about their own sensitivity under their little girl's\nFirst not to tell the and the president has no plans to pull off of fiery rhetoric and that he will not

New York\nA package that was a recovered in New York I just a few blocks away from CNN was addressed to CNN and it was addressed to James Clapper the former director of national intelligence this and that Pakistan has recovered in Florida overnight which was addressed to Cory Booker\nYou gotta have Williams next door shut up here on the phone with a source gathering junk you don't mind down with your\nMother is up to kiss the ass as a Democrat in rights on his show\nHe brings a mouthpiece out around him and then the\nKids is a real good\nBop bop bop a chunk gives a musician I Wonder if NBC has the marching band did ever marching bands that should they should ever junk should be the ventilator he could be a you know the the music men of or\nIt could be a professor Harold Hill he could be I think is the Herald hill of NBC News but junk he's got he's got a conspiracy theory now again everybody's got a ... this is the this is the program this morning by the way where it eight eight eight six or just by the way we're eight eight eight six three zero nine six two\nFive to six three oh nine six two five and a and if you if you don't say that it's Trump's fault and his rhetoric has clearly responsible and we don't have to know who does we obviously know this is a Trump supporter during this\nBecause he misspelled Florida and all Trump supporters misspell Florida\nAnd other and they don't notice when their computer tells them to check the spelling of Florida that I've noticed that that's not somebody who's deliberately misspelling to make it look like a stupid person and the oversized American flag a ... and then uh stamps and then the er and CNN report in something that contradicted itself this morning\nThat they are all the packages went through U.S Postal service facilities\nTo were delivered by courier and some don't have postage marks\nPostal marks whatever you call them\nUm and now how that makes sense and they wrote that out ahead of time and they sat down and said they all went through postal facilities but some don't have postal march and some were delivered by courier now make sense of that\nThat's that CNN their brains don't work as designed they're pretty pathetic a chunk junk was on the television and he's got yesterday we were kind of joking about it\nThat it's either a righty who lives in a cabin and he's like a right wing Unabomber right with a long beard and and he's making these things buddies to dumb dispel Florida and to them to sell shorts and to them just been spelled Brennan and then he puts stamps on but they're delivered by career and that was enough to confuse CNN\nAnd um and he sent these things 'cause he watches Hannity and that's how he knew to send one to Robert De Niro\nAnd that explains everything say that and that's not a conspiracy theory that's just good journalism say that they're using the old knocking\nAnd and then if you say well wait a minute here\nAll of the return address is go to Debbie ... K.\nAnd nobody hates Debbie wasn't mentioned it's like the Bernie Sanders supporters because she stole the nomination from Bernie and gave it to Hillary because they're corrupt and she was basically run out of town fired from the DNC issues that are the DNC\nOf that and and the people that are really angry with Debbie wasn't mention it or not Republicans she's been irrelevant\nFor a year or more more than a year and she's been silent for months so who is angry with her who what what writing your Unabomber is angry with so angry with Debbie was mentioning is that every envelope has her name on it\nBecause of the return address and I heard somebody suggests yesterday well they put the return address on their of someone they know so that they'll open the package\nWell that's fine but the package don't the packages don't detonate when you open them in fact they don't detonate when you do anything to them they don't detonate period so that doesn't really wash when you say well that's to convince them to open it because then they blow up but but they're not ready to blow up when you open them\nSo that that really doesn't make a lot of sense and they've got these people are supposed to be smart people on television talking about these things but really they're they're morally corrupt they're ethically bankrupt and they and their dishonest and they're not as smart as they appear or their hair cut some ties not withstanding\nUh uh I don't know who did it it could be a righty some nut Unabomber\nWho was a big lefty environmentalists by the way the Unabomber Ted Kaczynski huge lefty never mind that\n[noise] and it could be some left it could be a writer you could be a lefty and then I said yesterday it could be the Russians\nAnd that's kind of tongue in cheek but on the other hand this is the kind of thing that they've done on line so this would be making a three dimensional and a more reality based except this is risky as we're doing it I think that actually blow people up\nSo as we are discussing yesterday this this ... there are clues bread crumbs but I Can't come to any conclusions not CNN and and the rest they can all come to conclusions they came to conclusions\nBefore the whole thing started they that they knew that if fake bombs were mailed that it would be Trump's fault in the future shrunk came up with this I I think he might have been listening because he he likes to and I'm ... and he said this could be the Russians I ...\nI have this fear that it could be some Russian operation to clear designed to do what's happening now more of this you know I think ... and so in some ways we shouldn't allow um I'm I'm ... strange moment it\nYeah it's a very strange moment I think most women so strange for you was that blow\nAs some other uh Fla for I guess for the for the cars aren't they know they could be the Russians well it's always a possibility except I honestly honestly I think the Russians were to blow them up now who would not blow them up\nWhat an angry righty Unabomber not blow them up what's the point of that\nBut if you're an angry lefty Bernie supporter who really has a special burning hatred for Debbie Wasserman Schultz these are really your allies that Cory bookers and ... these are the spokesman for the Democratic party\nSo if you're a Democrat you wouldn't really want to blow them up but you'd want to start a campaign that would allow the news media and the lead up to the midterms to blame Trump for everything which they predictably will do everyone knows that before the whole thing starts let's go to the silly silly Abby Philips\nAt CNN who was standing in front of the White House today and she was playing all grown up she was acting like she's grown up and I she's a reporter I think her parents are probably proud of her the CNN gave her this job but she looks like a deer in headlights and and she's standing in front of her and she doesn't really know what she's talking about\nBut she's a highly paid CNN correspondent in front of the White House\nAnd she is attacking President Trump and and CNN has been blaming President Trump for this since the get go as all of the news media have they don't need to know what's going on who did it why they they know okay and I hear ... Philips she uh she is she's upset\nBecause President Trump isn't sitting still and taking his beating from these twenty two year old corrupt neurons in the news media\nHe is attacking the media for criticizing the way as far as what\nHe's criticizing the media he's attacking the media for criticizing him I say he's criticizing the media for attacking him and for blaming him for these but she didn't call them bomb scares riches in fact what they are\nThese are not really bombs\nKeep that in mind Abby Philips still talking about the president the United states um and it's all because you know he's been critical of people they received these non exploding devices it's got to be his fault it's just a fallacious illegitimate anyone who's studied logic studied philosophy\nRecognizes this as a fallacious illegitimate\nPresident Trump criticized Cory Booker Cory Booker had a non exploding device to him that we are going to call a terrorist bomb therefore it's President Trump's fault say textbook definition of a fallacious ... Abby\nThe main focus on is how ... and all of that I think telling the fact that he's laying out of the ... for ... that thought out people were when I met her at high tide in particular that had been

his ribs\nOr damaged a lung and uh and that was in the CNN will tell you that was over a bundle of sticks along the ah the the border of their property\nAnd and that's what they're sticking with
