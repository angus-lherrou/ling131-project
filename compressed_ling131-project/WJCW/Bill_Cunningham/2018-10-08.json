really motivates you want to do this\nWell every single one of these projects was pretty much dictated by my own cats a cafe in LA that would present different behavior problems I think the first one that I tried to address with a project was my cat's incessant need to be a to drink from the ...\nAnd so I I built that members circulating fountains I wouldn't have to waste water and ever since then I've just realized that you can go through some cat research I learn different ways to make different projects that are the cats I've really enjoyed and I've really enjoyed building\nWhat other examples would you like to briefly tell us about\nSo one of them was beneficial ones that I've had is uh basically just a set of shelves that you can put on the wall so cats\nBehaviorally at least mine tend to benefit a lot ... article mobility to get that our vantage point of Sarah territory\nAnd that this could be a little bit of a tentative thing for some people drilling into the wall mounting something that's going to support the weight of in my case some reasonably chubby cats and and the book I kind of go through a how I learned a little bit by trial and error but drilling into your wall and are doing so without\nCreating a lot of damage and also creating a comfortable perch for your cat is is the point of this project\nLife found your tips very reassuring 'cause I Am very afraid of ruining my drywall in creating a problem that I might not be able to repair so I I particularly appreciate the tips and also related to the catch a few explore some of those engineering principles what did you tell us there\nSo uh at my job as a engineer I kind of analyze\nThe forces structures and and see how much stress they're under and said this is kind of a interesting way to start seeing things once I started doing this more and more once you learn about how forces in a structure interact you start seeing things differently and you start asking questions about building ... and uh\nSo it was just kind of a good opportunity to show how these concepts work with the ... project of the cat shelf and so I kind of do a little calculation to show how the forces of the cat are resolved into the wall without without breaking\nAnd it leads you to make some recommendations about the designed to be able to withstand not only the sitting cat but the cat who jumps onto the shelf\nYeah that's exactly right so I think what a lot of people might be tempted to do is to go out and get just a bookshelf you can get a pretty simple clothing bookshelf that goes on the wall and it'll it might say that it can support that twenty pounds of books on it\nBut what I what the calculations kind of explain is why twenty pounds of books might not be nearly as a detrimental to shellfish twenty pounds of cats and they kind of jump on and create higher forces\nSo one of the materials you like is woods which is not surprising uh what other materials did you find yourself utilizing as you created these projects\nOr some kind of a fun a material that just makes them craft some projects out of I think his PVC pipe it's really cheap to work with it's got slip joined so you can\nBasically put it together it's if it's a a kid a flag goes or something like that and there's there's a handful of projects like that I'm particularly the or the drinking fountains out of PVC pipe but then some other things just some structural and like there's a set of\n... beds that you can make that a PVC\nAnd some name on wiping at my cats really enjoyed sleep then\nI really look forward to making that when I think that's the one I'm going to well maybe the second one I'm going to make a you do need to learn a couple of things like how to drill into PC it's not that hard to cut it I understand\nNo yeah so the ... the projects are also kind of get\nThey don't make too much of a mess a lot of these I actually made while I was still living in an apartment so I made these just on the balcony of my apartment so you can do it if you have limited a workshop space\nAnd that all the projects in the book there are a little kind of step up from what you can do just from a ... perspective we do need\nA some tools for them but I give advice and a recommendations for how to use this so if you're looking for a way to branch out and and make some more technical projects hopefully this is a good introduction to that\nOh it definitely is the book certainly is a a next step beyond a simple carpentry or crafting a truly looks really fun like I said I'm looking forward to the jumping into this what other materials that might you use if you kept on\nInventing um do you see a role for exotic materials in cat habitats or cat projects\nSo I think for for the book what I was really focusing on is is the materials and things that you could get at any comment hardware stores so that no matter where you are in the in the country of the world's you've got these materials on hand but yeah you can definitely benefit once you start to learn some of the concepts through these\nUh I don't want to say basic but introductory projects you can take those skills and maybe branch out somebody sent me a picture last week actually of a tree that they made from an actual tree that fell down in their backyard and are just ... thing that would and they turned it into something really beautiful but are\nAre definitely more advanced projects their\nMac do you see any utility for three D printing in ... projects\nOh three D printing I think is a tough one first size I think uh\nYou can get really creative there but fortunately I think my my cats aren't too picky I I haven't gotten anything so advanced where we we really need a a a a three print that more complex part yeah you can the the good news about if you have one of those simple maker box which are just super fun to play with or give access a lion\nOr what have you with us before is if something breaks or if you're missing apart\nRather than go back to the store if you know what you need you can just kind of print something out and to adapt it yourself so that definitely can save you some time\nWell the book is unique it's very clever you are very funny and the authenticity really comes through so congratulations and I presume it's on sale everywhere isn't it\nShould be if if you can't have trouble finding that you can go to engineering for cat dot\nCom and there's some links and information on how to find the bug\nWell thanks for joining us on animals today appreciate it thank you and
