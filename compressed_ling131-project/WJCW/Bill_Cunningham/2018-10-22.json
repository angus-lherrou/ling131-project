really want to squat on the asphalt right they need to get ready to be on the lawn so okay that enabled along we've got our bags we pick it up within a millisecond after coming out is that okay\nI think that's fine I mean what are you supposed to do when when your dog wants to pee or poop on some as long as this to drag him into the middle of history\nI think some neighbors would like that they would like you to have no dog or keep your I don't know what they want no dogs\nThey don't want their blade of grass stains at all\nNo I Do think we have a neighbor who objects to that very thing\nAnyway the neighbor with the huge signs of that but that's a no fly zone have there's also the one that\nWe have that memory the elderly woman who put this sign it was only for a brief time and I was didn't have the foresight to take a picture of it when it was up but she put a sign on the line that said poison on her lawn that can't be legal that cannot be and you know I think the thing is now that's our main destination\n[laughter] we encourage the dog to go and I said well that's a beautiful looking on over there I think the main objection people have is when dogs you're in a town or long then they leave the smell and then at other dogs wanna fall so then it led to the right spot and right they don't like that\nAnd that spot I've tried to make that spot go away faster with fertilizer or water or CJD it just has to go through its life cycle it's going to be brown for seven to ten days no matter what you do and I will tell you that another element of this survey reported that more than four million tons of dog poop each year are not picked up\nAnd it's just getting incorporated into the world\nSo that's a lot of stuff there but going back to the year and the thing that you mentioned earlier definitely we've got the smell of someone's urine on our Bush right at the\nRight at the end of our driveway I and our dog walking out our very own driveway wants to mark

this this was an operation that was a real golf ration this was an official individuals ended up exceeding the authorities in cities they had\nAnd so over the next several weeks we're going to have tens of thousands of individuals from the most violent place\nOn Mother Earth ... make their way into Texas Nevada Arizona and basically\n... the media is telling us we should encourage it an outlet and and let it occur\nLike Nancy Pelosi said Saturday that she would welcome all of the migrants from Central America all of them\nAre well there's about thirty five million who live in Central America there's about a hundred and forty million in Mexico there's another two hundred million in South America polling has indicated given a choice South America and Central Americans and Mexicans something like two hundred million would come to America or two hundred million or\nWhat would that do to our government or welfare spending ... hospitals do our presidents we wouldn't have a country anymore to hundred million want to come here\nAnd because the way the law is constituted or that or the Democrats were not allowed to change it takes ten Democrats and the Senate to do anything and they won't permit it they will permit\nThat because if you're from other than Mexico too you know the words from Central America and you may go to America there's a magic card that you have to read seeking refugee status and that begins legal process it will take years in the meantime you're inside of America waiting for a hearing that cannot take place where not scaled\nTo have enough camps they have enough judicial officers do you have enough lawyers are not scaled for any of this to allow tens of thousands or millions to arrive at our border so far this year until October first which is what about two and a half weeks ago we have a hundred and Seventy five thousand migrants have come to America this year\nFrom a central and South America hundred and Seventy five thousand we don't have the judges the lawyers the courtrooms to hold hearings hundred and seven hundred Seventy five thousand when you have five to ten year backlogs of millions who adopted heard yet [noise]\nAnd so the game being played by the Democrats is extremely serious or if you're from Mexico here legally you're going to take it right back immediately [noise] if you're from Central America you have the right to hear that goes on and on and on and never stops\n[laughter] so uh I\nI'm interested to see when and if the media will change\nTheir coverage to provide objective information the damages caused by unbridled massive illegal migration from third world poverty driven criminal societies into America and what the impact that has in schools orphanages hospitals\nAnd the rest there is no media coverage of what's happening in Nevada Arizona California taxes through New Mexico through legal migration ... there's no coverage it doesn't exist the murders of rapes and cetera it does not exist\n[noise] remember is that nine\nOf the ten most violent countries in the world or south of the U.S border sixteen other twenty most violent the other foreign Africa and they're invading our country they don't have uniforms on but they're coming here in mass incentivized by our media by the Democratic party\nAs I said in twenty sixteen the reason Trump shocked the world I was because of illegal immigration [noise]\nFederal judges and the economy right now with Trump is our leader everything is coming up roses it's unbelievable the Trump has everyone from North Korea to Russia believing we're about to bust\nUp every new treaty necessary to keep to get America back on even track the trade imbalances are starting to flip\nHe has an economy exceeding five percent GDP the unemployment numbers so not just the ... the lowest they ever could be the or the other three point seven percent of us would not work can be put a gun to their head the terrorists are on the run\nOr ISIS has destroyed Iran is on notice in marginalized and even the Saudis now are doing some soul searching about how they treat people opioid issues prison reform marijuana reform is all coming on the rise this guy is performing magnificently\nBut the media is going to use they think immigration the tank the twenty eight teams to favor the Democrats and the tank this president and twenty twenty now that's not the world that I live in maybe if you live in Connecticut Las Vegas or Chicago\nOr California San Diego that's the world you live and you want more individuals there was a third grade education Eighteen to twenty eight years old with no marketable skills not able to speak the English you want maybe a few thousand more in your community\nOr a place to bring them\nAccording to the Democratic party but that's not the word I live in Cincinnati, Ohio I don't think\nThose who think about these issues in Las Vegas or Chicago or California San Diego Tampa Denver Cincinnati I don't think we think about these issues in ways that the mainstream media can understand I must live in some alternative universe because according to CNN this is the issue\nOf unbridled migrants walking into America that will cause average Americans living in Wisconsin and Michigan their vote for the Democratic party if that's the case I live in some alternative universe that's not the world in which I live [noise]\nI'm Sorry and I wish there was some way through the magic wand that we go to help the two or three hundred million Mexicans\nCentral Americans and south Americans not living a great life that don't have the opportunities that you and I have we're only four percent of the world's population but every year legally through ... says he's we take in legally one point one

simply\nIllegally make their way somehow into America claim their quota refugee get in line for hearings five or ten years from now that will never happen this has fundamentally changed our country does far and it's going to be much worse\nIf in twenty Eighteen what in two weeks two weeks in two days the Democrats take the house and or the Senate\nIf that out if that happens the country we live and will cease to exist do we have the do we have the wherewithal to take in a hundred million people\nAre the schools coined in such a fashion or the hospitals ready to go ... or the bridges and
