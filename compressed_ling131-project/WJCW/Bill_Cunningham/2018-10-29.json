domesticated for a longer and are more easily trained than cats they may be better able to control their behavior and cats might mean more reassurance that they are safe under the same roof\nShe says it's easier for dogs to be happier around cats than for cats to be happier and dogs\nAnd finally the researchers found that the best predictor for happy cat dog relationship was the cat's age when the
