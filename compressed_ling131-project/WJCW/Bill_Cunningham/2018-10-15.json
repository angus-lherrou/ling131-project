Democrats have promoted illegal immigration\nWhich is destroyed black working class jobs and champion Bill Clinton's pro NAFTA policies which have led to a massive levels of unemployment in black communities they've also Democrats who crippled the black families by and bracing welfare writes the penalize married couples to get married it goes on and on and on\n... ... and this was all set in a sense to CNN's Don Lemon who laughed with venomous ... at what these other African Americans were saying can you imagine if a white conservative Republican had called some black guy a house negro\nOr use other racial pejorative against them they wouldn't be kicked off said but not when their own get to do it and they do it with such really and you know when you think back in history\nWhich CNN did the Kanye West borrows from an ugly ugly and tragic history of slavery and the pre civil war you see white slave owners who wrote Democrats ruthlessly\nPunished any black man or woman who sought to educate themselves and think for themselves\nThe Democrat white slave owners in the south headed control blacks maintaining power over them and after the civil war ended conducted by Democrats\nSlave owners had to release their slaves but they formed the Ku Klux Klan Democrats formed the Ku Klux Klan as terrorists arm of the Democratic party\nTo intimidate murder\nLynch suppress and destroy any political activities of the newly freed black population to keep them under control if they threaten the Democratic power structure believe me the Democrats in the Ku Klux Klan went after them hard later on in the era of Jim Crow white Democrats\nCodify into law the idea of literacy test and other means and methods to dumb down and keep African Americans poorly educated and keep them all in line\nTo protect their power Ninety five percent of black people continually vote for Democrats\nBecause the sample shouldn't media like the CNN and ABC NBC and CBS control black Americans to keep

school football game with a relative playing but I thought well this is pretty important so on Wednesday I made a request to the White House to do a short interview\nWhich of the White House should said should be kept about five minutes if it's granted I said okay actually it turned out to be almost Fifteen minutes because the president had so much fun\nSo I met the president in a hanger on friday evening\nAnd about an hour later he was going to go speak in ah north of Cincinnati about thirty miles north of Cincinnati and Warren County at a at a Republican gathering which twenty thousand people show up a little worn county while standing in a field with light rain in cold dark\nAnd the sun was down it must have been forty forty five degrees the president let 'em up\nSo well on friday night the White House said no problem I met with the president\nDid like a Thirteen fourteen minutes interview and the references to about an hour from our relate to the what was going on in orange county\nThen yesterday Saturday he was in Kentucky and uh and beautiful and I think he he told me off the off the air is going to be doing this through four nights and the next three weeks and he said I got more energy about this than I've ever had\nSo here's my talk with the president that uh was approximately seven pm on friday night tater headed\nFirst of all Mr President welcome to Cincinnati thank you you have a long distance relationship here I Do I have had ... ships I had swift in\nWith my father a long time ago and we uh we did a good job we fix it up we uh eleven hundred and sixty four you underserved remember the exact we fix it up I worked here for two summers sick of it it's like a garden that's right right but I should say I don't even know if it's still there now and knocked it down to about six months ago\nA really yellow and gone the whole thing is looting the garbage and everything and what's gonna happen with it make it a housing development oh okay good but it was great for us we fixed it\nAnd sold it for more money and uh it was very good but I Love since the queen city I Love the queen city let's talk about what happened today with a pastor Brunson yeah major accomplishment you're like the hostage receiving president all the world they're coming in how important was due to get back this religious leader who was being persecuted in Turkey\nWell he is that he's a great religious leader and it was a you know they accused him of things that he didn't do but we got him back and we got back I uh we got back many people actually if you look at it as like seems like all the time we're bringing back people\nAnd uh I Know President Obama pay one point eight billion for nothing to bring back a few people from Iran one point eight million and we got him back and he's going to be safe very shortly he's in the air just he literally just took off\nAnd he'll be at the office he'll be in the oval office big welcome a big welcome yeah you know evangelical Christians everybody everybody wanted a back what happened to them was incredible and he was held hostage but\nOh he's a he's going to be happy I'm sure is very happy right now how about\nYour wife is a good trip to Africa sure which is unbelievable what happened there talk about what was the goal in what was accomplished with Maloney in Africa\nWell she's a terrific first lady and a great human being and she wanted to go and see for herself Africa because we've heard so much\nAbout it some very good step but some very tough stuff in the sense of the way people live and she made for substance you also went to the pyramids and Egypt and that was quite something special\nBut uh and the poverty is incredible you know the level of poverty a it was very sad a beautiful in one way and very Saturn and other kids were beautiful they loved her\nAnd she came back and she said I Hope you're going to continue to give a lot of money because they need it it's not a question of it's not a question of defense it's not a question of it it's just such on the human race as they need it and she had a big impact on me I Will tell you a bill she really had a big impact on\nMe and the other thing the mid west I look at Canada Mexico in South Korea [noise]\nMillions of jobs have been credit and you were told a year or two ago by Gary Cohn and others that you know the candidate that was probably not going to happen Mexico's too tough NAFTA is ingrained what'd you do that caused Canada may not be real happy right now in Mexico may not be real happy and then South Korea\nTo kind of play because we're the big dog in the kennel but they don't treat it that way what did you do with the\nTrade deal and we're also the piggy bank that everybody wants to come in and Rob\nAnd uh Mexico we made a deal and we told her look otherwise we're going to have to just actually car industry which would have been bad for them and\nFrankly I wouldn't have wanted to do it but we were going to do it and we made a deal with Mexico we could not make a deal with Canada that just wouldn't make a deal that was fair for us because NAFTA was a total and complete disaster you know that better than all of that you saw what happened over here with you still have building's empty with just everybody moved out\nI don't know what they were thinking so that's why I refused to call it NAFTA I said the deal with making I refused so we called the U.S embassy a and it works good but we made a great deal with a with everybody what happened then is Kennedy came along at the end\nWe were unable to make it I said we're going to tax you cars coming in and then what happened and they made a deal they made a deal they made a deal and it's a deal that we're very happy with I Hope they're very happy with I Hope everybody is but it's a fair deal for us and\nWe have now we just need to deal with South Korea which is fabulous much a a much improved approved deals you know improved I Will say that Hillary Clinton you remember she made that deal and she said it's two hundred and fifty thousand jobs and she was right for South Korea so they got two hundred and fifty we didn't get two hundred and fifty\nIt was a terrible deal so essentially we terminated that deal and we made a new deal with south where so\nMany jobs and talking to my resolve I cannot next year will be talking about a million\nWhat you're talking about millions of jobs for judges don't forget we've opened up countries that were just totally close to it if you look at Canada we couldn't sell our dairy products out there and if we did it was a three hundred percent tariff people don't talk about that you know if I put on a ten percent or twenty percent Arab they make a big deal if they have three hundred\nActually three hundred percent two hundred and Seventy five percent two hundred and eighty five percent these are the terrorists they charge so essentially that's a wall", "show_name": "Bill
