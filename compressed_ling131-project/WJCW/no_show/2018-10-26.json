performing as a have them going to be a little bit and long did it because uh we had several people who were\nIn trying to do the Daniel Boone athletic hall of fame\nThis week as well and they were introduced before the band performed and then took the jerky band a little bit of trying to get some other ... cushion equipment out of the way so that the Daniel Boone ban could perform so probably going to be running a little bit later\nBut um my cold it's been a it was certainly an entertaining first have it both teams moved football up and on the field\nA jerky just had a shooting themselves in the ... but you know we talked about the fact that came in one on the carpet\nWanted aid on the season and she and the struggle to get when you see things like that happen throughout football games or sometimes you yeah you moved to a football but you just can't finish and that's been the problem for the trees that I\nDid when your quarterbacks are leading Russia\nOr that makes it difficult to understand you know you get these games or you know designed for the quarter back to the Russian yard but when he when he was my most people play into his with his feet or with his arm it's you know you're going to be a tough row to hoe and as I said that's why other one is eight\nHundred and thirty four\nOf the hundred and Seventy yard he is attributed to either by throwing the football or by running your\n... they've had a couple of patterns you know who to bend down here are like the like the first quarter either early in the third quarter or the defender Daniel Boone numbered Thirteen a journalist who's been all over the ...\nSaid to touch though don't they had a had a ... a big part and go to the throne or the though wouldn't look it up there and getting on the ball there would have been going through\nAnd you know most of the passes that\nCherokees have been able to complete they have had some fourteen Fifteen sixteen yard completion but a lot of them have been under ten yards or around ten yards they been quick\nHitting pattern anything that's been long down field the trailblazers for the most part have been there to cover ... at good coverage and he's in an in court is either head trauma way Jerome over or they've been knocked up down by the defender or knocked out of the hands of the receiver no doubt and I I guess\nIt was taking the adage of being don't break though they said because they they said ... yards in between between his but once you get down in the red zone is so to speak or\nNot getting Indians are close to sit in the door on the end zone and and you know as as a coach and you know you don't mind giving up your own you don't give up such that\nYou know and good football teams usually seem to find a way to get some break in and of course they take advantage of those break bad football teams\nTend to have a lot of brick go against them\nAnd what do we see Daniel Boone had the drop it at the end zone then from all the football away when they look like sure enough there were a lot of Twenty one to three and then what happens to turkey after they shoot themselves in the court with a couple of holding that'll do they get a high snap yeah over their head\nDaniel who gets to football at the one yard line and they were not going to let that one go by the wayside Charlie cold fix it in the end zone from a yard sale and boom just like that places rep Twenty one to three anyway and now you've got a situation where the trailblazers are going to get the football to start the second half\nAnd if they go down and are able to punch one in the end zone on this position to start the second half\nYeah I'm not going to say game over but it also close to that\nYou know the old adage you know they know to the lady said well the Daniel Boone goes down and scores she can be warm enough yes he's warming up or you know the buses are starting to the bus driver to go to the buses and cars ... turned to bone and that he's\nGoing into a couple of weeks ago uh the trailblazers ... to ... county fifty six to thirty four and it was a situation in that game where they got the big lead and copper county was able to score a couple of late to make the score look somewhat respectable\nBut you could see something like that happening tonight the weight Turkey's moving to football up and down the field you don't expect them to go without a touchdown tonight but I I unless the trailblazers caught the football up and turn it over\nI don't know if the Cherokee defense can stop the Daniel would often too many times in the second happy you know not to weigh a mission Charlie Cole\nWas running the ball actor or responsible he he decided you know I'm not going to let go to the fall anymore I'm\nGoing to score some tests now that I'm going to lead over some people if they don't like it they can try to stop it and they they've stopped him a couple of times on a couple of months but he's gotten forty yard that said oh seven chairs into church now than granted those touchdowns we're right back in the door but nevertheless\nHey you got in his unit stop all\nOnce again it's halftime and Daniel Boone leading Cherokee by a score of Twenty one to treat both teams\nAre on the bill Daniel Boone team is actually on the sidelines watching the band performed Cherokee is down in the end zone loosening up\nWhen the band is done that time is down to about thirty seconds on the scoreboard clock\nOnce that runs down it will stay probably zeros or be set at three minutes\nOr once the band is done and the teams get back out on the field of warm up they will set the clock at three minutes and the teams will be given that time to loosen up and um and then we'll be able to get the stats Beck and a half underway but as I mentioned with some extra activities\nHere at half time things being stretched out a little bit once again Daniel leading Cherokee by score Twenty one to three this is Daniel Boone football brought you by John
