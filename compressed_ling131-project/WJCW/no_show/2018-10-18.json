Newsmax dot com what America network gotta check with your cable company I think see our TV does a great job Fox I Can't watch Shepard Smith in the afternoon if I Want to watch that crap I watch MSNBC\nSo I Can't watch Shepard Smith there's parts of Fox that I Can't watch I Love Hannity I'll watch him Laura no problem Carlson no problem I Love watching mark on Sunday night\nBut there's there's parts of Fox that that I Can't watch\nAnd it's because if I Wanna watch Shepard Smith crap I'll watch MSNBC instead I'm also get the true thing\nBut but I and I worry about Fox long term\nBecause of the drift of what is doing in it concerns me but I I like more information not lasted ... when I I tell you what I Do Chris I get up\nAnd I check out a Drudge Report news match dot com I check mark ... website I go to the Daily Caller I go to daily wire\nI checked out Fox and I'd go to those six or red state dot com is pretty good I checked that those seven or eight and I feel\nFairly well informed to start my day and then throughout the day I check those websites for information I Can't pay attention to the so called mainstream media it's too much for me I Can't watch it drives me nuts but but I think there is information out there but you have to be a little more proactive and finding it\nAnd if you watch the our TV dot com and you and your Newsmax Daily Caller Daley wire Drudge Report I think you're good to go\nI agree except what I refer to is the mainstream media where people don't have the ... and ... they don't go to that effort because they're they're on the fat say don't worry for conservatism is we need to get out there it'd be a competing like the local news and the mainstream media we need to get in there\nYou know Chris I I tell you what would happen in a money controls everything if CBS or ABC said\nFrom top to bottom from the top of the tree through the root system we're gonna have conservative viewpoints on all of our ah channels can you imagine the ratings\nSkyrocketing said CBS News if they determine they're gonna do television much like one of America's network or Newsmax or see our TV\nOr if CBS would say we're going to cover news objectively moderate\nTo the right side of things when they make billions of dollars because you can't NBC ABC and CBS it's the same newscast every night at six thirty if one of them would go against the fracas and reflect the values the once in the whims and the wishes\nOf the majority of the American people wouldn't we be better off and when they make a lot of money\nYeah well where are the people that are being proactive enough to do that to get in\nThe mainstream candidate kissing these radio shows any TV 'cause they're preaching to the choir we need to change your mind it's like they're starting to go out and go on these mainstream media I think if you got to go there\nYes and it's okay to come and be with me it's okay to do Fox or to my friend Sean Hannity now mark ... might get them on on a Sunday night on Fox on the radio\nBut buddy he needs to go out and this guy is wonderful the sixty minutes interview he took Leslie stall apart on Sunday I thought it was fabulous and he's he's his own but the guy's amazing in his presence he looks to be fifty and not Seventy in his presence\nYou know it's like ... it's like being with Elvis and Nineteen sixty eight in a while it's like the Beatles on the Ed Sullivan show which like Beyonce metlife stadium this is a superstar when you get in the presence\nOf Trump it's like the messiah\nIt's it's unbelievable and I've never seen this in politics I wasn't old enough during the Kennedy era Ronald Reagan yes I Want to Reagan rally in Nineteen eighty four\nPretty good but there's nothing in politics that equals a Trump rally and that's why you can go to Montana Iowa Erie, Pennsylvania Cincinnati Georgia Florida hey go anywhere\nAnd draw one hell of a crowd I Wonder what would happen if the Trump stir one to Central Park in New York City I Wonder what that would be like\nSince he took at stall apart you know she she went from ...\nTo ... you know and this is off the subject or something real irony in this because they're starting to choosing him going after young prosecute its its competitor employers he whining about how unfair it is it's cracking me up\nI can I tell you what's unfair criticism when you picture our first lady has a stripper engaging in sex acts in the oval office and the mainstream media doesn't care about it and the other floater says don't gather around Milan due to protect her can you imagine if Michelle Obama was captured in a a video\nPerforming sex acts in the oval office what with the media due to the person that did that to Michelle Obama\nWhere's the high there's non meat because the Trump it's Mrs Trump\nThat that know outrageous sufficient to cause criticism as long as the Trump Bullock we gotta go Chris thanks for your call I'm going to fact\nOnce again rich amount of and Rick

greater scrutiny as the White House tries to craft a response to the presumed murder of ... inside the Saudi counseling in Istanbul\nI think you did and the aliens than the sun and all my medication is that the Saudis skinny [laughter]\nI Love Kenny Rogers Kennedy's hilarious this guy is awesome footage of the Anthony our talk he needs his own show because some of the stuff he says it's great but\nThis goes back to the thing I was talking about yeah he's dead acid bones saw\nBefore he went in a group of Saudi Arabians ah ah went into the conflict and um they took in a a a an autopsy expert in a bombshell they didn't make the most out into the ...\nNo they didn't know they didn't\nSo now the big thing is one of the Republican gonna what are they going to do because they're against the president is right\nLike Lindsey Graham and several others like nope we're done we're done or done we're done\nAnd we've gone to the mat for you guys on numerous occasions we were the ones who are pushing for this arms deal and if this is the way this is going to go this is what's gonna happen this is how you're going to do something and conduct business\nSorry we gotta go we've got to find some other if you will monster\nThat was for what for their own thing if we don't understand Saul you right but that doesn't mean that doesn't mean that we have to just cut him off like advanced offices find some of my colleagues\nAs well and part of that is that complex situation and maybe we diversify\nHerself in this area maybe we do maybe we look towards other\nPut ten ... countries\nIn the region that we have some sort of relationship with its not awful that we can eventually empower them to to do some stuff\nThat is a possibility but\nI Do know that Trump's got to figure something out and they're going to blame him the funny thing is you can listen to the left ... this is only useful\nWe've got a president that has already named journalist as being the enemy of the people so there'll be surprised when other countries take on a journalist murder I'm chopping them into the system and dispose of Donald Trump it was always been critical of the Washington Post\nAlways been critical of his ownership did anybody in the administration and Jared Kushner didn't they ... us a nod in a way to say it's okay\nFor the message that the president has frequently sent to the American people and to his supporters that the media are the enemy of the people\nAnd you wonder if enemy of the people rhetoric has anything to do with the way it was within months of Trump taking office that they saw the worldwide threat journalist of speech and dissent and suddenly are very endangered around the world\nKnow now that the fact that you would say did they give him a wink and and now it's like it's OK is a bunch of crap it's absolutely a bunch of crap but that's what you do you\nGo on and you see the most outrageous things as possible as if he called up the prince himself and said do not this guy he's got three American Kids and he's working at the Washington Post but he's a skill bag go ahead and snuff this guy world K with this because we don't like journalist either [noise]\nNo no it's a complex and\nUgly situation that is isn't going to be dealt with in the way that that you know where we just cut them off because it just can't be that way because of how complex it is because of the financial ramifications because of a lot of things is the reason that all these big companies were going to quote unquote devil is in the desert\nBecause of it there's got to be something there has\nTo be something more than just a slap on the wrist there's got to be something but at the same time can't just cut 'em off at the stump as Kennedy said so we're gonna have to figure something out\nThree two three five three twenty four twenty three and she had been some shows your Twitter you could tweet at us love hearing from you\nKnow buddy won last night's are you are
