employer it's their own fault I wouldn't let this happen and never happened right was that we didn't ... employees or listen to the radio they're working or doing things and we\nWere to happen but Scott were in the world of mass communication now so how can it be prevented if I text you for example and you're in the coming down the hall and you know I'm In the company the other end of the hall and I text you know I say hey check out the Kavanaugh hearings\nAnd you go to your device maybe it isn't on the Internet where the boss can see right there on your\nComputer or maybe a desktop computer but you're checking your email how do you prevent that\nWell if I was in Boston I suspected that going on and I'd be walking around and watch\nAll right Scott in today's society\nDifferent jobs require different attention requires some job Jonah production line you're working constantly is is Dick's alluding to some of those types of jobs where you always have these going my job's a fraud investigator I'm On the Internet surfing anyways looking up people trying to dig into people I can easily\nClick on a different tab and check something out about the case and still be productive and get my actual work done um you know\nI Want to go back to the numbers a little bit\nI think it's disingenuous because they're assuming that people can't multitask and they're assuming that people\nAre in fact ignoring their responsibilities and not getting their work done all they're doing is using numbers to fit their algorithm into their equation so that way they can spit out the result that they want to talk about when in fact the reality is these companies\nProbably didn't lose anywhere near that amount of money they probably didn't lose anywhere near that amount of productivity because as you said and as I alluded to\nTechnology is great we can multitask not every jobs production line not every job is working out on the farm not every job requires your soul attention on just bad job that's the reality of it\nWent on a a a you make a good point and back to the numbers and back to CNBC CNBC and their report went to the U.S bureau of Labor Statistics and they looked at\nHourly wages to come up with this particular senior and they did math accordingly and so it's not so much on CNBC as much as they're creating a possibility and asking that question could possibly be that if you start doing the math\nNow to further that Scott I'll go to you on that Scott when they also look at things like\nThe NC double a hopes for example or the super bowl ... brief on the Monday morning after or a the man on the moon the event when everybody was looking at the man on the moon this goes back of course or the star wars released that goes back of course or even something like a company party\nHow many times are we in a company party and the company goes okay let's all have Halloween traits or let's all have a Christmas yuletide and everybody takes a break so relative to these other things Scott I'm not sure that it can be prevented\nAnd I'm not sure it shouldn't be prevented necessarily Scott\nRight and and I'm Glad that we went to this part of the discussion because this was my primary thought\nYou mean people have a problem with the American working public paying attention to what's going on in Washington DC God Forbid I take some time away and pay attention to that because guess what boss without that working right we don't work right so I mean\nWhen I first heard this pose and I saw this information in this article I thought to myself\nI personally I I have an employee I I have a ... an investment in real estate business that I deal with too and I've got a couple of employees at the property\nAnd quite frankly I'm I encourage them to make sure they take care of themselves first I encourage them if they got something to do would deal with it and this to me as an employer\nThis is not a big deal if you're paying attention to Washington DC good I'm Glad because there's a whole lot of people that aren't there is a whole lot of people that are just walking around\nTaking whatever source they want to look at and consuming it as gospel a preaching and quite frankly I I really disgusted that the media took this angle and if there's any employers who are really concerned about their people paying attention\nI wouldn't want to work for that person most likely will\nTake maybe we should pay attention and not just to some attention maybe more attention to what many employers that were interviewed or trying to\nGet across to their employees was to discourage inter office debate about it\nOr we're in now and that's the same when President Trump on everybody was talking about about let's let's calm down a let's not have a major debate in the office but nonetheless at the same time allow them to pay attention\nTo it yeah I agree with the the thing is the way this article or the way they did this ... this study I guess you want to call it a they made it sound like everybody was sitting there glued to their ... their screens and nothing was getting done you can do both\nMultitasking work do you think they should be\nPaying attention or\nWhen everybody pays attention and they are not learn it on the facts\nThen we can get people that just don't know how to debate they don't know they get caught up in groups think what do you think about that\nNow that is that's very true you need them all the facts need to be able to think for yourself and uh if you just do what you're told you don't know what's going on your on your assuage here and there you don't know what to do\n[noise] did you watch nonstop I didn't watch nonstop within I'm retired like the three ... well that's why I asked you because you are retired you know I watched part\nOf it but then when he got to ... I just got to walk away when ah they started her when they're the damn ... got on it was a joke who's almost nauseating joined just walked away and went down the street and maybe rode my bike for an hour\n... yeah and you've got did you watch it I mean were you pretty glued\nI'm a I I was not I knew it was going to be theatrics I didn't buy it from the beginning um\nSo I I mostly did you know some people tracked sports scores on their phone I sort of tracked a Twitter and other online sources just give bullet points of updates and things that happened um that that's how I followed it\nBut you know Scott there were about a week where Kavanaugh was in jeopardy\nAnd it was not looking good for those on the right conservatives Republicans it was not to his advantage especially when Senator flake called for a number and delay and then it looked as if this could very well turn out not positive for a judge Kavanaugh\nScott as an investigator when they went to the FBI one last time I said check mate because it didn't matter who we check made on it was either going to\nVerify the liars comments and accusations or it was going to exonerate Kevin up\nAnd so what he did was brought the full truth out what it did was bringing it to an October surprise on to the Democrats that self inflicted\nAnd it woke up even more of the silent majority and probably added several thousands of independence to this I majority if not hundreds of thousands of independence\nYou know it's also and we're we're getting down here to the the wrath of the segment deck but what's also interesting is once the FBI didn't come back with their analysis and this\nIs an analysis for the seven time and said there is no there is there that still wasn't good enough for Democrats senators\nYou know they they weren't they had no one can they didn't really care what was it brought back it was just delayed do whatever they couldn't ... with a broad where they were going to argue about\nEither remember before this before any nominee was mentioned are named they were already saying vote no that's right\nWell and that came from Democrat leadership too so I guess in summary um I like it when I see these kinds of statistics because it does point out\nWhat there is a collective what what the collective cost is to employers in general that was just for that day and I also believe that Americans need to know these things if I was an employer I Would say All right everybody you go in at lunchtime and you'll look at the big\nWall screen that we have wall TV that we have in the break room and you can get caught up at that time so that would be my two cents or I couldn't discussion guy kicking off this edition of think America you can find me ...\nFacebook Terry talk radio and subscribe to

I read an article that you wrote for the diplomat and it showed the Chinese view and the American view so take us a little bit go deeper if you don't mind body and take us a little bit historically on how\nChina has viewed American business coming in post Tiananmen Square versus how now we view them because this might be the heart\nOf the issue as to why we got this tariff war me you don't like the term but the President Trump and his administration has used that term before um I think both sides want to get rich\nI you know there there is that the impetus to get rich so take us through that a little bit\nThanks Terry and you're absolutely right [laughter] uh and both sides want to get rich and uh one thing that I often say when I address\nBusiness and other groups is China did not opened its doors to the outside world to the outside world could get rich\nIt seems so obvious they open their doors they could get rich or at least have a sustainable strong economy and country or the year and you're absolutely right that there's a historical basis to this and that is China's been view\nOf foreign powers\nAnd of course they they um you know play this card for all its worst but it is absolutely true that European powers and the United states uh certainly to a large extent\nUm took advantage of China's weakness in the nineteenth and ... centuries ... um set ups Auburn\nA areas inside of China or in which sovereign role in those countries such as the U.S Britain France Germany and others uh was dominant instead of Chinese law we had American navy gun boat\nPatrolling Chinese sovereign waters in the nineteenth and twentieth century um which the Chinese don't forget and haven't forgotten when I first got to China in the eighties there was a great open hostility [noise] uh which uh many of us felt\nFrom ordinary Chinese citizens because they'd been taught that we were there to take advantage of them and that we had cheated them in the past and feeling is still there\nI can assure you it's still there you know I speak Chinese and so I Do most of my business and have most of my personal dealings in\nThe Chinese language and from\nFrom that perspective I can hear the\nFrustration the anger the hurt actually a lot of people feel hurt\nWhen they think about what foreign countries have done to them now\nIs the exaggerated for political purposes inside of China absolutely as I said this card is played it's taught it's tough to children and the time they're very very young it doesn't make it any less real that it's it\nBut we've we've tried to um men is a pain to hurt the wound for example so many Chinese students coming to the U.S for schooling for example\nIs setting up more and more trying to set up more and more trade 'em in ... where we're at right now is that we complain about stealing them stealing our technology\nAnd then selling it back to us and other nations plus we got this other issue that this computer chip issue that was hidden into a mother board of computers that this story just broke recently it was getting into the mother board of computers into a cloud vendor into R D O D\nOur department of defense and maybe even the CIA and the\nOrganization that broke the story was Bloomberg they stand by this story she'll address how how does the United states for one country tried to Memphis loan and then they come back with another irritation\nAbsolutely and uh I don't mean to make too much in the wound because I think it's time for China wants to be a mature uh international player and we can talk about that in a minute maybe", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Johnson City", "day": "14"}
