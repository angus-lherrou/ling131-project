Abdi from Northwestern University\nHi Dr August thank you so much for joining me\nThanks for having me Michelle tell me what is that the test and treat program\nMichele our goal of the the test and treat program is to make sure that no woman ever died of breast cancer or cervical cancer because she didn't have the insurance to cover her screenings\nOur goal is to do the important screenings and save lives our program provides free screenings for women who don't have insurance in a variety of cities across the country we'd love to be\nAll over the country some day and we partner with local hospitals to do the screenings in the unique aspect of our program is\nOnly do these swimming get their ... in their pap test but they get the result of same day discussed with them ... ... just choose a physician\nThen if they need additional testing or additional treatment there are representatives from that hospital right on site to help them a range it helps them go through all the steps of for getting the care they need\nArranged and paid for at the same time while they're waiting for their results we have little how fears they can get there\nThe pressure checked learn about diet exercise there are people on site who how play with their kids you can give them snacks and do that there is no reason for a woman not to get her screening done\nI Love it I think that it's so important because I Know when I go and get my screenings than it is so nerve wracking as it is and you just cross your fingers that you hope\nThese next six months you get a a good result when you talk to the salad and when you hear from them right out there and I think this is such an important program and it really women should not feel that there is any barrier to prevent them\nFrom getting screen that tell me what that says and cancer detecting the diagnosis are increasing among the chance to not only survive but to arrive today\nAs you know there are many advances in a passion\nImproved techniques and radiology different types of ... different types of the other imaging especially to help those women who have what we call ... ... the tissue in their breath\nIn dead of having to always go to the operating room to get her diagnosis on a big chunk of tissue\nWomen can have a biopsy done with just a little needle and as an out patient and this really makes it easier to get the diagnosis makes it less taxing on a patient at the same time\nI think we know we have more and more treatment for breast cancers we have\nWays of looking for is septic molecular target in breast cancer cells that part of the job at the half hour just to look for these target one of the most important ones that we talk about now is called her to\nKnow if women have this this shit they target in their breast cancer there are drugs designed to aimed at that hurt to target to help improve women's chances not only as you said of surviving but also a thriving\nYeah and that is so important and it's really nice to hear that there has been so many advances because we all have friends and relatives who have been affected by breast cancer and it really does affect all of us men women children on one way or another\nSo I really appreciate you coming on the show they tell me where can people go for more information about the test and treat program\nThere are two great sites to go to one is foundation that\nCap dot org and that tells a lot more about the uh the test and treat program and also\nListeners she'd go to your pet ... dot org ... a lot about cancer diagnoses that work in the ... patient story some great videos to watch so they'll do the best places to go\nRace ethic Harry August thank you so much for joining me today I really appreciate you\nTaking the time to time on TALK radio on top of that that's an important topic thank you all so much for joining on TALK radio today I'm a self interest in the past for mommy don't forget you can follow us on social I've had for mommy have a grave rest of the day and I thought the\nBook [noise]\nAbove your ego jaws and this is let's be fair\nTo have you heard the story about the guy who sued Winnebago over its cruise control according\nTo the story you set the cruise control while driving and then look to see to go to Bruce and coffee of course he crashed and as the story goes he was mad that the instructions didn't warn him not to do this so he sued if you've heard this you're not alone it's part of a viral email about five crazy lawsuits that received the so called Stella awards\nThe awards are named after the woman who spilled coffee on herself and sued McDonalds the problem is all these stories are fake yes urban legends\nIt's easy to believe them though because so many real lawsuits are just as outrageous\nLet's be fair there is a better place for information about how junk lawsuits are affecting America them through phony emails to get the facts was at our website the information we have is\nVerified improves once again the truth is indeed stranger than fiction\nOr website is Center for America TV dot org [noise]\n[noise]\nLittle wreck investigation Michael on the

rainfall making his way from Georgia and toward the Carolinas heaviest rain maybe near Tallahassee could exceed ten inches\nFrom Florida politicians have suspended or alter their campaigns because of the storm governor Rick Scott has issued a state of emergency order for twenty six counties in the Florida Panhandle and Big Bend area where winds could reach more than one hundred miles per hour\nYou know the biggest mistake we see I'm not leaving when when they really ask you to leave and I know nobody wants to leave their homes nobody wants to leave that behind [noise]\nBut um I think this is a good example of so many that were left behind 'em at the last minute so these people in this day and then they had to be\nIn many had to be air back that was so ... so on and they could take their pets with 'em and they'll regret that ah the rest of their lives so the first thing is when you get an evacuation notice get out get a car take your pets go some place to have a call it a vacation whatever it just get out of their\nUh but if if if ... and I say this because many people won't leave have have extra crate trendy\nHave carries for your cats\nUm build something that is as high as possible in your home or whether it's built on top of the kitchen table so forth and so on or your cats can climb um\nAnd that's that's you know that severe that something but that's\nWhen we see that that's what we know that the animal made it often time but someone had made shift something that they're out on the go on top of couch couches on top of couches those are the animals that survive I'm absolutely\nLock your house if you can censor our animals inside and be diligent you know when you when you leave did try to reach the rescue groups that are on the ground and ask them for assistance um if it's safe to go in get them in their\nAh but preparing a you know you can't prepare when these things happen you have to be repaired prior\nUm and the key is to having you know a plant a real plan and you know a carriers and creates a lot of these people don't have carriers and create so they can't take their animals out\nA lot of people can be evacuated potentially what their animal if they had a carrier and they don't have the area so that the number one thing that I Would recommend most everybody\nYou know from our perspective here in Southern California we were watching the news and we knew this storm was brewing and we knew pretty much where it was going ahead and it seems to me that we had a lot of time to plan for this and yet you told me it's sort of two people by surprise word what am I not getting here\nWhat people thought was yes we're going to get flooded out there to have a lot of water\nUm I'll deal with it all out you know work this out like we worked out the other floods uh and and and in their defense I guess they survived those previous floods this time the water was over there\nAnd when that started happening people said okay I'm In trouble I should have left\nAnd right now and these are people who many of them had pets and they had to be here backed out um\nYou know the national guard and so forth in other words she's had to get them out but to get the we're not able to take their pets in most circumstances and that again will forever weigh heavy on their hearts um we rescued a couple of dogs three dogs out of our homes\nThat were theme that um they said they check the house um\nAnd uh the two dogs who who are not\nVisible um but we got there when it gets find the dogs are we found a house with dying cats in it that again I'm everyone assumed the cat's with that but they were able to get just on top of the kitchen cabinets\nThey're very very top um and the first day where the water came in the water was absolutely um about three quarters way up the house she so that's what gave them the ability to survive and they did survive\n'em but you know it the last minute you don't have time you're not going to be able to show for your pets around\nAnd there is no one else there to help you accept first responders and at that point it's just too late\nRobert I'm Wondering if you can give us a little taste of some of the other activities or your position is up to I Know you are interested in preventing an investigating animal cruelty and abuse can you tell us a little about that\nShow we have a a an investigation unit that works with a ... page says she and other rescue groups around the country are you do the Plymouth area investigations and then we turn our findings over to the authorities that we feel with this

respected in the in the industry and um [noise]\nWe lead some great investigators um show somebody's if somebody's ah involved in dog fighting and let's just say it's been known locally and a very small town and everyone thinks it's no big deal and they're afraid of them and\nUh maybe authorities just feel it's not a big issue we get cold and we\nPrepare the case or and then we turn it over to the authorities and we we we make sure that something\nIs done justice is served a and we stay in behind the scenes but we've been involved with quite a few cases recently we're very proud of and a half hour that the gators or a ... they really are\nOkay and Robert you've got a dog house program which that\nIs way too many dogs that are legally allowed to live outside or are we to up part and

interested in alternatives to animal testing always on the lookout for new technologies and for the people advancing this rapidly growing field so I'm really excited to welcome Dr Thomas Hartung professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of public health\nHe holds a chair in evidence based toxicology and he's director of the center for alternatives to animal testing in the department of environmental health sciences at the school of public health welcome Dr Hartung\nYes hello pleasure to be here\nTo begin can you please give us an overview of your work especially the aspects concerning the replacement of animal models in biomedical research\nSure um I felt was actually very early in the field I'm already ... mph DC this at the University of Houston's in Germany that developed in a ton of this method for information [noise] and it's brought me into the broader community of aiming for an American I spent [noise]\nI Know the last three decades I been taking up of several roads in this place [noise]\nSo I started off with developing then after my PHD in the parishes and asked for this test\nBut actually I'm not for us to use nowadays about four hundred thousand rabbits that you find out if Michael Bennet come nation in India if things get going to inject into patients [noise]\nAnd I developed this test tend to three years ago and\nHere it has been accepted by all left in the international standard organization for medical devices last year by the summer of beer and a lot of it has also been made of the show to test whether you in from a computer but is it ten different it is a long period of time [noise]\nUm and then I've become the head of the incentive for the nation of a ton of this mess of\nOther stuff out of the European Commission or at the time it was a sixty five people in situations to promote a tentative and valley dates\nSoldiers so that they are actually doing a privilege up\nAnd just about ... million budget I was able for ... years to really make a big push towards new approaches in European legislation empathy agencies but to sell mine I made a change and\nMoved to the U.S and took over at Johns Hopkins the center for us to animal testing or the center is um the first\nAnd I would say uh the premier information on a ton of his methods in the U.S [laughter]\nBit just celebrate it also does seven on the wrist or even\nA so cats as we call it um is a center which brings stakeholders together but he also doing research research for example in developing human minibrains to test on these instead of rats and mice\nOr we're developing computation and methodologies to predict properties by computer instead of using the animal tests [noise] okay\nThanks for that overview can you just get us up to speed on toxicology can you define toxicology and uh how's it changed in the past twenty or Thirty years since I graduated medical school in Nineteen Ninety One it looks like the field is change so rapidly\nChanging into changing though ... didn't tops ecology changes over do you have to mention um toxicology ... with the safety of drugs and chemical and we would love to have a safe environment we want to know that the things we are consuming eating a are safe to us\nUm however it is the only field of science which ... search engine only very slowly I just turned fifty five years and most of the animal tests which still using have been introduced whenever market born on kindergarten\nAnd um so this is really a very unique positive sign but normally the exchange very rapidly in favor of TV extremely conservative wants to introduce the test we never get rid of him and to get it again [noise]\nA top psychology is only using about ten percent of all animals\nBut about Ninety percent of divert for tennis is done in this field and this has to do with the fact that you have not a moving target that these essays are armed and that you can really develop over ten sometimes Fenty is tentative under something is actually being replaced\nSo the way we got connected with you was when we reviewed a recent paper where you and your group looked at data base analysis to try to predict toxicity of
