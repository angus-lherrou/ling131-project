M. O. R. I. C. I. and the numeral one grieving Peter\nAh good evening nice to be with you\nGood to have you with us tonight and we had a number of things we wanted to talk about tonight which we will get to but before we go any further since you were a man of opinions on a wide variety of issues I'd like to have you weigh in on the likely impending confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to be a Supreme Court justice\nWell gee you know that senator from Arizona I wouldn't have let him go to bed alone tonight I mean I it from the from the from the Senate room or a in Washington After that he voted I Would ever since and would've marina escort to his homes and nobody harassed them say get changed his mind again [laughter]\nAh but ah other than that ah my feeling is that you have a right to demonstrate into petition your government and everything but I Know back during centers and all and all that I think that that can be limits that can be a time when you say well you know\nIt's off limits now we we we've had our debate so we've had our earrings and\nAnd we're going to close the Senate building a to anybody who doesn't have a number a court in the way a and and and let people both these\nWhat you have to at some point you've got to have a rule of law and and and ah we might as well get right to that which has been an issue\nThat I have been upset with for some time and that is what I refer to as the uh\nThe anarchy factories we've created into I'm Talking about our institutions of higher education knives are bad enough that that people are are are taught to that or however you feel whatever your whim dues you or maybe that's a\nThat's your uh your marching orders and heaven forbid we should ever try to uh to inhibit you and under cut your self esteem\nAnd that the rule of law means nothing and that if you could shot somebody down or you can easily adopt the tactics of Hitler's brown shirts for all the while chatting that you're opposed to fascism\n... we've got to do something and I'll tell you what I don't understand Peter\nOr maybe you can in light me on this\nIs going to be tough enough to bring about this change at private campuses but at public institutions largely funded by state tax dollars why in the world have the chancellors and presidents of these schools not been called on the carpet\nBy the state legislative education committees all across this country and said you will fire the following people or you don't get a penny out of this government well let alone having\n... very reluctant to censor higher education but we've had is we're gradually gone from academic freedom to\nAh basically said academic or negate anarchy but it really is an energy I mean isn't chicken say whatever you want to do as you please but rather you have to think a certain way say certain words or a I think it's more like what's going on Facebook\nWhere you're not even allowed to show up and sit in the same room is judge Kavanaugh well at least in in hearing your friend is without being called out of some sort of trader and being ridiculed and badgered and and probably driven from your job the director of global operations today made a terrible and tragic mistake\nAnd that is that he apologized for his actions are and now they want their pound of flesh and Don it they'll get it and steady should've challenged ... to say look every Facebook employee is entitled to their own political views there is no orthodoxy here when it comes to whether you're a liberal or not\nAnd if you don't like that than it is it it is it my director of global operations should that should lead that vice president that's it you know but the thing is that ... created a monster\nJust as they have at Amazon and Google and so forth a you know the the leaders are so liberal so off the cliff to the left and they and they're so tone deaf about it\nYou know they'll they'll they'll they'll back movements and and and that that are very very much to the left\nA A N publicly and then expect their employees not to follow and so they developed a culture where you're just not welcome\nIf if if you don't if you don't basically ... extreme left wing views Facebook's that way a Twitter's that way or certainly Google's that way and there's no freedom of thought in those places no freedom of conscience\nAnd so that's what it's like to be any university these days I've been at the bottom end of it I can tell you you have to have your furniture disappear from your office you have to have your uh uh your courses disappear from the calendar just before registration so you don't get any students\nUh you know from the from the computer system you have to have the finance departments chairman\nShoulder into you know as you're walking by ... over six feet of ways over Georgia\nAnd and your five foot six and weigh a hundred and fifty you have to be called in for which choice I've had those things that's why I'm retired\nWhenever something bad would happen to me and my department chairman would say I don't know why these things that happened to you Peter ... I don't see you can retire one is just quit\nThat's why I Am saying that state legislators all across the country should be calling these people in and demanding you know why I'm listening to make substantial changes the policy and personnel why they should get another patio of state aid\nWhy do people bend over backwards said to me too movement\n... [noise] I'll put it this way if in fact a woman who's actually assaulted the ... you should receive justice there's no excuse for what are we going to be in college campuses around whatsoever\nIs it that's not what it's become it's become point the finger and you're guilty looking Garrison Keillor\n... public radio the what's happened remembering the private sector you not entitled to due process\nSo the slimmest accusation and if your employer says it's too much trouble for me to be involved in this it's too much bad PR you have to go then you have to go now most of the people that get fingers pointed out the more guilty\nBut not all what's more the punishment should fit the crime the question is what the person do they make a glance that a woman didn't like and intentionally do it that's a very different than touching a woman and things of that nature\nUh and it's very you know but let's get into all that because I'm not ... you know that's that that's what I'm not prepared to talk about and I understand but the point is is that is that we've gotten to the point of tyranny we've gone from justice\nTo mob rule and where do they learn they learn in school you know ... these days they\nDon't educate they indoctrinate exactly we've lowered the standards dramatically or said\nIt was a lot higher education that's a doctrine Asian therefore cut off the money until they change or leave how was your change\nHow do you decide which correct my answers get them focused on producing quality students to get four four and a ten students they graduate and many don't ever graduate or he can't do the most\nBasic things that we expect of a college graduate precisely that is that is look at a body of data and come to a reasonable set of conclusions\nAnd offer balanced presentations in the classroom well you can't do that you're not allowed to run away and what do you mean you're not allowed to change the law\nWhether the thing is it's very hard to do that but what you can do is start measuring outcomes in higher education or go back to college entrance exams so that we know the students all the students to come in our confidence and capable of learning\nThat would be helped were again that that would run afoul of an awful lot of of agendas out there it's\nActually it would but it but it would get the job done in the same time the\nOther end have an exit exam so that at least that everybody the graduates has some minimal level of confidence and uh I Would I Would go further but that'd be the start because then the fact that they would have some photos on their on the second thing is that I Would I Would start\nTo to put make them responsible for some of the student loans or have them ... skin in the game were coming up on a break", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "Johnson City", "day": "06"}
