Seventy three percent had an imbalance and I've got my cough microbiomes compared to only sixteen percent of healthy people that\nThey know how to do is go ahead and try to correct that's I mean I Know probiotics as a big thing but what can people do who are struggling with that\nWe actually don't know definitively about the role of addicts that's still an area that needs a lot more study certainly not a treatment family all agree that it's not a treatment summarized important thing for people to do is to see their health care provider if they have any unusual abdominal symptoms\nYou know we wouldn't hesitate to take our kids to the doctor if it had a medical problems\nThat we don't really always put ourselves on the top of our to do this show the bad news is only about thirty

Republican Senator Marco Rubio reacted to Trump's comment that if the U.S cut arms sales to Saudi Arabia over the disappearance of journalist ... the country would be punishing itself\nAnd the study that must have really scared the dairy industry was the one published in the archives of pediatric an adolescent medicine and twenty twelve\nThat showed that active children who consume the largest quantities of milk actually had more bone fractures than those who consumed less wow milk doesn't\nActually build strong bones like we grew up to believe it like others told us it like the milk industry always implied that it did and still does\nYes of course calcium as an important mineral that helps to keep on strong and yes indeed accounting is necessary for healthy bones but the actual amount of calcium needed for this is easily cheap with out consuming dairy products\nAnd I can see how one might believe by the misleading promotion milk products\nThat there's no other way to get adequate calcium and one's diet other than with theory or its products that's also probably the most frequent question beacons are asked after where do you get your ... is if you don't consume dairy products where do you get your calcium from\nWell I'll tell you plants foods such as kale broccoli\nOther leafy green vegetables beans and lentils are loaded with calcium holy products dried fruit\nNot since seats on this but you didn't think almost are loaded with calcium did you also I consume a lot of calcium fortified products such as breakfast cereals and juices by the way soy milk and fortified orange juice provides about the same amount of calcium per serving as milk or other dairy products\nThat you know that it's possible to decrease the risk of osteoporosis by reducing sodium and taking your diet you rarely hear this kind of very helpful information in addition\nExercise is one of the most effective ways to increase bone density and decreased the risk of osteoporosis and the benefits of exercise had been observed in studies of both children and adults\nAnd of course you need vitamin D to help with the absorption of calcium so where do you think your vitamin D the best natural source of vitamin D\nIs sunlight\nSometimes it just takes only less than Fifteen minutes of sun exposure to the extremities hands and face to be enough to meet the bodies requirements for vitamin D and it depends on the person's skin tone and it depends on where you live and during the winter months you might not get enough from the sun alone so your diet must provide it\nI personally take a vitamin D supplements because few foods naturally contain vitamin D and you should know that no dairy products naturally contain vitamin D\nYou can get vitamin D through fortified cereals and grains bread orange juice and soy milk but like I said I take a vitamin D supplement a vegan one of course and by the way finding Reagan supplements or vitamins can sometimes be very challenging as many or most I should say containing greedy in St arrived from animals\nFor example gelatin\nWhich is a flavor was fruiting greedy and drive from college and obtain from various animal body parts is often the capsule of many supplements\nAnother example of some calcium supplements are made from oyster shells but then he can supplements are out there and don't be fooled remember the terms organic or natural doesn't necessarily mean vegan [noise]\nOkay so we talked about calcium we talked about vitamin D how 'bout potassium because remember the commercial says one at a two kids don't get enough calcium vitamin D and potassium one simple way three servings a real milk a day\nPotassium is an extremely important mineral the body needs so it's definitely worth mentioning and from the commercial one might think it might be difficult to meet your daily potassium requirements if you don't drink milk\nI Will tell you it's difficult\nTo have a dietary deficiency of potassium\nSince potassium comes in a wide variety of foods you probably already I mean you would have to really avoid all the fruits and vegetables to be efficient and potassium potassium rich foods include bananas oranges orange juice raisins cooked spinach mushrooms sweet potatoes potatoes ... autos\nTomatoes you certainly don't need milk to satisfy or dietary potassium needs so\nYou need to know that this notion that milk is essential to support bone health is simply just wrong so are there any health benefits of milk\nAfter all milk does the body good right wrong\nDid you know there's a link between consumption of dairy products and cancer most significantly dairy product consumption has been linked to increased risk for prostate and breast cancers\nAnother milk another dairy products are the top sources of artery clogging saturated fat in American diet milk also contains cholesterol and as you know diets high and saturated fat and cholesterol increases the risk of heart disease\nInsulin dependent diabetes or type one diabetes is linked to consumption of dairy products in infancy\nAnd then let's not forget the numerous contaminants and milk which range from hormones to pesticides and other toxins antibiotics are often given the cows for certain conditions and inflammation they suffer from due to dairy products practices which have cows producing much more milk than nature intended\nAnd happen all the other contaminants founded milk products like Melanie often found in plastics which negatively affect the kidneys and urinary tract\nFurthermore the American Academy of pediatrics recommends that instance below one year of age not be given whole cow's milk\nAnd we now know that breast feeding mothers can have ... babies if the mother consumes cow's milk the cow Santa bodies can pass through the mothers bloodstream in Newark breast milk and then to the baby also did you know that more than sixty percent of people are lactose intolerant\nWhat does that mean will lactose for milk sugar needs to be digested properly finance I'm lactase and if you're lactose intolerant you can't digest lactose because your small intestine doesn't make enough lactase\nSo what happens if you eat or drink dairy products you can get a variety of uncomfortable symptoms including bloating diarrhea gas nausea abdominal cramping\nIt seems to me if we were meant to consume lactose or milk we would all naturally have the enzyme lactase needed to digest it\nBut that's the thing milk is not natural for us to consume I mean cow's milk might be natural an ideal for growing baby cows would fully grown humans drinking secretion from another species\nIs not natural so bottom line\nMilk and dairy products are definitely not necessary in the diet and can in fact be harmful to one's health\nSafe tuning into the show don't go way more with animals today right\nHey this is talk to Laurie ... and thanks for listening to animals today not only can

you ever wonder if your dog is at risk of being stolen your about this once in awhile how big a problem\nIs the theft of dogs anyway we've been wondering about this for quite a while and I'm pleased to welcome a real expert in this area ... she is director and co founder of last dog so it was constant and co director of last dogs of America\nHi Cathy Hi how are you\nUm find welcome to do we have a handle on the scope of dogs in the United states how big a problem is this\nWell we think we do because we taking report every day all around the country for a missing dogs and we can literally hundreds report every day\nBut what what we found in our eight years of experience at doing this is that when a dog was innocent people tend to panic\nAnd when they panic they um they you go out there thinking they don't really think through the whole problem that we like to really approach logically I'm In the office Seward August installing so they report stolen dog\nUm but then as we work through the process we find that they don't really was not stolen after all and then the new simply law or um the other really really common scenario by far probably our most common scenario is that the dog was picked up by somebody who meant\nWell meant to keep it out of harm's way and then possibly did the wrong thing by either keeping the dog or recall him and the dog or I'm taking the dog to the wrong shelter things like that yeah so in the grand scheme of things when we look at everything at the end of the day\nThe percentage of stolen dogs is still very very small and I'm not saying it doesn't happen because it does but even very small and when when we finally stolen dog is\nEither to climate intent so somebody actually broke into your house\nUh your business your yard your car I'm In and interviewed on just like they would have your jewelry or your TV set or whatever and and again that is something that we find that I guess it does happen but it did not happen nearly as often\nAs the media has led people to believe and I have a bit of an example of that because when I didn't catch it\nYou know a onto went with a new report their dog stolen and that gets put on there in the media that makes the headlines and uh but when the dog is found and it was found that really ... was never still after all that is very very rarely reported on so in this you know kind of swirl around and people's minds and they assume I'm\nThat you know that there was this huge problem out there on and I actually look back at an old story that uh we had actually reported on several years ago um that the American kennel club had put out a press release saying that I'm done mapping cases are up by almost Seventy percent but when you and that was the headline on story\nAnd that got spread everywhere that went to all the the major networks\nUm because it came from the American kennel club but when you're done great down into the story on the actually the the numbers were so small so they had four hundred and thirty two pet pass in two thousand and loving and again this is all across America\nI'm as compared to two hundred and fifty five in two thousand and ten so it was really only like a you know ... although it was a percentage wise and to the ... the increase it really was not a large number of dogs when you compare that there's about a million dogs in the United states\nYou know OK so acknowledging nothing much larger problem is dogs getting lost rights and we might talk about that off and on the show particularly around\nThe upcoming holiday like Halloween and all the things you want to do to keep your dog for bolting and things like that or we do want to just go a little bit more about the ... problem even if it's smaller than a people might think precautions just so so horrible to contemplate and there's this video that then I just came across\nYesterday that I shared with you on a few dogs they're in a field behind a sense on an a on a country road and\nTwo guys pull up and one of them just reaches over and grabs a puppy by describes his neck and puts them in the car and they're they're gone it was just shocking so can you interpret that video or comment on it and\n... yeah and I thought the onion is very troubling to a good thing is is the first of all we would recommend that many you know that that happens to anybody that they maybe they follow our police report and then they do what\nI'm that hormone or you know did and we just look at security footage and you will be amazed at now how popular security cameras are and it's very likely that somebody in your neighborhood has a camera that media has caught an image of what actually happened to your dog um\nBut then that being said\nWe have also found that it it's sort of like murder when often that a person uh that committed the crime was known to the victim\nSo we when we really do know that a dog a stolen we asked the owner to first of all think", "show_name":
