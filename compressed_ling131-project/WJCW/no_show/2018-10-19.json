control the house and Senate\nMeanwhile Democrats tonight are telling you that Disney is evil because in Nineteen thirty seven when the door for hanging out with Snow White and that French kissed know why it was in a coma dying\nShe woke up and the me too movement has come after the Disney prince saying he didn't have snow whites consent to cancer\nAnd you and you wonder why\nYou want to you wonder why I don't trust the left\nYou wonder why\nThis is why it's scary it is really really scary what they will do\nThis is how crazy they will go these are the same ... and with these are the same women they're involved in all sorts of movies here complain about this that all these moves that rumor involved with all sorts of different non consenting moments\nBad moms nine consenting moments\n\nBut hey let's not look at what they do for a living 'cause that would just not that I mean let's just not do that Rick\nThanks for wedding you're on the market venture Ben Ferguson filling in and I go ahead\n[noise] hey Ben thanks for having me on my uh uh really enjoy your show great thank you had a good\nQuestion I'm trying to gain some a little bit of understanding and and I I mean I Know deep down what the answer is but more from a logical standpoint let us know few years ago Mr Obama\nFiled federal suit against the state of Arizona and Governor Brewer for trying to enforce immigration laws they successfully argued that immigration was the purview of the federal government [noise]\nWell now we go back and at that time ... the state of California and a few other states joined with the federal government to win that argument well no that Mr Trump is they're trying to actually enforce the immigration laws\nSome of these states are suing saying oh wait we can do our own thing as well such as California with the uh [noise] a sanctuary city yet\n... it's ... it's because it's whenever they don't they ... people need to understand about liberals\nThey don't have a set of values they stick with its the values I think at that moment will help them the most that's the reason why they're willing to do whatever I mean there can millions you a liberal it's easier to be a Democrat in politics because no one will ever criticize you for for ...\nNo one will ever criticize you for doing one thing or saying one thing one day one day and doing the complete opposite the next day me in\nThe ... the part where I'm confused as is if is with the court to who sit there and argue the whole the whole notion of story to feed system stuff like this yet those think courts are\nStepping back and in reality they're decisions don't stand ...\nWell you got to remember we're talking about ten years ago when Obama was talking about enforcing the border and that that issue Democrats thought was less popular to be anti border security now they're they have to go all in on it wrecked because if they don't eventually I think they'll keep losing the Republicans like Donald Trump\nThey need new voters in here and they need to give out amnesty and they need to do a quick ... and if you had to enter the I mean we could take cruises a perfect example with is better race if all the illegal immigrants from Texas could vote\nOh absolutely absolutely and and you could argue there's virtually it's impossible to win a presidential election if you as a Republican don't win\nTexas for darn sure and really there's a very good chance every time for us and when you got to win Florida because you're never going to win California well if you can turn Texas to them\nFor the Dems those three states ... it's virtually impossible to do math ... makes it were a Republican win win the White House so all you need to do to switch Texas over is just skip the illegal immigrants are there the ability to vote\nAnd then you got it the same way that you have it in California\nThe same exact way\nBy the way we got some very important breaking news Rosie O'Donnell you know she is very serious commentators she was just on MSNBC deadline White House\nAnd she had some very um insightful words and commentary and analysis about the two thousand mid term to maintain midterms elections here is Rosie O'Donnell the liberal wing of the day with some great advice and analysis for this upcoming election listen\nJournalists here who you call that any of the people ask me all now he's doing that here's a guy who was tortured and killed a journalist was thinking of fat and\nThat's why I'm not thinking about it which is also equivalent to the truth about it\nSo now Donald Trump wants to kill American journalists\nPer Rosie o'donald\nAnd doesn't want to and wants to scare journalists\nO'Donnell says he's doing that to scare every journalist here\nHow many calls enemy of the people as we all know he's doing that\nHere's a guy who was who was tortured and killed a journalists\nAnd this is Donald Trump sweat dream to scare all journalists the same way\nThat I

are thinking potentially that he's going to make a\nAnnouncement while he's in Arizona that they could be sending troops or something there but this comes at a time on the back of of of Kavanaugh\nAnd all of a sudden this this excitement and enthusiasm that wasn't there for the Republicans came out of nowhere and kind of backfired on the Democrats and now they're doing as the as ... is that the same level or higher now all of a sudden you've got another caravan coming here and some people are saying if\nIt's if you will the enthusiasm and this is is hitting at the right time and may cause even more excitement and enthusiasm for Republican voters\nThis election as a wife and the struggle with a left wing movement which ones to radicalize America\nYou know you're happy that they're more people work such as people off of food stamps cement there were no longer dependent on government so if you're a left wing Democrats so it's actually bad not good I have a production view I think two words\nI'm going to define the night of the two thousand Eighteen elections and the nursery was one is kind of an ... and the other is caravan\nYeah absolutely absolutely\nBecause you know I've got friends who are ... progress of this ... this guy's texted me talking about you know as we had rented struck on people talking about oh this guy's the walk away and his friends as liberal friends won't talk to any more 'cause he walked away from the Democratic party and stuff I have plenty of friends who were progressive and you know they're saying they they love other cultures but they don't want to open borders\nBut they love other cultures but at some point in time we've got to start dealing with this in a real way and we're not and both sides have failed I continue to say both sides have failed but\nIs this the perfect storm that will keep the enthusiasm 'cause like everything else people get excited member have big Kavanaugh was two three weeks ago none narrow word any more narrow work\nIt's kind of slowly but surely dissipated and now people are talking about the fact that there may be a lot of voters would stay home on both sides of the aisle on their terms and it's not going to be the excitement that people think there's going to be out there and and all of a sudden you've got this happening and it could be potentially be a huge\nPerfect storm to energize potentially both parties if Trump handles it wrong but really I think the opportunity here for Trump and the Republicans to handle this is right in front of them\nCombination of anger over how the left smeared engaged in character assassination line used bull interacted with judge Kavanaugh is really one part of this and the degree to wash the left his finger\nTo have three thousand people have caravans across the American border break American law recognizing that if that happens next caravan will even bigger than the current event after that will be even bigger\nYeah and where does it end and what do we do at this point in time\nBoth sides need to start figuring something out sooner rather than later and uh I don't think any side really wants to take it on or Mitch McConnell they said you know I think we're going to take on Obamacare I think we're going to really he he's\nHe's trying to stoke some enthusiasm people that that ship sailed as far as a lot of people are concerned and you've lost that opportunity and you've failed when you had the chance to do something and and he came out and even went as far as saying there's no way we're going to get rid of some of the aspects of people like an Obamacare like\nPreexisting conditions there looking for something to keep the enthusiasm going and this may be that storm that lands\nAre opportunistic Lee in the lap of the Republicans it's a possibility\nIt is but it's a frustrating thing because these are human beings whose lives are being you know a centrally\nUsed their pawns in this game of politics\nThey it sucks it absolutely one hundred and ten percent sucks it sucks for us as Americans as residents of taxpayers of people have done it the right way and it's all for them that both sides are using them in a

it's cheaper to get into right that's\nThe big money getting more expensive to borrow but it's cheaper to get into a lot of people don't have thirty forty fifty a hundred two hundred thousand dollars laying around to put down on a house\nTo get into all the mortgage would be less they don't have that up front so that's why people are doing it plus a younger generation we've talked about this I

years ago you sometimes you come out of college you wouldn't have that much that you put yourself through maybe get a little a little money here or there but it wasn't as expensive it is now you come out\nBut you came straight out of high school and he went to work and you're able to do to to get all you know a little bit of money put together and you bought a home and it was fine because you didn't have that giant dead over you it's not that way now and what that means going forward is when you look at what drives an economy one of the biggest drivers is people are buying homes what do they do when they buy homes\nThey buy stuff for their own and that is something that I think you're going to see slowed down\nA lot in the coming years and it and you're not going to\nBe able to blame
