the Senate gallery protests continued outside the Supreme Court as capital all took the two required oath of office\nIt's possible anything's possible I think that probably putting somebody like by noon a might be more preferable to Hillary for the Democrats I'm not sure he could win but I think he'd given more of a run in probably be a less controversial\nAlso well All right Carl take a stab at this one\nOr two in ... would be Donald\nTrump's ... almost ... dream appears\nTo have that happen are ... just write themselves you don't have to be put into\nIt or not only that the the worst thing in the world\nIn politics is to lose and lose poorly there's nothing wrong with losing and there's always a winner and always will be a political contest but when you lose poorly\nYou were sure about it after the fact\nOf that just does not play well with the American public especially among the uncommitted you know you're always going to be able to be for the bar one started yoga ... for whatever candidate gets ... it's the people in the middle of it makes a difference in the elections and I just don't see her being viable I\nFrankly I don't know the Democrats could run that actually is really caught short abroad appeal of\nAnd you know Donald Trump role will be just as happy with Elizabeth Warren running on the pictures you would be ... that would be almost as much fun Korea might say\nSo you know if you're going to if the Democrats are going to run somebody that has a credible shot at a big it's got to be somebody like Cuomo\nA probably a call now I don't see Cory Booker I think he shoots himself in the foot a lot Kamala Harris as being a little overly anxious about all of these women\nIssues and I don't see the depth and breadth and the other issues she's she's a I Am people tell her as being so brilliant and so insightful I don't really see it I just see partisanship but back to the Hillary idea especially these articles that are kind of being floated out there could she possibly do it um\nI tend to think she could and she might\nAnd the reason is is that she would say see I told you so see I told you so and there can be a new group see I told you so I'm with her see I told you so ... this is we're invention and we are in this it looked at what's happened the cabinet\nThis is ... against the right this is hatred against her and they're gaining momentum and and in\nIt for health holds up and I have no real reason 'cause I don't know we don't get to know much about her el she couldn't take another craft and that crap crack at it and it could very well be crafting\nHer political aspirations once again I mean stranger things have happened and it would be on the sea I told you so however on the other side coming out of the other side of my mouth would be this trunk and say yeah look what I did\nDuring this time um and then the town of course North Korea and bringing 'em or North Korean dad home and the ... the stock market and I mean he would you would start his laundry list on what he's done including the beginnings of build the wall night but I it it ... the question is\nWhat I put it past the Democrats and I would not put it past the Democrats to put a Hillary and possibly Elizabeth Warren's it get out there\nAre I think our health so big issue a bigger than anybody thinks and today you really need to be very healthy to be able to go through what you have to go through you saw her tail off at the end of that election and that very well could have\nBeen different or have a different okay I'm up she was directly involved\nAnd I don't think she can do it and it's a possibility anything's possibility but I think our health is going to be limited\nI make no mistake I don't think she should do it I think she might because she's got bad vendetta she's\nAnger anger is a bad\nKind of a little late she still is mad about it and it's the era of the woman I'm a Hillary Elizabeth Warren chicken wow Carl\nDon't win with anger though anger is a very destructive emotion in politics you know I agree with Mike I think to\nBe the angry woman angle is the absolute worst political angle to trade goes with war and I'm a as a VP choice on a ticket is less toxic than her on the head of the ticket\nBut ... you know just I mean even though you know we always one heartbeat away right from ending up in the love seat\nBut nonetheless it's a less toxic alternative but for Hillary to run again I I think there is a serious health problem I don't think she could manage the champion and go through it uh well\nWhat is her health problem Karl on that note I what do you think is wrong with her health wise\nWell not entirely sure but she's obviously fragile for mental perspective we saw that during the campaign in the last time around there were multiple times that she needed physical systems to do simple\nThings like walk up a flight of stairs and you just you know it's whether it should be a debilitating factor and part of the choice and part of the selection process or the presidency is is a different question what do you use one of the optics of it are important\nAnd I just don't see how you get there from here until we have a full body prosthetics where you know so I mean just look at the reality of it you you want to get up on the stage to give a speech you got to climb up here for quite a steps to do it and she was incapable of doing that without assistance on several occasions\nIn the press has been complicit with her and they haven't pushed at them and asked her they they haven't dug into it and they won't ah they won't do that so the information that comes out is very limited\nThat is true and that's why I asked the question because I don't know I don't know if she's better\n'cause she has met now I agree Carl she could hardly get up the stairs\nAnd so it's it's hard to know is this a heart problem is this a joins problem does she have spinal issues that she has some brain problem is she on hormone replacement therapy or not um she has no stamina it seems but\nThen you see her post election and she comes out on the stage and waves and she goes to universities and she gives talks and and she started this new apparently this new group\nDemand justice and the last\nFive months approximately she has been sending emails touting this new superPAC or to combat that President Trump the point is she's getting these hints so much so that major publications or picking up on it and trying to be first with\nAnalyzing whether or not she actually is going to do this again and with the whole\nThe era of a woman whether you like it or not and I the last thing I Would want to see in personally as hell around the camp dripping am Pedro but whether you like it or not the wind is at her back as a woman\nA so it is it certainly is food for thought and fodder for this radio station Mike\nShe's trying to remain relevant and uh she's not doing a very good job of it and uh\nShe's lucky that the press doesn't get on her case because things would come out and and also the department of justice hasn't come out with what they're gonna do relative to all the stuff that she was ... so she stays relevant it it ... lessons that\nShe's got Obama behind her too because he wants to be out in front of as well final thought on this one Carl [noise]\nWell you know there's the there's also the money thing I mean that's the reality of it when it comes to politics and politicians and especially the Clintons somehow it's all about the cash\nMhm and none of their uh improprieties and there are\nThe things that are alleged against them ever seem to surface it's very epsilon with this and it's amazing it's amazing we've got two years now into Trump and we still still don't know very little about the Clinton Foundation and the hanky panky going on there which we were told there was plenty a\nAs well quite amazing alright and quick break and we'll be back and talk about plans engenders wanting

[noise]\nWe're back on think America was in Washington recently and caught up with Steven ... who is the executive director of the English language unit at\nHigh speed tell us about the English\nLanguage humid and what you're trying to accomplish in Washington with English as the king language\nWe are the nation's leading advocates for official English is what we want to do what we advocate\nFor English to become the official language of the United states of America\nNow right away you're probably going to have listeners saying wait a minute it's the what do you mean English is not the official language of the usa that is correct most people assumed that it is but English has never been the official language in the United states in America never you know two hundred and forty\nPlus years of independence and so we advocate for passage in Congress or the English language unity our English language unity act in the U.S house of representatives that's a real number eight or nine nine and seven\nAnd in the U.S Senate Israel number as six seven eight\nRight now in the United States House we have Seventy one supporters and in the U.S Senate we have seven supporters as well and so every day we're on Capitol Hill lobbying and educating members of Congress about why we need to pass the English English language unity I\nKnow Terry you'll be amazed because I can tell you that we have spoken with US Senators conservative\nUS Senators who said to me Steve wait a minute what do you mean wishes and the official language I never knew that these US Senators that don't even know it sometimes we do a lot of education on Capitol Hill\nTo get it done to hopefully pass this right now with a Republican controlled Congress and the Republican in the White House we see a window of opportunity that we haven't had a long long time to try to do this we're also working on the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue at the White House we've had five different meetings with different aides to President Trump and vice president Pence\nTo try to get President Trump to sign an executive order which would repeal former President Clinton's old executive order number one three one six six\nWhich mandated government translations are communicated translations or interpretations for anyone any organization receiving federal funds and so if Trump can do that that would be very helpful as well\nTell me Stephen about the cost to the United states government or even local municipalities state and government to have for example ballot translated into say Spanish or any other language to speak to the cost\nThat during the Bush forty three administration there was a government study estimated than interpretation of translation costs at that time\nWere price week two billion dollars a year that's billion with a B that's extraordinary it's amazing it's going to remember that was during which forty three no government study has been done since that time so the number has to be something north of two billion dollars but even if you use that as a basis stronger\nSigns or a new executive order and repeals the old executive order if Trump does away with government mandated interpretations\nAnd translations would save Americans at least two million dollars a year if not much more than that we are talking about a lot of money that could be saved if Trump science who knew exactly where it's going to say we've met five times with different age to President Trump will join aids to vice president Pence\nWhen vice president parents who was a member of Congress really into you know he was a co sponsor of the English language five times five different Congress as President Trump is well when he was campaigning and twenty Fifteen twenty sixteen\nHe would say all the time in this country in order to assimilate you need to speak English so we know that we have allies in the White House\nBut now we need to get through all across the goal line we need to have the president signed a new executive order repealing President Clinton's executive order doing away with government mandated translations interpretations and we need Congress to balance the English language unity I as well\nTell me Stephen where your pushback is coming from which groups or is it just the general left on how is that going where is the pushback that\nThere's different types of push back I think it's similar to the pushback that you see in the entire immigration issue as a whole where you have all you know a lot of people on the left who don't like it but not everyone we do have Democrats and liberals who do support\nWhat we're doing is we have a lot of support in California for instance California's a bouncy taste right now\nWe are people who are conservatives and liberals who support what we're doing also do see some establishment types on the right as well establishment Republicans who don't like it has well I Do a lot of media interviews on the radio and TV and we'll get pushback against similar to what you hear\nOr other immigration issues where people will call up and saying oh you're a bunch of haters you have immigrant or not compassionate whatsoever how can you foresee English on these people that's no that's not compassionate all and I say to them we are actually more compassion because of an immigrant comes to this nation and we love immigrants we love legal immigrants\nIf an immigrant comes to this nation is emerging themselves in English right away and if they become proficient in English right away\nThat's going to lead to a better job opportunities for them they're going to be able to make more money they're going to be able to support their family they're going to be able to live the American dream in a way that they could not do if they did not learn English so we're more compassionate by advocating for official in English in this nation not less compassionate\nIf you don't have this how do you foresee more as the tournaments holes in America with various different ethnic groups speaking their own languages and what does that do should that me to the fabric of the United states of America\nWe don't want America to become a tower of about when we will do one have balkanization of the United states look at a place like Canada which has English and French incredible governmental costs for translation interpretation in Canada other nations across the world as well where you have multiple official\nLanguage news all it does is make it more costly or to do things from a governmental standpoint\nAnd who bears that cost the taxpayers doing all of a sudden dark\nSo from a simulation standpoint it's better for him has to come and learn English\nThis does not mean that they cannot speak their own language at home or in a cultural center in their place of fame or any of the private place\nWe're only time you're on for governmental operations and nothing else but we don't want to\nHave in this nation linguistic ghetto where people are speaking different languages in their own community\nAnd or you know the government has near things translate into so many different languages that you lose sight you know the fact that he wishes and calm and unifying language in this nation we want to avoid that because again we see around the world how it has not worked out well\nIn any other place we have a multiplicity of different languages competing with each other and\nDo you see this an issue in any way for them in terms or for that twenty twenty presidential election\nAbsolutely I think it was even an issue and twenty sixteen and again we know where President Trump stood on immigration\nAs opposed to where Hillary Clinton should we know that President Trump when he was a kid it was frequently saying that in order to assimilate in the usa you need to speak English right now what we're doing is that we're holding candidate speak to the fire all across the nation whether it's federal racist congressional races or even state municipal raises asking them how do they feel about official\nEnglish legislation we're willing to work at the state level as well right now thirty two states across the usa have English as the official language or their state Michigan hopefully will become the thirties or this year\nSo we do a lot of work in states as well and we never told all of our supporters to talk to every candidate whether someone's running for Congress for Senate and for local races around the state Senate or governor would ever", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Johnson City",
