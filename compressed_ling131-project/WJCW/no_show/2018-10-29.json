and families\nNational League of cities is here to join me and the reason why I Want us to talk about this today is because we had something that happened on Thursday October twenty said more than a million people across the nation and the U.S military bases worldwide turn the lights on for after school\nLike opening their doors to showcase the skill you didn't gain and that's how they develop an after school program and I personally think these after school programs are so important and I'm so happy Jodie and odd you you're here with me today to just talk a little bit more about them\nAnd we're thrilled to be here and I'm highlight this big celebration\nYou are so tell me a little bit for everybody who is not familiar with keeping the lights on afterschool tell me about it\nAnd so we have created this national celebration at the local of levels to really showcase what's going on in today's after school programs because after school Perkins keep kids safe they inspire them to learn and they give working parents peace of mind but something so many people think\nAbout the safety they don't realize that all the opportunities and we want to shine a light and all of the extraordinary activities that are going on and after school programs whether it's\nRobotics our coating or dance or music and mentoring a you know debate clubs to highlight that the kids in these programs are having access to a host of learning opportunities that are going to make them stronger adults\nAbsolutely I remember when I was younger I did the debate team and I was so shy when I was younger and that really helps\nThe a lot and I credit that for maybe leading me on my path to what I did later in life so I Do think that these activities are so important and it's a what happened students who have no after school programs available to them\nAnd so on so right now today ten million kids will be going after school programs there's a ... another twenty million whose parents want these programs for them but they don't have access\nAnd on of those kids at eleven million are unsupervised staggering eleven million kids unsupervised after school\nAnd they are three times more likely to use drugs or alcohol it three times more likely to joining gangs they're thirty seven percent more likely to become a teen parent\nUm where more and more worried about just screen time antisocial behavior and and and just not learning so even if you know a kid just going home they could have all these opportunities to be social and interactive and engaged and expanding their horizons or they could be you know sitting alone\nRight and ... that are all funding for after school program secure for the future\n[noise] absolutely not so for the past on two years there's been a proposal from the White House to eliminate all funding for after school which would be\nDevastating for communities around the country and the good news is that there's been a bipartisan effort and strong bipartisan support for after school and we've been able to fight back\nAnd wait that bipartisan support we've gotten actually some modest increases and funding but it's not enough and the fact is going to happen again so I'm till we need to\nBroadcast and showcase why these communities are so important and I hit that we had bipartisan support because members of Congress go home and they see the difference these programs making their communities and that's all right for them\nThat way I mean I think anybody who has children are like you said even if you don't have children and you just see in your community and absolutely makes a difference and I just I don't understand why these programs would be on the chopping block though how can people participate in like an after school and support after school programs if they'd like to go to Bob\nCoated WWW dot after school alliance dot org and you can see up activities and programs that are going on in your community and all sorts of ways to truly support after school both locally state light and nationally\nYeah I just want to plug for a municipal leaders mayors and council members have become major champions across the United states to support after school because it's so important in terms of keeping kids safe getting them off the street I'm after three PM\nAnd also keeping them out of trouble so it becomes quality of life issue it also becomes an economic issue because parents can stay at work without the headache knowing that their kids aren't safe so we want to applaud their effort and continue to get more and more mayors in council members engage at the local level\nYeah absolutely and that's a good point because parents do have to work until five six o'clock maybe sometimes even leader that did not know what their child is up to versus knowing that they're in it or practice or like you said coding in robotics that to me I I Can't\nEven believe that the thing because it was it when I was younger but I just think it's amazing just\nHow many programs are available for after school activities if only we had the funding well thank you so much again\nJodie in IT I really appreciate you joining me today on the program

you said in your intro so this is a very forceful at affirmative step in the right direction for animal rights\nAre you surprised that there was such overwhelming support of the spill in the California legislature\nNo not really because California has always been in the vanguard when it comes to animal law animal animal protection on in the California domestic violence protective act there is a provision\nThat offers protection to animals who are involved in um you know domestic violence situation so California has been in the vanguard there and like I said I think I've said this

be issues and challenges in California like there are in other states\nCalifornia is very progressive and certainly a leader in the country when it comes to the evolution of these rights\nAnd the new law refers to household pets how does this law define household pets in the rent is a paid any problems with that definition\nYeah the law doesn't define household pets and this was I think a problem with the Illinois statute that was passed earlier a in a year or where they didn't define the word companion animal [noise] probably a household pat\nDeals with uh the things that we think of dogs and cats but\nProbably it doesn't apply to service animals it doesn't apply to livestock that doesn't apply to race horses and I think understandably it's the type of animal that is um enjoyed a love in a

that the statute just passed by the California legislature and signed into law by the governor gives court the discretion\nTo deal with a joint custody or sole ownership\nSo that if a judge thought that something really did not require court intervention\nThe judge could declined to intervene in California but we are talking about a typical case where a estranged husband and wife or to spouses are fighting over ownership or custody in control of an animal as part of an overall divorce proceeding\nKeep in mind that this happens in very small percentage of cases\nEven though those cases are on the rise let's say in the last five to ten years\nMark in your experience for what you remember your father's experience wise in working with divorcing separating couples for most frequent problem areas in determining who gets to keep the pets\nFor the most part when people have a dispute it involves um how the a pet is going to be transported back and forth\nUm some um litigants and a divorce case might say I want the dog to stay primarily at my home and you know if I go on vacation you can take care of it or you know that sort of thing but when another party to divorce litigation says look I Want\nThe dog to be with me when I have the kids so that you know they all come together in a group [noise]\nThose are the types of disputes that arise in the context of separation and divorced they're not the only ones but you know in terms of the\nThe litigation that kind of thing that ah you know you see on the news every once in a while where people go all out those are the types of

say um medical care or or shelter you know someone who left the dog untethered outside for long periods of time\nThat might be a case where somebody comes in and a divorce and says look I Want sole ownership of this um companion animal or household pets and I think you know the new California statute gives judges the right to hear that evidence\nMark do you have any further comments about how animals ... evolving\nI think this California law is a great a step in the right direction but I think that all over politicians are seeing how\nAnimal law legislation resonates with voters or we had I listen to a program that you did very recently Dr Lori on puppy mills and uh that really moved me because there are thousands of puppy mills\nAnd millions of puppies are who are born in these really terrible conditions and I now that politicians are looking at these uh areas as long as that really affect voters because they know that\nDogs and cats and other companion animals are parts of

of an interesting perspective about them\nWell hi Matt Hi how are you today\nJust fine okay I thought it would throw out these are two little tidbits here and maybe you can react recently we had Dr Robert Rita veterinarian who uh who is also a frequent guest and gives us all sorts of perspective on the health of our a companion animals and we were talking about\nSnake bites of dogs and prevention and treatment and vaccines and other related topics about snakes and uh and dogs and uh\nShe gracefully reminded us that these snakes that we're talking about usually rattlesnakes they are a part of the eco system they have an important role and we shouldn't be afraid of them we should just let them be which is nice to get that reminder and then just today\nI saw a news report coming from a small town in New Mexico and uh they're having\nProblems with skunks and snakes\nAnd or the skunks the police are responsible for relocating them and they trap them and they just move them\nAnd the next day of no mechanism to deal with the snakes usually rattlesnakes also except for just shooting them and it's really sad that they don't have the resources and during the training or whatever that that is the state of these snakes who uh who hadn't done anything wrong so uh\nUh what do you think about it any any of those things\nThe first thing is I think what the veterinarian touched on is really important to remind people that you know they are absolutely vital to the health of the ecosystem so if you care about animals and nature and wildlife\nAnd the environment as a whole you have to accept things you can't have a healthy environment without Mac so if you want to be you know wildlife lover or nature lover or you'd like birding or you like aspects of nature you have to remember that to have all those things\nWe absolutely have to have snakes\nAnd then the second thing is um what you mentioned was said was you know just leaving them alone that is the absolute best advice\nThat you can get someone about snakes and it's unfortunate that so many people are afraid of them and most of the things you hear about them in the media or movies you sort of just really portrays him in such a negative light at all snakes\nMurderous monsters that are trying to attack and kill people and that if you step out into an area where there's rattlesnakes they will chase you down and kill you but really that is the furthest thing from the truth snakes are very shy animals for the most part that would like to avoid people whenever they can\nTime was up in the Georgian Bay surrounded by rattlesnakes a couple of summers ago there I was in between where there was two of them and the snakes were just kinda sitting under these rocks coiled up\nThey weren't trying to attack me or chase me or hurt me or anything like that they were just kind of sitting there quietly\nAnd when I approached a little closer to get a photograph the one rattled very slightly and that was its way of saying you know just leave me alone in because I didn't pursue any closer I didn't try to capture the animal or anything like that it didn't strike\nAt me it didn't bite it didn't even Randall anymore I just gave that initial rattle an outlet is that animals way of saying just leave me alone so it's funny that people have these horrible misconceptions about snakes when really\nYou know they want nothing to do with ... has sent over the course of the last Thirteen Years\nI have literally thousands of snakes and the wild um and I was in a I don't think done a last fall or no sort of water snake than last fall\nAnd I was surrounded by you know dozens and dozens of these large heavy bodied snakes and none of them tried to attack me or fight me or wrap around me or anything like that so again it's just\nGoing to use my own experiences to reiterate the fact that things are not trying to hurt us and in fact NC State university did a study a few years ago where they found that almost all think by some people that happened in the United states are because someone is trying to capture or kill the snake\nSo if you are out hiking or camping or cottage in and you ... snake\nAnd you're afraid of them or you're a little wary about them you don't have to have someone come out\nAnd shoot it or kill it or get rid of it all you have to do is walk away and leave the animal alone and I promise it's not going to hurt you and again having them they're ... it's incredibly vital to the ecosystem so that's my main message is just to kind of\nPromote coexistence and let people know that we can coexist with these animals are not out to get us\nThat when you talk to children I Know you like to do a lot of educating about snakes um do they come in with a\nPre conception about them or are those fears presence or when you talk to them or are they are just open ready to learn about snakes\nMost children are completely open to snakes in fact I was I'm Out yesterday and I had I was I have a little ball python with me and\nThere was a little girl that immediately I said did you want to pet the snake and she said Oh yes it and you could see her mother like kind of standing in the background all horrified so you know kids are so open minded but unfortunately the those", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Johnson City", "day": "29"}
