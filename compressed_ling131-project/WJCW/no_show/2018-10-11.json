a default liberal it was his factory setting because he grew up in West Los Angeles and he heard about this Clarence Thomas do and how he was a sexual predator or something so we watch the hearings and he sat there and he was like what\nAre you kidding me how dare you Ted Kennedy how dare you Joe Biden how dare you Democrats this march this man this man has done everything right he's done everything you're supposed to do\nTo get ahead in America and and it's not like I mean since he was the\nThe grandson of sharecroppers and he pulled himself up for nothing went to Yale Law and now you're going to stop him because of this and not only did he become a Republican or a conservative at that point he was radicalized he became an activist and he made a point at that that day\nTo push back against the Democrats to push back against the media even called it the Democrat media complex\nAnd he hooked up with Matt Drudge and worked with Matt Drudge on the Drudge Report until he started

Georgia as hurricane Michael pushes through the state and local media say some of those twisters may catch down\nBecause we still have the core even though we've lost the high the quarter wins around us are still sustain Ninety miles per hour so is that most of the north we can expect when God maybe to a hundred and ten\nFlorida governor Rick Scott says they only started to assess the damage done there\nOkay Michael is the worst storm that the Florida Panhandle has ever seen one of the worst power storms ever make landfall in the United states we heard of significant impacts that tend to air force base and many communities along the coast\nYeah and and one of the other things though is much like in places like California where they've had to retrofit stuff for earthquake after Andrew rolled through there many of the the cities\nOr you know in Florida itself and many of the cities and the surrounding areas the panhandle of would not have\nHave bumped themselves up to new standards so you're not going to see the potential damage you could've potentially before but the thing that's interesting is this I've talked to a lot of people\n... is is it\nHow much do people care about that anybody wants to see anything happen to anybody but the realities of this is\nWe had one last year and it was big and then all of a sudden you know after Houston and the flooding and then everybody poured out it was used in strong and all these kinds of things and in Florida had theirs and it was oh yeah we're here again into that and the by the time it gets the Murray or you know maybe Puerto Rico where like in\n... and what kind of numb to the whole thing was just like a well desensitized to say I I don't have that much sympathy to give there's only so much we can do it it's not like you wait till the end of the year and go okay the storm season's over let's figure out who deserves what and that includes our sympathy\nAnd we're watching this and this is snuck up but as I've talked to people across the country they're watching it on TV catch\nMaybe read the headline but they're doing it the you know they don't want anything to happen to people and what would get people's attention is massive tragedy thousands of people lose their lives that's going to get people to really pay attention\nOutside of that it for a lot of other people it's just about another day and it is crazy what's going on there and the the the massive size and what it's doing to to do some of these areas listen to this this is the wind and the sheer power of this\nThing in the\nThey want to thank Frank woman\nYeah they are there's a lot of damage and that's where the damage to become the houses are going to say fine it's the debris that's going to smash into them\nThat is going to be ... it just just watching\nThis and how this goes about is going to be a crazy it really really is and those palm trees that that that's very interesting to palm trees\nThe strength of them they're they're meant they go all the way down and touch the ground are going to come right back up that's the the the strength of the palm trees that's the reason why in places like California on the coast in in in Florida and elsewhere yeah palm trees but it is massive it is ferocious and rarely is it the wind\nThat is the flooding that people need to worry about and as I've talked to people today in Florida ah many listeners out there you know what I was talking to him and said you know what do you want to tell the rest of the country like something you know will be fine this is this is\nThis is part of being here\nAnd I think that's I think at this point in time for a lot of people that have kind of acceptable that this is what you do you live in California you may have an earthquake or two or three you live in the northeast you live in in in you know the northwest you're going to get cold front and cold snaps a potential blizzards and you live through the center of the country you're going to get\nYeah tornadoes things of that nature this is just one of those things and I think the thing about America is is how strong are infrastructure is how good it is and how fast that it goes uh uh you know depends on a lot of things I think what we're going to\nFirst and foremost I think will people will rebound very fast here but as I talked about through this I one of the things that I think it's going to happen is because\nI think that even though it's going to be nasty and it's horrible for a lot of people and they're losing a lot of there are things that rebound fast and the way that things will get up\nElectricity things of that nature I just said Trump's going to be called a racist over and over again not because of this they're just going to go back and go you didn't take care of of Puerto Rico and that's that that's what's going to come out of this global warming and you didn't take care of Puerto Rico\nBut it is a it is ugly and asked me if you're out there and get tax the program three two three five three twenty four twenty three let us know what's going on with you\nUh get is not that people I think don't care I just think at this point in time we're so desensitized where some numb and there was a first mover advantage in last year after not having a almost a decade of no storms\nHouston got the first mover advantage second in was uh was Florida and by the time I got to Puerto Rico ... be more like that and this year\nIt's the same thing Caroline and got a lot of that love and and I look at what's going on in the panhandle I wondered to myself or
