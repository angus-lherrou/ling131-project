I feel like Donald Trump last night in his rally did what he did but the mainstream media would actually pick up the story because\nNobody was talking about the inconsistencies of ... a doctor for a test of money and I think that he did that because he knew they would all talk about how Rudy was or how inappropriate wise but in order to do that they would actually have to show what he actually said\nAnd so I feel like he did that any like that I you know what I'm taking a bullet for for Kavanaugh why I've been on hold for the last two hours and get ten minutes\nOr I Will tell you been on the phone to ours and Fifteen minutes I'm Sorry I don't even have that are my clock here\nThat's fine my my I I I've had the opportunity to educate my daughter on why this is so important on there they have with Emmett Till in Nineteen fifty five\nA young black man who once again Caroline Brian at the time Caroline\nNow more than that he was tortured he was beaten more to a pulp he was hanged was then burned go ahead\nYes and in two thousand a Caroline Bryant at the time of the initial allegations Caroline found them at the time\nAnd she ... her story and said that she lied about his story um of course and brother in law and here we're nationally um put on trial for the lion king of the show man\nYou don't believe me when I say we're about to run out of time to you know please get to the point sleaze okay oh you're going to miss it\nAll right it's the one you asked the department of justice to reopen a case on July ... while she can't because a woman lie about sexual assault\nAll right I understand your point thank you we can find many many examples of people lying about crimes that they accused others of being committed we can't the history books are filled with them and not just our history books the world's history books are\nTwice when we created this country and when it was a stylish we decided to do something else\nNot only does the accuser have to prove their case against the accused the bar is even higher it's not a fifty fifty proposition\nIf you choose somebody of criminal activity depending on the crime the worst of the crime the higher the stay in the worst the allegation the higher the standard\nBeyond a reasonable doubt you're accusing somebody of raping you or sexually molesting you know beyond a reasonable doubt\nIs a standard in most places\nLadies and gentlemen there's doubt all over the place here this has been politicized horribly\nThe Democrats don't care about the truth they wouldn't know the truth a punch them in the nose it's not about the truth same with most of the media in this country\nAnd they're having a grand old time if you're watching TV endlessly pumping the same stories looping the same video using that\nBreaking news breaking news breaking news when there's no breaking news\nThey're playing us and I for one am sick and tired of it\nI Want to thank you for Georgia for holding so long I didn't realize it but I Will say I've been handling this point about are inconsistencies now\nSince last week we salute or armed forces police officers firefighters emergency personnel all law enforcement out there [noise] check out a loving TV Tonight and I'll see you tomorrow me well [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrying to ... talk radio station Eugene Johnson City [noise]\nShootout attorneys\nGambling suspicious letter or a coup officers and sheriff's deputies came under fire in Florence County South Carolina ended OK Charles Kenny boon says one officer has died six other members of law enforcement injured\n\nAnd partly in that have nothing to do with you know you come out and say look I think she's a lawyer and she just nothing but a fat liar and I say you come out and say that and you could get destroyed for it\nRight\nIf if if your company will stand behind you saying look these are my views\nAnd this is what my views are where you can't do that nowadays because you're playing with people's lives and you're playing with a livelihood so sometimes people will be like a I don't want to I I I don't feel this way but I got to say something and when you don't control your own destiny it's tough to go out and say something like that\nAnd we found her to be very persuasive but\nThe media coverage of this has been so one sided it has been so biased there has been the presumption from the very beginning that every single allegation made against ah against the judge was through and I say this again is somebody who said before the allegations he should be on the Supreme Court\nYeah look I think you could do and if\nThe drinking is the issue that are the teenagers and we're all going to be in trouble ah except for me 'cause I don't drink but and I never even had to drink but outside of that a lot of people are going to have to quit their jobs in politics in life and that that's that's the insanity of what he will he lied 'cause he drank a little bit more come on\nOff your moral high horse but the media is painted a picture we've got to believe everybody we've got to believe everybody get no we and then I said it from jump you got to believe\nThe truth believe\nThe truth not everybody because not everybody's telling the truth not everybody is telling the truth\nIt's an issue it is a huge huge huge issue here one hundred percent\nHe took advantage of it last night he knows what to do with this crowd he jumped in there and he he knew exactly what to do and when did do it he took advantage of it because I think he knows nothing's coming out\nThis guy's life been put through how her life is being put through hell and I blame that on the Democrats because they needed\nSome way to try to slow this down they needed some way to stop this they needed some way for this thing to slow down to the point where they think they could get one or two to jump over just put enough doubt in somebody's mind and enough fear in somebody's mind that they'll say no I Can't vote for this guy because even though I don't believe him\nPublicly I've got to look like I Believe her even though I don't believe he did anything even though I don't think he did anything publicly I got to do it because we live in two worlds now we have an\nOnline world and a world of social media warriors that are out there being hey I justified in doing the things that I Do and if I deem that you've done something wrong I have every right to destroy you and I'll get the media and everybody else to bend in my ways because we don't want them to look insensitive and we don't want them to ask\nHard questions because we feel and that's a big word right there\nFeel feelings don't care about the truth don't care about that in fact feelings will override everybody and everything it's not the way we live our lives it should be about the truth\nIn the end it should be only about the truth nothing else should matter we can take into account your feelings we could talk about that but it should change the outcome of something\nThis has been a political hit job from jump street I'm not saying that that he's a wonderful infallible human being I don't know the guy neither do you but what they portrayed him as is that trailer we put out yesterday is the Boogie Man\nHe's going to destroy everything that is holy to the left he is going to destroy everything in the world that matters to the left he is here because he is the fourth writer in the apocalypse of the horsemen that's what he is and that's how he's being painted\n\nAnd more and more people are kind of realizing that I've talked to a couple of friends of mine who are very progressive they said I don't believe any up\nAnd they were laughing like somebody looked in my yearbook jeeze what am I right back then I wasn't politically correct or woke as I Am now one of my friends that I'm not as well because I Am now if you look back in my yearbook we got all kinds of codes and things that we said\nAbsolutely one hundred percent\nHe took advantage of it last night he works in the audience because as much as he's a politician or trying to become one he's a he's a performer\nAnd so then Donald Trump goes and he says it and it is like lighting a tag on fire\nAnd I will say not just because Donald Trump divides every day in a way that is among becoming of a president but because the media has all these on Romney yeah the massive opening because they've been so one sided on this story it totally does it allows him tell a lie dynamite\nAnd blow the whole thing up yes\nAnd about the dividing let's remember there's two sides to the story half the nation can't stand them they're never going to like him doesn't matter what he does\nPeriod case closed doesn't matter what he does half the nation hate\nHe doesn't play to that half he knows where his bread and butter and that's where he goes that's it he knows that he absolutely knows that\nSo\nDivided that's you're throwing that out there he ran in last night he did the things that he does\nAnd he said what a lot of people are thinking but they're afraid it's the same thing we talk about when people go and they'll go somewhere and there'll be sitting in an audience and somebody will say something horrible about Trump and somebody doesn't believe it but the fear factor is oh through peer pressure I better clapping agree with what that person saying that is where we are\nThe two per cent honest somebody calls you today and you're a fan of Trump a lot of people who vote for Trump you know what they don't tell anybody those are the quiet droppers out there you know what if it's a robot there'll be like yeah like Trump if it's a human more often than not to say I'm undecided or no I'm not really a big\nFan because we have a fear of being judged absolutely for upset at last night\nI got one\nRight I Am wondering if you think it was I was wondering how did you get home I don't remember how did you get there I don't remember where is the time I don't remember how many years ago when I [noise]\nWhat\nWas it and I don't know I don't know\n[noise] and I'm at a map flies to shatter\nThat for now\nBecause I have a feeling this time next week he's going to be on the Supreme Court because I Do think that this is going to come back and I think we need to start being honest with one another that we we should care only about the truth\nFeelings we can talk about them we can empathize with people but at the truth is something we can't change that because of Felix that's not how we should live our lives three two three five three twenty four twenty three I tried Benson shows your Twitter ... and ...\nYou like saving money do you like knowing someone has your
