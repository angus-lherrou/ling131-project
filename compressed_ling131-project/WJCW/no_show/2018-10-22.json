awesome dad and we both have toddlers around the same age so we get to see each other a lot ... late ... and talk about all these issues that affect us as parents here in New York City and just in general have Marshall\nHey I don't see any other ... you because we're we're ... ...\nExactly it's a great excuse to socialize I Love seeing you I mean I Love seeing your daughter too but it's a great way to catch up and you know I like these ... and so many people\nChoose to go another route and maybe they enroll\nThey're less than two year old and all these different weather at a daycare program our separation program are to the program and I find myself feeling a lot of pressure asked you oh my gosh if I'm not I'm rolling my daughter and all these programs are you going to fall behind all these other kids and\nI don't know personally I just think I don't think I was in his youth program and I think I turned out OK I'm just wondering how you feel about\nAll that well it is a quick or you want to do is we are we have a little bit here for the interview or we will not\nI think there is you know a lot I wouldn't call pressure I Would call it you know I don't I Want to do the right thing\nAnd I'm not so sure what to do but I'm not buying into the pressure so it's about the right word for it yeah it is so because you want to have your kids also and locking disadvantage you return to our all of those programs\nBut at the same time like I really do believe it or you know that they're being bored and just observers or on their own because we were like we're over programming very early\nYes I agree with you and I think that even just this is lost\nThey are around the other kids and they're getting exposure or their babies and they're playing and they're learning how to share and just different dynamics about being around\nOther people I think that's really beneficial at the age and I do agree you want to make sure that they are in line and they are prepared for when they go to nursing school are in their guide and but I I'm with you I'm not feeling the pressure that I think a lot of other people feel it that's all it\nRight now you do your great yesterday because my little girl gets very shy of the play dates and it makes you wonder\nWhether I was wrong not to not to put her in more but she seems completely overwhelming and intimidated by all these other baby\nSweetheart you're scared of baby what good would scared of babies what's with that I don't understand or knew he was clean to me and you\nPicked her up and then my permission of course side and said come on we caught up with the other kids and that was great because she actually responded to you're better than me but\nAnyway the point was that these played it for the Hearst so shy we saw the first half hour them making that makes you shouldn't be any more maybe maybe maybe I didn't make the right decision maybe she should be more worse\nRight and you know and I had a similar situation not exactly that but I was dropping my daughter off\nAt the gym that I go to because they have a daycare Center for two hours you can drop the children off and you can go work out so for a while she was really enjoying it and then we just start crying hysterically and could not bear for me to leave\nAnd it broke my heart and I thought you know what I should have burn a separation program what am I doing I Can't just leave our he or she doesn't have the skills to know why I'm leaving and\nIt went on for a while and the people at this gym just kept taking her and said we're going to we're going to put her on a slide we're going to play with her don't worry just go and it was so hard for me\nBut now she's doing well and I think these are just stages that they go through and they learn and I I don't think that we should feel oh my gosh it's because they're not in roles in certain programs\nIt just happened yes or how to you I mean how do you why don't we don't necessarily have the stomach for that so you leave her in the program and she cries hysterically and you're just like\nThe later I'm Sorry you're crying hysterically and a half year old I'm not saying that's not the wrong thing to do that are like people are parents do realize like these are the kinds of challenges oh my God my heartbreaking and I'm going\nTo leave me the guilt of oh I'm just going to go work out well she's hysterically crying you know I Know horrible and I called down there several times to make sure he was okay and when I Would go to pick her up and I see her eyes are all bowling and she looked like she cried the entire time I felt terrible\nAnd then I didn't bring her back for a while and I said okay I'll Try again and I just they kept telling me look this is what they do they go through a separation anxiety\nDon't worry though it'll pass you just have to keep science I kept trying and now she's doing better so I think they're a time that we just have to\nThe blinders on a little bit and say okay this is best for them they are learning and and just just do it\nMuch harder just learn how to while your child is screaming bloody murder like\nThere are about to die hard or read a book

C. R. M. and who were partners and bringing this to the governor's desk\nWell that is it just committee co sponsored the bill with social compassion and legislation and social compassion is an excellent lobbying organization in California\nUh we work very closely with senator gala Gianni to she was the author of the bill to introduce it but we we had a lot of time with and both the state assembly and the Senate so we had\nAlso a principal coauthor\nAssembly member cholera we had co authors in the Senate Alan Chang and stern and other family member coauthors bloom Gabriel lean on and Costa so that's a that's a pretty impressive spread of assembly members and senators who are committed to moving this bill forward\nYou bet and I also read that many individuals called or legislators and many celebrities were also behind the bill\nAbsolutely we saw such great sick such great support on I Want to say less cosmetics that was just really amazing because last cosmetics has increased\nHe free since its inception and they're not only operating cruelty free but they are out there supporting these types of laws said they came and actually Hillary pickles worked for less cosmetic she came and she testified to show that business is really can thrive\nAh and remain committed to operating in a cruelty free manner or John Paul Mitchell says done has also cruelty for eight cents inception and they contacted senator and support\nAbout nine I Wonder if they maybe Ninety other cruelty free companies reached out as well\nWe had a lot of celebrities the court John Sally came at least the U.S silverstone hardly ... Smith Maggie Hugh ... and ... and others we had celebrities come together to create a video that can be shared on social media that included\n... Jane Bell is Mitchell was really great she came to all of the hearings and\nA really helped us with social media and on top of that thousands and thousands of letters were received by the state legislators in support of this\nElizabeth I read that previous versions of this legislation were somewhat broader what if any compromises were needed to achieve passage of the bill\nThat deal really we moved through the Senate we lived through a couple of committees and the assembly and things were looking really good we're really excited because this was\nA ... as the original bill was written it was the strongest legislation on that we're aware of in the world for cosmetics and not because it the original bill did address testing that was required for other countries\nBut as we move forward as we got closer to that finish line that provision was giving rise to so much opposition that it looked like we might not be successful and so since this provision which address for in\nA testing done for foreign requirements didn't go into effect really for five years anyway we decided to remove it\nSo that we could remove some of that opposition and even without that sunset\nThat they'll still sets a standard for cruelty free cosmetics and prevent new animal testing for final product and ingredients we had to move off of that but we've decided we're still going to pursue the intent of that provision just through another avenue\nA physician's committee has been around for a long time since Nineteen eighty five we have developed really good relationships with a regulatory agencies and so we have also become a position to in a really unique position where we work with regulators to train them on non animal methods\nThat we definitely will be increasing our efforts with foreign regulators to work on this issue directly\nWhat is the mechanism for enforcement and package labeling and and what potential penalties on shore for violators\nWell the district attorney or city attorney would be the ones to to bring a case here on an companies who violate the would be subject to an initial fine of five thousand dollars and then a thousand dollars every day after that that product remains on the shelf\nDo you think this new law will make cosmetics more expensive for consumers\nKnow I really don't think so and the reason it a lot of you know there might be some uh there might be a bit of expense for companies to transition into non animal testing right up front but in the long term these tests actually ah generally are are a lot cheaper and quicker\nSo it shouldn't affect the cost of the cosmetic in the end and and as you know as it stands now there are so many cruelty free cosmetic company that exist\nOn and that are are operating in this on I guess I Would say more affordable area so I I don't see that it would lead to any increase in cost\nElizabeth what are some of the alternatives for cosmetic testing\nWell there are actually over forty alternatives that are recognized by international bodies for ah for conducting cosmetic testing but some of them including lab grown three\nDimensional skin models that are based on human cells as well as sophisticated computer models\nOr other states follow California's lead\nYes absolutely and there are already some bills that have been on introduced in other states that would do a similar ah that would have a similar effect at it but the physician's committee is really looking forward to California yet again leading the country and this time\nWith replacing animals have\nGreat news and
