E. V. I. N. for Hillsdale dot com that's living for Hillsdale dot com\n[noise] alright Claudio Rockford, Illinois the great W are okay go\nOkay then national event how are you okay thank you\nA ... a lot of a lot of the topics and twice that\nYou make our our typical ingredients of what is taking place in the destruction of Europe and fortunately we in the U.S are just mere in that image and I I Believe that uh\nThat what we're seeing happen in this country is just a um\n[noise] it just what they're seeing taking place in Europe as far as the the uh what they call them you know there there might when they're um uh people coming from the Syria Sudan and all these regions that are going through wars\nAnd uh we have the need and that is destroying everything and has their opinion and agenda and they have in Europe that you which is people that are wearing suits but not appointed by anybody they're dictating what's going on mhm\nAnd I find very interesting I fight and I don't know if I can share on the air with you\nWhile let's not but uh you make you make some interesting points there and um and you're probably not aware of this but you're quite right in this to this extent the progressive movement or\nTo its philosopher kings in your roof so and ... and marks and ... among others\nAnd also you know in in certain respects the signing of this nation reaches back into your\nTo lock and monitor skew in Sydney and in others that also of course Harris style and ... but but the point is these are really two different ways of looking at humanity\nOne looks that humanity one individual at a time that's where we come from you and I one individual at a time individuals have merit individuals have value individuals have worth\nTheir God given God given God created and then there's another view which is to look at the whole the community\nAnd if people are stepping out and they're not doing what they are expected to do for the better good\nWell then those people need to be addressed and dealt with\nAnd of course what happens here is a relative handful of individuals when compared to the overall population determine what is good for the community whether it's good for the community or not and this is where you get in trouble you get into these various ideologies and theories and extraction\nIn which I'm a a relative handful of individuals seek to impose their will on all of society\nAnd to destroy manage nature\nAnd so the individual is only as good as the individual is willing to surrender his or her individuality to the greater good to the state because conformity and uniformity our priorities their primary\nNow are viewed doesn't view it that way conformity in uniform me there's not the priority as much liberty for an individual that is possible and in order to society and moral ordered society that's our model\nAnd so you want in in addition to that an economic system that is competitive that his market oriented that is relatively voluntary and so forth and so on\nAs opposed to this constant central location that government power uh but that is essentially sees by an elected individuals and a well that is imposed on you rather than exercising your own will you can see this now your point on the immigration from\nThe vast majority of Americans don't want what's taking place on the southern border the vast majority of Americans do want the southern border security even those who are fairly liberal on the issue of immigration\nBut you have a political party and leadership in a political party that believes it must change a population it must change the electorate it must change the citizenry in order to have as close as possible I permanent hold on power\nAnd that's exactly what's taking place here that's what Merkel data in Germany that's what's taking place and um people don't have a right to come to the United states of America they don't have a right to come here at all they're not even covered by our constitution\nIt's the people in this country who have rights and have the right to make these determinations\nAnd so uh I agree with you to that extent that\nWhat's happening here on the American left is they've taken the European left the progressive left both of which are progeny use of a of haggling marks and angles and er and er Russo and others are and that's the that's the road they've taken as opposed to the road we've taken which is the in the light meant\nThe price of western civilization and those sorts of things\nThat's my round about kind of process Oreo way of agreeing with you All right Claudio thank you for your call appreciate it\nI'm going to tell you this every night right up to election day first of all we're going to have an election day that is an election I program when this result start coming in moving from east to west I Will be here from six to nine pm all over the country so I think you want to stay with us secondly you're the precinct worker in your home\nYou need to make

examined and for it as well as the New York\nThat's a nice rally in Wisconsin President Trump blamed the media and opponents worthy turbulent national political environment\nTo historical felons\nAnd all the time that is\nThat much but because we're not Steptoe if you will in our believe we're gonna take it in a direction of just\nI hate you don't want to be your friend I Can't do it\nI refuse to believe that this is who we are I refuse to believe that this is what we've become I refuse to believe that this can't be turned back if you will to we can go back and this is why I talk about the middle here\nWho we are some Seventy plus percent of Americans\nDon't listen to the extreme but\nRemember you only need Seventeen percent to affect\nOf us\nThat say you know we want we want some we we don't want the lies anymore we don't want the BS anymore we don't want this this this this tribalism\nAnymore and were by nature we're tribal right by nature we are tribal\nBut it doesn't mean we have to hate\nAnd that's the issue I have that is in both sides play a game both sides stoke fears both sides\nGo out and played is because they know what's good for their business\nHow's business today squeaked businesses great\nGreatest guns salesmen of all time Morocco bomb great greatest numbers for news television cable news in particular\nDonald Trump it's great business is booming\nTribalism is everywhere and I'm frustrated but I think you're frustrated by it I don't think we need to just sit here and point fingers at either side and say it's only them and when you start to come at me with it only them or they started the conversation as far as this this this thing is is over\nThis the left do things that are ridiculous yes yesterday this whole talk of him being a white nationalist\nAnd all of this stuff is insane\nBut that's where they went with why 'cause business is booming\nAnd this is only going to continue to have business book frustrate\nThe other side Trump and the caravan and look at all the stuff and there's people inside of here that are from Middle Eastern countries don't want to do damage to us\nBusiness is booming\nAnd for the rest of us who just want to hear hey can you guys just can you cut the crap just give us a straightforward answers and I got other things to do\nRight I've got a new mc Donald's menu I gotta go through over here to see if there's some I Want to try on there I got a double check my lottery tickets in hopes that maybe I at least one a million bucks off of that I got a kids' soccer game I got all of this stuff going on I don't need your crap\nJust cut to the chase\nAnd stop lying to me and stopped telling me the other side's bad we can't we can't and we won't because that's all that we want to do all that we want to do anymore is tell everybody how horrible the other side you know when I when I started doing the show\nI said to self I don't want to be this site versus that side I don't want this to be black versus white I don't want this to be right versus left\nI Want this to be a conversation but we sit down and we have differing views and I wanted to be a conversation and we look at data and we look at facts and we have a good time and we go on and and and we talk about all kinds of stuff\nAnd it's tough\nIt's tough because I'll tell you right now I'm bored with it\nI'm sick and tired of ... this starts in so many places I was talking to a a huge programmer today It's MORNING called me and we we were chatting and\nWe were talking about how inundated people are and I said you know it's not even like you you sit down and we talk about this stuff right like the politics and this that and the other\nAnd then it goes to a commercial and what happens at the commercial you get five minutes of ads right now because of the midterms telling everybody how horrible the other side is\nAnd then it's back to the same thing people don't want to hear that\nI don't want to hear that\nI Want to talk about some you know solutions remember life it ... it's about what we can afford to do with each other right it's not going to be a hundred percent one way or another but we've gotten too big streams where it's only one way or another\nAnd everybody would rather have a hundred percent of their\nOwn belief in a hundred percent of nothing\nThan actual product it's sad it's sad\nAnd that's what tribalism is becoming this day and age do I think we're going to a civil war I Do not but do I think that this this discord an anger that is going on right now is going to get worse before it gets better yes

the distance from my early all the way up here to Washington DC\nFor more than a thousand have filed for asylum to stay in the states are you from Honduras ones were why did you leave\nNo good to know if if you were wearing a job they don't pay the we do the right [noise]\nYeah so that we you know because of what taking place today with the the the bomb scares a the reality is is a this caravan of still coming and it's not going to get here till\nEarly December late November at their lives would probably early December and and what it's going to look like I have no idea I couldn't tell you what is going to look like by the end of of this because it is slowly meandering here are and at some point in time what maybe seven to twelve thousand depending on who's counting\nAre and how it makes you aside look\n... that's going to eventually dissipate as well because they're going to start to split their often go certain directions and you know summer headstarts California Arizona and Texas and things like that it it's it's it's it's awful\nBut it needs to be discussing what I was talking about yesterday people say oh you know the left everyone was just a lap says open borders\nI might do love being that I said that the left wants all open borders there's two different here's the thing this is the problem with like ... immigration is a perfect example and I think it's it's it's a problem across the board in our political world\nAnd you don't get this and the price is right you don't get this at home with your spouse or your boyfriend or your girlfriend or your kids'\nHeads is\nThere's two ideas of how we should look at the store I think the left wants to completely open borders or there are a few people that are probably that way yeah\nYeah just like there's a few people on the right that would like to shut down never let anybody else in here ever again right but those people are nuts and we're going to take them out of the equation so the left and right fight over ... which side thinks they have the better idea when it comes to immigration\nAnd while they argue about it\nRight and they throw those balls in the air and then argue about these balls in the air and they're arguing at each other neither decided to catch anything and it just hits the ground\n\nAnd you're like oh that's that's that's crazy\nWhy is it because there's nothing in it for they don't want so instead of actually saying look we're going to a there's a there's a great story that Norman Schwarzkopf told one time about when he was first in the military and and general Schwarzkopf said\nThey were deciding what they were going to do that we're moving a base in to a certain area and they don't ... years and years of research and they sat down\nAnd the commanding officer at the time the commanding generals can make that decision and again this is one source got first got into it\nHe walks in and he hears a Fifteen minute pitch from both sides of what they were going to do where they were gonna move it and the whole nine yards or if they're going to keep in the same place and he he hears Fifteen minutes this has been like a year or two of them putting together all the data all these figures he hears like Fifteen minutes for both sides and it goes okay we're going to do that\nAnd he said later on that night\nHe ... he goes permission you know speak freely says yeah go ahead and he says can I ask you a question is is just shoot he says how did you come up with all of the years of data and all this stuff and all the information they have all these kinds of things all of this stuff that happened\nThat they put together for this and in Fifteen minutes you decided to do that and he said it's simply somebody's got to make a decision and we're either going to find out that the thing that I picked was right or going to find out that it wasn't wrong and then we can reverse course\nBut without make any decision nothing was going to happen and that's what we've got with ... with our ... our political world across the board without making decisions nothing gets done\nAnd that's the frustration I think a lot of you have out there and this is one of those things where this thing is coming here\n\nRight these people are coming here this wave is coming here and while it is it is a it's a micro when the overall scheme of things when you look at the the the visa program and the ports the reality is is they're arguing over this\nAnd while as a well they're arguing it's just going to show and they're just going to come here and then nothing will get done and all we'll figure it out is they like to argue even more than we thought that's it period case closed and it gives both sides the opportunity to come out and say things\nYou think there are wonderful people you got some bad people in those groups you got some people in those groups and I'll tell you what this country don't want them\nRight then come out and they can say that they can also say hey that this person over here is bad and this person's bad or it's it's frustrating\nBut it's not solving the problem the caravans on the way a lot of people I don't know and by the way this is the first caravan\nNow eight seconds smaller caravan that also formed in Honduras is already in Guatemala heading north to the Mexican border and there are also reports of other caravan harming in El Salvador\nMine\nYeah why not really I Do the same thing opportunity to come here\nWho's in these caravans I don't know\nI don't know who's in these caravans are but I Do know that there I see some kids I see a lot of women I see some working age or you know men as far as like you know from probably their mid genes through through the early twenties or thirties when people are gonna come construction and things of that nature and you see some older people as well", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "Johnson City", "day": "25"}
