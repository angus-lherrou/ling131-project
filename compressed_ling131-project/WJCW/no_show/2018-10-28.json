neighborhood correspondent Jessica dean is that the six Presbyterian Church\nComing out with when they're all coming out of shale that lives in cleaner than\nBut but it seems like maybe there's some a financial component to this and obviously to get some publicity\nThe second thing is um I think that there's a struggle among the very niche group of people to say hey we don't have any power anymore the the conservative they have the Congress and the presidency and now they have the court and the only thing that we can do right now is\nTo try to some in some kind of spirit to create some kind of harm and distress on on this to exercise some power for us and then third ah I I think it's a a a matter of searching for some religious um\nMeaning in life and and these folks who you would think would be so focused on science in the modern day technology and doing things through process than all of that have turned to not to God or to some benevolent but to turn to some kind of evil\nPortion of this to make things happen in their behalf and so it it just doesn't seem like a very\nA common thing or people\nWould really tended other than just hey let's get some publicity out of the it's\nInteresting how they view sexual assault and no justice on sexual assault in such a sanctimonious way such a high flu moral way because witchcraft is associated with evil yeah coal disassociated with evil for those who are\nReligious particularly Christians so I found that kind of interesting and so there's and and that kind of irony there are a little bit of the skin there do you believe in a cult powers shame\nWell I Am a person of faith and so I Do believe that there is an evil and I also believe there is a good and I tend to believe in a Judeo Christian beliefs so I Believe\nThat there is a devil and the devil will do evil things to people and so I don't shake this off slightly in and come from the mindset of a secular humanists perspective\nAlthough you would think that the folks that are most opposed the cabin out come mainly from that contingent in society so\nSo if you are the Judeo Christian tradition you the lead and when you see I Believe in a devil you mean an evil spirit that you call a devil it correct yes\nAnd it's a common in contrast that with uh the flip them that would be you believe in a Holy Spirit\nCorrect yes so with that would you say a Holy Spirit are wholly spirits plural can combat witchcraft or the occult would you believe that I Do believe that\nYes and even protect those who are are relying on the Holy Spirit\nSo if this is going on in Brooklyn how do you as\nA Christian believer that believes in Holy Spirit\nHowdy you conjure up the Holy Spirit to counter the evil that's being done\nIn Brooklyn deal light candles do praying more do you have ... you have um a worry the I ... what do you use do you have the incense are you on your knees more how do you have\nA counter to the holy water\nFor most people of faith I think the the primary go to solution is prayer where individuals some of the Christian faith pray for a protection they pray for\nA good things to happen and they don't rely on conjuring up evil or giving themselves are creating a vulnerability for the devil to come in and affect them so I think it it really goes to prayer now\nDifferent faiths have different ways to do that whether it's bring the rose earlier using holy water or whatnot so I I Do think that Christians tend to pray and it's typically heard pray for a hedge of protection or from things like this happening\nIt's interesting on this discussion the reason why I asked you those questions is because there are people out there that say oh please you know are we ... oh for crying out loud old hacks oh you've got to be kidding it must be around Halloween who cares\nAnd they don't guard against it and yet they would call themselves a Christian and yet they're not taking the\nThe protections that are afforded them to the Judeo Christian tradition such as holy water such as prayer such as scripture particularly the New Testament such as um\nIncense and candles and getting in\nA mind to reach the odd to reach saint Michel the arcane journal to reach your guardian angel to reach interventions through a Jesus Christ through marry or any of the health mates the saints\nTo guard against stuff like this and counter ... they are agnostic in their defense of two to prosecute this\n... and I think a lot of that is driven by the culture Terry I think that most people don't want to deny good sound that science but you can't help it being a member of faith\nThat they're ... and you can't deny that there is a spiritual realm to things and that spiritual realm is very real people don't know how to explain a supernatural and so put it back into the context of what's going on with these which is I think that\nThere is a a a tendency to get that spiritual realm within that side\nAnd try to use it to their advantage for a political purpose or or you know or to seek vengeance and that's just wrong for many of us\nAnd also happens that this particular congressional year I always call every two years the congressional year ah we have an election around Halloween time\nSo don't which has come out and really capitalize on that October thirty first time and uh and do their thing do do they or don't they have more power around Halloween and because the election is right around the corner are they\nMore powerful consequently and therefore Holy Spirit need to be conjured up there needs to be be an effort that the Holy Spirit come and fight the battle against the occult\n... absolutely I think that the fact that we're in the season of Halloween and all saints makes that spiritual battle ground even more prominent and real for many of these people I just do happen to think that these which is they're they're just upset that they've lost a lot of power\nAnd they see no other way to try to exercise power then to call upon an evil to do the dirty work for them and it also gets them basically some publicity some free publicity and their\nTheir message a name out there\nDespite the fact that our culture ... ... ... a relies heavily on a very science reason based a component to it so there's we're not going to deny that the religious and spiritual component in our lives this country is still very much a spiritual country\nAnd I think that we're just seeing a manifestation of it through this\nWell when I see ... stories like this and there's multiple stories out there and again it's not just any heck's like putting pins in a blue dog\nIt's a ... to cause suffering physical suffering um and even death when I see stuff like this\nI think well where are the on we're Christian soldiers where are they because they need to counter this if they are really true or in their fight in this spiritual battle on good and evil that would be my ...\nYeah I I Would say they should probably be on their knees praying right now and um and not ridiculing this are trying to write it off as just another bunch of crazy left us performing some bizarre act to try to get publicity I\nYou know you make my point because if it really is a belief that we are in a spiritual battle that has manifested through the carnival no no the time and space that we are here than the ... there needs to be more a more asking of spiritual holy hell mates and\nI'm not I'm not here to say that there isn't [noise]\nBut I Wonder if we could do more [noise]\nThe job Shane great thank you very much on that statement

behavioral health dot com out in Texas Dr John die been on this topic of in the vein of the little goes a long way Mike Rowe dosing what the heck is Mike Rowe dosing\nWell it's taking a tiny little bit a potent drugs\nSo that you can get and that fact or a little bit above bugs from that drugs or drug or drugs without all of the serious side effects it's my understanding this is the new thing now in Silicon valley\nMicro do searches for example use a little of say LSD\nTo improve their creativity\nBut the other side of it is that there are experts that say it doesn't improve your creativity at all that falls so I brought Dr John die been on the program again he is with origins behavioral health care hello sir nice to have your doctor\nGreat to be here thanks for having me\nAll right this is a new thing Homs micro dosing explain how much a little bit that can go a long way how much is micro\nSo generally you're talking anywhere from there generally talking about one step to one tenth of what would normally be considered a dose of the drug and and you're right this is mostly a solution to the gym like LSD that that people are doing this with Simon and and\nUh generally like a stick to it tens of but does that would be perfectly\nCause a person to have a you know those those psychic kind of experiences is is what they're talking about and and you said it exactly right that the goal\nPeople's idea is if I just take a little bit I can get all the good stuff\nAnd you know not have any of the the what we call site at\nAll or they right I mean I have one glass of wine I feel pretty good and I'm not drunk\nHowever it eat older there's several things with that number one it depends on your body and your brain everybody metabolize as that glass of wine a little bit differently so for some people\nUh one glass of wine isn't a problem at all for other people it can cause a significant issue your body your brain your health condition your age all of those things are impacted by it but here's the biggest difference when you take a glass of wine\nHabit generally pretty good knowledge of what the alcohol content is with wine when you're talking about\nDrugs especially like LSD for example the the reality is that these are not regulated they're not controlled so you don't ever know nobody who uses drugs elicit Lee or street drugs\nReally truly knows what the concentration is with the purity is so you're always anytime you're taking a an ... a drug that was not you know\nManufactured under you know regulatory conditions you're taking a chance because you you can't tell what the actual purity is and what does that so you might take a smaller amount but you're not ever sure of exactly what you're taking a small amount of\nFame be sad said of this push for recreational marijuana especially since experts say it is far more potent far more five six seven times more public than the marijuana said the sixties or seventies\nActually twenty five to thirty times today is that right\nHas twenty five to thirty times more of the cycle active ingredient THC that's the stuff that is the heart of the stuff that causes addiction but\nI'm twenty five to thirty times more so it's it's vastly different and and that's a that's a good analogy but but even even more so you've got if you're getting your last day\nYou're getting it from some guy who's making it and you know in his base but I'm ... and ... you know it even more difficult to tell what you're taking the other thing\nThat you know and again and I want to be clear\nThat there is there is currently no\nResearch into this and so this is one of the dangers now I'm not against having research into it let the scientists do their thing\nBut until there is good scientific understanding of what really happened what people are doing is they're saying you know I've got this cup of mud in front of me and I really don't want the dirt I just want the water so if I just drink a little bit\nI'm only get you know I won't get as much dark you're still\nGetting mud mothers mud so whenever you take a drug\nDrugs have this tax we call something called the ones we light affects awake all those the ones we don't like side effects but the reality is all of them are just effects of the drug and and you can not especially with a drug that you're not sure about potency up\nYou can not accurately predict how a even a lower doses are going to impact dent in effect you and so people put themselves at risk\nFor not only are getting the positive experiences they want but they put themselves at risk of experiencing all all the negative deleterious effects of the drugs\nOn ... and yet it's catching on in Silicon valley from what I read especially with LSD because they say they'll use there's any way are very open about the fact that they're far more creative their cognitive skills they're flying on all kinds of pistons in the brain\nUm lay people dress out and this Silicon Valley connection in particular doctor\nSure well and and let's and again from a fairness perspective there is there's very little research on it but recently\nThere is some research on a utilizing these drugs are Johns Hopkins university did one and two thousand sixteen there was another one done but New York University School of medicine and and it was specifically looking at\nCancer patients Sudhir cancer patients and ... and they had tremendous depression and anxiety ah and and the they had trials where they have these people are LSD or ... you know these kind of similar acting thanks and actually they had positive effects they actually helped\nPeople's depression and anxiety these cancer patients so there are some studies that show that they're potentially are\nSome helpful effects of these drugs even drugs like silence I've been in LA deep the problem with that again he is we don't have to to Illinois a drug to say that it's dangerous the reality is people use drugs generally because it gives them a desire to affect\nThe difficult thing is two fold\nNumber one it also comes along with with the potential side effects with LSD the potential side effects are are ... are psychosis they are developing depression and anxiety disorders they are ... you know there's a lot of potential negative side effects", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "Johnson
