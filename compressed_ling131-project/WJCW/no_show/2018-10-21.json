never done and yet the house Judiciary Committee Jennifer said we will grant Senator Flake his wish and we will put the FBI on it again so these are kind of\n... to me a lot of trumped up charges against Kavanaugh but the main reason for me is that this is very much\nA Protestant liberal Protestant I should emphasize liberal group of Christian churches Jennifer\nI agree and I was stunned initially until I started taking a closer look at the background of the national council of churches and what they stand for and to your point there very liberal\nBut it's almost like pandering to the secularists because church numbers church attendance has been going down particularly in the United states so\nMuch thought while they're trying to have it both ways but the other thing I thought of and I was also raised Catholic is that child you know accusation is enough to dismiss this person\nI think it may tie in to some of the issues that the Catholic Church has had recently with some of their priest and some of the sexual accusations there I don't think it's too much of a leap that child people what to appear to be virtual is if they\nLook at Catholics you of even better\nIt's just something even though they haven't had any due process that they're automatically guilty of a crime and I almost think that they applied that in this case to Kavanaugh so I think it's twofold that the liberal group itself but also having this recent situation with the Catholic Church\nIt is true that the national council of churches is huge on social causes\nAnd it's a little ironic to me for as that the ... in the cabinet himself\nBeing Catholic by Jesuit trained which within the Catholic Church in the Jesuits are known for more liberal social justice leanings any way rather than the the kind of more traditional Catholic stands I'm so that was kind of ironic but\nThe national council church is very big on social causes very big on this resistance very big on being liberal about\nProgressive ideology for example the ... church or in Washington I Believe it's called St John that in mind much more progressive than the than evangelical churches mostly ... members of course voted for\nFor President Trump as did Catholics so to me they have turn themselves into this kind of political body and have blonde on the issue where they probably didn't need to and they're um they're attacking him because of this\nIdea of probably two to Jennifer's point we don't like Catholics were liberal Protestants we lean toward social causes and he's a Catholic and and therefore I Am a Trump nominee and so therefore we're going to give them thumbs down\nIf we go back and look at history I'm there had been plenty of times where liberal agenda has\nRained through when it really has nothing to do with the substantive argument being made here as it relates to Brett Kavanaugh is is he a qualified educator and ... when he looks at the law can he apply equally across multiple\nDifferent you know topics ideas concepts um is he a fair judge so when you mix in this concept of ideology not to mention um you know church church in another self religion itself as had plenty of turmoil throughout its history and throughout\nThroughout human history ah it it's difficult for me to say that you know there isn't some other agenda going on here and Jennifer's point about some of the other things going on in the Catholic Church um\nAnd I understand these are different factions you know there's there's different denominations but\nThe point is ... where where did we go go wrong in that ... why can't we judge a man based on his character again facts are fuzzy right they're they're applying weird facts that may not even be facts much your opinion\nBut why can't we take this gentleman's record and say wow he actually has ruled fairly liberal on certain things\nAnd he seems to actually have a clear understanding of\nThe ... you make a great point Chris in the sense that he's been known to be a independent justice judge\nA and he's been known to be a constitutional is and I think of that entire list that President Trump had the short list including Amy Coney Barrett I've asked myself through this whole process if it was\nA me they would have taken or over the\nCoals because she wears her ... honors on her sleeve and not considered particularly in\nIndependent judge she's a constitutional is but not necessarily independently Kavanaugh's so I think of the pick of the litter on his short list Chris it was quite noted that he picked somebody that could probably have\nIn his mind Trump's mind the the most easy getting through this process or can you imagine what they would have done to Amy Coney Barrett who I think was\n... coming up in second place or Tom Hartmann or others I mean on that list there were a list of nine I think there were six Catholics on Amy would have been crucified use a ... a religious term even more than Sarah Palin crafts\nYeah and it's a shame because in the spirit of trying to get behind um what's going on surrounding the Brett Kavanaugh fiasco I'll call it a fiasco lord knows what what would have been done to Amy if\nIf they had found even the slightest thing in her history where she had been on a date with a man of of a bad reputation you know I mean with with searching in and prodding and all I'm probing and all these things that they did and Mr Cavanaugh I Can't imagine what they would do to a hard right Catholic woman who had any sort of\n... ah extra curricular activity in her past you know and and and just what do you use your term to encapsulate crucified or in front of the entire world it would have been terrible\nTo me this Jennifer would have been sexual also because it's hard to find things like with any of these judges oh bank fraud or um I don't know white collar crime or it would have been sexual don't you agree\nI absolutely agree and to Chris's point about uh the other judge candidate or a nominee that was a potentially they're they're looking for something and when the national organization decided that it was had to do with a\nPartisan bias extreme partisan bias that's what they said about Cavanaugh I was stunned if I didn't see that and I think it just illustrates though the liberal\nHypocrisy even amongst church organizations that simply don't like the candidate it's so interesting too because we are talking about blind justice aren't we [laughter] Jennifer you know this is about to be what\nAnd supposed to be decided on merit it's supposed to be the preliminary through the judicial committee a which I thought was very insightful to look at the left and the right within that committee so\n... by ... to lady justice with blind folders on this was a hundred percent political Jennifer and it was a last chance Gulch it seemed to me to knock down a good candidate\nThe way they didn't with justice Gorsuch the Gorsuch because of probably how they feared he would rule most likely on issues of\nLife I agree and it's one hundred percent political and it's not just the destruction of a candidate it was the destruction of a human being and his reputation last night\nChris I ah I feel terrible for the Kavanaugh family um my last thought is that if you go back and you were really dissect a who has been nominated to the court the last four or five it's it every single one of them has been a partisan decision with the exception of the last two although\nThey may be more conservative judges I Would I Would imagine that they were conservative base on I'm not in politics but policy in the last\nGood discussion both Christian Jennifer that kicks off this edition of think America back with more talking about Washington again bring your dog to

com I'm delighted to have John Milano\nOn the air he is a fellow with the center for Immigration Studies he's an expert on all of these changes to the ... of the immigrants coming into the country from other countries and other countries may be jealous of India's immigrants into the United states here's my interview with\nJohn John and tell us in detail what is this fairness for high skilled immigration act most Americans had never heard of it before\nAll the various for high skilled immigrants is a massive measure that's been pushed forward\nBy foreign guest workers from the that um these workers face comes from two aspects of the immigration system versed in Nineteen sixty five we adopted a system of diversity and immigration so that each country is limited to a maximum of seven percent of the green cards are permanent residents in residency permits\nIn the United states but at the same time in Nineteen Ninety Congress allowed H. one B. guest workers to apply for green cards and so what was happening was we were telling eighty five thousand people a year from India to apply for ten thousand green cards here which then created a backlog and then in two thousand cameras allowed ...\nTo stay in age from ... status but he definitely\nWhen there was a ah when they were in the green card cue so the rules I was even bigger backlogs the guest workers from learn the American system\nAnd they hired lobbyists and they ... had drafted this fairness for high skilled immigrants act which gets rid of the per country quotas for employment base green cards that's pending right now and uh what this bill would would do it you know knock your sleep\nIs getting rid of these quotas but people no one has really considered the effect to get anywhere the quotas which would be that no one outside of India will be able to get a green card for between six and eight years and then after that Seventy five percent of the green cards would go to India it's great for India\nBut sucks for the entire rest of the world\nI mean you can just imagine what would happen if suddenly the Irish find out that they can't get a green card for six years and one of the attacks is that in some occupation categories they will not be able to bring cards at all\nSo for example the restaurant industry is gonna be screaming I Can't get a green card for French chef and those are the giant train wreck what is happening with this bill is that it was sponsored by Kevin Yoder of Kansas who became chairman of the ditch as Appropriations Committee this summer\nAnd he promptly slipped this bill into the future budget so the summary here is\nThat we have a bill with the most radical change in American immigration policy in the nation's history that's been pushed entirely by foreign interests has had no hearings has had no press coverage of its effects and it's been slipped into the budget bill\nAnd so people this is called the train wreck in the immigration system and we'll just suddenly find out about it if the bill gets enacted\nHow is Center for Immigration Studies helping get this messaging out so that the bill can slow down and can have a review you can have a process by the American people don't understand it what is the I asked doing\nWell see that's the way we write about these things we've written about what this bill does when we go to the CIA us do to our website you can find I'm writing to describe exactly the effect of that the bill would have on fortunately Congress hasn't paid much attention to it they just let this thing go\nOn autopilot what will be the upshot if they continue to let it go on auto pilot and now we're going to have a lot of mad countries India will love it but they might be mad at India do\nWriter but it ... it'll be literally a train wreck in the immigration system no one will be able to get a green card English from India\nAnd wondering if right now you can get a green card for most if you're for most countries in the world you can get a green card regular you don't have to go through the ... system first but this will change it so that everyone has to get into the um guest workers system they won't be as workers system before they can get a green card\nLet me move on and I don't even think about that train wreck but that will be very interesting to watch it at that as it goes down or not\nLet's move on and on wind Molly tip that\nWas killed tragically stabbed to death presumably and we want to say allegedly because he hasn't been convicted yet but Ga chess and other\nFederal authorities say that he actually did it some people wonder if he had to help he said he was knocked out are blacked out so one wonders if there might be friends of his acquaintances buddies of his et cetera that might have helped in all of that\nBut nonetheless there wasn't a lot of talk about the e verify\nThat this young man slipped through where are we with the demand that e verify happen at every employment door post\nOr basically nowhere on that um it hasn't nothing's been advanced in a long time with with e verify the reality is um I mean we know that there's a huge number of people working in the country we're working illegally and they're being hired by employers who would rather not know we'd rather have willful ignorance on this\nHer death is another as I've said from time to time brick in the wall what do I mean by that I mean just like Cape sign it was a brick in the wall with more and more Americans dying at the hands of illegals whether it's murder accident some kind of manslaughter\nMaybe it's just a DUI maybe it's speeding maybe stabbing maybe it's with a gun it's another\nSign that brick needs to go to make a long but what I hear more sanctuary cities\nAbolish ice and those signs are all over the place especially in an election year\nThe police are terrible we are a global world borderline society do you think more Americans will become more bricks in the wall to make the wall or the wall will never be made and the illegal immigrants slow\nWill just continue to happen and whether we like it or not we're a borderline is a nation with no sovereignty could\nBench Lee we're going to go towards the bricks in the wall slide than\nThe election of Donald Trump I think is one of the key signs of that I mean the the people are tired of the open borders system that the than the Trump made immigration central issue of his camp campaign and now when you see in surveys over immigration ranking among the top issues of the voters\nBecause people are more and more seeing how immigration policy affects their lives like in my town um my\nFront yard is to train for the illegal alien pickup joins okay my front yard is the gathering place where the contractors come and pick up the illegal aliens for work and so naturally comes at a latrine dumping area and so people like me pay the cost of illegal aliens\nMeanwhile you know the rich people who are hiring all these people to do their lawns and enjoy life where they get the benefits without suffering because the other ... we've seen is in the higher end in employment visas come one of them was the we've\nMade it measures the H. one B. guest worker visa\nThe H. one B. guest worker bees a is for people in college educated occupations patients will generally park college degree but Congress has designed the system\nTo replace Americans with cheap foreign workers and that's the purpose of the program a sugar coated with descriptions like that that we have a shortage of American workers and we need a highly skilled workers to fill jobs that Americans can do but that's not what Congress enacted and people are shocked\nTo discover the Congress has made it legal to replace Americans with foreign workers", "show_name":
