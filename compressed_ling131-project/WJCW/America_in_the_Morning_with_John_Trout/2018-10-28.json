avid Kevin okay Hi Kevin welcome to the show high\nRight area there um you said told me they think I'm wrong and you were talking about there but we'll talking Democrats\nSaying not to do something than doing it immediately afterwards and I said you don't think they know what they're doing you didn't think they were aware that they were doing that\nAnd I disagree I think they know what they're doing always and they just know that people listen to whatever the last time\nNo but no I I honestly don't think at times and I get this by the way from not my opinion I actually was when I read Bernard Goldberg will bias and he said they were in the media they really don't know\nThey really don't think that they're biased they really don't and and he was in the end he worked there right he'd worked for Denver he just thinks that they're right on everything but they never even miss the obvious things\nLike the obvious irony that as they're calling for the end the divisiveness they are putting out the most divisive statement that they themselves are not conscious that they're doing it\nThat they don't even believe that they just think they're they are so just driven by tunnel vision that they don't even know that they're doing it and I so that really that really didn't tell me that came from Bernard Goldberg who worked for Dan Rather and wrote the book buyers and talked about the media at large\nThe mindset that they actually have they don't walk around thinking\nThat were Democrats and Republicans are thinking there's Democrats or Republicans and there's a way that we think and we're always right and they never questioned the way that they think they actually don't analyze what they're saying at the time that they're doing it and I just believe and again we don't know because you know ... whether it's soccer or whatever I Can't read his mind ... but it sucks\nAn obvious it's such an obvious divisive\nStatement that once you explain that people go oh yeah they claim

you saw the New York times\nWhen the New York times to the editor of the editorial staff on the you know they you know the the the butcher job on Sarah Palin\nRight where's the fear of being wrong there isn't one because they believe they're right right\nThere's no fear of being wrong I Can't be wrong I write yeah you're you're you're making the point there that they were analyzing that statement and knew the hypocrisy was there and but nobody will notice it no I don't think they knew the hypocrisy was air they just they were so tunnel vision this is our statement we're right right

that the first time during our pre show meeting when I read that sentence that's how I took it until I read it a second time right\nThat I said oh so the bomb was harmless too and I have a woman that's not what it says\nQuote as law enforcement officials said tests have determined that a powder found inside an envelope delivered to CNN along with the pipe bomb was harmless right not in the pipe bomb right and there's a there's a difference there so we just wanted to make note of that now we don't know\nAnd but there is a question that this is a three days is what the FBI you said the FBI knows whether these rely bonds or not\nThey know but they have not yet all we have gotten is potentially ... potential potentially explosive devices and and so you you ask yourself the question not in not in we're not in conspiracy theory mode were simply widening investigation would they not want that released well it'd\nBe you know because there are a number of theories here are possibilities as to what this could be or what the motive could be behind the individuals but ah that were responsible but the the concern here is is that um\nI guess the question is whether or not they at at at any point whether these devices were meant to send just a message\nOr whether they were intended to kill or maim individuals\nThat's a very different motives and and mission by the person responsible ... those are the questions you would be asking as an investigator mhm\nAnd so you would want to know the answer to those questions my point is if it's leaking out from law enforcement\nThe ISIS parity flag and everything else and are these selective leaks why don't we have a leak yet if sources are telling these news organizations\nDifferent things the powder isn't there why isn't anybody asking the question we're the bombs why would they have gone off with a on a timer\n\nIs there an investigative reason why they would not do that\nOther information right I don't know the answer and I I there's there's no sense of suspicion there's no conspiracy theory here these are just questions that I hadn't because it gets to the heart of\nWanting to uh uh I think everybody wanting to know what the motivation of the person or persons who did this what the motivation is and you don't know until you know you you can't even start to to come\nTo a a path or possibly a path to go down to figure out why this happened unless you know whether the bombs were actually bombs or they were fake bombs mhm\n\nBecause the motivation then can be completely different right\nWhile you're looking to send a message to the people uh the the the would be recipients you're also looking to send a message to the country and the world knowing full well that this would make them is\nThe interesting thing is when you actually go through it and you look we were when you look at Fox News and others are and I did mention that the wall Street Journal said called the pipe bombs and I said no we're in there did I see a quote in the wall Street Journal\nThat said pipe bombs that were for her to the FBI and investigators talking about it and so I've seen that in many different articles and you know I've gone through a ton of different uh uh uh you know news reports overnight to try to find out\nYou know of anybody of it you know throughout the night if anybody is leaking whether these were actually working live bombs that had explosive\nOr whatever you would use in what they claim were crude devices right 'cause we were been told they were pipe hyped like bombs crude devices potentially explosive devices I don't know would potentially means\nWell that's the question of you use the word potentially does that mean it wasn't\nArmed wasn't triggered wasn't ready to be triggered\n\nThat potentially had it been armed\nIt would have been explosive\nBut the phrasing the phrasing is is is ah is key by the media because we don't we haven't heard this is why we're looking for quotes from people actually doing the investigation well but then fighting the FBI\nI I I'm I may be taking the liberty here\nBut within\nThirty seconds mhm of looking at those bombs ... an FBI bomb expert would be able to tell you whether it was legitimately a bomb or not mhm\n\nAnd whether it was a working or lie by so if it's three days old why don't we know\n\nAnd I'm asking from an investigator point of view was a reason that they wouldn't tell you because it will tip off something to the possible suspects I don't know I I but it's very strange for three days have gone by and other things simply\nLike the the image of the the parity image of the ISIS flag the other picture to get her done that stuff's leaking we still don't know whether it was a lie bummer lie bomb or not or lied bombs lie bomb in that case for CNN or whatever we don't know why don't we know\n\nBecause they know mhm you know the FBI knows right yes\nAnd certainly the person responsible knows now
