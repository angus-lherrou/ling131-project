I mean seriously they was wasn't one of those old my beer\nMoment but if if if you look at this entire week and you know just looking back at at this week before we had all fun vacation that ... you know we started the beginning of the week and really it was the fact that the the the message from the whole cabinet hearings if you believe in due process\nYou are a rapist enabler right\nIf you believe su ... the mindset of due process that you don't believe the allegation that's how crazy doesn't unite talked about that over the last thirty forty fifty sixty years\nThe number of lawyer shows on TV starting with Perry Mason\nYou know you go through ... like I'm probably missing a ton of them most one with William Shatner Boston Legal just throwing the ... and you know and then law and order for almost the last Thirty years and law and order everybody understands with people may not know the three branches of government they may not know the constitution they may not be able to\nTell you you know the freedoms you have in the first amendment all things that we are brought up over the last couple of months\nBut it's part of our culture it's part you know ... ... innocent until proven or get guilty\nThat evidence decides that something that's even beyond what we're taught\nThe infrastructure of how the constitution works that's part of our popular culture it's in so many TV shows out there over the last forty or fifty years and and I think they just ... it was a huge mistake in calculation by the Democrats to believe that they could sell that to the American people cause I guarantee you if you're a Democrat out here\nRight now you know ... that that was a stupid move by the\nRight that if they wanted to oppose cabinet posts Kavanaugh but coming out with those statements that a woman is always to be believed everyone knows is pure trash yes nobody is to always be believed just because of\nTheir demographic their gender or race whatever everybody knows it's the evidence but they actually tried to sell that to the American\nUh uh the people and you think about is just it's just it's nuts and then by the time we got to the middle of the week it was the Democrats promoting and civility including the mainstream\nOf the the Democratic Party or like a Hillary Clinton or we saw Eric Holder come up and backtrack oh everybody knows that's not what I meant somebody wrote that don't use the word kick\n[laughter] and you know to you know where we are uh you know right now looking at the polls and seeing how they're all going to react\nMhm yeah and it is it and\nIt is also the wagging the finger toward people\nSimply for believing in the process there they're being a indirectly condemned\nFor doing so yes saying that you're essentially on a person's side and that you support what we allege he did write\nIt which goes against and and think about it I I think the perfect example the perfect imagery is the ACLU what they used to be a seal used as to what they had become today\nBut the presumption of innocence means nothing nothing to the American civil liberties union anymore it shows used something accord with Americans understand and the ACLU probably did decades of a a damage\nMaybe overcoming challenges premature\nAnd make strong and healthy\nWho do I performed for\nTheir flying from Austin composer whose music deserves to be hiring\nPerform for all the stagehand\nMake sure I never missed a Q\n... high school choir director who taught me to pretend the guy friends tend to hire\nA speech debate theater using the performing arts teach valuable life lessons that typically aren't taught in the classroom\nThey help high school students learn leadership skills that prepare them to enjoy more satisfying productive lives and\nTheir forms and this is happening in my high school debate coach who would help me become more confident than I ever dreamed pounding\nThis message presented by the Tennessee secondary school athletic association and the high school in your commute [noise]\nDon't ignore facial redness or what you might think is a sunburn that just won't go away it could be an early warning sign of accounting facial disorder called rogue nation sixteen million Americans have resignation and it's how trigger is the son\nLearn the warning signs facial redness bumps and pencils visible blood vessels even irritated eyes if you experience any one of these signs see a dermatologist for diagnosis and treatment or visit the national ... society everything shut down or\nThere are some moments only the force can inspire find your words that discovered the forest dot force learned about forcing as you can discover new things to do when you go to discover the fourth stop by to you by the U.S Forest Service on the on Tom\n...
