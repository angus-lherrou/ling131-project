facing five federal crime prosecutions in connection with more than a dozen package bumps into critics of President Trump\nThe FBI's director made it clear the packages contain improvised explosive devices and the bombs were no hoax\nThe ex pats have been unraveling sentence harassed revealing a dark history of at least nine of rats including threats to blow up a Florida power company according to police reports he sent them a warning saying it would be worse than September eleventh\nThat has also been making threats against high profile people in the media on his Twitter account mainly directed at CNN journalists\nEven with the Iraq in custody investigators are stressing it does not mean the threat is over\nToday's arrest doesn't mean we're all out of the woods there may be other packages in transit now\nSo bats and and that's a again\nAs we said many times it's not the ... it's necessarily that a crime has been committed they are you a proven it\nIt's the perception that you're hiding something right\nAnd so there's where that is a right now interesting day uh yesterday I mean I'm just looking at your real clear politics with two weeks ago Republicans are increasingly bullish\nOn a on a ... a prospects a you know other uh headlines reading up uh in fact\nI was reading ... earlier or the other at the headlines were favoring a Democrats and ah let me see a silver eighty five percent Dems now take the house as well [noise]\nYou know okay ... Nate Silver is ripe thirty eight and cook cook Charlie Cook yes eight more house up ... you know a racist so right for again it's depending on and you were\nAnd it may be it may be too complicated to to go through on the air but you were telling me before about when you look at uh five thirty eight yeah and the Nate Silver website and and and ... and ... well wait a minute you were you were talking about one district and you said all they're doing is looking at the population\nWell they they look at the population and they look at their expectations are forecast of you know this is the the Web sites\nBecause of how many people in that district are going to vote it was Texas started to Pete Sessions\nAnd then a based on you know again the leaning of that or the makeup of voter makeup of that district which is nine points in favor of the Republican\nAnd then they go to the pole and the most recent poll goes back a long time I mean it's it's pre cabin on I think it's a mid September September\nThirteenth are ending and again but what they're what they're trying to what they're trying to give some certainty to win and again it will be proven on election day whether he was right or not right but what you're trying to do is in a very uncertain time\nWith variables that have not existed that I have not seen in a midterm right right I that I've not seen since I've been covering politics is really the late eighties yeah which is really Kavanaugh and the uniqueness of Trump\nI think you throw everything out the water because what the pollsters are attempting to figure out is not where people stand\nYou know not not in it but who is more excited and you know you quoted to me on that particular district the number of people they say we're going to come out and vote and I'm thinking to myself that's a complete guess how do they know how do you measure\nAnd and this is the the hardest thing here when you're talking about\nThese house races is how do you measure you can look at presidential elections and you kind of an idea based on other presidential elections and All right how many people might come out and vote\nYou know in this particular of an election but when you start talking about these particular districts and the uniqueness number one of the whole Kavanaugh hearings which I think is unprecedented\nAs a late September ... he's right [laughter] right um\nIt it's just an unprecedented and Trump himself\nIs an unprecedented president and has broken all the rules of trying to figure out what's going to happen right you know in in a in a race I just I don't see the certainty that they claimed to be making I don't know where they come out with right certainty that yeah or or anybody is buying the certainty that that they're attempting\nTo suck 'cause I Would still say and again I'm not a pollster and I don't have my own methodology and I by the way I give a lot of credibility to five thirty eight on many things in terms of like election coverage\nAnd things they've done in the past ah it it's just that I don't know that you can blend all of these formulas which they have\nTo make their own essentially proprietary blend of of production models I don't know how you know again I Would love to sit down with him and say okay tell me why you believe this works and why this is a better model and they may be right on\nNow again this is about the overall you know eighty five percent chance that Democrats will win the house that's an overall that they will get right you know at least a a you know to ah you know that magic number\nAnd and have more than a more seats ultimately the and the Republicans and and that could be the case but I here's what I question\nIs we're not seeing recent poll even in some of those high profile Senate races like Ted Cruz and and uh and that's all Rourke I mean you have to go back it's it's been a week I Would think you would have\nAnother poll that would have come out or you know where to Wednesday morning and maybe we'll we'll see one today or tomorrow\nBut I Would I Would like to see one I mean I for you know for measuring this I think if you're going to get into accuracy and get closer to accuracy I Would expect to see one every few days on the house races\nI mean it becomes on some of these races you got it it's a it's impossible because you go it's all pre Kavanaugh all pre caravan and right now what they they've got a thirty seats as toss up at our see pie in the house\nAnd you look at those and and again I think there are too many factors I'm not saying anyone is wrong\nI I'm just saying that that we're not seeing the polls I Would love to see some more Daley pulls\nA or at least you know twice weekly but we're not seeing those and what we do have in many of those races as pre Kavanaugh polls and pre a caravan polls and I think those two elements are changing ah right now the the the central\nComing up next\nUm I Believe that last night the President Trump\nPut out one of the greatest tweet suffer ... he had one of the greatest trolling moments in Twitter\nHistory ... he has been criticized for his tweets mhm we have always said he could use it in a much better way yeah\nYesterday he did\nYou don't want him and said coming up next eight six six Ninety red eye\nFor supermarkets across the country these days you\nIt's a jungle because\nPeople are spending more food away from home in\nAgriculture department research economist added ... ... in a new look at data from Nineteen Ninety seven to twenty Seventeen she says spending at restaurants has been surpassing spending on grocery store foods since back in twenty ten and traditional supermarkets are also losing out as shoppers are buying a larger share of their at home food at warehouse club super centers and such and so\nThe grocery store I share food at home has really declined lot\nDropping Thirteen percent since Nineteen Ninety seven us some businesses can see the market share shrink
