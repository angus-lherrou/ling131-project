the what's the ratio there's a greater motivation on the right less motivation overlap or after the confirmation does that change anything at all at one uh what is it because you could make the argument that if\nHe were not confirm what the left feel more empowered I think that's the argument I Would make there's a a good argument to make for that that they would feel empowered that look at

women are the reason that you know a a cabin up a was a was confirmed\nAnd it gets back to what my friend a independent Bob called me and\nYou know over the years now he has moved more during the Obama years he became more a ... he became more moderate Republican\nI Would say and in some cases even conservative I Am in a state of that well maybe we should call them independent Bob anymore but he still proclaims all the time that he's an independent right\nAnd when he called me be called me yesterday and and just said you could just he was so intense he said how could I ever vote for democratic get\nSo how can I vote for any party that tells me women are always right and white men are always wrong right he said white\nMen aren't always right and the women\nAre not urging me white men are always a wrong white men are always right ... women aren't always wrong women aren't only write your aren't always right you've got\nBy case basis he said I Know that he said everybody knows and he's but he told me he said but I couldn't change anybody's mind on this because he was involved in a ton of social\nMedia debates and\nHe was talking about his friends on the left that would stick to some of the new ... point that wouldn't even matter and I told him I said well look\nThe point I'm looking at is not trying to convince them 'cause you're never going to convince them which are trying to do is convince the the middle trying to convince people like you and I told him I said I remember you twelve Thirteen Years ago\nYour look right now is completely completely different uh another family member of mine who was who was always more conservative but always said well it's good to have the Democrats are it's good to have the Democrats are it's good to have the Democrats there\nAre within a conversation with them over the weekend\nAnd I explained I said well\nYou know what the Democrats did here as soon as I said that they just started going\nOff and just said I Can't believe that I Can't believe they've gone to this to this point and it's the mainstream of the Democrats not summer Iran and and he told me he said you know I always I always like it that you know I agree mostly with the Republicans but it's always good to have an opposition party there but he said what good is that opposition party\nIs it because you know the Republicans don't always do the right thing you said in sometimes I Need to be kept in check he said the who keeps them in check\nThe Democrats ... ... the mainstream of the Democrats have gone crazy and I think that is a key here so when I look at a couple of weeks from now for weeks from now\nAnd and the election uh\nI look at history and history shows the vast majority of times when you get to this point and you've got a Republican president you've got a Republican House you've got to Republican Senate in all likelihood the Republicans should lose seats yeah\nUh that's what history shows it's almost the same as when people call this up and and the one gentleman limber forget you remember the call to about a month before the election of ... he said you guys going to be surprised when Trump wins and said no we're not because history shows he should win based on the economy\nBecause the economy actually has been so bad and people have felt it and they view that there's a need for change so\nYou look at history and you think yeah now the Democrats should take now should they take enough seats to actually take over the house I don't know\nBut then you see the big huge on oh and that is the Kavanaugh nomination I have\nI I still can't come up in my mind\nWhen the Republicans have been so United the only thing that comes to my mind is Nineteen Ninety four\nAh I'd only been a talk radio for five years\nBut I remember Ninety four caught everybody off guard except for ... members Ogden had her death threats as a result we became a poster yeah he ... he he came closest\nTo to catching what was actually happening now that was the United GOP at that point [laughter] just nobody knew that they were United Right off to all go out go out and vote and were motivated at that point\nI had not seen\nA Republican Party that was as fractured as this Republican Party has bent\nAnd with in a period of two weeks is a completely United party not because they love the leader or necessarily of the the party who would be the president not because they all of them a majority do\nBut\nIt it it's because they had seen what the other party is and they look at the guy that they hated just a little while ago and said you know something he's really\nNot that bad I I I Wish you wouldn't say this I Wish you wouldn't treat this but these people when you see what they actually want you know they called Trump a fascist and at times I didn't like it ... times I'd I'm speaking premiums speaking for never Trump hers\nYou know never Trump per se but you know he he talks authoritarian but even if he isn't and sometimes he sounds intolerant even if even if he isn't well then you see what the Democrats do when you say will actually this is what they mean\nRight there is no new launched nuanced opinions here to what they mean they don't believe in due process they don't believe in a presumption of innocence they stereotype they say what you know and they stereotype to fit their particular narrative at the moment and we'll change a day later\n... ... it's ... if\nYou look at the I I think um where the Republicans have come together over two weeks over the last couple of weeks it's not even just the Kavanaugh nomination ended up itself or\nProtecting the process during the Supreme Court nomination even\nIt's not just Lindsey Graham and no and and and the things he said I mean part of it ah it it's it's all of those and more it is but the bigger picture is including by the way ... you know and and her speech which got a lot of praise on on friday\nBut it really is you know the\nFact that I it it seems as if the party is saying yeah it's time to build a wall\nTo wall\nAround the party and what it really ... and four and a wall around the constitution to protect it it's time that the party joined hands here and not that everybody has to agree on everything but there there has to be\nA greater respect and I think campaigning to go out and show what the and demonstrate clearly over and over again what the what the other side is doing\nAnd saying look we can all have our discussions on those issues within our house\n\nBut on the outside you need to know where the danger lies to you every single day and it is from this kind of behavior\nYou know the interesting thing is for all the accusations of being a fascist an authoritarian that have been leveled at Trump\nThen maybe some never Trump spurs bought into ...\nA majority of Republicans ridiculous because he wasn't if you see if you see what he's about if you see the things that he loves if you see the legislation that he's put into effect if you see his executive orders and what comes out of the White House about separation of powers and what they believe\nYou know that's not true but I think that what and I think you're right on here this wasn't just about the nomination it was the belief\nThat the\nDemocrats truly are and it really hit when he realized it was the main stream it was those in the Senate Judiciary committee it is what is viewed as the leadership of the Democratic party that the mindset of authoritarianism and fascism that mindset that they were throwing at Trump\nActually belongs to their party and they only get shredded it officially here and I and I I think it is I think it has scared\nSome Republicans who didn't want to be a part of you know the uh of supporting the Republican Party I think it scared them straight right I really do I really I I usually only they went I went whoa we well never thought they'd do this and\nAnd you know the last motivator that we could even come close the ... I guess in ... during the the uh the Trump presidency ah to to pair allowing this was when Roy Moore last\nThey realize they need to get tax has done yeah you know they ... they weren't getting it done they weren't getting it done and it was well no more than ... than all of a sudden right after Roy Moore's law they got it done\nWhat happened over the last couple of weeks should be a greater motivator on all legislative in procedural issues that and it should be for the foreseeable future\nThat tax policy did not unite the actual party you know that their nose and it didn't it and um\nIt was the effect of the Roy Moore last right that got them motivated and that's miniscule compared to what you know the last two ...\nPrefer for all of a stagehand you\nMake sure I never missed a Q\nHigh school choir director who taught me to breathe the guys tend to\nA speech debate theater using the performing arts teach valuable life lessons that typically aren't taught in the classroom they held high school students learn leadership skills that prepare them to enjoy more satisfying productive lives\nForms and this is happening in my high school debate coach who would become more confident that ain't ever dreamed pounding\nThis message presented by the Tennessee secondary school athletic association and the high school in your community [noise]\nIs reducing the YMCA\nYou already know the why we're so you think sure you know the wife or a swim workout even a game of food did you know we're more than that we're a cause\nWhen you take your jumps out at the Y. someone else is getting job training [noise] take the cardio by most kids are in an after school enrichment program [noise]\nPractice or download facing dogs as a team practice is her leadership skills\nWe were with people no matter their age income or background and give them the opportunity to learn grow and thrive in all with one simple goal in mind to strengthen our communities and we got so much more that does just that\nThe one you might think of the wise that place to live the way we're also about lifting higher [noise] introducing the why\nWe're so much more than a place to cause\nThe YMCA dot net slash more at highway speeds the average taxed takes your eyes off the road for about five seconds that's enough time to travel the length of a football field stopped text stop ... dot org brought you by the national Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the ad count now\nDish H.
