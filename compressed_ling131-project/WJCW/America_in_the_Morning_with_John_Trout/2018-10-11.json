lot of rain across the southeast is well this is going to be renewing flooding problems throughout the Carolinas including some areas that are still dealing with flooding issues left over from Florence\nWe're also going to see gusty winds that's going to be a big problem as well and we can have additional power outages s trees and power lines began to come down as well with this storm moving through\nFurther to the north we have a cold front which is what steering Michael also bringing rainy weather there can be some gusty winds even up through Virginia and into Delmarva\nHowever

be our Democrats bring the issue of health care back to the forefront in advance of the midterm elections corresponded Linda ... has the story\nThe mid term elections are closing in fast and Democrats want to punctuate the issue of healthcare\nHoping it will help bring voters to the polls on election day\nThey want to portray the Democratic party as the champion of health care and the Republican Party as the one that wants to take it away\nThat helps to explain why Senate Democrats forced to vote on a bill that would eliminate the extended sale of so called junk health insurance plans the fact that they didn't get the votes to support the bill and that only one Republican Susan Collins broke ranks and voted with Democrats\nIs not necessarily a bad thing for the Democratic party because it sends this message\nWill keep working to improve health care to bring down the cost of prescription drugs but to make sure that people with pre existing conditions can get that care and we will do our very best to hold the Republican majority accountable for their attempts to undo\nDemocrat Maggie Hassan says these policies which are part of the jail peace effort to undo Obamacare don't cover much and they certainly don't have a pre existing conditions\nWhat we really are seeing from the Trump Administration and Republicans is an absolutely relentless attempt to got protections especially for pre existing conditions Republican\nJohn Cornyn says that's not the case\nProtecting patients against pre existing conditions something we all support but basically the the misleading argument we're hearing from the other side is the only way you can do that through the Affordable CARE Act the Affordable\nCARE Act or Obamacare does cover pre existing conditions and Democrat Chris Murphy says the low cost insurance plans that Republican support and not worth the paper they're written on\nI think it's really sad that we couldn't draw more than one Republican vote for a measure that simply says when you sell insurance it should actually be insurance\nBut Senator Cornyn says the insurance he's talking about is all about choice\nWe need more choices for consumers who they can fly

going to be a possibility throughout the especially the eastern Carolina is not as much in the western half of the north and South Carolina\nWe're also going to be looking at rainy weather in general

Florence the last notable storm which was a virtually guilty of loitering why the difference\nWell hurricanes are are like ... and the stream where um the stream as a kind of background atmosphere flow of scaring the storm in case of Florence is kind of slow me entering streams so state over a long a period or an area over a long period of time\nOr as a Michael is in a fast moving stream and is there for moving quickly to the north\nI gather that in terms of wind velocity there's no connection between the speed with which this storm moves across the landscape uh if you will it sits horizontal speed if you as a as compared with the the speed of its wins in in the circular motion the two are not related ride\nRight to to aren't related yeah\nA storm surge again or is there a loitering stormed more likely to cause more in the way of water damage than one that moves rapidly\nIt certainly can cause a build up the search ahead of the storm and Ken prolonging the search as a
