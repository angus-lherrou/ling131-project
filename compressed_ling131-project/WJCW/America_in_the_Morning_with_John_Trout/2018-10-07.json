fun uh but\nAs we know we we've state of this before\nThere has not been one and I mean one there hasn't been one\nRational thought\nOr arguments\nPolitical thinking talking point\nMade by the Democrats throughout this entire process knocked one\nThey don't have anything here\nNothing\nThey have\nTried to change the topic\nAnd if you listen to it and they say they're constantly trying to change the topic of his we subtle along to the to the folks on the right who at times lets them change the topic and many people on the right don't stick to the topic because the topic is only this\nAre the allegations supported by any other evidence\nAnybody else who has been sexually abused we have tremendous compassion and sympathy for them\nBut they have no credit no more credibility speaking on this particular issue on this particular case than anybody else in our justice system the\nOnly thing that matters is evidence and and our justice system which is the criminal justice system it's also the civil justice system so also on the political justice system\nThe presumption of innocence and the presentation of evidence to back up an allegation\nIs required and there's a responsibility I Believe of every American to ensure that that is the way that the process is held up whether it's in the arena of political ideas that may not be the criminal justice system\nBut it's the same responsibility that people have not been defame other people's character for their own immediate political one and the the some of the arguments that\nYou've heard what one of the younger is what I thought was the beauty will who they um they they started it with the Merrick Garland a because they they they they would nominate him so Republicans got what they deserved excuse me\nThis is something that has been talked about for a long time Chuck Schumer brought it up back went in two thousand nine ... when he said in an election year no and and and Bush or or should be able to Bush was\nMade was before two thousand I or because it was it had to be during Bush it'd be during the Bush before two thousand nine but Schumer brought it up a during the Bush administration went and just just a in case one of the Supreme Court justices died said we should not be the the policy of the Senate\nTo nominate a a Supreme Court justice during a presidential election year right by the way the stink wasn't as big it was for a little bit and then people realize oh Hillary is going to kill Trump so we don't have to worry about it we'll just get it after ... right but delaying a nomination\nThat has been an idea that both Democrats and Republicans have been promoted for a couple of months to allow the next president who all the polls and all the Democrats thought would be Hillary Clinton\nIs not the same as the famed mean a person's character by calling them calling that person\nAte gang rapist a sexual assault terror without any evidence besides an allegation\nWhich the witnesses\nThat the people that brought those allegations about their witnesses could not cooperated\nAnd in the case of Dr Ford who claimed she has the evidence that would cooperate it she refuses to give it to the body that would make that decision which is the Senate Judiciary committee\nSo to make that case I mean that's probably the strongest argument which is a weak argument\nThat I've heard was well since I held up Garland murder girl is will they deserved it what do you mean that was done through the majority leader said you know we've got the majority\nMhm but\nUh we'll hold it even if we have the majority after the next president does a lot right irrespective of whether it's a Democrat or Republican\nThat's the same as the fame ing and\nDestroying somebody's life right with allegations that are not provable\nI didn't see any attacks on Merrick Garland\nAnd so everything that you know every allegation that has been brought up\nIs suspect mhm\nUh because the witnesses that they brought forward could not cooperate it right\nThe things that they said changed that the the the alleged victims claimed changed as we went along\nAnd that's what we go by and our system whether it's the political whether it's political justice whether it's civil justice or whether it's criminal justice the presumption a vivid evidence and the fact that an allegation and stop and think about it the protesters right now that you saw yesterday and you're going to see all day again today\nThat may get arrested again today and there may be you know but thousands more who knows\nThey're saying believe the survivors which means you always believe the accuser will do they believe that no we all know they don't know we all know that sort of August argument you believe the accuser if they're on our political side this is the social media\nOr approach now to ah to\nActivists or activism it's exactly what you see on social media you know we talk about the fact that real\nPeople don't live their lives like you know people uh act on social media\nWe talk about that a lot\nWell the people who are activists\nTrolls and celebrities do they live in a virtual world will celebrities live in a virtual world\nThat's what they do for a living anyway there immersed in it I mean it is not\nFor them that's nothing different you just live the fantasy and the family fantasies whatever it is whatever whatever you say it is because you have a blank canvass\nThat's exactly how they think that's how they act what you're seeing here is social social media type activism taken to the streets that doesn't happen to be backed up by anything I posted it therefore it's real\nI say it therefore it's true\nDoesn't work that way you know in the real world right so overall when we look at the last two weeks and who knows what the vote will be this weekend I I I don't know I mean I haven't seen any a count yet um\nAnd I guess we we will see right and we will know when we come back in Sunday night Monday morning all I Know it was for the last two weeks of covering this uh there's not been an issue where there has been more passion since the election but I have not seen this type of unity\nIn the Republican Party and think about it think about what it would take I mean I I didn't think that you would see the unity and the Republican Party this soon and it's solid right now because I think they now see that\nWhatever their differences are with Donald Trump whatever ear or whatever irritates them about the the the president whatever they find unacceptable about the president and I'm Talking about the never Trump or is a lot of Republican conservative\nThey look at it and they finally have come home why because they've looked and they've said these

played a little bit of the Cory Booker thing had tiger Carson calling him\nA center Spartacus but the interesting thing is he is the one that came out the other day and said that it doesn't matter whether he's innocent or guilty that doesn't matter any more of the fact that there's so many questions which came from the allegations\nItself means that they should move on to an you know another right on another candidate a\nAlan Dershowitz responded to what Cory Booker said now Alan Dershowitz is a liberal\nBut he's an old school liberal\nYou know you think about it we talked about the old school liberal Camille paleo for example an old school or a ... you know liberal ... one of those who yeah but as as we did a few years ago said oh excuse me the whole transgender thing uh he left to better understand\nThat if you do this you're gonna have feminist soon you're going to be fighting feminist and the transgender activist because you can't have you can't have feminism\nA man can be a woman right if a man can be a woman if anybody can be a woman just I think men can be a woman by saying so feminism is doomed in you know she was one of the ones that first came out you know after after because we'd set of years ago but she also came out\nAnd and and stated that and so I really think that you know you look at the old school liberal she's one of them ... which is another one of them we may disagree on the role of a light like a John Adams and Thomas Jefferson the role of the centralized federal government the\nDebate that's been going on for over two hundred and forty years should it be big should it be more encompassing or should it be smaller\nStill though that debate encompasses all the rights in the bill of rights and the constitution\nIt doesn't reject in say freedom of speech is gone ... Second Amendment rights are are gone due process rights don't matter anymore a presumption of innocence doesn't matter because of our politics know the old school liberal didn't believe in a bigger\nCentralized government but they wanted\n... even with the big central government they still want it especially the bill of rights was sacred to them and it no longer is but here's what you're talking about Cory Booker standing doesn't matter whether it's innocent or whether he's guilty it's just the so many allegations that he needs to step down here's a response\nDancing professor that that's a science than it doesn't matter whether it's ... just\n... well it sounds very familiar when I was in college that's what they said about people who are accused of being communist yes as a matter of the yard and the guilty if somebody is accused me of being a communist\nAnd you angrily responded and said you're not then hey you don't have the temperament to have the job\nAnd it's just a job interview if you're getting fired for being a professor after forty years and what's the difference if you're innocent and guilty somebody said you're a communist this goes all the way back to the inquisition when they would call you in first and make you testify and then they present\nThe evidence look once you're accused of the most heinous crime imaginable it turns into a trial where you have due process here where the burden of proof is on the other side where the evidence has to be clear and convincing in America we don't allow people to destroy other people's reputations in careers\nBased on it for instance guilt the way the ACLU now says he is he'll use as we should presumed guilt not presume\nIs that for a hundred years to defending due process us exactly what they're saying so you were a liberal you have lived her life in a liberal world can go to Martha's Vineyard Keno liberals to them ever say look I don't agree with Kavanaugh hate Trump but I agree with you that due process is worth preserving other with also feel that way\nI found very very few of them for example today seven hundred and law professors signed a letter they asked me to sign that I refuse I wrote a dissent\nSaying he now no longer has the judicial temperament well can you imagine if this were a liberal who had been appointed by liberal president who had been accused and it would act and similarly I don't think a single one of those professors would have signed that letter they will fail the shoe on the other foot test\nSenator Booker why I like it no it's just that wrong this is all about partisanship is the opposite\nWas happening and if it was the Democrats who are putting up\nCandidate everybody would behaving the opposite way and so it is part isn't ship and I think the framers of our constitution never intended the confirmation process to look anything like I said great\nI ... and that's it I mean we we talk about the process you know it's it's telling that we're at this point instill at this point in fact heightened your you'll likely see the chaos heightened today and tomorrow\nUp until the main vote on so late Saturday or early Sunday Morning whenever it happens but we're at this point but it is all this chaos\nBefore\nThe actual vote and what is it that that matters it's only about the vote\nI mean this is further proof\nThat this was only about the delay delay it as long as you can in hopes an outside hope I guess that Kavanaugh would pull his own confirmation and withdraw his own confirmation and or the president would do it", "show_name": "America in the Morning with John Trout", "year": "2018", "city": "Johnson City", "day": "07"}
