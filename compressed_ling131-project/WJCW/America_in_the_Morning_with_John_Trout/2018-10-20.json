is that these three thousand or whatever number coming up from um under since so long to Guatemala through Mexico\nHave already given up their right to asylum because they're in independent countries in or out of their\nUm desperate situation as far as yeah it might it it it becomes an economic situation at that point but if they want to seek asylum they should be seeking it in in Mexico and then go into our embassy\nTo get proper immigration to the United states\nYeah but you know and I know that Mexico is not going to give them anything\nThat's that's a relevant\nIt's all relative to the fact that they're in that country and the the proper way for them to immigrate to the United states would be good who are misty and applied for immigration then but they're another country wants to enter that other country and they're out of their situation\nThey are no longer asylum seekers\nIf they wish to seek asylum it should be in that country not ours\n... that's a pretty good tank I like that it's an interesting take it's not going to work their roads have been ignored that idea but you're right they left the country so they don't they're not fleeing the same violence that they claim they were and uh\nIt would be nice if that was the case I like the caller I Can't think of his name was suggested that we should charge the country's or not charges but he just said charging one

bill it back to Mexico and build back a lot of them all of the concrete the progressive come through because they have an equal if not more um responsibility to take care of him and we do\nIn in you know look look you may you know you're making a great point how can how can I disagree with you that uh you know it's funny because asylum means you're threatened with violence or some other reason and once they're in another country and the way here is technical but and it's an interesting point\nIt technically throws it out the window there the argument goes out the window wants to end or

... what's your political philosophy would you describe yourself as a libertarian or oh I think you are Republican right\nOn the Republican because they're two political parties and that's how you engage in politics or in the United states drosophila ... a small L libertarian sure\nYeah tell our listeners 'cause you're a big supporter of the taxpayer protection pledge what does that\nWell it's something I created in Nineteen eighty five eighty six to help pass the tax reform act like sex\nAnd people are worried with Ronald Reagan wanted to reform taxes raise it reformed taxes that you know I take the rates down and broaden the base but there's always that danger when new reforms taxes when the dust settles\nYou'd have to go up because they've got like an up late thousand changes the tax code of sorry I asked when you add them altogether you pay more now a which is not what we wanted and that with President Reagan ones and uh he set up 'cause we tax bill back if I'd run it I said yes that's good\nI'd rather than the national ... before a good stuff and uh\nSo the pledge is a written you know what's happens the promise a if a if elected or I Will never raise taxes or it doesn't ... tax increase him before taxes you know reduce rates broadening the base\nYou know pay less than that but no net tax increase at the added altogether no tax increase and right now about Ninety percent of Republicans in the house and Senate naturally have taken that pledge kept it\nAh it sweat allowed us to defeat Obama's effort to raise about one point four trillion dollars in taxes uh back\nUh in two thousand elaborate he should have said oh to the ... the economy's going to collapse the government will collapse nothing but work if we don't raise taxes and the Republicans held allies had no listen we're not raise the taxes period we\nHave to reduce the growth of spending way than a under Obama to as one of the name of the spending twenty four percent federal government spending twenty four percent of the economy [noise] and that fell to twenty percent\nOr over a couple a years simply by limiting the growth of spending it while the economy grow all of that and said there's nothing radical about reducing taxes just got to\nNot spend quite so much and hold that for a number of years and you can bring to write down\nSo I think I Know the answer this question has any Democrat signed a pledge\nThey have a we get two kinds of people who are Democrats you sign a pledge a back in Nineteen Ninety four\nAh when the Republicans won the house the Senate there were two Democrats and the Senate and five Democrats in the house who had taken the pledge that tend to keep it [noise] and I'll switch parties after the election uh\nThat's when I was going to guess that I was gonna say yeah the ones who is that the Democrats assigned a we're switching or retiring I just had that funny feeling that if that is what it was yeah yeah I didn't want to be cynical but you're right\nIt's the biggest difference between the two parties there are Democrats who\nYou know won't spend money on that particular project that's possible but there are that the Democrats in Washington DC who will not raise your taxes when that she chats and\nThere and that's why I asked ... go ahead\nOh there are ... Republicans or you know there were a couple of publications\nEight or nine who didn't vote for the Trump a tax cut\n'em there's not a single Democrat voted for uh almost at Republican voted for uh and the ones who did vote\nAgainst it knew it was going to pass it just was this side of the other thing is I Wish that definitely a so that it's the central difference between the parties da da da da\nDa da da da da da di ... the two parties most completely\nAnd I was ... and that's why I was asking I wanted to say that's got to be one of the definition of things that the Republicans a general one limited government certainly as part of that is lower taxes and and it defines the two parties and it's important for people to know that\nA Grover has been a ... a kind enough to stay with us or for another segment and you can call in if you have any questions and I have more questions for him let me know what you think eight six six Ninety red eye eight six six nine of seven three three three nine Marcus they're filling in on read I read you\nThis my monthly adjustments down when it comes to us meat production year over year overall we're still\nLooking at a big increase in meat production from Eighteen to Nineteen\nWorld the agricultural outlook board chair Seth Meyers says some of the changes involved timing of production\nSo when you look at beef we reduced some production in late two thousand and Eighteen and move that into some additional production in two thousand and Nineteen\nAnd in terms of pork production\nAnd we look at slaughter pace and slaughter numbers and animal weights we actually made some not huge but notable production changes\nBy like be reducing two thousand Eighteen pork production which is expected to carry over into the following year ask for meat prices other than a one dollar increase for ... from the previous month prices were steers boilers in Turkey remain unchanged in October total exports year over year I made up\nIncluding an increase in pork exports from September we did increase our exports this month and a good size increased year over year as well\nA rod ... reporting for the U.S department of agriculture in Washington DC\nThe USDA report is sponsored by cynics road master XL premium highway diesel fuel and shell wrote\nDownload books with literally radio toll free ... movie red eye [noise]\n\nDrivers knee jerk service pilot flying J truck has gotten leading to your service centers in twenty four seven roadside assistance you want and we got\nWhat does it mean to the corner office well not a seat in the wheel of a new free ... and the prestige of the corner office takes on a whole new meaning to sleep designed to be ergonomics gash large LCD display controls at your fingertips fall to create a more comfortable functional workspace\nThat set you up for success to take a virtual tour of your next office space visit fried lighter dot com slash corner office that's free minor dot com slash corner office free liner\nRuns smart did you know the studies have shown that almost two and a half million truck drivers in the U.S have one or more serious health problems such as obesity diabetes heart disease even sleep disorders and our truck drivers lacked the same access to health that other Americans enjoy\nThe unfortunate result of these circumstances is that drivers are off and unable to get treatment in the early stages of disease\nMinor illnesses become severe leading to hospitalization and disability the driver then may lose their CDL and become unable to work this creates a downward spiral that leads to extreme financial hardship and possible unemployment\nGo to truckers fun dot org today and learn more about how you can contribute if you are someone inside the trucking industry may be a need\nBurnt ...

special guest is Grover Norquist president Americans for tax reform and if you have any questions about the tax code or anything related to that eight six six Ninety red eye\nAnd I have a question for him and uh you know I think yeah I have a feeling it's going to know my friend\nMy friend is Bruce ... years ago even before he ran for the Senate he proposed that we should do or attacks we should be able to do it on a postcard India I think you know the person he was a flat tax how do you feel about that just one flat tax and you do it on a ...\nWell before\nI moved to the United states I Lived in Massachusetts and that's where I grew up we have in Massachusetts a flat rate income tax about five and a quarter percent uh it's in the constitution a number of states have flat rate Illinois does\nA nine states have a flat ribs Iraq\nAnd uh what we find is if you are at a flat rate people think it's fair and they don't want to move away from it I I was always told as a kid everybody agrees whichever progressive graduated income tax or some people pay ten percent of the two percent you know state taxes\nA federal taxes you know go from Fifteen to almost forty percent or if you tax everyone at the same way\nIt keeps the tax rate low for everybody in Massachusetts five times the Democrats liberals have said let's go to a graduate attacks and\nDivide people into five or ten theloop syntax with your life [noise] and there's a very sophisticated discussion that went on TALK radio because it was a ... year one they'll raise taxes on the ...\nYear or two they'll come to me or the county kids will go you're on your own soccer because I've already had my right\nIt's your turn and they would over time like this one at a time and everyone's rights would end up higher and I think that is exactly what does happen in American history and other countries\nSo the best way to keep taxes low have one single rate spot and then when the government says I've got a great idea and you're all going to pay for it\nAnd people said you know what now were all listening tell us about this great idea where he's both a Obama President Obama and President Clinton got elected promising I Will never raise your taxes now I'm only going to raise taxes on them the top one to two percent said a\nBunch of one percent said Obama of course within the first year they raise gasoline taxes on everyone [noise] ah so the promises that somebody else is going to pay the taxes doesn't really last show the safest thing to do is to have a single rate to Texas people one time but one way\nIt is the toughest tax to raise [noise]\nI was thinking of another one of his ideas he Bruce or something you said that if this idea that they'd taken out slowly prevents revolution someone how to write a check for five thousand dollars of the end of the year or whatever it is if they really knew what they were saying it would be an up or do you agree with that assessment\nI not only agree with that I wrote that in the paper in my freshman year at Harvard and they like flunk me that they said\nYou know this does come from a conversation I had with the IRS I called my phone and said if they did if you didn't withhold taxes out of never lets paycheck every two weeks\nBut instead once a month we said send the check like the electric bill and Fonda or on April fifteenth said send the check the whole year and the ... is the IRS person I was talking to I interviewed for the the papers right he\nSaid there'd be a revolution [laughter] it's\nA no ... yeah I think if someone had a right and you know check five pounds a little more than twenty whatever there would be you'd have a new Tea Party right or any of these days with\nVery yeah it make it clear they actually pay no\nLet's go I promised a car to mark in Albuquerque New Mexico you're on with mark and with Grover Norquist\n[noise] think here Bruce ...
