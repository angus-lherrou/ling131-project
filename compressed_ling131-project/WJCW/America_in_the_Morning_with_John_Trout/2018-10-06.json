Manchin all deciding to approve the drug she's been\nCalling the Republican from Maine widely viewed as a critical out in the cabinet nominations came to the Senate floor and said allegations of

Republicans now appear to have at least the razor thin majority they will need to confirm judge Kavanaugh when the first Senate caster final vote Lindy Kenya washing\nCat and a federal judge blocked the Trump Administration replacing conditions on public safety grants to further it's cracked down on illegal immigration the judge also under the grant money be released the California sanctuary cities\nKnowledge of this otherwise so it wouldn't have happened that's I'm convinced why Dianne Feinstein waited until after the other background checks well we're\n... its own over the last couple of days that we have found out how the whole background check works with the Senate because of course it's something that we've never focused on before I what I've been surprised that the Republicans you know they came out and said that you know they didn't follow the protocol but they didn't fully explain it because when you fully explain it as you just did Eric when you when\nPeople understand that look there was a process\nThat ... that Dianne Feinstein could have followed yes that would have always kept because the claim\nFrom Dr Ford is well she just wanted to get a known and then you can do an investigation to find out if you find anything on it but I wanted to remain anonymous right well she could have actually got what she claimed she won it is very important for I think everybody to understand that there was a process to keep her name\nAnd have the FBI\nDo a background check to see if any of this was true\nWithout her name ever be known\nAnd Dianne Feinstein really said excuse my language to hell with that we're going to use is a politically and\nKnowing that linking it would make it public\nWhere she still claims today she didn't want to come forward right\nShe still claims that it is that today so if that was the case and I don't know whether that was the case I'm just looking at the different scenarios ... but if that was the case it was the Democrats that be trade who they thought\nWas a victim of sexual abuse they betrayed her which is why we said they didn't care about her claim that they never cared about her claim because if they truly cared about her claim and her wanting to keep it secret to keep her anonymity\nAnd could have followed the process that existed that they helped create with the Democrat majority in two thousand nine left to have a process yet for somebody to come forward keep their you know keep it quiet and still have a part of the confirmation process and and a part of the judgment\nOf why you would or would not want to confirm or the particular nominee\nBut Feinstein and the Democrats know that the only way to change those you know they were getting down to four\nOr five votes that's what this is all about to change any of those votes as the political pressure and the political pressure is built in the media\nAnd so you can't do it officially finance a Dianne Feinstein knew there was no way of doing this officially because it would never get to the media because Senate rules prohibited from getting to the media now we know why Lindsey Graham was so livid\nLast Thursday a week ago today this is what he was talking about\nViolating the process and the rule circumventing those rules and processes along the way this is what he was getting too because that now the puzzle comes together Feinstein new\nBy submitting this to the FBI early on as soon as she got it and it being part of the background check\nIt wouldn't have seen the light of day Dr Ford's name would not be known to anyone but her friends colleagues and family because that claim would not have still would not be substantiated because\nThey even with all of this they haven't substantiated anything except for the fact that she's making the claim and that means it wouldn't have left the Senate\nAh at all because it would have been apart as the rule states of that three oh to report that they cannot divulge any of the details from\nThat report again keep in mind if there is a criminal case against a nominee well that's public the people versus whoever that's\nPublic that would be no\nBut there but that's it's not the case when it's just a plain when someone's making a claim and there was no report or authorities involved in that claim at the time so\nIt's very clear why the Democrats chose this route now and didn't didn't want to go forward on the thirtieth you wait until after the vetting process the background checks are complete\nAnd then you leads to the media and let the media help you hopefully build that public pressure that political pressure to drive that those four or five votes in the Senate that were on the fence\nAnd now uh like I said today is going to be an interesting day I I wanted to leave earlier I said uh just just due to ours has shown repeated the rest of the day so I go home and go to sleep and wake up at seven o'clock because I won't just because I I I I Am\nAbsolutely are as interested as you could possibly be in wondering how the Democrats are going to try to solve this another week ... what are they thinking\nDid you know they are you know the audience are they are we got to be able to solve this in some way and so we know that we're going to hear the typical\nThings like well we didn't have enough time to actually look at this report a twenty four hours a isn't a is isn't a a a enough enough time well okay we believe that there's some cooperation here we disagree with the Republicans and we don't we believe further investigation is needed knowing that the Republicans\nAt\nThis moment are not going to break the protocol and the rules that the Democrats created in two thousand nine to all the irony or and and so\nI you know I don't know where that will do but I'm sure the Republicans have already said they've had to look at and say okay what different scenarios are out there when once released this I mean they know now the Democrats are going to the Democrats and Republicans\nBoth no you know what's in it and if the Republicans say look there's nothing here it's the same as it was last week we're going ahead with the vote I think that no matter what the Democrats say they should go on with the vote\nAnd even if he isn't confirmed then you make it an election issue delaying this another week is not going to change anything that we all know right now you you you did it once you go forward with it you have the votes Saturday if you don't have the votes than you make it an election issue\nInternally no doubt the pressure is going to be on those uh four or five people including mansion ah you know flake or who was shown you know clearly a weakness and uh what they were ... ... what what what they'll tell you on the left the ability to be thoughtful\nConsiderate but if you ever [laughter] ah I'm Sorry that was funny I Know I'm the but the but that's what will happen internally externally it will be about building the political pressure still in that and this is the narrative\nThis will be the narrative from here until ...\nWe did not have enough time there was not enough time the FBI did an interview enough people there's no way that could possibly know because they didn't even interview Kavanaugh or Ford well they have both of them on record as a matter of public record as to their claims each of them so\nAll of that is a you know is is the political part of it um but you're right Gary I think in terms of now going forward\nAre you the the the motion to invoke cloture was made yesterday or the cloture vote will happen friday a than they will er and if if they've got the headcount then\nThey're going to move forward with a vote which can happen as early as Saturday I suspect they will not want to waste one minute ah in in terms of getting in Saturday and getting that done if they believe they've got those votes\nEven at fifty because the veep can be fifty one the tie breaker then they're going to move on it\nThe the the majority leader will not waste any time and going\nForward and say what you will about Mitch McConnell and we've said plenty about 'em over the years but he has done since Trump has been president I think\nA a very decent job I don't know what grade I would give him a but certainly I think he's done a decent job across the board and bringing the party together on a number of things to get them done legislative\nThis rises above legislation because as we know those decisions made at the highest court Thirty years yeah\nThis is this is going this this is a big effect this huge acts the direction of the country and ...\nRight now that the majority leader\nAh along with corn and\nUh and and a number of others right now oh well maybe not right now but last night and and just an hour or two we'll be whipping those votes together and ... and and saying exactly what we just said this is too important to wait any longer\nEight six six Ninety read I one of the key

few of them for example today seven hundred law professors signed a letter and asked me to sign it I refused I wrote a dissent\nSaying he now no longer has the judicial temperament well can you imagine if this were a liberal who had been appointed by a liberal president who had been accused and it would act and similarly\nI don't think a single one of those professors would have signed that

agree and I hope that would be honest I have to say so I mean we defended Al Franken on the show I I don't like personally and I hate us politics but I think he got\nShot for the same region and them too yes he deserves me to find that you wrote a or you were quoted in a recent piece saying that and Julie sweating next lawyer may have a legal obligation to withdraw her previous statement what did you mean\nI've done some research now on it and there are ethical and moral rules that say that when you should have been an affidavit even to Congress and you need to learn that there are things in the affidavit that false\nYou have a continuing obligation to withdraw the affidavit you cannot allow an affidavit to remain on the record right if you have information suggesting is false any reasonable lawyer hearing her on TV says you can't any longer ex\nWhat's in that affidavit she has to be investigated\nIndependently of the background check criminal investigators\nTo see if she deliberately and willfully with or without the eight of anybody else made a decision just to frame somebody for something that he had nothing to do with the evidence to suggest they never knew each other that well here's a park they were operating in different circles\nIt wouldn't surprise me if an FBI investigation prove they never met each other and if that turns out to me the fact she belongs

changed I mean she changed the story herself and you have ... her attorney\nRepresenting her that presented and filed officially sworn state well after that sworn statement\nShe changes the story you have to withdraw that statement but you know what bothers me it's what the left has destroyed ... reality\nNo he was he just said there any reasonable lawyer ... and and as you pointed out to was the
