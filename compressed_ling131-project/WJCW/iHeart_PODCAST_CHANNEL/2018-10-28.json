with Terry overtime now from Megan Megan poor who does it can be on the program she's always with us here on this one segment\nTo come in on it we've been talking about cashing in on a lonely people and yes Megan it is a thing we've been talking about the loneliness economy that uh\nTook off in Japan in the eighties when the country's population began aging and so many\nYoung people in the aging in any in in Japan we're not taking care of the aging Japanese they were trying to make a living and make it and they add investments in the United states they had investments in uh in China they had investments in Australia New Zealand\nThey were all over the place in Japan was booming and making a lot of money and guess what grandpa\nMom and dad were not taking care of so there was some businesses that build themselves around the loneliness in Japan um which allowed\nOr their people to make their living by\nPaying attention to the agency you can rent some person to help grandma and grandpa we see that now with robots what's your take on the lonely ness that's going on and this loneliness economy making money on people being lonely\nI ... it's actually actually really interesting I don't\nThink that this is a isolated to Asia and in fact um they're finding that\nIn the United states people are reportedly be coming more and more lonely and in fact younger adults who are born between the mid Nineteen nineties and the early ... thousand\nScored higher on a loneliness a scale\nThan people who are Seventy two years and older and the United states so what that tells me is it's not just for the aging population I think they are a number of factors that are playing here I think one of them is of course the the increase in technology I mean for me Terry I live in a large city\nI can actually get much of what I Need done in a day without having to leave my home\nI can order my groceries on line I can order my supplies on line I can access the news on my TV I can I can interact with people via social media and not ever actually talked to anyone on the phone so I think you actually what we're seeing as we're seeing a shift\nWhere we're going to see a shift to people who are able to suddenly we're going to have hit on how to manage loneliness how did you stay connected in a very physical way\nWhile we are still ... utilizing all of this technology and I think that this is a growing industry um it it sounds really bad when it's ... it's ... somebody says something like oh well they're cashing in on loneliness but I think that that they didn't create a problem I think that technology has really caused us\nTo be you know isolated\nAnd what concerns me about this in particular when it comes to our political and community issues is that the more disconnected we feel carry the less likely we are going to be to relate with each other and to be able to discuss things with each other and I think that's why we're so polarized\nPolitically because we're able to say things about somebody because we are looking at them in there we don't know our name\nOn line and that's a good point the irony though is that in with robots we're supposed to have all of this connectivity\nAnd yet it is a robot so some people that want to hide out and and you mentioned those that you know you live in a big city and you can order everything in and you can hang out in your dad and your bathrobe and work or whatever um that's\nIsolating and yet they would say no it's not oh my goodness I'm connected I'm connected I can do a a a a talk a conference call with Singapore for example so I'm connected so it's kind of a funny irony in a way some people love robots other people on the human touch\nWell and especially since the solution seems to have stemmed from the problem\nThis solution of utilizing robots and artificial intelligence to\nDecrease someone's loneliness and increase their connectivity is actually it's kind of ironic on and it seems like we're we're kind of it's all cyclical here because I'm not real that's not real human connectivity I Am curious though Terry to see how this technology advances and how\nThe connection between artificial intelligence and human moves forward and and whether we're going to get to that point to where you don't know whether you're talking to a real like human or ... or a robot\nGood points I let's wrap it

America and make America great again rally we don't want to let people\nIs there a a racial discrepancy you're also I mean a is are there more black women who have heart disease or during pregnancy and delivery than than white women\nSo there's a ... there is a disparity and the disparities have to do with race particularly African American women who have about triple the death rate overall for maternal mortality\nAnd an increase in in ... vast mortality but also just access in prenatal care there's so many things that have to do with it that are both risk factors an age of the mother but also\nThings about our systems of care or lack there of\nThe truth you mentioned a couple of the possible reasons and diabetes obesity or what what what would you say\nWell I think it's clear that and we've known this for a long time as the older you are as a mother with a higher risk the pregnancy is and the higher risk the mother is for having underlying heart disease to start the pregnancy\nAnd so we're seeing older mothers we're seeing people who are having children at ages that really they didn't have them before\nAnd that is sort of that one of those high risk groups that we could which should look at there's been a rate of rise in the risk factors particularly obesity and diabetes which are powerful and are not necessarily screen for and treated during pregnancy it's one of the other things we've learned is that\nOverweight women can lose weight ... during a pregnancy and have a healthier baby and a healthier them but they have to be under the appropriate care\nIs that because women in the U.S are having babies later\n[noise] part of it is an older age of women in the U.S but many of these countries we're talking about Scandinavia and Great Britain and others\nUm that there was a quote a it in from the u._k. comment where they were looking at maternal mortality they said the actual lead the rate or risk of death of the ... pregnant father is no greater than the pregnant woman in the u._k. and we can't say that about the U. S.\nWow that's always that's interesting and that's yeah that's pretty ... and and why do you think that is their system compared to ours\nYou know their system of care that access to care every woman has a has a primary care doctor every woman is going to get the appropriate care that's not true in the U.S\nSo what should women do uh before they become pregnant particularly up there are obese or have diabetes\n[noise] well I think they should see either they're obey or their primary care doctor if they have one and two I have some preconception planting what does a healthy pregnancy look like what are my risk factors\nIf I'm really overweight and my ... you know in general we don't advise those women to have the same thirty pounds weight gain that to an individual who is normal weight would have\nTo what is it healthy pregnancy it looked like for me\nAnd then monitoring through the pregnancy to make sure that we identify those individuals who develop hypertension new hypertension during pregnancy or new diabetes during pregnancy\nAnd importantly in a slightly off topic but definitely related is individuals who during their pregnancy women who during pregnancy develop hypertension or diabetes even if it goes away after they deliver are at higher risk for heart attack threw out their entire life\nAnd so that marks a woman who failed distressed test a pregnancy and we need to watch or maybe they need to see a cardiologist maybe they need lifted lowering therapy or greater monitoring for their high blood pressure so pregnancy it's such an important time for women's health and babies health as well as her future heart health\nHow does pregnancy affect the heart\nTo a normal pregnancy are um the woman's blood volume increases I'm a by about a third so that means the heart has a lot of extra work um\nBlood pressure typically actually in a normal pregnancy goes down um think about the uterus where the baby it goes from a fist sized um Oregon too big enough to have a nine pound baby and so women actually have this ability to make new blood vessels and ... which\nAre so when they prove that they can do that that's a pretty healthy thing if they have a preterm birth or a baby that doesn't develop fully because they're placenta isn't healthy enough those are all markers of risk for that pregnancy but also future pregnancies and future heart disease and that women\nBased on the statistics that we talked about you suggested that maybe there are some things that we ought to be doing differently\n[noise] well I think that preconception planning is really good talking to what are the health risk but I had that I can correct before I even get pregnant what medications and my on what medication show and I if I'm On medication is what should I switched to\nI think making sure that women recognize that heart disease but they are at risk for heart disease and so\nThat they pay attention to symptoms I mean one of the areas and it it was a sizable number of the individuals who suffered a heart attack after um a birth in this study that was reference at the beginning of the segment\nUm had a condition called spontaneous coronary artery deception this is an area of interest of mine this happens and people with healthy hearts with healthy vessels with no cholesterol or anything it is I'm so there's nothing to prevent it but he got to recognize the symptoms right away\nSo you get in and get the appropriate treatment so it's multi level it's pre it during and making sure that we address the issues that arise and then making sure that everyone on the team including the patient knows what the signs and symptoms are heart disease I think\nThat's a great point because it's been a while it's been a while since I was pregnant but I only thing the only thing that I thought about before we got pregnant was to start taking folic acid that was the only ... planning that we did it all\nAnd even as someone who's got some heart issues I didn't even think about heart health when it came to being one of the things I should be watching out for when I was pregnant exactly [laughter]\nSo the big issues are obesity and the increase in rates of diabetes and women having children when they're older would you suggest that it ... if you're thinking about having children maybe ought to think about it early on\nWell that's great to say in theory in general healthier pregnancy is they're going to be in in a woman's twenties on the other hand the reality is um women find partners later or whatever so I Would say to that older woman the woman who is thirty or thirty five and coming into their first pregnancy\nIs that is even paying more attention because that's also the age in which we're starting to see more risk factors\nAnd and so I Would probably be healthier to have pregnancy at younger ages yes but the reality is we're going to have older mothers and continue to do so so making sure those older mothers are as healthy as can be All right we've\nBeen talking about heart health in pregnancy with cardiologist heart specialist Dr Sharon ... short break\nWhen we come back we'll look at later in a woman's

gallstones blocking the two leading out of the gall bladder can result in the build up a bio which is a frequent cause of inflation\nOther causes of an inflamed gall bladder can include problems with the bile duct itself tumors which can sometimes be cancerous and even certain infections here to discuss gall bladder diseases Mayo Clinic gastroenterologist Tucker Brett Peterson welcome to the program Dr Peterson is nice to meet you\nThank you very much it's a pleasure to be here with you tell us a little bit about the gall bladder where it is what it does\nWell the gall bladder is a recipient for ... coming out of the liver during periods of fasting and it expands and and the bio made by the liver which is being made all day long and stored there and concentrated a lot of water

in the hospital for two weeks they would be a big incision remembered the picture of Lyndon Baines Johnson showing his goal butter scar and it seems to me like people who had had their goal butter I
