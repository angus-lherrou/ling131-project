England actually worse so taken aback by the practice of dropping a live lobster into a boiling pot that they came up with a device called the crust\nJust done which uses an electric current to Don and pain asleep painless way kill the shellfish such an lobsters right before they drop them into the into the pot so you don't necessarily have to give the marijuana you may just go ahead and got him to death [laughter]\nOkay isn't that cruel and unusual to have been ready for some\nIt's less than point zero three seconds\nOkay and what would they say when I'm oh we kill a frog or what would you say if I'm a ... crab with regard to crabs I felt funny just by the way about what about stone that crap but that was a little bit hey humorous and an article what do you say about um\nA beef what do you say about um anything that we have to kill to eat I mean it becomes kind of absurd and the and doesn't it uh to\nTo to go to such extremes to make sure that an animal feels no pain at all or a plant field no pain now are we going to go to this idea of well broccoli broccoli were eating a lot of broccoli kale but when it's uprooted it can feel I mean there were any search stages aren't we a little\nBit but I Do think that again the consumer that free market will decide so if you want something that's I think we killed or ethically source then you will go to that on a horse\nShout out to

turns out this deep brain stimulation is now approved by the FDA for these disorders now in the case of Roger fresh what he has a little bit different from this movement disorder\nYou know he is a one of the concert master's with the Minnesota Orchestra\nWho is a master at\nPlaying the violin now I suspect because he practiced so much probably hours and hours every day that he developed what is called more used dependent tremor so somehow his brain circuits unlikely because of how much he plays the violin develop an abnormal circuitry in his brain\nOscillation as what we call it which is basically\nManifested asked tremor in his in his hand kind of an overused syndrome kinda yes exactly you know you probably heard of um like in golfers certain golfers because they're so good to have what's called hips yes where right when they're ready to part they very easy whole\nTheir muscles tense up and they have a movement problem\nAnd they miss it's similar to that yes you're on ... kinda yeah yes I have yet from her with us and so\nWhen he developed as she didn't know that there was anything that he could do he went to variety of physicians but there was really nothing that was offered that when he came to see me he had his violin with him he walked in I saw him\nAnd I like my other patients Parkinson's disease essential tremor dystonia where I can pretty much tell what they have right away I thought he looked perfectly normal and then he said well wait and so he then proceeded to take out his island\nWhich by the way it's a very very expensive violent that he brought to my office and he started to play this music and I'm not a musician I don't fully understand but when he plates or notes you could hear of I brought all you know a lot of shaking I didn't know he didn't mean to do that\nBut he said no he's trying to hold a note perfectly still but he can't do it because he's he's having this this tremor only when he played certain kinds of notes\nAnd so um we presented him to our neuro modulation committee because this is an unusual kind of situation and he was approved by our neuro modulation committee to undergo this surgery which at that point we were not hundred percent sure that we could help them\nAnd so in the operating room typically for the deep brain stimulation surgery I Do the surgery with a patient awake particularly in situations like this because I'm I don't know beforehand whether or not\nWe're going to be able to treat this and we need to know whether or not the tremor goes away with the stimulus really need to be awake during surgery yes and and in this case was unique because not only did he have to be awake but we had to have the violin he had to play the violin has we have to have the violent because that's the only time that the tremor comes out [noise]\nSo how does a deep brain stimulation work but I got to ask you though you say the patient is awake but you got to put a hole in the school has to get this needle and they're not or wait for that when you drill about no no they they are away for that you you do it at our local yes\nSo um you know just like a dentist would you know if it came to know about the teeth and then the same type of anesthetic that I use that number's up the skin and throw a tiny little hole in the skull but by the way this surgery is incredibly precise\nIt's done using a what's called a stereotype to head frame and we get an MRI so even though we don't\nSee inside um you know like through an incision we actually can see the brain through the MRI and we have the ability to target very very precisely or within any area of the brain\nSo how did you know where you want her to put this needle yes so so you there's a little place or just can't play violin and you stick the needle in there\nYes actually this is um this is one area of research that we've been doing research on in the mail neural engineering laboratories exactly\nWhat you just asked so how does the brain simulation work and we have developed several uh technologies to figure out how it works and in particular were very excited about technology called the ... system that we have now tested\nThat shows that it appears that deep brain stimulation can release different kinds of neural chemicals in the brain that stops abnormal hospitalizations or these are a isolationist that ultimately cause the tremor and devious appears to release those chemicals\nUm that causes that kind of tremor and furthermore we now know we have a marvelous map of the brain circuitry we pretty much know all of the\nVarious circuits that's causing this type of trauma and in this case it's coming from an area of the brain called the thalamus witches center of the brain deep that's what it's called the deep brain stimulation and more specifically\nCalled the Wii I Am and travel center media is part of the ...\nNow this case is unique because that's the usual area for essential tremor when we did this surgery on that area he got you know pretty good from our control but it wasn't perfect\nAnd the interesting aspect that's also Ken Burns picked up on is that we had to then at a second lead that is not so unusual so we needed to find that\nAnd he okay is it in the movie is that that was great\nWell I mean you know let me be clear does this old brain surgery editor for it has inherent risk and I of course have to discuss all of this with Mr fresh and all of my patients that it has risks such as causing a bleed hemorrhage stroke and so forth so we have to take those risks\nBut in this case the potential benefit far outweighed in our opinion\nThe risks that he'd talk for his quality of life it was a deal breaker yes absolutely you know the amount of a trauma that Mr fresh has actually would be considered you know not so much in the sense that you and I think if we had it it would not affect our life\nBut for him because he's a concert master this was actually devastating\nAnd now the other interesting thing is he has a remote Chanel where he can turn these electrodes on or off if he does not using that movie's not playing the violin right\nThat is correct so he can ... and and as soon as he turns it off all of his term or comes back now yeah he demonstrates in the movie and now the other interesting thing is is when we added a second lead in another area just in front of the the I Am\nWhat we discovered is his tremor control actually is almost super physiologic meaning that you know everybody you and I under certain conditions would have a little bit of tremor\nPhysiologic tremor well interestingly he can now hold them no almost\nSuperhuman meaning that he can play is that violence [noise] even better than before what fair [laughter] that is wonderful [laughter] All right we've been talking about the deep brain stimulation without pretend to lead to a short break when\nWe come back we're going to get a very exciting update on a story was

William\n[noise]\nWe'll come back to the Mayo Clinic radio I'm Dr Tom jibes and I'm Tracy McCray ... we just discussed with a neurosurgeon Dr Kimberly Mayo Clinic researchers have made a truly exciting breakthrough in the treatment of spinal cord injuries through electrical\nStimulation on an injured spinal cord and intense physical therapy the first patient implanted with this device of Mayo Clinic is no strong enough to be able to stand and make movements that are resembling steps\nThe patient is actually able to exert some control over his legs again legs that were completely paralyzed\nThe latest update on this research was recently published in nature medicine\nWe've heard about this exciting advances from the nearest surgeons perspective but an equally important part is a role played by physical medicine and rehabilitation and here to tell us about it is after Christians out and making guilt doctors always the director of Mayo clinic's assistive and restored of technology laboratory\nAnd Meghan is a physical therapist and Dr ... lab welcome both of you to the program thanks for having us\nYou're good to have you both this must be exciting for both of you to to work on this project who's most excited\n[laughter] I think Megan so yeah and\nYou know being a clinician and having experience in working at the population for fourteen Fifteen Years now it's really exciting to be able to finally have something that we can tell her patients are patients families that we're making progress towards\nUm recovery for those who have such a devastating injury has a complete spinal cord injuries it it's really life changing for me as a professional but also the experience you know the ... on the horizon is really really amazing [noise]\nDid you know for a while but this was coming something like this would ultimately become available\nYou know I had been kind of following the literature um that had been coming out from a UCLA climbers from UCLA as well as the University of Toledo and I was aware of this type of intervention and what it was available to the individuals backward injuries and what their options were\nWhich were really promising but I think this paper and in our our results really kind of her home run compared to where it started\nAnd so you know we knew there was a possibility but what was the level of ability and what was the level of recovery\nWas really beyond my belief at that point so it's really amazing to see the progress we've made to this point anything to add doctors out\nBut I guess I Would like to just add that I mean I think it's exciting that that we at Mayo get to have a team that that is able to replicate this work and push it forward and and now really excited because we have this great team together and the possibilities are sort of endless now for ... for what we can do next so\nSo what role does those therapy play and rehabilitation play in this whole process and how important is that we know about the ... we know about the simulation um but didn't this patient also have a significant amount of therapy but for the implant was ever answered\nAnd so on the part of the trial is for the first five to six months we did go therapy alone and just worked on the type of activities that were attacked as addictive banning and that being in balance training which is why we continued with that after the surgery\nBut we really wanted to do the physical therapy intense really just to find out what kind of recovery as possible and just the therapy alone\nUm this individual that um where we've published in the in the paper had very little physical therapy after the injury\nI'm three years prior other than the traditional conventional compensatory strategies um so it wasn't to the level of well we introduced in rehab program at this trial so he did five to six months of intense therapy with you know maybe minor improvements in terms of his endurance and his conditioning but no recovery below the level of injury\nSo how do you what sort of physical therapy do you do on someone whose legs were\nParalyzed our goal was to regain Bushnell activation and movement which means it's time to be able to intently move their legs or activate their muscle okay so you\nWere trying to get him to be able to move something that wouldn't move credit which you can relax\nAnd we were we using strategies that we use with other individuals with neurologic conditions on to try to engage the dinner muscular activity of the legs and the trunk by loading them and by going through the repetition though the flux and extension moments of the legs so\nIt's a standard of care that we typically fall for people who have had some motor and since you activation but it's not the standard of care for people who have a complete paralysis injury such as these individuals so\nYou were trying to strengthen the muscles that you knew the patient would need to walk\n[noise] partially yes\nI remind you that when there's a spinal cord injury there is no damage to the muscles the damages and the spinal cord injury or the atrophy atrophy definitely so our our purpose was tried to ... century information up through the nervous system by loading the legs\nAnd providing tactile cues and movements of the legs that can be sent up through the to the central nervous system to then try to make the connection in the nerve\nTo then send them order out put to the muscles\nSo does this type of therapy continue indefinitely for the patient\nSo we quickly realized that you know you can't have an epidural electrical stimulation without physical therapy we feel they're both in are going to this type of recovery so we know it's really important\nSo you can put the employer the end but that it won't do any good if you don't have the therapy\nWe that's our theory that has yet to be proven as well but um [noise] we know physical therapy itself wasn't the answer so we had the implant and we added the therapy in the nation together and we got the miraculous results\nUm what goes on from here is a little tricky\nBecause number one like I said this is not the standard of care for someone who has a completely I'm a severe spinal cord injury so to be able to send that individual out to the clinic now without the standard of care will be tricky because our clinicians don't know how to manage to me later in conjunction with a therapy which we feels really really valuable\nSo we're at the point with this trial where we're really trying to integrate the home exercise program by identifying activities have been really proven safe impossible for the individual to do on their own at home with minimal assisted devices\nAnd then let them do that stuff at home on their own um and then and then it it's our job to figure out you know who is this appropriate when is it appropriate if it is appropriate and how to be implemented into standard of care", "show_name": "iHeart PODCAST
