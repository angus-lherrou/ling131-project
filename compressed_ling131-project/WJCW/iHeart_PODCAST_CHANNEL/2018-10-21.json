making we've had a robust conversation with Jennifer and with Chris from these dangerous sex offenders\nBeing held under civil commitment in prison after they served their time I think uh that shouldn't be and yet\nThere are those psychologist that say if the crime is that a pet a feeling you can never be rehabilitated so these men and some women the in fact are in prison like facilities with barbed wire cells guards watched hours trying to get therapy or how do you come down on this issue\nYou know this one was really hard and and it was really interesting because when I started law school I I you know obviously I I was a mother and and\nI previously I thought well anyone who is a pedophile needs to go to jail and I would love for them to go to jail for the rest of their life and I would hear stories about bad things happening to pet if you file in on in prison and I would think yes that's how it's supposed to do that as justice\nAnd then I started studying criminal unconstitutional law\nThe cynically procedure a lot and I started noticing that there were numerous exemptions for sex offenders on that we have a constitution which is our umbrella law that governs the entire country um and they are there for a reason because obviously are counting father saw a lot of infringement on human rights natural write\n'em when they left their across the country they're monarchy\nWhat I didn't understand is over and over and over again that there were exemption for these constitutional protection when it came to pedophilia and um I Do a lot of research on this I think it's ... it's based in and this is what a lot of psychologists believe it's based on the fact that we find\nPedophilia and sex offenders absolutely abhorrent in this country especially as we should write it isn't a born behavior and harm on our most innocent back then um the the issue that we had is at what point does that just got\nOn turn into something that is just a I'm a ... it's trying to say she I'm kind of revenge appetite at the American culture has\n... rather than actually addressing the issue and there is a problem here Terry whether you believe that these people deserve it or not the problem that we have is this program the system is broken the when we look at rates of recidivism Craig sample only five point three percent\nA registered sex offenders are going to go back and get re arrested for sex crime\nYes that's very low by the way\nIt's very very low five point three percent is a very low number especially compared to other recidivism rate correct\nAnd and the reason that we have you you want to look at the purpose behind the sex registry it is to protect the public from sex offenders when we look at that rate of recidivism we say okay wait a second so then if we are putting them on a national registered\nRegistry to protect them or to protect the public and only five point three percent are actually we arrested for sex crimes and and we're actually just\nPutting a large group of people out there in the open for something that that they aren't going to necessarily go back and redo\nNot only that we're finding that most on sex offenses actually and most pedophilia is are targeting family and friends not strangers so it's actually happening within a family or within a close relationship so again this national registry is not helping any of those family or friends because they're close to them on the money and I\nFound interesting about this in in this particular I'm a treatment center a they deem sexual assault rape and child molestation all as violent\nAnd once you get the violent as a category with that offender then is Adam sander absolutely has a mental abnormality\nOr a personality disorder and then from there they assume likely to repeat but it doesn't address a person who says I'm just over sex with too much just solve their own or um I can be a real rehabilitated through\nThese means it never does it sort of keeps you they're right and we're down to about a minute so\nRight exactly and this is the issue that we've been running up against is that it's not actually addressing the issue and here's the other scary thing Terry when we look at the most common age to be charged with a sex offense in this country it's fourteen years old ... ... well\nAll right let's leave it there what are you got and change

say when you eat the whole food in your ... your body does have to do a little work to digest it so you have kind of a a ... broken down some argue while you absorb more nutrients where other people say well maybe you should eat more whole foods because\nJust like every other muscle in your body needs a little work out too\nWell and it's kind of a catchall term because juicing can mean the juices extracted out and there's all this fiber stuff left behind or\n... you could put it all in a blender mhm just blended up like crazy and there's nothing left behind it all goes into a glass\nOf ... so you mean when you Jews you lose the fiber fiber is kind of a sudden but at the bottom and don't drink that no it's not even in the glass if you do juicing you put it through the machine and then all that fiber in polls and stuff is left behind whereas I put everything in a blender\nMhm and just with it up my kid even with carrots in there\nHe likes them because they're sweet well and I think there and I think that's a really good point because there are some vegetables that adds some sweet and and now with ... and depending what your ... taste preferences are\nIf you know some people want to eat more greens or keep the calorie content of their smoothies down so adding vegetables as a nice way but some people don't necessarily like the better of the greens are some of the vegetables so pairing that with a sweeter fruit like pineapple ... is a really a nice ...\nIt's a different shy there oh okay you're an ideal combination of fruits and vegetables I mean it it it can you make such a thing can you make a an ideal\nConcoction or does a really\nWell and I think the idea would be in in maybe the eye of the beholder um and maybe what their their needs are now somebody say we're trying to get more iron in their diet I'm and absorb more iron I might say with your leafy greens combine it with something that's going to have more vitamin C. likes to address or the pineapple\nUm that's a nice combination because you have the vitamin C. helping some of the Iranians are from that\nIsn't so does juicing help you lose weight I mean did you do tend to get full when you do this and eat less\nWell and I think it it probably depends how it's made and and so\nLike anything what goes into it and the portion matter\nAnd so if it were said just just the juice the pulp extracted and you could drink a lot of juice and a lot of calories if there were many many fruits and they're now granted it's nutritious but um there it is a significant amount of calories\nUm and even if it were a whole foods maybe there is a chance that it could be extra calories for you and so you just want to keep that in mind and that's for some people are finding the combination of the fruit and the vegetables lower than the calorie content of the overall beverage\nUm and then I think just the idea of just keeping the keeping the portion check you might want to share it with somebody mhm\nSo some of the recipes actually call for a little bit of added sugar but that's not a good idea\nAnd it wherever we can cut out added sugar in our diet is probably a good idea because we're eating far too much of it so any chance you can cut back or cut it out it's a good idea and with the natural sweetness of fruit and some vegetables it's probably not necessary at\nThe secret is an avocado which makes them really really smooths sounds weird can't taste of the crowd when you do it or what is it easier is really right bananas\nBecause that makes it sweeter and it makes it very smooth mhm so

other chronic conditions or are undergoing chemotherapy are more likely to have complications\nNow complications include bronchitis pneumonia and even heart problems Dr ... has a vaccine for influenza is one of the best defense as we have and that some people don't get the flu vaccine because I think it can cause of flu\nThe flu vaccine is what's called a dead the vaccine you can't get the flu from a flu shot\nFlu mist while safe for most people contains a week informative virus so people with certain conditions you get a shot in dead everyone who can get it should get it ... it takes two weeks for the vaccine work so get your flu shot and now and in other News Let's talk about\nThe guts faking hiccups is pretty easy but getting rid of the real ones can be difficult Dr Mark Larson a Mayo Clinic gastroenterologist says hiccups are an involuntary contraction of the diaphragm followed like closure of the vocal chords that leads to the characteristics downed\nThat you hear Dr Larson says most take up triggers are associated with temporary bloating of the stomach from something like overeating or rapidly eating\nGulping down big drinks especially carbonated one can also got tickets even being suddenly excited or scared can cause that repetitive involuntary contraction of the diaphragm\nLarsen says most people who experience hiccups will do so for only a very short period of time usually a less than a minute or two rarely hiccups can last for days or even months and that may be a clue that there is an underlying medical condition\nAs for hosting the heck I Dr Larson suggest simple remedies that just holding your breath gurgling or simply sipping cold water you should do something that interrupt that activity of the diaphragm\nAn airplane use that word I'm Vivian Williams [noise]\nWelcome back to the Mayo Clinic radio I'm Dr Tom shot and I'm tracing upgrade poly cystic kidney disease or ... is an inherited disorder were clusters of cis developed within the kidney [noise] this is cause the good news due in large and lose function over time the other sister\n... and that is their non cancerous or their their stocks they're filled with fluid ... you can also causes to develop and other parts of your body mainly deliver\nThe disease can cause serious complications as well including high blood pressure and kidney failure the FDA recently approved the drug toll of opt in to up to ... and it's for patients with poly cystic kidney disease\nMayo Clinic was instrumental and the research for this drug and will be one of the only a few places to initially off of the treatment is part of its clinical practice and here to discuss as male clinic know for all just Dr fraud should be welcome to the program Dr ... thank you for having me doctors should be\nGreat to have you here and it sounds like a real advance of for people who have posted the kidney disease absolutely tell us a little bit about the condition itself\nSo both the kidney disease um there's two types there's one which was called up his ... and the other one is to someone dominant than the rivers to the inheritance pattern but first the inheritance or the first one that excessive uh sushi affects the trial the children and then ... ... ... a labor issues as well\nBut the most common type which we will talk more about the auto zone dominant which affects mostly the adults\nAre the most common inherited kidney disease and as you mentioned so these patients actually are born with some food food sucks\nA so called good but they don't cause any major issues or early on uh mostly high blood pressure hypertension sometimes that can cause bleeding and then later on or you could grow and kind of a damaged the kidney and the kidney failure\nSo one kind that the ... the one that's probably less common can affect you as a child and the more common type a will affect you as an adult but they're both called poly cystic indices exactly how common\nTo go home and dominant as a as I mentioned the most common so it's one in five hundred to ... thousand in the population so there's about six hundred thousand patients with ... or eighty became the those on the gum and type in the United states and about twelve to Fifteen million worldwide\nAnd what happens if patients aren't treated I mean if it starts off shut wrecking your kidneys and then what happens\nYeah so for decades the patients who ah have some history so they've seen their great grandparents their parents going through uh the the disease they've never imagined that there's a kind of something to slow down the disease progression or the good from growing\nSo for many decades the only thing would be treating high blood pressure\nMaking sure you're healthy and then once you reach the end stage renal disease where you need either die houses are transplantation\nA that's usually the the treatment so there was no treatment basically\nAnd for the past decade and a half about Fifteen Years or so here at Mayo Clinic a lot of tourists in his lab resented tourists kind of found what the basis of a distance from uh the troops to this just to be growing and feelings with a with fluids\nOr and found that if we target are the ... so that's the receptors at the source hormone act upon on the kidney\nIf you block that receptor\nThen you need to lower what's it called again the so it's a molecule that drives the ... the tries to this for a an growing and ... with us so we found if we block that then we can slow down to the progression\nAnd then we we took that over to clinical trials and then found that this is the medication that would slow down to disease progression\nSo it's not a cure but it slows down or the disease or from so it's kind of delays the need for a kidney transplant or dialysis an earlier age and hopefully that gain more years of good kidney function with the treatment\nEven more than what previously would have been a line of treatment which would be try to control your high blood pressure still do that but this medication now can push off any potential problems years decades what\nSo yes so treating high blood pressure is very very important for these patients and there has been some clinical trials did not show that it's going to the late too much the progression so we needed some kind of treatment that would really slow down so for about ten is the first uh treatments for this disease\nUh so usually the best is to start the patients on these are on this medication early on so when they're kidney function is to normal but they can use are still making these says so if we started early on they have to be on it for several years for decades probably twenty twenty Thirty years and they would gain hopefully\nSeveral years back and usually we stay if someone is progressing fast usually every four years of treatment or would have been a the the need for that just by one year\nOr so if you're on it for Twenty years it's probably an extra four or five years or there's not a big a long long studies because it's a chronic disease that need many years to study but so far this is kind of the expectation that's how it's gonna it's gonna do neither does\nLoud fantastic [laughter] so how\nDo most patients find out that they have this disease and have you ever seen a case where there wasn't a family history\nA so mostly are the majority of the patients would have someone in the family that has this disease and they've been so familiar with that usually we diagnosed by screening with an ultrasound\nOr so you actually look at the kidneys and see this is exactly so we look at the ... and we have kind of criteria is and how many sewers and depending on the age because the ... the older you are the more cyst you'd have\nA so to diagnose first we do the screening by ultrasound and then we can do as you can order him or not to look more at a kind of the the kidney soup and how we get the kidney and then we can ... um\nGive a prognosis or how the patient would do depending on how big that just are and if the patient wasn't aware that they had a family history of poly cystic disease what might be their first symptoms what might lead them to come in and see", "show_name": "iHeart PODCAST CHANNEL", "year": "2018", "city": "Johnson City", "day": "21"}
