you indulge a certain behavior weather and it's an addiction right or or or an illness\nOn the worst day get whether it's with um a a human or a robot and unfortunately many times what they find with a special especially sexual violence\nIn predator behavior is that it's never enough\nRight when he first is pornography first it might be um uh something small then they have to get bigger and bigger

the government's job and what they're actually able to do is to protect the public they don't get to legislate morality now they're\nThey're afforded a substantial amount of deference when it comes to passing these kinds of laws so they might end up prevailing but I think that they do have an issue is typically targeting this type of business considering that it's going to be very hard Terry to prove that\nThis is harming the public well\nBut but then you just talked out of the other side of your mouth with regard to repetitive behavior over and over and over again where there is looking at

think it's and you also know that age as you mentioned it's a risk factor for breast cancer so long ago women live that is going to cause that increase to be more perceptive ... and then earlier diagnosis of breast cancer with mammography\nAre helping with the diagnosis of very early type such as ductal carcinoma in sight to\nIt'd be fair to say that in addition to more and more women seemingly being diagnosed with breast cancer you also seem to have people who are having successful treatments and I'm going to use really big finger quotes an easier time of going through their cancer diagnosis and treatment and I would suppose it's for the very same reason\nAbsolutely in terms of treatment of breast cancer we have seen dramatic improvements thanks to the amazing work the research work being done by breast cancer research specialist a male and throughout the world we have seen huge advances in treatment a breast cancer and as a result it it's\nNot just in terms of treatment in terms of longevity but also treatment of symptom management and care for patients at the end of life and all of that so that's kind of what we're seeing in terms of improved outcomes a yes\nOr isn't the uh the fact that women are told that they wanted the chance of getting breast cancer isn't it a little bit misleading because that's only true if you live long enough right sure if you're a forty year old woman that your chances of getting breast cancer are worth more than fifty or something like\nThat that's exactly right you know I think that as we live longer because ages a risk factor are their likelihood of developing breast cancer increases as we get older\nAnd so that's why when we talk about screening you know there's a whole controversy and we will come to that in a little bit about do we do mammograms or not\nA younger women have less likelihood of developing breast cancer but as we get older the likelihood increase it so the longer you left you hear more about a breast cancer diagnosis and one of the things we also see is that as we live longer one of the age dependent kind of cancers are though the slower growing kinds of cancers more treatable with good outcomes\nFor it before we talk about the different tests and ... and the current guidelines or to ask you about breast self exams because it seems like\nWe were told women were told at one time that every month they ought to check their breasts and weather in the shower the top and then a few years ago the word came out that really women shouldn't even try to do with their breath because of his ... where where do you stay in\nThe United states friend itself this task force did come up with a recommendation that breast self exams are not necessarily clinical breast exam and unnecessary and\nSome of this is based on research that was conducted in Shanghai, China where they kind of looked at women who had had regular breast exams and another group that had it and they found that maybe there wasn't much of a difference however\nWe do know that there are women who come in who have self detected cancer\nOr that one not picked up even on a screening mammogram that was done in the recent past them a self awareness is what we call it now is being familiar with your breast that if you noticed a change in ... when you open yourself and you felt something get it checked out\nSo self awareness is something that is very important and we do encourage our women to to be self aware\nAnd it's not just about women it's for every individual being familiar about their bodies if something changes go seek health and really therefore we strongly do encourage breast self awareness\nOr a good to talk about the current guidelines for mammograms because there's some controversy there to\nSell the screening mammogram a recommendations very in fact even by institutions or a different group so the United states Brenda services taskforce recommends that women start ... screening mammography at age fifty\nAnd then you can do by email which is every other year and that for women from forty to forty nine\nYou discuss with your health care provider and then decide if you want to do the mammogram\nAnd the American Cancer Society a came up with a recommendation start screening at age forty five\nI'm Howard National Conference of cancer networks that starts reading at age forty\nYou know male clinic we've kind of looked at all of these data and we believe and working together as an institution one male we have a breath standards council which incorporates are all our various sites\nAnd what we decided looking at the data was it would be reasonable to start screening at age forty a with a recommendation again and courage educate our patients what are the benefits what they read the benefits of early detection compared to the down side you know the downside of mammography of course you go in if you're called back for additional testing those things idea related to that\nThere is at risk of false positives there is also the risk of false negative so false positives as you go in as a finding you do a biopsy and it's been nine well that was a lot of anxiety for the patient the other is\nA false negative which is you know women with dance brash which is on member Graham the tissues look very dense can miss a cancer so there is that limitation of false negatives and then the whole controversy about over diagnosis of breast cancer all we've picking cancer so early\nThat perhaps is not going to cause harm and lifetime off that woman so these are all information patients need to be aware of before they make their decision but I Will say this is when we talk about this this is for the average risk population a woman who does not have a family history and the other risk factors\nFor women who are at higher risk so if you have a family history or you have a gene mutation like a ... one or two gene mutation or women who have received radiation to the chest because of the Hodgkin's or a diseases in the past they are women considered elevated risk where the screening guidelines on very different\nThe November grandmothers there's still the gold standard but it's not perfect particularly when it comes to women would spread so what other test or you have ... for women like to\nThank you for asking that you know we this has been an area that is required a lot of work a radiology has been doing a lot of research to try and say what are the new advances\nSome of the tests that are caused or that or the whole group is called supplemental screened the question really is does the woman benefit from supplemental screening in addition to mammography if her mammogram showed dense fresh\nAnd supplemental screening one of the first things is telling the synthesis of this is a three D. mammogram\nUh where you do the to the top down side to side views of the breath but why do you do that you take several sections of imaging through the breath so it gives us a little more detail the biggest advantage of treaty mammography is the decrease in recalls rate which means being called back\nIt's a very big difference when I look at a mammogram and versus that 'til synthesis one it's like I'm looking at two different patients it's amazing so even the patient can tell the difference absolutely if I can tell the difference it's a big deal that's all right and what a fence\nSo treaty is now getting to be routine for women in general and regular mammograms and now with the coming three D. the next ... important uh advancement as molecular breast imaging and us initiated that the Bible studies at Mayo Clinic\nA colleague Dr Deborah roads and Dr Michael O'Connor with radiology a nuclear physicist is kind of work to create to bring this to our practice and what it is is\nA tiny does a radio isotope is given intravenously and that outlines the breast tissues in terms of its a functional image of the breast and basically highlights areas of high blood flow and therefore hyped up take off the radioactive material and therefore can very clearly identify cancers\nAnd women but dense fresh and you know we generally say when your screener thousand women with mammography you pick up about four cancers\nWhen you add to almost synthesis it's adds another one to three cancers but thousand women with molecular breast imaging it adds about another eight to nine cancers but thousand women so that's definitely something that uh to be considered for women with then suppressed\nAnd then the next justice more like as I Am magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the breast\nMRI can pick up a lot more so about Thirteen fourteen cancers but thousand women but it's a being highly sensitive the big concern is that it causes a whole lot of false positives and also the cost of the test and so\nAm I right off the breast as a supplemental screening for women at very high risk and we have very clear guidelines on who should be pursuing MRI in addition to ...\nAll right so if you have ... the alternative to ... and beyond molecular breast emerging and him are\nHard we've been talking about breast cancer screening an early

supports the way to be upper body and it provides flexibility promotions like bending and pushed it\nTo my favorite things to do with it yeah all those moving parts though can also mean trouble almost anyone who experiences low back pain at one time or another might agree with that\nAnd it's one of the most common causes of disability in America luckily you can take measures to treat and even prevent low back pain here to discuss is physical medicine and rehabilitation specialist Dr Ralph gay welcome to the program Dr Gates nice to meet you\nThank you glad to be here to get good to have you on the program so it is interesting isn't it that uh this is so I'm an eight out of ten people will have back pain at some point during their lives is the leading cause of disability for men over the age of forty by what is the problem with the low back\nOf the problem is that we're all aging as part of it but low back pain concerns people of almost all ages we see significant low back pain in adolescents\nAnd young people are the most common age group for discrimination is between the ages of thirty in fifty we're seeing a lot more people who are living longer and trying to be active so many more people who have spinal to know says\nI'll tell us what that means ... says it's mental illness was to nose which means narrowing and you can have to notice of many structures in your body to notice of your arteries that go to your heart\n... doses of the spine has to do with the canal that the nerves go through and there's a main canal it goes down through the middle and there's two small at each level between\nThe vertebrae or they're too small canals cold frame and and they can become narrower wars to nose to swell the common spinal ... is to notice of the main canal\nThat can cause pain when you stand in walk because that can now get smaller at that time and you get painting your buttocks are legs typically and you sit down and goes way so that's a common cause of of broken leg pain and sometimes back pain as well\nAnd more elderly patients and then we all are aging and her spine ages are spine starts aging on of microscopic level by our late teen years by the time we hit our twenties we start seeing just ... and ...\nAnd it just gradually ages as we get older we don't know exactly why this is not something where it's a bad gene\nWe do know that a lot of it is genetically determined based on twin studies where we can look at people who have identical DNA is primarily done in northern European countries like Denmark where the contract people throughout through life\nBut a lot of this is genetically determined and we're living longer and wanting to be more active and show we see back pain throughout the course of life\nSo is this a skeletal problem because of that ... Steiner is that in muscle I always think my low back pain in the muscle problem but it doesn't sound like it is\nWell that's a very good question and it's one that we don't have a very clear answer to\nWhen you look at studies that try to isolate what is causing back pain as far as a specific to issue is it a joint does a muscle or is it a nerve we can't do that very well and some of the studies would suggest that no more than maybe ten to Fifteen Percent of the time can we isolate a structure\nThat we know is causing the person's pain most often it's multi factorial if you have an arthritic joined in your back and it's aggravated the muscles get tight\nAnd they become painful were very good at at\nFinding nerve problems pinch nerves or injured nerves but when it when we get out of the realm of the nerve to issue into\nThe muscular skeletal to issue as we say the bones in the joints and discs were not very good at isolating exactly where the pain is coming from and it's very difficult to do that clinically there are a few of the issues that we can\nUh within reason say is are causing pain such as the small joints in the low back that often are affected by arthritis\nUp but there are other structures that we know cause pain such as the desk and we have no way of going into numbing it up improving it that's where the pain is coming from it's all on clinical impression\nIf you get back pain after a weekend of of the heavy lifting or a lot of golf or whatever uh and it's not bad enough or hasn't lasted a long enough to you for you to think that you ought to go see the position of what's the best thing to do for\nThe common recommendation or the current recommendation is that we don't go see a doctor right away as you've uh incinerated are the best thing to do\nIs a rest possibly take some ibuprofen or Tylenol and you can use ice or heat there's no science to tell us which works\nBetter yeah that was the question we all we all want to ask what do I use I sure hate and there is no right answer huh\nNo we we uh we depend on extrapolating from\nA joint problems are joint injuries such a sprained ankles where we theoretically believe that we not theoretically I'll say we believe that\nThat uh if we put ice on it to reduce inflammation from an injury well that's not necessarily going to help the low back because the the cold from the ice doesn't get deep enough to affect the physiology down around this fine and the same way with the heat the heat doesn't get down there far enough\nAnd so it's probably affecting the nerves in the muscles that it can penetrate more than anything else and affecting the pain that way certainly ice or heat can reduce or some pain and it can help with muscle spouse some of your having spasm\nBut I Can't tell you that there's a write in a wrong application of ice and heat in that situation if it's a cute I Would go with the ice\nFirst I Am I at first and when you say ... what do you mean by rescue domain laid out her bed no arrest\nHas relative rest and we know that if you lay in bed for three days it's going to be more damaging than helpful", "year": "2018", "show_name": "iHeart PODCAST CHANNEL", "city": "Johnson City", "day": "14"}
