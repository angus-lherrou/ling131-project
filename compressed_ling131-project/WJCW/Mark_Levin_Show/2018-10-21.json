{"month": "10", "state": "TN", "station": "WJCW", "content": "So I mean it was great to report today some really positive things US Economy are the most competitive again in the world and we weren't that for the last decade huge accomplishment um we had a great discussion with a lean Parker of the women are winning and the trauma economy\nAnd how awesome is that I mean that's really really wonderful stuff\nYou know I Hope that they come out to vote I Hope they come out the vote to continue you know this this economic expansion that we have to continue the policies of President Trump so you know we continue to build this economy\nYou know we had a discussion and this is like a scary scary scary stuff with professor Ruben from Emory University and you know he's just published a piece\nOn say fifty seven percent of the\nDemocrats prefer socialism our young people in droves in droves in droves\nAre bracing socialism you don't have to go far I mean right here in our own country uh candidates for Congress like Alexandria\nOcasio Cortez up in New York City of course on the presidential side Bernie Saunders and and and I think rich whatever Bernie was advocating for should he run again and he probably will but there's going to be a number of others running they're going to even be further to the left\nOf burning and twenty sixteen I don't know how you could become the Democrat\nCandidate for president unless you keep one helping socialism I mean it's it's it's a bizarre thing it's surreal but that is the world that we're living in and it's incredibly dangerous very very very dangerous\nFor us for our children ... grandchildren and their children we got to stop this thing we got to turn it around we got to get our young people in bracing economic freedom\nBut you know Neal I mean there's a way to do that to everyone listening right now here here's here's your assignment right number one vote number to vote\nNumber three vote Republican\nNot one Democrat vote Republican that's your chance do we stop this forward momentum and give us another four years or two years depending on the boat\nTo get your act together as we move forward you know I Do find you're just standing again that we've been on we've gone down this road and you're right Neal unless you're left a Bernie Sanders Bernie\nYou know we we know Bernie well we've had we know that we talked about him for a long time [laughter] you know I don't really want to give up you know a puppy for everybody and free Broadway tickets and all this\nBut everyone's farther left the Bernie right now I mean Bernie was a moderate compared to what's going on right now and you're listening to Spartacus out of a New Jersey are you know Booker of courses Spartacus and and you see the the the ridiculous in is\nThat that we're dealing with right now in in terms of the schools we don't teach the reality of capitalism versus socialism we'd only been on they don't even understand in in terms of schools you know how that were Republican not as great democracy\nWhich would be a little scary because then the mob would rule and by the way California New York in Illinois would decide completely who's going to be anything in the country so they don't even understand why the electoral college was put in as a stopgap\nSo that scares me Neal and and the first thing we have to do bar and anything else that we're talking about we can have this conversation over the next six months when which we will\nBut we don't vote if everyone listening right now does not get out and vote and get their friends to vote and their friends friends to boat I'm taking that real seriously this is as important as it was to get Trump into office that was the start\nBut it will end in a very bad way if we don't keep control the house and we don't keep control of the Senate and we must keep the executive and then we have four more years to put up more of a roadblock to this insane environment that we're dealing in right now\nYeah it's um you know I mean there's a there's a tremendous amount of state I mean we are a show that promotes American ingenuity and in the promote American risk taking and\nThose who sit around the kitchen table who are thinking about making investments in themselves and their businesses and you know launching whatever that might be and for the first time in a long time\nThere are being encouraged they're being ... encouraged to just put themselves out there you know to take that risk a are inventors I mean they're out there they're they're doing whatever they can they're they're borrowing money either they're taking it from wherever they can cause they feel confident\nYou see it in all the numbers and you see it amongst all the demographics that African Americans Latinos women everybody's out there putting themselves after you you see new business startups you see entrepreneurial was among the rice\nAnd that could all come to a halt and it would be so devastating for our people it really would be I mean people who are dreaming about their futures and they have this vision about their families about how good it could be they could have the rug pulled out from them so fast so fast rich\nWe got to prevent that\nUnfortunately though although we've had an incredible discussion today we're out of time but don't worry we're going to be back again

a lot of people don't realize when you're cooking if you have something on high or even between medium and high you are probably pass the combustion point of most oils and so if you're cooking and you have some oil and it's starting to smoke a little bit that means it it's very close to his combustion point you need to turn\nDown with just a bit about uh about a smoke detectors Smith lambs things like that what's the best advice that you can get people in those\nCountries won't fire department like remind everybody to ... smoke alarms make sure they're working\nYou need to check on the back of the smoke alarm and make sure that it's not over ten years old and if it isn't for ten years old you need to replace it with a new one preferred Lee won that as a photo electric alarm with a long life batteries in it that way it'll last you a long time you don't have to worry about changing those batteries out\nNow is going to ask you about the the new ones that are coming out and that's that's actually prefer that because the battery does last is there anything that people need to check on those ... how long are those usually good for the new news do\nA lot of the new smoke alarms with a long life battery we still suggest that you test them every month and that way your family is really familiar with what they found like and they will know what the founders if there is a real fire and that way you can also practice every once in a while and that way the kids know and everybody in your home will know\nThe ... new homes are constructed with our ... Schmidt detectors in them if you ... do you suggest that you actually have a ... should there be one in every room minimum\n[noise] or with modern code there are smoke alarms inside every veteran also

conversation with Doreen Lancaster\n... registered nurse with a ballot health with the health resources center in Johnson City we're talking about the new location of the health resources that are services offered there and the topic of belly fat\nOr ... registered nurse with ... hills at the Johnson City medical centers health resources center we're going to be talking about uh health resources center some changes there and also the subject of belly fat\nGreen thank you for taking a few moments up to chat with us or talked me a little bit about the health resources centers some new changes into the new inclusion pleasing Johnson City\nOkay well thank you very much for having me on the new location for the Johnson City health resources center is now at the wellness center\nA two hundred med tech parkway and we've moved our location to serve the community and a more efficient way we'll reach a more vast demographic as individuals\nUm of course we still have our location at the um\nKingsport mall um our hours of operation for both offices are Monday through Saturday from eight AM to sixteen him and we know that the health resources center is as a community source for screening and important health information\nOn the H RCs herbal staffed with a experience registered nurses\nAnd our other healthcare professional such as our dietitian\nAnd some of the services that we offer to our our community members of our daily blood pressure checks a health screenings ah we assess folks with smoking cessation\nOr diabetes self management classes chronic disease management classes we often will have physicians that will lecture for us and scares me we do physician referrals\nAnd we also offer one on one a console was registered nurses I'm\nIn addition we also offer free a sharp a boxes that individuals can pick up and drop off\nAnd oftentimes people don't realize this but we're out in the community many times I'm speaking at a public events or more visible at health fairs so if a an individual is like to seek us out ah for public speaking they can do so\nMuch more for a lot of years had new\nCorrect that's correct so we moved our location in June\nOkay so the little five months ago in Johnson City we should point out correct you mentioned that she used to have to be richer broader constituency\nCorrected that demographic of individuals and you don't have to be um a wellness member in order to come to the office to seek our services I wanted to point that out\nOf the ones who were traveling with a marine Lancaster reforming health resources sooner the location in Johnson City is a cool kid will see a woman ... took a we're talking about some changes there also an upcoming class\nBilly ... talking about ... to him why we should be concerned about it\nOkay we're very excited about this class uh it will take place at the Johnson City a health resources center on November thirteenth from one to two PM\nAnd basically um we're focused in on this because how many times do we look in the mirror and we see what's the equivalent to a spare tire right around our middle and we say how in the world did it get there but more importantly how can I get it off\nAs one of the hardest places to lose but\nIt is but I'm more important than just looks wise 'cause oftentimes worst society based on how we're looking um but what we're doing here is we're examining this belly fat and it's not just limited to the extra layer of patting that's located just below the skin or this up to ten years that\nThat's the fact that we can pinch that's Ninety percent of our fat\nBut what we delve into more specifically in this class is the dangerous layer of visceral fat\nThat's the type of fat deep within the abdominal cavity that surrounds our internal organs we can't see it but it really heightens our health risks um and that's why we should be concerned about it that's my next point is um\nThat belly fat can do more than just make it harder for us to zip up our genes right\nResearch actually indicates that there are number of uh numerous health risk consequences that can be just as harmful for your heart as say increased blood pressure and smoking\nBut in addition you ever hear the expression on your eyes or the window to yourself yes but your waist may offer key insights into the health of your heart\nSo no matter what our body shape a is access that we know is it good generally for our health but there really is a clear distinction between you might say settled bags on your hips versus ballooning bally's these are not equivalent\nSit when it comes to body fat location does count and each year there's new evidence that shows that this outline deep within your abdominal cavity puts you at great risk for health consequences\nYou mentioned before how how does that exactly taught him\nOkay so actually heart disease is a big risk factor um about six hundred and ten thousand people die of heart disease in the U.S every year that's one in every four deaths heart disease is actually the leading cause of death for men and women\nSo when we talk about this belly fat in class we talk about how this excess amount of sat produces substances would get into more specifics\nIn class that can actually raise your blood pressure\nIt can negatively also good and bad cholesterol levels and impair the body's ability to utilize insulin well which puts them at risk for\nType two diabetes which then puts them at a higher risk for cardiovascular disease stroke and other serious health consequences\nSounds like a domino effect does\nIt most certainly is so we know that there are risks associated that women having a waste measurement more than thirty five inches and then more than forty inches\nFrom

constitutional sects mark Meckler from convention of states this year with details\nWhoever wins control of Congress next month likely will do so with a very slim majority I Will that affect the legislatures ability to govern Andy ... of the club for growth is here with a real story\nThe national debt has hit another new high should we be concerned airing Boehm of reason magazine talks with Brian read all of the Manhattan Institute\nAnd Democrats are approaching the mid term elections with very different strategies in urban and rural districts Dr ... from the center for vision and values that grows City College has an American radio journal commentary\nTime looming Henry and welcome to American radio journal the constitution of the United states\nCan be changed by amendment or via a convention of states since Congress will probably not reform itself the convention route is more likely to yield results\nMark Meckler is president and founder of convention of the states and convention of states action is here to explain how a convention would work and why it is needed mark welcome to American radio journal mark when we\nTalk about a convention of states it's probably a process that most Americans are not familiar with so tell us what is a convention of states\nYeah you're right it's something we've never done before in our history it's found in article five of the United States Constitution it was literally put there two days before the end of the convention and Seventeen eight seven and it's put their this idea of the state's getting together and convention put there\nFor the very purpose of pushing back against federal overreach and what it is is a process whereby two thirds of the states now thirty four states can get together colic convention get together and convention and discuss ideas\nFor restraining federal overreach and specifically the application we're pursuing right now which has already been passed in twelve states calls for\nPhysical restraints on the federal government term limits on the federal government that would include Congress the courts and the bureaucracy and ultimately I think the most important scope and jurisdiction restraints\nAre you finding that the current system the way that it is structured mark particularly with Congress with a lack of term limits and no real limits on power are we finding that this isn't working as well as it did in the early days of the republic\nOf the real reason is is needed is then you referred to structurally broken the structure of government in the United states of America so the structure was set up correctly I think it worked beautifully for the first hundred years and then we started to break that structure\nSo we now need structural reforms and the only way to get structural reforms is by calling a convention and imposing a structural reforms one great example is terminal and it's simply use to be imposed by people people rotated in office they didn't serve for thirty thirty five years in Congress or in the Senate\nAnd so we didn't need term limits now we do need term was when the founders created the Supreme Court for example the Supreme Court\nThe justices average age of appointment was forty seven average life expectancy was fifty four they didn't expect jurors to serve Thirty years on the United States Supreme court so we've broken the system in some pretty fundamental ways that need to be repaired structurally those things aren't going to be repaired by elections\nWhat about the process by which we have mended the constitution numerous times throughout the centuries starting with the bill of rights where you go amendment by amendment is that just to laborious process to try to get this type of systemic change that you're talking about\nWell I don't think it's that it's so much more laborious the issue is what we're looking at is controlling the federal government if you look at the process\nThe the other process for proposing amendments amendments have to be proposed by Congress so we're talking about is Congress needs its wings clipped Congress needs balanced budget imposed on it Congress needs term limits imposed on it they will never propose those sorts of evidence they would take two thirds of both houses to propose it\nTry to imagine a time when two thirds of both houses of Congress propose a balanced budget amendment term limits that's just not going to happen\nOr they haven't even been able to balance the budget in exile in decades let alone propose it so we need this convention of states in order to bring about this type of change that is necessary at this point in our history mark one concern that has raised the as we do have as I mentioned earlier that bill of rights and there is a concern that a convention of states\nCould go rogue and maybe erodes some of the God given rights that are protected by our constitution how would you protect against that\nWell first of all the convention is called according to resolutions passed by the states all states have to pass the same resolutions those resolutions preclude any discussion frankly up anything in the bill of rights they literally cannot even be discussed\nWhen you get in convention all the delegations are controlled by the states that sent them to states limit what they can and can't talk about\nToday we need to remember there are thirty three states with both houses controlled by Republicans every delegate that comes is controlled by their legislature so if they even started to try to get out of bounds they could be stopped by their states and ultimately\nThe founders provided the protection which was it takes three quarters of all states are thirty eight states to ratify anything you can do the math I run the math on every single women ever been proposed to me you can't find an amendment that would limit our liberties that could be ratified and even close to thirty eight states\nLet's talk a little bit more about process you touched upon it earlier and the number of states that is needed tell us how many we have you've mentioned how many we need and where do we stand in the process of getting to\nThe critical mass that would allow this convention of states to occur\nSo it takes thirty four states are two thirds of the states to call a convention so far twelve states have done that so we're just over one third of the way they are which is extraordinary people said it was impossible to get that far we've gotten that far already\nSo it takes thirty four to get into convention in\nConvention it takes twenty six states to pass a proposed amendment out of convention important to remember when you're in a convention the only thing I can mention can do is propose amendments so people get all scared about getting into convention it's merely a place where people alternately make suggestions\nAnd then it takes thirty eight states to ratify anything that comes out of convention I think we're well on our way I think that one third mark is a pretty extraordinary landmark\nWe have passed and another Nineteen states in one house or the other you have to get both houses in a concurrent session so I think we're well on her when I think we should expect to see some pretty extraordinary progress in twenty Nineteen\nMark if you go back in history and I realize that unfortunately it's not being taught at least to the degree to shoot in many schools these days but tell us a little bit about the founding of the republic didn't the state's create the federal government and the other way around\nAnd you look I think that's the history that's really important in the power pyramid was the state's created the federal government the state's essentially were to retain sovereignty they ... they were to have brought on ... powers the federal government was had to have limited any new Merida empowers it's now been reverse\nBecause of the rulings of the Supreme Court and really importantly in regard to the commerce clause the federal government can pretty much do anything it wants to do constitutionally and this is a big problem and\nAnd so we need to reverse that power pyramid take the power away from DC make it so DC isn't so important I Would add one more thing there's so much conflict and strife in this country right now politically I don't like it I don't think anybody likes it\nWith the way you reduce that strife is you quit making centralized decisions you take the power away from the federal government give it back to the people in the states let them make the decisions at home we won't see these huge national fights anymore\nWe have been talking with mark Meckler who is the president and founder of convention of states and convince estates action somewhere else just a little bit about convention stage organization where can folks also go on the Web if they want to learn more and get involved in the fight\nSure the project was founded just about five years ago\nAnd it was founded to take power away from DC give it back to the people people can read about it get involved at convention estates dot com it's supported by literally virtually every\nMajor conservative figure in the United states that's commented on Sean Hannity\nMark Levin Senator Tom Coburn Senator Jim demand lots of senators are fast and Rubio they understand that Washington DC isn't working in the way to fix that his take the power away from DC and get it back to the people that folks want to be involved in that they can do that a convention estates dot com\nMark Meckler from convention of states mark thank you for being here\nGood to be with you thanks for having me\nAndy Roth at the club for growth are keeping an eye on all these congressional races we have going on around the country as well as US Senate races Andy\nGood to have you here I think family alum\nAndy as we've talked about many times Republicans currently control both the U.S Senate and the U.S house of representatives\nThe Senate seems to be headed more in the Republican direction but let's talk today about the house right now can you give us an overview as to how many seats\nDemocrats would have to gain and where do they stand in achieving that goal\nThe Republicans are in charge of the house it appears that they are going to lose seats President Trump claims that there will be a red wave that will counteract that\nAnd to to be honest with you we are kind of seen some something of a red wave but the damn wave was so big\nTo do something about their blanket prohibition on marijuana and I want you to think about this for a second can your bank now uh do business with the uh the banking Canada you go cash a check or write a

be safe all model of the ... I'll describe it very briefly\nResidents of earthquake and get permission to buy marijuana it's not like\nHow do you how do you do that how do you get permission you\nBasically fill out a forum for the government that says I'd like to buy marijuana and they approve your thing and then you go to a pharmacy now this is as a\nHabit that they ... uh legalize it re criminalize now they have a list of everybody who's bar there aren't\nToo and yeah and that's why some liberty minded activists sim would refuse I mean many people in California refuse to get that card because they don't want to be on that\nList say rather by on the black market ... be that'd be listed in some government agency okay president Donald Trump announcing another wave of judicial nominees most notably an openly gay conservative apparently Patrick boom a day\nAs it turns out the ah both the senior and junior senators from California are\nBigots rampant anti gay bigots ten because they're they're opposing a Mr ... nomination and he's also a like a minority I think he's like Filipino or something like that yeah it just goes to show you that of course ideology is the most important thing on the court\nFor so many people and\nThe ideology of this man is conservative or conservative area and right and that's why he's vehemently opposed by the Democrats\nIt's like it's like what they call the national organization organization for women which is really the national organization for liberal women likewise the walk away and the me too movement those\nOnly apply to when conservatives are the aggressors or the apparently or potentially guilty party\nConvenient weapons to yield against favorite opponents but I Want to say this there are three I think just judges going on in the Ninth Circuit court of appeals and apparently there had been talk of a deal made me where\nI'm the liberals would get a pack and then a couple of packs for and and that is now out by the wayside apparently um the Democrats didn't even attend the most recent Judiciary Committee\nOr hearings to to to move on judges and Trump is moving ahead or not just with these appeal had a right or does have a record pace of very rapid pace yes\nAnd uh of course you didn't you didn't really listen to the explanations of Dianne Feinstein and Kamala Harris to a gay\nOr a nominee to the to the court because they said they were not consulted prior to their nominations and us they are opposing them so you know you've got to read the press releases she died before\nYou think about that just for a second and imagine the hubris involved in other words they've said that they haven't even evaluated whether this person is maybe the best person in the universe for the job simply because they weren't consulted a they're not going to go ahead um it seems to be fantastic for people who are in open\nSort of hot talking or any way against the executive branch with him they would ask them to consult\nI think it's clear that at this point it appears clear that the Republicans will likely hold the Senate which means we'll have waves and waves of judicial nominees already\nDonald Trump has done the impossible eastern Mitch McConnell into where hero for Republicans because of the ... through aggressively including in in a summer session which is rare for the Senate he has steward it through a really\nMore judicial and point men's than than any president\nOn you'll save Americans the movement\nOn the judicial front has dipped well into the libertarian as well in terms of the who who the who the candidates are that we might like to see I'm not for the ideologically pure libertarian but for those sort of politically active libertarian and so uh that's all good news for liberty generally I think\nSo Scott let's move on how about New York prosecutors suing to stop a misconduct watchdog what is this about\nWell to nobody likes to be a looked after to see if they're doing a good job you know or the police always reject these accountability types of commissions and the prosecutors do too and prosecutors have\nAh probably more power than any other official I can think of in terms of the power versus the oversight right and the charge somebody with a serious crime up to and including a capital offense a and prosecutors are are almost never a disciplined for their misconduct and they do engage in\nSimply like all human beings to engage in misconduct right whether it's through a a carelessness or active malfeasance or malice as malicious Ross or ... M and\nUnfortunately that's a real big void in terms of our system of checks and balances and almost sign this bill this was actually one of those a good piece of legislation I think are\nPut into effect and he had a lot of pressure from the left or this was a you know you remember his campaign against ms Nixon um issues punishing him if there's a few punishing him from the left and I think it's a very effective blows in terms of why aren't you doing you know picking up the low hanging fruit for helping out of\nThese you know the criminally charged in our in our state and so that's what they did or didn't establish a commission to review complaints of prosecutorial abuse the prosecutors are having none of it they do not want oversight they don't want their questions\nOr excuse me their judgments questions and a and they're saying there's no one knew\nWhat Scott doesn't this present constitutional problems much like the special counsel Robert Mueller who becomes in ... in that sense of fourth branch of government that has power over the other three is a truly constitutional to appoint someone like this\nTo the commission doesn't actually stand is judge jury and executioner over prosecution over prosecute tours it it delivers findings and then people can act on those findings and I think that\nUm if the uh state Supreme Court does find that there are constitutional problems and they just exercise those portions of this legislation that do present constitutional difficulty because the people in New York\nAnd in every state in this country need more effective\nUh oversight over these prosecutors\nOkay thank you Scott makes them this program liberty nation radio plus liberty nation dot coms oh podcast the uprising hosted by Scott at me and Lisa gay daughter are

other and we're having those spring conversations in our locker room about the things that are\nFacing our society and I think it's a healthy thing I think it's I think it's an amazingly American thing um and I are if it's all it's it's interesting Everytime I go into a locker room and talk with a guy at a different perspective\nAnd that's why I Love football so much was that I wasn't a Walker right next to a guy from South central Los Angeles from a nowhere world Georgia from you know my on my cell phone artist from Iowa City in West Texas you know at the city both our rural part of a of the state\nSo getting to meet these people\nGetting to um to know all these guys from all over the country\nReally it was one of the ... one of the most the best things I can say about football and wanted it provided for me as I outlook in\nBeing able to see the lens and being able to see life um throughout different guys eyes is I think of something spectacular and I've I'm sure some of our listeners probably feel the same way about um some of the group of guys that they're with\nYeah so it is so ... what you're saying it's a microcosm of of America\nNo you know everyone always says melting pot and I always I always say mosaic\nAnd then we all yeah\nWe use flash it all together and it works and and there's nowhere else in the\n... and in society where it has to work like the armed forces um about when you started talking about teams a lot of similarities come up and whether their sports teams military games whatever that that co you shouldn't have to happen not it has to work for for it to be successful\nAnd a year you hit the nail on the head it's just a it's a mosaic of America and I think that's what makes football so great is because we are in a homogeneous population we're we're\nSpread out were different colors creates religions everything but that's what makes a great and and that's where I was what made it fun to be a part of and still be a part of\n... it's just like the military in that respect you know here's the thing my biggest borough undermines saddle\nNow with all of this as people aside from the tack to the gym a constitutional right to do certain things in this country\nBut the fact that the rhetoric people talking about football players like they're spoiled brats like they're launching dummies yeah you know and here's the thing very two people can play professional football now that's for sure\nPlayers are well educated or they were tired\nIncredibly hard your entire lives to get where they're at the ... come along hanging challenges a physical ailments you name it they confronted ... overcome it in their successful and players do a lot more than just playing football once a week\nI mean so many players around in the community I giving their personal time they're either a financial resources are you yourself you you've been on us so we're right\nOh yeah that's a I and I got to be honest with you when they had something I'll never forget and and and you you you hit the\nNail on the head is this how active our guys are in the community and how we got the PA are trying to help facilitate those guys you know
