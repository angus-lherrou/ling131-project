Lee in her first statement to the committee ms Kaiser\nHer lifelong girlfriends stated through council that quote simply put ms Kaiser does not know Mr Kavanaugh and she has no recollection of ever being at a party are gathering where he was present with or without Dr Ford\nQuote unquote in a subsequent statement to the committee through counseling as Kaiser said that quote the simple I'm I'm changeable truth is that she is unable to corroborate Dr Ford's allegations because she has no recollection of the incident in question\n\nMore over Dr Ford testify that are friendly Lynn apparently

testified that doctor that actually with a judge Kavanaugh or mark judge turned up the music in the bedroom so that the people there's could not hear her screen\n\nShe testified that after the incident she ran into the bathroom lock the door and heard them going downstairs but she maintain that she could not hear the conversation with others when they got downstairs instead she testified
