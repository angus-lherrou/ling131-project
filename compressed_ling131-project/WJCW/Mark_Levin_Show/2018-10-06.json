cw Johnson City for Brazil [noise]\nWell the chiefs after eight twenty six yard hunt return by\nTrip price they\nComplete the rare one yard drive [laughter]\nYou don't see that very often a one yard drive and it's a ... thirty eight yard field goal by Walker to make it the dos and walk or to make it three to nothing Daniel Boone running away from volunteer and the second quarter twenty eight to nothing Daniel Boone leading that one\nHere it's three to nothing in favor of Cherokee the kick off by the way went out of bounds crack it took it at their own thirty five\nAs they want to keep it away from the kick return or for the pioneer rocket hands it off to join her and he gets a yard and that's it from the thirty five to thirty six it'll be second down and nine\nTo carry seven yards for Iran killed joiner again Daniel Boone twenty eight volunteer nothing early in the second quarter at Churchill\nSo boon on their way crooked down three to nothing here with ten thirty six to go here in the second quarter [noise]\nAnd they're going to spot it at the forty wanted to be a gain of a yard for court me who kept it and it will be second down and nine Courtney thirty two yards on nine carries from his quarterback position it'll be second in nine at the forty one yard line\nCherokee in their own territory with seven and a half minutes to go in the first time\nSeven to three\nOn top three receivers to the left now\nAnd here's Courtney looking that way is going to set up a little screen passing complete as that went through the hands of counter Smith some of these so far the Cherokee receivers almost look like they're short arming the catch is\nNot really extending their arms out completely in the hands\nAnd now we have another flag down I Believe could be a sideline warning\nAgainst the pioneers [noise]\nSo it will be a sideline warning against the pioneers there first so that incomplete pass makes its third down in nine Courtney not being helped out buyers receivers very much as one of seven for Seventeen yard\n\n... three of eight for forty two yards on the other side for the pioneers [noise]\n\nSo it'll be thirty nine cheap set their own forty one yard line\nSome of the execution they just haven't\nDone the fundamental so far back to throw is\nCourtney sets up an ice cream to the fifty to the forty five the forty ... thirty five to thirty down the outcome strength prize to the twenty five to twenty and he's finally got to be rolled down at the pioneer twenty yard line [noise]\nThat passed the price it was really a wheel route out of the backfield by price and he hit him on the dead run\nAt midfield and he was on his way all the way down to the rocket twenty yard line\n\nSo that is going to be eight thirty nine yard gain on that little we'll route to price on the past from court me and so Cherokee threatening again is there'll be it's a crack at twenty yard line with six fifty nine left to go here in the first half and the pioneers leading by the score of seven to three\nSo again that pass\nGood for thirty nine yards from Courtney to Trent price\n\nOn a quick little we'll route on the right side over there\nAnd so Courtney now\nIs to of eight for fifty six yards after that passed a price\nFirst down Cherokee you have to crack at twenty yard line moving right to life\nThreatening again as they are back in the rocket red zone\nSo far only been able to come up with is a field goal pioneers took their last possession sixty five yards on the Dr Daniel Boone leads thirty four to nothing over volunteer in the second quarter and Churchill\nAlright cheap spurs down\nYears Courtney keeping and he has hammered down at the sixteen yard line by prince collie a flag is down on the play as Courtney kept it on the read option\nAnd runs it down to the sixteen for again of four but we'll see what the penalty will be\n\nAnd sue let's see what is going to be holding against the chiefs holding against Cherokee\n\nThe referee when he makes a call instead of staying somewhat on the hash mark or toward the middle of the field he walks all the way over to the\n\nOpponent's team or the non penalize teams who make the call so that for yard run by Courtney is going to be taken off the board it'll be now first down and twenty ethic rocket thirty yard line after the ten yard penalty\n\nCourtney with three receivers so the rank and an empty backfield Courtney will keep it to the thirty twenty five another client comes in down to the twenty [noise] comes Courtney he got ten yards but we've got another flag down good be holding again\nSo again of ten by the very quick quarterback tray Courtney\nWho came into this season as a wide receiver and took over when colon Trent they're talented quarterback was injured in the summer playing basketball\nWith an M ... here and so now\nIt's holding against Cherokee again another ten yard penalty so that's what I say Cherokee they've got a good little ... but they just seem to break down at inopportune times\n\nSo now it's first down and thirty yards to go at the forty yard line of rocket so Cherokee has had a fumble they had a Bible snap trying a wild cat play with Kurt singer down of the nine yard line of rocket and that stopped him on down\nAnd now they're two straight holding penalties have marched in backfield first down in thirty Courtney to throw straight dry now looking down on the left side on the same route incomplete intended for Leeper covered well by Michael Robbins and again the past incomplete\n\nSo that's a really good match up to watch between Robinson\nBorg rocket and Leeper the wide receiver for Cherokee\n\nSo it's two of nine passing for court me fifty six yards now it's second down in thirty or Cherokee at the crack at forty yard line [noise]\n\nAnd it's kind of discombobulated themselves with two penalties here\nSecondhand and thirty yards to go single running back beside Courtney Courtney will hand it off this time and nothing doing [noise] about uh two yard last could be another penalty for false start as coffee\nAnd established there to slam down the runner Trent price for it to yard loss but\nInstead it's going to be another penalty against no it's holding against Cherokee not a false starts that one's going to be waved off and it's going to be now third down\nNow that football was actually a loss they put it down to forty and they should be back at the forty two if they took the plane it would be a two yard loss wow they're going to give price no gain on that\nActually it was to yard last but anyway it's third and thirty ... he's going to keep it around the left side and have thrown for a lot back at the forty four yard line by JR Giles grapes play Giles as he froze Courtney for for your loss and it'll be for it down and thirty four yards to go\n\nAnd now wait we have another flag down right as I started to write down the total\n\nSo Courtney thrown for a for your loss\nAs he tried to come down the left side of the line for a run pass option and instead he has thrown down\nAnd this time the penalty will be\nAn sportsmen like against Cherokee that's a dead ball foul and that's going to moving back even farther and so camp to play for your loss and tax Fifteen on it for an sportsman like conduct so now Cherokee at their own forte will have it for the down and fifty yards\nTo go forth and fifty I don't think there'll be faking this punt\n\nAs they've got their punter Walker in there to a sports town in fifty so they were all the way down at the twenty yard line and they go back field [noise]\nForty yard after penalty so here's Walker to punt\nGets a kick away high not that long wobbly spiral will hit it the thirty borrow it gets a great bounce for Cherokee and the Cherokees player caught it down to twenty he got to let it roll it would have gone even further creditor responded to the twenty two yard line and that's work rocket will start first intend it their own twenty two\nPioneers lead seven to three we have five oh wait to go in the first than\n\nSome thought would be a high scoring game right now is seven\nAt the forty seven and so that's going to be a twelve yard gain for Courtney\n\nOn a quarterback drawn so he now has forty yards rushing\nOne of the pioneers has shaken up its primary staff whose down at the moment shaken up it looks like with two oh nine to go in the first day of Twenty one to three crooked\nAs Cherokee took the early lead three to nothing since then it's been a seven yard touchdown run by joiner a Seventy yard touchdown pass from lark and ... and and a twenty five yard\nTD toss from Larkin to Dante heckler\nThrough the air\nIs now seven Fifteen for one hundred and sixty three yards and two touchdowns here in the first day in\nMy car Robinson for catches a hundred and six yards Dante heckler map to catch his for forty three yards as they attend to the injured pioneer who is ... he is sitting up and will now be helped up near midfield\nMoving slowly\nIs Tyler east after you an outcome walking off\n\nAnd so here we go it's a Courtney who just ran a twelve yard or on a quarterback keeper\nCourtney has passed for fifty six years rushed for forty he is a dual threat quarterback is straight Courtney jeeps habit at their own forty seven first in line with two oh one to go and the clock moving here in the first day at\nPioneers lead at Twenty one to three coordinate with two banks beside him he's going to run it again and this time they will force him out of bounds near midfield\nComes Courtney\nAnd uh\nMy plan a hand forced him out of bounds they'll give Courtney three yards right the midfield it'll be second down and seven\n\nSeconds seven with one forty nine to go here in the first day at Twenty one two three rocket leading\n\nDown at Churchill again Daniel Boone leads forty eight to seven over volunteer in the second quarter here's Courtney play accident here's these past complete the lever he's hit emitted immediately by Robin said and slowing down just a quick little curl\nTo leave or over on the left side line in the past complete it'll be good for five yards will make it third down insured\n\nThird down in about two years Courtney on hand it off and close to the first down they stack him up at the forty three yard line forward progress might've gotten him as Trent price on the Kerry and he will get two yards on the Carey actually they're giving three to the forty two and that'll be a first down\n\nSo price Twenty one yard seven carries first down Cherokee at the crack at forty two yard line with one Thirteen and I'm moving clock here in the first half one Thirteen to go as crooked\nOn defense Cherokee has at first didn't Janet the pioneer\nForty to play action back to throw court and he's going to fire deep down towards the end zone that France is going to be [noise] is it intercepted let's see\nIntercepted I Believe by Fritz comedy again and they actually made the interception at about the two yard line [noise] actually they are going to bring it up field to the fore is where they'll spot it\nAnd print Scalia has his second interception of the night\nAs Courtney trying to hit labor and the past intercepted by prince Cali down at the four yard line his momentum carried him to the end zone but he made the interception\nAfter four so Kelly has two interceptions Cherokee has three turnovers and another Cherokee possible drivers for hit by either a turnover or some kind of miss execution here so now the pioneers habit\nAt the border yard line or their own for the habits first intent fifty one seconds to go and a half [noise] illegal formation on crack it will be the penalty as a flag was down and they'll bring it back\n[noise]\nAnd let's see they are going to put it down and we're at the two yard line\n\nAnd so it will be\nFirst down and twelve for the pioneers at their own to rocket leading at Twenty one to three as they've scored Twenty one straight points we were scoreless in the first quarter\nBefore Cherokee took the lead with a field goal early in the second quarter rocket has scored Twenty one points in a row since then\nFifty one seconds to go\nAs we have a momentary time out coming up and a half time won't have scores of other games around the area including that Daniel Boone score as they are\nRunning roughshod over volunteer down at a\nChurchill forty eight to seven\nHere crack it up comfortably Twenty one to three at the moment but Cherokee as we mentioned\nHas a very high powered offense although\nThey have that a V. eight off and sometimes that kind of loses its cylinder to along the way\nAnd stops there\nAs they shoot themselves in the foot\nQuite a bit here and the first half as Courtney has thrown two interceptions to prince collie they've bumble\nThey've also Bible to snap deep and rocket territory that had them on a horse downplay turned the ball over on down rocket when it first down and twelve at their own to yard line ... wants\nTo throw out of that end zone he's going to launch it down in the middle of the failed that passes going to be in complete up at the forty yard line pass intended for leaping Dante heckler he was double covered the passing complete so they did take a shot at their own to yard line but the passing complete\nIt'll be second down and twelve yards to go at their own to with forty four seconds to go in the first time\n\nSo it's going to be cracking at their own to yard line second down and twelve or Larkin under center this time he's just going to keep it\nOn a sneak in lark un's lunges forward for a yard or two and that's it\n\nAnd let's see where the spot it actually after three and one yard gain by lark and\n\nSo now forty seconds to go and Cherokee calls time out will take it with um sixty seconds as you listen to Johnson City hearing center high school football back in one minute on W.

are certainly people that are paying attention or trying to make the conversation more human but we use for instance incredible metaphors\nIn the business which I'm certainly not against metaphors somebody\nOnce said sell this as a whole not the steak and if you can tell somebody how we'll wind makes you feel and you're accurate about that well and that's probably a good thing there's this one I wanted to share this with you this was a metaphor\nThat was actually used by a wine writer back and well it's about a two thousand and one retard much Shay and the author writes this rich ... offering reveals\nLush layers of chewy buttered popcorn flavors medium bodied an extroverted this is a street Walker of a wind up for its lack of class and refinement with its well rounded sexually charged the assets I Want to buy a case of that [laughter]\nJust scared me away\nStairs you know because I'm left asking the question well what is it tastes like chewy buttered popcorn yeah what\nAbout who the audience is in that that's an interesting one because\nWhen you really think about that that person speaking to a very specific audience are almost afraid to there I said dumbing down to the rest of the world so if you're a winemaker trying to get somebody to taste a million\nPeople to taste your wind versus a very specific much you're not speaking in a language anybody like myself understand I'm not a kind of sword but I enjoy why I live in or out of Washington that's the form of wind so\nOld I Am ... years you're spoiling the surprise here on fire [laughter] that's okay All right All right now I got a jump in here because this was this was the crazy thing okay I\nI didn't know where you were in the world because we talked to people all over the country and all over the world and then as I was two and a little bit of a Googling of you\nFind out your wouldn't ville Washington well like I\nMean we we claimed to be the many Napa Valley of Washington\nAbout it it's one of the great wine regions in America and so what are the odds that the guy that I'm going to talk to about conversation marketing as it relates to wine is in one of the best one of my favorite wine regions\nYeah yeah it's a lot of fun here about a lot of guys\nThat what what a coincidence are you always watch it we have you always been from Washington\n[noise] no I'm actually originally from California so I'm a transplant from about twenty five years ago in fact I think you know maybe even to the day I moved up here about twenty five years ago the\nRegulations for escaping yeah I Know I I I feel very lucky and blessed [laughter]\nCalif where I'm In the I'm On the central coast of California which is a wonderful lovely place you know you I'm In wine country but so so you

Oregon the ad council\nAnd your grip and counter continues with David Wilson and my special guest Kevin one and Kevin and I have a lot more in common then I realized it strange that we would actually be doing this story because when his PR agency put out the press release I don't think they were thinking wine shows Kevin [laughter]\nWell maybe not but you know it takes into account every industry so yeah\nI I guess that's true and the probably the one thing people in every industry have in common is most of them drink wine snow that area it's very difficult in the wind business to differentiate yourself\nFrom everybody else because there are so dad blasted many winds out there one of the first things that you guys talk about is the idea of earning attention and then telling a story both of which are similar things when you go into a wine store or wherever you get your wine and you look at the shells\nThere's been this ... mass exodus from the conventional wind label and now we have all of these wine labels\nThat seek to be incredibly clever and one of the things that saddens me about it is so many of those clever labels are created by marketing teams that know nothing about wine or what's in that bottle or to communicate really clearly what the wind is all about so you get these just\nAbstract concepts on the label and I think that's kind of a disservice\nTo the wind consumer your thoughts\n[noise] well it's disingenuous and it almost speaks to the idea of\nYou're not telling a story you're actually trying to gimmick your way into getting somebody to buy wine and it would be to the unsuspecting consumer like myself if I'm looking at a row of line\nThere's a hundred different brands and I know that I Want to read or you know I'm going to look at them and what am I judging it on\nIf I don't have any help from the store clerk or somebody who's sitting there and I've got to pick something you're taking a risk if I like the label and I go for the labor which I might do if you're right it's terrible and it doesn't really speak to the label\nI don't know how I'm going to buy it again I don't remember you just because you have a gimmicky label so that's all part of that visual storytelling that we get into in the book as well\nSo how does that match with your idea ... and here's a quote pertaining to your book and says to gain attention in today's granted marketplace it's prudent to do the opposite of what most everyone else is doing that means don't deliver the cliched boring content and that and in fact is what they're doing with those labels is trying to differentiate from everybody else\nBut I think in doing that you still have to be accurate don't you in communicating what you are\nDo have to be accurate and the interesting thing about what you're talking about is that whole thing\nWith the labels may have worked but then everybody jumped on the bandwagon I can see now you're now you've got all these sort of creative ways of doctoring up a label and then you have the traditional way so now they're sitting side by side so there really is no differentiation anymore because you have just as many novelty labels that there are traditional labels so now they're all part of the same\nChoices and the way at least from where we are we talking about\nSay in the book there was actually a mention of Jordan vineyards not sure if you're familiar with that but they don't really interesting campaign they completely broke out of the norm and they started a video channel on YouTube they filmed the folks making the wind from the label or they\nFilmed executive team and they did a version of to see them and they kind of poked fun and and they they did this sort of weird alligator the type of thing to it and they got twenty thousand flowers out of it and suddenly they were on the map\nBecause of this originality and they wanted to have fun and they were actually talking about lifestyle\nAnd they made it seem like working there was fine and they didn't get any thing\nAbout wine and what it tastes like they were shooting bottles of wine next to fruit and plates of food it was just about the people that make the wine and the fund that they're having and trying to foster a certain culture and relay that type of culture to the audience that's how they differentiate it so it's not just at the store on a label it's also how your messaging yourself to the rest of the world\nYeah exactly and I was having this conversation with somebody yesterday about the connection between personality that is of the winemaker\nAnd the wind itself and\nI've always had this give me a couple of hours with winemaker without even tasting the wind on that with the wind is going to taste like because they put their personality into the bottle and just as an artist what their personality onto a canvas it's important to tell\nThe story and I think it does also it creates a a relationship between the product and the consumer that wouldn't otherwise be there otherwise it's just a bottle of wine\nI always used this example and I should probably get some other ones but\nThere is a wine out called little black dress and I've never had the wine I don't know what it tastes like I don't take any exception to the name other than the fact that I'm not buying that wind to take to a poker game with the guy's\nNot gonna I won't show up with little black dresses have taken their market and they've narrowed it down really to not just women but at a certain type of woman and I just wonder if that's a bad strategy\nBecause I mean is it a feminine wine is it a wind that they've tested on women and they ... women like it better these kinds of things frustrate me a bit again not an indictment of the company they can do what they wanted their brand but can you share thought or two on that\n[noise] you know one of the things I Do actually talk about is I might take a little bit of an opposite opinion and it's only because what they're trying to do is try the niche market they probably figured that\nHey we've got an idea for a wine we've got an idea for a niche and this is really important if you're going to go into a crowded marketplace how are you going to compete with everything that's out there and you've got thousands of different brands to choose from so if you want to\nGo into a niche market that you probably have a better chance of penetrating a niche market with\nSome creative marketing build up your brand get a little bit of a following start to make a name for yourself and and branch out so it actually can be valuable it's actually one of the way that we started our business to my front teeth three and of course we started in different industry I couldn't compete with a large publishers but I could compete in the niche that I had come from which was really educating investors\nI'm rolling over on this one I'm going with what you're saying here because when I think about it I feel in Asia as well I'm not\nEverybody's cup of tea in fact I'm nobody's cup of tea I'm everybody's glass of wine but anyway I fill in nice for people who just want to have a kind of conversation that you and I are having here and so I guess I shouldn't really be critical of bad but I Do want to offer one caviar which is this that if you're going to provide an image or a story about a wine\nLet it please reflect what's in the bottle it needs to mirror what's in the bottle because what's gonna happen is if somebody opens up that bottle and they don't get that sort of\nFeeling that you're trying to project on the label you're never going to get another sale from them\nI agree if you're going to target a niche you need to speak the language of that niche and there's going to be a higher set of expectations for the quality of the product and what you're going to deliver so\nIt really better match what you're saying so if you're promising something\nAnd you're not necessarily promising what it's going to take flight but you're promising that it's going to make them feel a certain way you're promising they're going to be a part of a a maybe it's part of the subculture by drinking little black dress and somehow you're sort of targeting that mindset you got to be careful to make sure that the product match that so I agree\nAnd more than that I think that the consumers thinks that\nIf they reveal their card that they're just a casual wind drinker and they don't have the education that somebody else might that they're going to be looked down upon and that's really not the truth that all I think that people who are helping you with wind generally speaking they're pretty nice people\nTheir pretentious people are few and far between it's the guy with a new Tesla new girlfriend that you have to be worried about but if you as a consumer if you will tell the person that's helping you what's your level of expertise is and be honest and don't be intimidated and don't standard looking like you don't have a brain they'll treat you really fairly\nAnd they'll do everything they possibly can to help you but just as important is\nFor the person who's behind the counter ask them don't assume\nThat's a really good point the hardest part in a relationship between the cellar and the buyer is creating common ground and\nYou know more than the buyer awfully or the buyer may know more than you but if the buyer comes in if you don't know you have to establish relationship and a report and that starts with your handshake recall and shake moments in the book you know what is your ... going to look like are you going to start talking jargon are you going to make them feel\nStupid for not understanding for you as a customer also have a responsibility to help the person the other side of the counter know what it is what you bring to the table too so we don't want to put all the pressure on the business\nThere is some responsibility as as a as a person violent wind to say hey I Need help and give and give\nThe information such a I'm an experience I'm a novice drinker I don't know anything about it I couldn't tell you the difference between a ten dollar bottle and a hundred dollar bottle I have friends who I Need to buy this for ...\nWho might I don't have a large budget it's going to a party it's black tie whatever it is that they need to know habitat and and the other side of the the equation is the is the person finally the wind should really look at\nWhat they're saying and not try to have an agenda don't try to sell a bottle of wine try to get involved in the story that's being told and help them\nThe smartest thing a consumer can do I think is I mean you know how much you have to spend and don't let anybody talking to spending more than you want to spend if you're going out you're buying a gift or you're bringing wind to an event\nYou need to explain a little bit about the people you're bringing the wind to and the setting all of that and you can say look I only have forty dollars to spend or thirty dollars to spend and if in fact that's under cutting things\nThen hopefully the person's going to be honest with you and say you know what you're only going to embarrass yourself with a thirty dollar bottle if things are in fact a bunch of bankers that are sitting around used to doing this maybe you'd be better off to bring a little bottle of port there was something bringing about a fancy corkscrew the more that you can help the person\nWho's selling you the wine the more they can help you and it said this before when you go into a tasting room if you don't want to hear the whole story about the wine\nPlease tell them that because it's really a courtesy to the wine cellar who's got to do that pitch all day long maybe a hundred times a day right if they don't have to tell the story you don't make them do it\nBut the other thing I'd add to that is remember if you are selling a bottom line you're not just selling a bottle of wine and you're selling and experience so it's the whole package including you though a thirty dollar bottle of wine that comes the additional corkscrew or some extra information or\nSome collateral that they can take 'em to help educate them if you know that person doesn't understand why maybe give them something let them know that it's a relationship beyond just a transaction and who knows maybe that bottle of wine creates a memory and that memory is attached to a positive experience when they bought the wind so they go back to you over and over again\nAnd the you know what there's always and you know this from living in wouldn't bill there are so many little hidden gems out there when you're going to an important party there are plenty of small producers that have that thirty dollar bottle of wine it's always when in doubt brings something very UBS\nYou're [laughter] that's what I say\nYeah don't try to go get a wind that you're going to impress that person with because they know it's a came as or remain eagle or something like that instead make a little discovery that they'll enjoy All right so we got a minute to wrap up here having okay me the most important words of wisdom for the consumer and for the wine cellar\nAnd then we'll tell people where to get the\n... well I think we fit in a lot on the culture the consumer don't be afraid to ask and don't be afraid to share your experience and come back and let them know what your experience was in for the seller don't sell a product fell experience try to remember that you're impacting somebody's life\nEven in that small moment you aren't backing somebody's life whether it's right there in the moment or whether you're putting content out on the Internet don't sell a product give them an experience\nElaborate on I'm giving them an experience\nIt's really more about educating them so if you talk about features and benefits you're just part of the noise but if you tell a story and talk about how the wind might impact them in a positive way how is your\nWind out of that experience going to help them in life I Know that sounds like a grand ideal but mine is lifestyle and there's millions and millions of moment that have been recorded over bottles of wine or glasses of wine whether it's managed by ... or something like that so just know that you're going to be a part of an experience and maybe they experience hasn't been created yet but you can set the\nStage and start the story for them\nAll righty well the book is conversation marketing how to be relevant\nAnd engage your customer by speaking human I think the title says it all the author is Kevin ... you can find a book on Amazon and you can find Kevin at\nA he three custom that is the

they're going to enter into any sort of trade negotiations with a non market economy read China and if they happened to enter into an agreement\nThe United states could just rip up the rip up the whole thing and say hey you're out you're out you know we don't do this anymore it's just basically putting China I notice that you know you're not going to make a deal with North America with anyone unless we bless it\nYeah absolutely what we're seeing here um is the art of the deal that ultimately the end goal is to get a renegotiated\nRelationship between the United states and China or what you are starting to see what Trump is that he is racking up trade victories with South Korea with Japan now with Canada Mexico we might actually be doing you pretty soon\nAnd you're getting the band together or man back together and trying to kind of have them put pressure collectively on China in China's going to have a choice\nDo you kind of cut a deal with the rest of the world or do we try to isolate you and we're going to a Cold War I'm with China related to trade issues\nYou know I I agree with what you're saying it is the art of the deal and in in it appears having a person in the White House who's a strong business person strung businessman many many decades of background and negotiating business deal really and by changing and shifting the paradigm\nIt really is producing result I just I find it down there\nThat people still when I listen to the other side and say well he doesn't know what he's doing well it's chaotic well we don't know whether we're going to have ... we don't know where they're going to have a trade war we don't know what we're really good you know we're not in control of what's going on out there we don't have respect in the world and I think it's die magically the opposite of that don't you\nI'm not sure I think that there is a a you know there's plenty of coordinated chaos here I'm One of the things that you know as I talked to folks in D.C as I talked to people that are in positions of annoying and I asked them sometimes waters are angle\nAnd we haven't always identify that ah so what I've continuously try to do is that I look at the statements that the president has made\nI look at the statements that folks and as an administration others have done and said well what are the key themes here\nI'm One of the key themes has been can we get our allies are our traditional allies together I'm In a way to reestablish the trade relationship in the region and with China\nThe other thing that I think is incredibly fascinating is when you look at each of these trade deals\nAre us energy Ellen gee exports oil exports are always a key part of it and I think that's there for two reasons\nOne a Trump wants to promote us energy and be the largest exporter of natural gas and oil um but at the end ... beat in coal ah but we're we're we're in a situation where at the end of the day or if the United states is supplying\nChina with the energy they need to grow we're going to link these two economies together stronger than we are today they already have a trillion dollars worth of our treasuries\nThey need our technology for their innovation if they need our energy for our growth\nThat takes the two world superpowers and provide a more stable environment the counter to that is that is a harm to the Russian economy and it's a harm to the Iranian economy if all of these trade deals have the United states providing the energy to the world\nThe economy's in those two countries are under considerable distress in under considerable isolation and that is a part of his foreign policy that I don't think get Nick you debated very much out there that is part and parcel with all of these trade issues\nBut I I think you're right and I do find it amazing how so many of these different thoughts of being connected and we're seeing and under the Trump Administration I mean he's been very very ... you just don't buy energy and that's so important\nIt he has been very very high on getting something done on the energy industry in the United states fossil fuel energy in this industry in the United states\nAnd in in your right by it which is why he was so upset with Germany for cutting the deal with Russia for their energy needs at the same time he was trying to renegotiate the NATO alliance and all the things that are happening with that but you're right Bye bye and getting us involved with energy or making a part of this trade deal\nI'm hopefully cutting a deal with China that links them at the hip with us in terms of energy which means that they they need us more than ... you know I I Need you more than like you know they may work that way\nUh it does put pressure on Russia both politically in terms of you know what we're able to do with these other countries in the in the levers that we have it at the same time it really puts them in jeopardy with their economy\nYeah I mean I think what we're I'm looking at here is that um it varies\nProbably also a little bit more risk to this fight than as appreciate it though is that the you know I I've been spending a lot of time with trade experts and the number one question that gets asked with China trade fight is who is going to blink first\nI'm neither side is going to blink anytime soon in right now we're at a bit of a stalemate um so I kind of get some solace in the fact that we were able to get deals with South Korea\nOthers and that's looking good uh as I look at the impart impact to the U.S economy to the U.S consumers to the stock market or I Do keep a nervous eyes to what's going on in China and that is going to continue to ratchet up and get worse before it gets better and that's something that we need to kind of be concerned about it\nAnd I mean is a very fascinating I I really like a a you know your ideas here in the non market economies and how that was kinda tucked into the new U.S MCA the the NAFTA two point oh so we're going to take care of both sides of the political spectrum\nBy getting both of their uh their their ... teachers in\nThere to describe what just happened is incredible trade agreement or that is going to now make America prosper even more but yes we got into China right we've got to get trying to write we can't ignore that all of his inventory and everything that's in the economy right now is going to get is going to be you know is going to be sold is going to be using our products are coming in a much higher price is going to get to the consumer\nWhat's that going to do the profits of

host Neal Asbury together with cohost Dr rich rough and\nSo rich I mean trade trade trade I mean it's such a hugely important thing and uh so many jobs are connected to trade and by the way our exports pay five times more dollar for dollar that are important too\nSo it's very important that we export so it's very important that Americans have a supply chain that they can depend on to get their components of raw materials that we can make things in this country and China is a very important part of that supply chain\nWe all we must remember that you know this is all about cheap finished goods you know this is about raw materials components that keeps our factories and the people working in our factories\nAre having a job and being able to compete internationally with competitive prices\nBut the jobs numbers are good rich\nAnd you always remind me that the job numbers are good and you know people are working in this country and and I don't just working working and getting better jobs and they've had in the past you know the Obama economy was all about part time workers right I mean oh yeah we create jobs with their problem was they were all temporary

very much have their their their finger on the pulse here about what's happening what jobs and they say in September September payrolls up per ATP two hundred and thirty thousand wow that seems good to me mark what do you say\nI'm no absolutely I it's hard to find much not to like about the\nCurrent a performance and project array of the job market we could easily see the unemployment rate dropped down to three and a half percent if we get there that would be matching a level level last seen in December of Nineteen sixty nine and a you know perhaps some of us here old enough to remember Nineteen sixty nine but uh my shoe size was much smaller back then\n[laughter] yeah well that's what I waste so much more of that that's what I graduated with my BA was Nineteen sixty nine really ... the summer of all of it was ... was that it was that\nWell you know what I think you're a hundred percent correct when you get the big picture of what's going on out there you know even even you know the Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell the other day he indicated that he quoted a remarkably positive outlook\nFor the U.S economy and joined ... low unemployment and inflation to the point when you know a reporter asked him well do you think that this is you know a a remarkably positive strong too good to be true scenarios as it I think that's a fair question\nSo you know and Jamie dining made a very strong common just about ten days ago so we are in a in a remarkable place right now in terms of where we were just too short years ago I mean the progress has been enormous\nYes and you know I Know that there's a tendency to want to sort of pin this on let's say the president or to say that uh what was not necessarily regarded as robust was the fault of the previous president uh I think that uh to some degree Mrs ...\nHer point a a a however I understand there is a tendency in the environmental which we now live\nTo try to make everything a political point to give the president his do obviously he made a passage of the tax cut both out of business and personal level of priority\nIt got that done at the cooperation of a of a friendly GOP led Congress obviously the administration has made it a priority to try to reduce regulation business sees that as very friendly will see longer term whether that causes any a meaningful harm to consumers or just individuals and\nUh the jury isn't yet I ready to come back on that but I I think that the broader take is that we are both of US Economy\nAnd the global economy cooperating together in a constructive way\nUh obviously uh we're gonna have to speaking of Jerome Powell and I was at a news conference a I think and Jamie diamond has said this is the chairman of J. P. Morgan Chase as well there is a risk out let's say twelve to Eighteen to twenty four months out that if the U.S economy does continue to perform well\nUh there is a price to be paid and that is higher interest rates and it could be and as we speak the market is having a bit of a a a many tantrum because of the rise and bond market yields but perhaps that's again the price you pay for a strong economy or it could be that many people are underestimating what the fed\nIs yet to do including members of the F O M C underestimating that but none of us can possibly know how that will turn out until we get to that point\nWhat do you think more about the you know originally were just talking about this uh this just previously today about tariffs in what that may due to the job market because a lot of our manufacturing jobs rely on diverse supply chains raw materials components and so on coming from overseas\nOr China you know China half of what we import from China are are exactly those things\nAnd uh\nYou know has you know ... and you know have we seen the end of this because you know it's it's kind of like OK the market's going up but American profits are going to start getting compressed if the cost of manufacturing opponents materials are are going up and then that's not going to be good for the job market\n[noise] while you've outlined that uh that conflict very well uh and you know for those of us watch these things closely meaning perhaps not every one on your audience watches as closely as we do the most broad takeaway is that the trade dispute slash tariffs\nHave added a level of uncertainty that they had not had to manage through before of obviously the apparent resolution of the agreement which is a successor to NAFTA\nIf indeed all that works out as well as a let's say every one hopes are most people hope uh that takes some uncertainty out of the equation but clearly as I think you've already said\nThe a burgeoning disputes with China are are a centrally potentially huge and we frankly just don't know how that works out\nIs is really great talking to you you really analyze it very well you explain that very well we're very happy to have you back on the show mark hammering the senior economic analyst at ... dot com he mark thanks for being back with us\nComing up we have former Trump campaign advisor Michael ...
