there's a but we have to be honest about his actions and not agree that everything he touches turns to gold I said that Donald Trump is a man not a God and the last few days I disagree with some of the things he has done in many of you think I'm wrong about the things I said\nFor example I Believe having Tanya west in the oval office was a mistake and you won't convince me otherwise but why does he feel you have to have these celebrities visiting him well perhaps because he is of that world he gives a celebrity\nIs Donald Trump though the first celebrity president not really he is kind of but not really you could take it all the way back to our first President George Washington he was the most famous man in America at the time the most respected man in America\nBut he also thought I'm only one thing his nation of its citizens above himself you know that the citizens at the time wanted to make George Washington king but he said no they want you to make him king\nThey wanted to give them a grant title is president more than president he said no they wanted Washington serve until he died he said no why because he loved his country more than himself that is no longer the case presidents after George Washington\nHad been respected but they were seen as what they were leaders and politicians not celebrities it was not until John F.

W. Bush stole the election sound familiar then after being the most popular president in history after nine eleven they successfully turned them into a racist failure after Hurricane Katrina and an

first place depending on what boom does tonight\nAbout Tennessee Hi looks to make it a very crowded top three of the leader board by knocking off the pioneers tonight\nFinances come into this game a on a roll of course and they continue to just to pile up points they are ranked fourth in class five a in the state of Tennessee off to the best starting school history coached by hate and family and his first season he has yet to taste defeat as the head coach of the pioneers us look at their season so far they defeated Seymour\nTwenty one of the seven then Campbell county twenty eight to seven\nFeet volunteer fifty five to nothing\nDefeated gifts fifty five to twenty eight then it went over ... county forty one twenty\nForty four to nothing over Hampton and forty one ten over Cherokee so if you look at it\nThe last five games this season rocket has scored forty points or better they ... their opposition two hundred and eighty five Seventy two on the season that's an average score a forty one to ten\nThe defense only allowing eighty nine yards rushing for the opponents per game and just Ninety two yards through the air coming into this so the defense is giving up under two hundred yards of total ... per game while the fans has gotten certainly well deserved think as the season has gone along\nUh the defense is to be lauded as well they've had a very outstanding defensively\nLet's take a look at some stats obsessively and defensively for the pioneers coming into this one\nAs they are are led by ... the outstanding quarterback one Thirteen of one eighty two sixty two percent completion\nPercentage two thousand and Ninety six yards on the season twenty six touchdowns three intercepted and to rushing touchdowns what a year the junior ... has had in the Russian department they're letting rushing by Ron killed joined or not anyone carries for six hundred and six yards and five touchdowns\nReceiving Dante heckler thirty three catches seven hundred and thirty five yards ten touchdowns he also has to ... return touchdown\nJohn collie has caught twenty eight for four hundred and thirty yards and five touchdowns one punt return touchdown for collie Mica Robinson twenty six reception for five hundred and six yards seven touchdown and mark cyber has Thirteen catches for two hundred and forty yards and a touchdown\nThey have arguably the best receiving corps in the area\nNo question as rocket continues to put the ball in the air and the receivers continue to catch up on the defensive side they're letting tackled by mark side where with sixty two he has twelve and a half tackled for last as well John comedy with fifty six tackles\nFor past breakups as well and Jay aren't Giles twenty six tackled ten tackles poor loss\nInterceptions heckler and Robbins and have three interceptions obese that but pioneers are probably going to get a boost tonight Adrian bowls their outstanding defensive end and Potter\nIs dressed staff he has missed the last several games with that leg injury\nHe looks to be back he's dressed down and coach or gently said it was going to be at the game time decision he is dressed out so we'll see if in fact is able to go but he is dressed out for this game and that certainly they can use them on the defensive line\nThe pioneers you might have noticed if you seen any highlights maybe pictures you've noticed that large plank or two by four piece of lumber that they carry around\nAnd that's got they're a team motto want it to this year and that's all in its engraved on there and that means being all into David crack at football and everything they do and certainly they've in body that as the season has gone along last week against Cherokee of course another great performance pie quarterback table ark and\nAs they beat the chiefs forty one to ten in the game played at pioneer field block and for the game was twelve of twenty three passing for three hundred and sixty seven yards and five touchdown\nThey now has twenty six for the year as far as rushing around killed joining or let the weight fourteen carries for Ninety five yards and the ballgame receiving it was Dante ... three catches for one forty two including Ninety nine yard touchdown\nAnd Mike Robinson had five cats is four hundred and thirty five yards including a thing of beauty on his final touchdown as he got away from two would be ... and stored\nOverall and the outfits last week rocket piled up four hundred many yards total up and to only two hundred and forty hours total for the Cherokee chief [noise] so that's what the pioneers they come in again three at on a conference seven oh\nOverall as they try to stay on beaten but more importantly try to go to for no in conference play here tonight\nAnd put a

before you know when the conference the night starting up again brought to you by Andrew Johnson bag a strong heritage a strong future let's keep it right here we've taken several breaks with a few technical issues but we'll keep it right here and get right to our coaches corner\nAs tonight we hear from head coach Hayden sharing Lee again he's seven hours ahead coach in his first season so far at the helm of the pioneers\nAlright coach big ball game against the tendency high Vikings to\nHear this evening and certainly conference implications we'll talk more about that in a minute I didn't want to touch on last week where a course your team defeated Cherokee but had to shake a little rest stop there after the first quarter\nCame out about that and uh you know I don't play or anything like that but when you're when\nI'm On the last call um last friday so on and well they're not going to second or were they were twenty more in there and kind of going back for more than a stronger and off\nAnd are certainly a good performance another good performance by a cable ark and and I know all your team but he just continues to be very accurate with football and certainly hit a talented grouper receivers every game it seems like\nAn outlet\nDo you wouldn't know it but actually started over five friday night and yeah that contributed to a little bit of our you know slowly start especially in the audience\nYou know once he was able to get you know a couple of complex something about the rest is history of the state so I'm not going to start for sixteen to start but you know he uh he bounce back well and was able to get some long their second and third quarter and\nWe were able to build on that and you go to lead and um then we were able to run a park there with the wrong key on a second half so overall a\nSock performance from her office of their especially from the second quarter and on and I'm just happy with our performance during the second half\nAs the season goes along and of course are you guys are seven to know you have talked about this team being from bowling hungry it seems like every week and that's certainly a credit to the coaching staff does it gets harder as a season goes on to keep them humbling hungry especially as they're still undefeated\nThose who have served their country\nDo you support in Texas V E T to teach teach teach teach to

Breyer he'll hand it around the left side\nThat is gifts under the forty forty five and gifts enough across the forty five you don't have a first down\nSo Ryan Gibson\nThe senior runs it on a sweep around the left side and they are going to spot the ball at the forty six of Tennessee Hi so that'll be a seven yards gained for gifts and and the first ... first intend Vikings at their own forty six yard why the game a little over a minute hold\nAnd it's fantasy high with it to start today and Crockett deferred after they wanted to toss\nVikings to have a double ...\nPistol formation of type formation behind the quarterback Coleman player\nOn that and now the rocket jumps let's see if they were drawn off as the nose tackle Jim and we'll see if it's off side against rocket or fall start and the official say it's off side against pocket so not the bachelor stark for the pioneers but we know how quickly can turn around\nAnd so the Vikings will now have at first and five there and Crockett territory at the pioneer forty nine yard line\nCrack at three in Tennessee Hi three in one as far as the conference records are concerned\nVikings now wind up with a wink set on the right to receivers to the right mix prayer in the shotgun\nOn first down in five yards to go make Breyer\nHe'll play action role writes a throw under a rash and Breyer's going to run it now and he'll be forced out of bounds down about forty five yard line by chasing John ... like\nA gray hair is going to be close to the first down\nMight be a little bit short down at the forty four and a half yard line\nAs he was under great duress but he was able to use that speed\nAlthough collie finally chased him down and Breyer gets up limping a little bit\nSo they put the ball at the forty four and a half and I think it's going to be short so it'll be third down and less than a yard for the Vikings\nDid make lawyer for yards on that carry\nSo its third and inches for Tennessee high at the rocket forty forty article I make Breyer and the gum third in very short\nAnd now Mick ... going to hand it off on a counter play back to the forty and down for a first down to the thirty five yard live inside the thirty five\nAnd let's see\nWas Kate Mitchell who lined up on the left slide he came back against the flow on a counter play and Mitchell is going to pick up\nTen yards were first them\nFirst down Crockett or rather a Tennessee Hi ethic rocket thirty four yard line burst carry than I for Cape Mitchell he missed the game against Daniel Boone earlier\nBut he's in there tonight outstanding senior and so it will be first in tan Vikings at the crack at thirty four yard line\nNine forty to go here in the first quarter they're doing what they want to do\nSo far here's a hand off again back and this time they play well on the counter and it's a bank down as it was ... tackling Kate Mitchell they came back with the same play and\nIt was a huge step who was ready for it it's a loss of three on that carry it will be second down and Thirteen\nSo Mitchell thrown for three are losses they came back with the same counter play back to the right side against the flow and this time Mitchell tackled\nBy each step second and third team for the Vikings at the rocket thirty seven yard line\nMake Breyer with ... beside him that his\nGifts along these right side Coleman on his left\nBack to throw make money or here's this fast that passes going to be a diving attempted it incomplete yes\nIncomplete down at the twenty nine yarn about intended for CJ has tried to make a diving catch this is not a big time throwing football teams they'd rather run it they can throw it although they're not as comfortable throwing it\nThey'd rather control things with their running attack but now they're faced with third and Thirteen and we have the first big third downplay\nYou heard or one of our keys to the game\nStop sign at third avenue and that's what the rocket defense they want to throw up a big stop sign here and get tendency high off the field I'm third them one receiver left one writes split facts make prayer in the shot gun on third down and Thirteen\nMake Breyer roles left to throw
