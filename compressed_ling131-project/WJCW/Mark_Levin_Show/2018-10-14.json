{"month": "10", "state": "TN", "station": "WJCW", "content": "It is a good bargain and it's the way we really should have been going on a long time ago I I Do find it\nFascinating how I'm Mr Trump or a President Trump plays chess\nBecause that's exactly what he's been doing with the energy industry in the United states\nAnd our allies and our photos across the the world\nAnd that is that if in fact we can get the energy I'm a sector doing even better and making us an export and energy that poses a threat to a number of areas won it stabilizes as we talked about on the show the fact that we can have our own supply of energy that's less expensive less subject to the vagaries of\nPolitics in the Mid East and so forth that's a good thing for us that's that's just great number two it creates tremendous jobs in the United states as we all know the energy industry has high paying technological jobs\nUm and and they're they're not the jobs that were being created in the bottom is rations to good work on Tuesday Thursday and Saturdays a window when a Wendy's and\nThen a Monday Wednesday and friday or you can be at Burger King\nBut but the reality of the thing is that it also poses a threat um as to Russia\nAnd to um and even Iran or if we eliminate their ability to get a dollars as Petro dollars black\nOil dollars into their currencies which they desperately need that the one area that Russia has done well over the last Twenty years with the energy sector and that is why the president when he was at the NATO with at the meeting in Europe\nAnd uh and and Canada gee settlements I start with Angela Merkel saying well wait a minute wait a minute you want us to work with NATO you wanted to support you at the same time NATO and Germany in particular is cutting the Seventy five billion dollar deal with Russia well wait a minute\nFor what well for energy will God's sakes why don't you create and work with us the energy of the United states and it hurts the people that NATO supposed to be protecting you from I mean that's the most ridiculous it's an oxymoron that just doesn't make sense so when you see what's happening now in this big chess game that the president's plane\nHe lined up American fossil fuels he ... he expanded dramatically\nHe gives us the opportunity to be a net exporter of energy he uses that next exporting to stabilize our economy with all the things we just talked about and at the same time you're hurting the photos of the United states\nAnd it gives him leverage to cut deals\nThis is brilliant anybody who sit back and said oh my God you know pollutants got him and pollution and so forth has no idea what they're talking about and they have to stop listening the sources back organization because they're getting the full story the true story is there's brilliance and all of this and we're all going to benefit by this including by the way\nThe president also put out a note this week saying that well you know what we're going to work with the EPA we're going to change the rules change the rag we're going to get more ethanol made from corn rehab but we don't have time to talk about corn not the best thing to you but also natural gas ethanol\nAnd we're going to increase ethanol into our gas system you know the ... of petroleum system we don't have to bring an oil from OPEC and we can be totally self sufficient\nAnd we are in similar to the rest of the world what a great idea to do that and by the way it does not hurt the American farmers to much either it helps them dramatically Neal\nIt's interesting a President Trump brought that up at a rally this week and a actually a in Iowa\nIn Iowa you know I'm sure that it went over very well or an ... I guess it was the summer months\nAh that that ethanol the use of ethanol in gasoline was reduced because it would create smog and and very high humid or conditions and and you know when the humidity's high the temperatures high\nI guess that's an all or would be a bit of a problem at least that's what the Obama administration fought\nAnd so President Trump said hey wait a second you know we're we don't believe that we're going to help our farmers and we're going to allow ethanol to be used during the summer months and therefore the farmers in Iowa I'm sure Kansas Nebraska that whole

found the nation's unemployment rate at its lowest level since the Nineteen sixties here do sort through the numbers is John Tammany John ... is director of the center for economic freedom at freedomworks\nJohn welcome back to American radio journal\nJohn the unemployment numbers are out for the month of September and once again it would appear that the economy has yielded a low number\nOf unemployed the lowest perhaps in decades so tell us a little bit about that\nIt's got to be remembered that economies are just people and people naturally grow their naturally trying to better their situation\nThe only way they can is if a natural barriers are putting their place usually have the tax regulatory trade tariffs and an unstable money variety and so I think it's a fairly strong signal that while President Trump isn't perfect in terms of economic policy\nIn particular on the trade front overall his policies have been rather benign and to some degree pro growth and would that people\nIn the economy just naturally migrated to better and better jobs and and more and more people have come off the sidelines to get to work and so it's very positive sign\nIn terms of the growing economy and\nJob opportunities are we seeing this just in certain groups of people or is this extending across all economic classes and all demographics classes\nEverything that I've read has so far indicated that this is a very deep economic rally as Senate hitting people of at all levels of the economic spectrum from from the high end of earnings too low you're hearing about a\nSmaller businesses and or a service businesses that are really struggling to find good workers right now just given given the high demand for them so it's it sounds like it's as is always the case a growing economy to generally lifts all boats and we're seeing that happen right here\nIn terms of these job openings and what appears to be a growing lack of qualified employees is this a factor that could possibly hold this economic expansion down going forward the fact there aren't enough qualified workers out there now for the jobs available\nI don't think so and and my example is myself I come from I guess you'd call generation X. people who graduated in the late eighties throughout the nineties most of us\nDidn't grow up with Internet or anything related to the Internet\nBut my generation adapted\nTo work this Internet based very quickly and that same generation had a lot to do with the Internet boom and so my take is that as it is it's always the case people can learn they learn quickly what they need to learn in order to be employed and and what brings them into employment is that\nCompanies looking to add quality workers to raise the amount that they're willing to pay\nAnd that serves as a fairly potent lower so I never worried about bad skills people can develop skills very quickly\nYou mentioned one of the areas where the president ... maybe as not as free market as other places is when it comes to trade we have a new NAFTA agreement and ah although I understand you don't have a crystal ball what effect do you think having an agreement actually in place now will have on trade\nIt's good in the sense that it removes some uncertainty certainly the markets like that are probably what they would have liked a lot more is if President Trump hadn't done anything investors broadly like NAFTA and so\nThe fact that the good news here is that in bringing it back Trump largely brought back but we had before there was a bit more central planning to it and that's unfortunate there's lots of things like certain cars if they're going to be made and sold in North America tear free they have to have\nA certain amount of labor cost at least sixteen dollars per hour the inputs in the car have to add a percentage of I think Seventy five percent be made in North America all that's unfortunate that the Republican Party has historically been one about\nFree markets and freedom for producers to do is they wished without a metal and there's a little bit of central planning and the new NAFTA but largely at the same as the one before and investors\nProbably like that and let's talk for a minute or two now about the Federal Reserve and John many Americans of\nCourse of her to the Federal Reserve a lot of folks maybe don't quite understand how it operates in what impact it has a just very briefly but what impact does the Federal Reserve actually have on our economy and how does it try to manage it\nWell I'm One of these people and I'm somewhat of an outlier here I've\nLong believed and I wrote a book about it called who needs the fed I I think the feds impact on the economy is vastly overstated the fed exists as a lender of last resort to solvent banks but it can't really do that you know solve the bank would ever go to the fed for a loan it'd be an admission of bankruptcy\nThe than also regulates banks but I Can't really do that very effectively as two thousand eight reminds us and then of course it aims to\nSet the overnight rate which banks lend to one another button interest rates price like any other you don't need the fed for that and so I think the feds impact has vastly over and people say well you know they're going to\nReduce interest rates and that's going to ease up credit that's the equivalent of married to a place you sane in New York how apartment rents are too high I'm going to reduce how much landlords couldn't charge for apartments\nAll he would do is just cause scarcity\nAnd the same way if markets actually responded the fed the fed can at best cause scarcity by trying to artificially lower rates below what they normally hit in the marketplace so my point is is is we in the real economy we largely act as the fed doesn't exist that that sort of an ... that sort of an outlier position\nBut I Believe it will be increasingly common place in the coming years\nThe fed has been on a rate increase I won't say binge because they've been doing it in smaller increments this past week it did seem to get her the markets a little bit will the fed raising the the rates will that caused the economy to cool off or given your previous comment cereal really don't think it's going to have much impact in the long run\nNo I don't think it will have much of an impact it all let's remember the fed kept rates low mountains here or the rate at at him set for years and years for basically two thousand nine until what about twenty Fifteen or twenty sixteen there is no major economic boom during that time the fed can change reality when when we're when we go to the market to\nBorrow money we're borrowing access to real resources to trucks tractors computers desks chairs most of all human labor the fed can expand the amount of that available I Can't make these resources cheap and so I think the answer is is to always remind ourselves that\nThe fed is just another entity try and influence things not very well\nWe have been talking with John Tammy who is the director of the center for economic freedom at freedomworks John towns have been about freedomworks also where can bugs

here in the next two years at least\nWe have seen a disturbing trend Greg of\nState attorneys generals using their office to promote a political ideology\nA it's a political position so we can't divorce it entirely from politics so that the people's preferences with respect to their law enforcement priorities are honored\nBut there's bald political like basically that to to this climate change lawsuit stuff that we saw again Bloomberg uh funded with a little touch of um [noise] what's his name from uh from New York everybody's favorite bugaboo Soros excuse me um\nAnd this privately funding a public attorneys general though I think is very dangerous we know that Mr Bloomberg has some very anti liberty positions but even if we agreed with those positions it's not appropriate for private actors\nTo fund prosecutors even if there is no direct or influence because we know there will be in direct influence and that's an inappropriate influence on somebody that has the power to bring prosecutions in the name of the state\nJust a couple of minutes left in our conversation here so let's move now to Massachusetts that's where a conservative nonprofit that plans to attacks do attack Massachusetts factions in a pre election ad brought us\nThere will complain Wednesday to keep its donors secrets represented by fully Hogan the Institute for free speech the Massachusetts fiscal alliance\nWould fall under the state's reporting scheme merely because it plans to mention state a state senator in an ad so uh the the fight over here is I guess who who you can mention and what that constitutes in terms of the law\nAnd once again it looks like a knowing who the donors are is a big priority they'll have to kind of reminds us of the iris scan\nYou know you wonder why is it so important for them to know who donors are when we know that politicians have said they want to reward their backers and punish their opponents\nUsing lawn regulation and that's why it's important for these people do good conceal their identity they don't want government actors punishing them for exercising their free speech and that's all we're talking about here they're saying to their fellow Massachusetts ...\nHey it's not okay to be an additional tax on people simply because they're wealthy or they pay more money anyway right they're making more so they're paying more but they shouldn't have a separate an additional burden over and above everybody else's burden simply because they're very successful\nAnd they should be able to the you know the pro freedom position as they should be able to say that that sense\nUm without having identified themselves because they're fearful of the Massachusetts ... parties right and the governance of laying the hammer down on them so\nUh it's appropriate and position and to the extent possible we should allow more speech or is always the cure for bad speech\nLastly Scott I'm sure the response you get is the word transparency would be in there and the and the phrase dark money would be in there or from your your critics on this one what would you say that ah it's all about uh the sunshine policy we just want to know who's involved with the big deal\nWell how do you protect against a tyrant so for instance many people on the left a and many libertarians for that matter thought the search Sheriff Joe Arpaio was a horrible sensor and he actually he actually punished his critics\nSo people who wanted to run against him were a really good deterred from doing so because of the way he ran his office so from the left you can see how there could be a strong man on the right who would you know inappropriately punishes critics if he had their identity so by protecting one's identity\nWe can protect against that I think it's a real pro freedom position I think you have\nThere are some arguments that you know that you can make it and you just made it's not a it's not a case of no downside but to me that the equation clearly restaurant anonymous speech encourages more freedom and therefore should be allowed just didn't like the tradition that we have\nWith Kate those letters and Google is Federalist

journalist ... the country would be punishing itself\nUh the way the story would unfold which he appreciate you got to go back and redo it go back in\nBut it happened really in a in a way that's when we're either you know come coming onto a breach or recovered in you that area of a you know conflict we're constantly always evaluating the situation or in ... in the environment or what story dictate so\nThere's not really a moment that doesn't go by where we all take a breath and um you know I'm always asking are the questions about\nDialogue is well writes round about it improvised around it but the upper end privatization needs to be correct to what the language is sometimes the calm talking it up at a two\nTactical yeah clean that up and make it a little bit more terrorists and make it more specific ground or a little bit faster if you get my drift but that one though I Do I think it's\nConstantly a revolving thing not just kind of pinpoint and that's why we you know we're so we hang around on that\nTalked to David ... as you were in the national defense from SEAL Team the other thing David I appreciate about what you guys have in terms of a story in a relationship on you know the different relationships you have with your your teammates and with your wife and your kids I mean one sex\nYou're you're shooting the bad guys and the next thing you said you sleep in your son's bad you know so I mean that their own kind of thing is it it really makes you know your character so interesting\nYes it look you know when you're when you're in that arena and they're at their job I caught doing what they do and hitting that target or whatever that is there um you know they come home and how do they you know get back to balance is\nAgain I say I don't want to say that I talked to some guys about this is it they just get bored\nYeah I'm coming back on the homeland for them as a sure it's different adjustment I mean there you are you know riding pretty heavily on a on a target zone or up and are the stakes are so high that uh the adrenaline so high that come back and it's boring\nUm yeah I Can't wait to get back out um\nAnd I want to talk about the you know with\nVery much value peak yet the\nShock and trauma you know a brain injuries and explosions or the people that have been hit and a\n... a a war I'm hit home um you know we as a society try to understand that but can't really get into their mind what's going on they they operate in\nSuch a through their heads so from my character coming home and yeah you know with my kids and my wife my relationship and I'm I'm just wait for my next up and that's a at the high for me\nYeah well and that's the only thing to you know when\nI entered conclusion of last season you had an injury in a while I was excited to see what what you would do that one thing we do down on the show and it's it's really interesting and it seems like that's going to kind of evolved\nA ... as you go forward but uh that's really interesting and that's you know that's another thing that these guys have to deal with\nWell yeah I mean you know we didn't want it to back when we came back last night wanted to be about six months after the fact that he probably see something that you'll definitely deal with\nAnd these are the casualty these are the things that what happened when they come back home that uh you know you can be you could hear something just walking down the street and you could you know it 'cause it never had a loud noise could be something that just loud noise right um it could shock I mean to up\nTo ... or whatever that may be but\nThink the best thing about this show I've always said is you know\nI really want to expose what in the shadows of these guys minds and that's a that's a pretty dark place um but something that we really haven't seen if we could put some light in there and cut out the feeling I think that's what really the show stands on merit by\n... yeah and I think also something that you guys get absolutely right when you're talking about the lingo and the jargon that kind of thing you know ... ... that can get pretty heavy and bogged down and wondering what you guys do I think we're the which is great\nYou do a lot with very little conversation especially when you're on a mission and that kind of the I think really translates to guys who do it for real\nI mean we value ourselves out of nowhere and they have for this show will be one of five will be kind of breaking up a sense of trying to how how it was going to come back to the team well Lucian people and we get to

right but it just hasn't been Heather and we're talking about the trades or initiative that you guys are doing now a trade training and a Home Depot I mean it just makes them so much sense for you guys to do that\nAbsolutely it does it's one of the things that we started looking at the issue that social issue really a few years ago\nAnd if you look at the problem there over two hundred thousand skilled labor job openings right now the average age of a Palmyra which doesn't sound very old at the average uh Palmer is fifty six years old and we've got folks who are retiring out of the system but we don't have younger folks coming in to spot\nOn the ... that is absolutely true and and just to kind of underscore that point I was talking to somebody the other day union guy who ah worked for the electric company retired had to go back but yeah there was nobody there they knew what to no friend\nOf mine's doing the same thing yeah but ... you know for years adjusted it's been as manager of\nCollege college yeah right well you know not everybody's meant to go to ... and ... and these are important skills I mean there's nothing shameful is having a skilled trade\nNow and then you know ... the editor either good job this is not really good career and you can make a lot of money and then I thought I mean you think about the last time he tried to get a plumber here how\nMy\n... and

an hourly rate they're going to treasurer one hour which is\nSixty bucks an hour ... area so for a two minute work sixty bucks an hour yeah yeah and\nCrazy so what's your right not everybody is meant for college right what we want to do is give them that other that other career opportunity and so on and and now that we're investing fifty million dollars and twenty thousand killed ... people into the pipeline by twenty twenty eight man\nWhy it amazing\nIn the military people ... and you're doing this from my understanding is er during watchers from Fort Stewart and George ...\nAnd we already launched yet in in you\nKnow you got a great pool of people that are already have possibly prior experience and some of those fields right\nRight that weren't starting with ... military and we're actually on Fort Stewart in Fort Bragg right now and then we have open up another classroom in Jacksonville, Florida that it out that if some of the naval bases\nUm but we're working with Dr Pepper ratings service men and women who are separated from the military air right they've got those skills they've got the work ethic are going to work on time they're going to do the work they're going to stay out there how they're going to get the job\n[laughter] yeah you know that's a good point too because I hear from so many people in so many different businesses we can't find anybody that wants to work\nWe just can't find people who want to work well Darren veteran I I mean you're talking about somebody who who not only wants to work but enjoys working and is very loyal and and you know ... that's the other thing that I think that the companies are finding out now for sure is that when you hire veterans you you get the best employee you're going to have\nYou really do and again it goes back to that work ethic I mean\nIf they want to serve they want to get a job done their mission oriented though and it goes back to their they already have the soft skills that employers are looking for that's what they're finding lacking and other candidates that they've got out there\nAnd so you're doing this through some nonprofits right\nWe are we're working with homebuilders Institute there a national nonprofit they're based out of D.C they've been around for fifty years so they they know what they're doing it I'm just an incredible partner and with them we're going to work focus on\nSeparating military will it will continue that will also be working with veterans who are either unemployed or underemployed men that will be working with under served youth we're going to be
