know in a Nancy Pelosi you know uh Dave okay she\nUm was rated the number one most liberal state senator and as you know there are a lot more liberal areas and attempt district they Arlington in Alexandria, Virginia but she was rated the most liberal state senator uh she as opposed to oppose the tax cuts of course she is she is attacking me\nOn the tax cuts that are giving us you know our our families a drug that Virginia ... that's a great family tax cuts that two thousand dollar child tax credit that\nWith a bill that I had to double the child tax credit she would eliminate that she would she said you know we got to get rid of uh the tax cuts and she said she wants to increase the Social Security taxes that we all pay raise the cap and and do it that way\nAs well let me tell you on a second as I understand that she was a long history of raising taxes including on people who drive and there's a lot of people who drive from northern Virginia the Washington and back and forth\nYes yet no hotel taxes car taxes\nUm you know you name it there you you can see on the wrong way ... dot com to lift the tax increases that she supported and I'm On our website Barbara Comstock for Congress dot com you can see the tax cuts that I have advanced and uh\nSince I've been in the state house you know I have I've never supported a bill to increase taxes I think the way we grow our economy and get more money flowing in that we can you know rebuild our military you know which we've done now which my opponent doesn't talk about it all\nBut the way we advance art get this three point five percent growth four point two percent growth that we have is by cutting our taxes bringing businesses back\nFrom overseas reinvest thing in our own economy and you know we have this great economy with the highest median family income you know low unemployment across the board I mean I Know you highlight this all the time\nBut this isn't something that uh my my opponent opposes this record I mean it's it's interesting she just um you know attacking me with the score card they have and ironically you know the the the scorecard they're doing it's called the FiveThirtyEight scorecard eighty two percent of the bills on that score card or a bipartisan\nAnd she's opposing those things now six of them are tax cuts and most of those weren't bipartisan because Democrats never support tax cuts but seven of the votes were to keep the government open eleven of the votes\nWere to stop this over regulation that the Obama administration has done a two of the votes for for the

show here for a second I mean not my show but with the play well it all began with the label and according to Dr detainee uh for the most part at least\nThose are just marketing tools designed to quickly catch the guy from a store shelf she says but we had a different idea\nWhy not create a label that delved deeper and dramatizes the incredible cultural story behind ... migration from Europe\nTo the America as it's funny I tell a story about how much back got here or how they got to Argentina\nFrom the U.S and it's a very different story than is in this play let's just say that I anthropomorphize winds and give them personalities I if I have time I'll tell you that story and a little bit but I I just want to share this one with you because it's\nIt's so amazingly interesting anyway um took them about a year to create the original art work for the ... back to collectible release which probably makes it even more expensive and valuable\nBut anyway the label artwork also inspired Dr contain ya to create this for act to play with four allegorical female figures\nAnd she did that in conjunction with her brother in law who is play right Gustavo all a ... and and the performance Dr ... herself brings the four figures from the label to life\nThe theatrical piece debuted on may seventh to an audience of trade and media and bow and arrow which is in Argentina restaurant in New York's lower east side\nAnd then the second performance took place during the Nantucket wine in food festival which I wanted to go to and couldn't get there\nBut anyway there's a lot of other scheduled performances coming up and so you'll just have to Google that and see if you can catch it because I have a feeling it is a wonderful thing to experience anyway uh the idea for the label began with Dr contain his sister now she's a historian Adrian I contain yeah I mean this is\nNo slouch family here folks there or play writes in the family and his ... and the family in the greatest winemakers in the world and the family and doctors and yeah\nThis is a serious family but anyway the idea came from Adriana contain yeah and she says the story of wine is almost always been told from a male perspective and we decided that it was time to honor the women who are intrinsic ... traveled from Europe to the Americas and frankly I don't know that story\nAnd made Dr ... says as we dove into our research we were amazed by the stories they were funny dramatic and sometimes tragic I was inspired to write the play\nAnyway for her performance Dr continue fleshed out the roles of all four of the characters depicted on the label which include Eleanor of Aquitaine the twelve century monarch and ... first champion\nThe character Madame ... which was not a real person but a disease that wiped out almost everything in Europe she describes Madame ... as the voracious female aphid that was this gorgeous Bordeaux in the Eighteen fifties\nAnd also in the play the Italian immigrant animal sector who is ... his own great grandmother and represents those who brought the first ... cutting to the Americas and finally Adriana Kenya who was at the site or a father and Nicholas ... as his dad was the great variety as a treasure of the new world\nThe labeled by the way just to top honors at the drinks business award which is a very prestigious awards receiver labels so you got to check it out anyway\nI'm not going to tell you any more to spoil the play for you I think what our next step should be is to get a Dr Laura ...\nNo not that Dr Laura\nDr Laura could change again here and let's see if we can get a complete rundown of a story and what I'll probably do is tell you my story about\nThe evolution of mail back and you can compare it to hers and you'll see ... well I'm just full of at [laughter] All right we're going to move on but this is something worth looking out for and I'm going to see if I can find a video of this play on stage and maybe I can share that with you as well but I thought it was a\nFun story and glad to share it here now All right we're going to move on and just a second here there's a brand spanking new book out it's it's

encounters host David Wilson [noise]\n\nBack to the radio and my guest author Kathleen ... Kathleen came out when it's brand new\nRights that just came out with the end of April and it's such a great mishaps is for people and I'm so gratified because he writes something or put it out there and it was somebody going to pick it up and and people are and it's exciting\nYou know that they're going to read it and then he want to know what they once they've given us read it for good feedback on that and it's really terrific so far\nWell if they if they actually read it it's going to be good feedback because it means that they didn't stop it you know page dwell in any way hey I failed to mention that this a portion of rape encounters radio is brought you by the winds of peak ranch\nThese are wildly premium exceptional extraordinary winds they're not a ridiculously priced you just have to just Google peak ranch it's PG E a K e ranch and buy a few bottles I've had everything that he's made do it do it do it do it back to the book\nSo the book again is the wind lovers apprentice now I Am dissecting the title you're Kathleen because it's the wine lovers and that's our apostrophe S. apprentice now in a print is somebody who is learning under the poodle edge of somebody else\nSo I'm assuming this apprentice is learning under the guidance of the wind lover\nAnd I'm thinking that must be you is that right\nYeah me and you are my apprentice\nYou have worked in wine bars restaurants you're certified so may you've had a lot of experience now in the wind industry at least especially over the past decade as I see it correct\nYes I'm going to stop you trying to the Somalia I never actually worked at a bar or restaurant the wine bars I've worked for employers I've worked for distributors I've worked on my own I have to just about every part of this industry except in restaurants I plan on doing and I got hurt it along the way\nI never mind folks she didn't do what I said gee did but but but to work in wine stories that we have a wine store ... and pour him I feel such a responsibility when somebody comes in and they want me to choose something for them\nWhat they're really in some ways the same job because it directly right you have to pick what you want in a store that represent historic mission or I thought that that they put out in terms of line and then you might people coming in and say well\nI Need a ride and then you have to drill down and get to sit with them and take out kind of what they want it for their drinking with did they like bigger fruity or wind today more of an earthy kind of wine and you really have to figure out fairly quickly what they're looking for and how to\nMake the right decision where they're going to come back and I've had people do this and the wife worked come back and said that was amazing and it feels so good\nYou know there was a very important aspect to this subject we're talking about right now\nThat one store feels you they're not able to identify what is going to work for you don't go back\nThey don't understand your palate now maybe it's you maybe you're not really explaining things the way that you should and that by the way the reason you read a book like the wind lovers print is better you're able to enunciate\nWhat it is that you're enjoying in particular winds in a good consulting like Kathleen\nIs going to be able to take the most basic of language that comes out of your mouth and translated into oh you should be drinking to not you should be drinking you know sue raw or whatever it might be that's your job as the white lover right\nYeah but it how you pointed out at the beginning people don't always live in an area where you have\nA wine store with people who are knowledgeable in there because\nYou know they need a job and nothing wrong with dating a job or being in a wine store but if you need help that's not your bad situation but the book really tries to help people understand what they're how it is and then they can look on a wind left on a shelf and say oh gee I'm probably going to like this line but probably not this one and it really sort of get to consume a little bit of\nOur especially for anytime but especially those situations where you don't have somebody a or a really good sales person to steer you and that right direction\nGiven the fact that in in your book the wind lovers apprentice that you pay particular attention and you know given I think we devoted more words to the wine regions than almost any other subject in the book\nCan I interpret that to mean that the regional influences if I can identify the fact that you are really drawn to Italian wines let's say that you know the more that you understand about regions and what\nKinds of winds and the characteristics of those one style of wine making that goes on there the more that you know about that the more you're going to be able to dial down into an area where the winds that are produced are going to suit your palate\nAbsolutely and and her the genesis of the sexes I probably didn't mean for them to become so big but I just kind of got out of role I think a passionate\nAbout other places which I was writing that so many people will come to me and they would say oh I hate cabernet but I Love for Dell and football a lot of words that winds\nEverybody gets a cabernet in them or somebody to say well well I Love the chaotic right and it's like well county is really a region and send you they did the grave and they're just some basic thing with it not because people are stupid but just because they've never\nHad the opportunity to delve into it to understand really what it is that they're drinking and European allies are tough because they labored by place they don't labeling like rape so for somebody has to sing\nCalifornia and my love for Oregon paid out of our that can be really daunting and challenging so they got down to the break it down into what I kind of call Twitter bites 'cause they're just they didn't really short notion these are the great here it's what you need to know here's where where you should look in the region the Appalachian it should be buying from\nAnd the fact that you can drink a cabernet from California Napa drink a cabernet\nFrom the area that I'm In which is the possible central coast region those are going to be completely different for the most gas yeah drink a cabernet from the ... world from war do\nThat's going to be radically different yes what you're going to get from California you can drink a cabernet from South America from Argentina Chile and that's going to be probably more similar to the California wines then it's going to be to the\nWell what what I really felt was missing was that high level kind\nOf luck that gives you another detail but without bothering you down also that you can kind of got when I look at the pay that they need to end the three to four or five pages about or do or about how to order wine in a restaurant or about wind from Argentina and don't feel\nThat it takes to read it four or five pages\nYou have a really good foundation and and it's really kind of fast\nPaced crazy world I think that that that's really what people need not two hundred and fifty pages on Italian Line because they have to kind of sit down and read that and and go through it and it's very prominent oriented and the way that I structured in terms of the region it's much more of a bullet point the type of format without using\n... and I and I think you you you imply a very important thing here too and we were talking about it in the last segment which is the regional differences between winds use unmistakable yeah if you can wrap your arms around just that much\nWhat one is all about and the fact that you know there is a good chance I'm going to tell you that there is a good chance that if if if you have a bottle of Italian wine and you don't like it you might not like most of what comes out of Italy right very good chance of that there's a very good chance that if you like\nThe Seventy on blocks from New Zealand\nThat you're going to like almost all of them and you may find yourself not liking California so non blocks as much because there are there are very distinct qualities that occur\nBecause of the environment we call it ... which is sort of a stuffy awkward for everything that impacts the one making experience but the bottom line is is that different places make things differently\nBut yeah it's it's finding the winds that kind of fit your palette that fit your style\nAnd I always tell people that when you're self to tear usual it's a good comfort zone and there's nothing wrong with it but you know you raise your hand over on the show by the the ... that's next to it or or you know by by the shark native maybe from a different region than you're used to drinking and just said and try it and explore it because he never now\nLet's keep something straight here that if you're ordering wine in a restaurant from somebody I they can no more afford that expensive bottle than you can ... you shouldn't be embarrassed into spending more money than you need to spend because there's plenty of good wine out there at a decent price but but I have a bit like but having said that you know\nIt's okay to walk into a wine store and say you know I drink this or I drink that even if it is a you know ... or two buck Chuck or inexpensive\nWine ... you can certainly say you know and like this I'd like some is there something better than this really and and and they're going to point you're not in a direction or you're going to go to somebody's house for dinner and they will live a port for you an Australian syrup for dinner you know men it was good\nWrite that down go into the wine shop and say\nThis really I thought this was really good now they're in they're going to be able to point you in the right direction\nOr even even better X on your phone I cannot tell you how many yet all horse\nYeah how many I had an amazing wine and I can't remember the name and I didn't take an ex are they are offering very founded vice\nBut bear in mind is that if you go into a ... big retail shop and they've got cases back to the ceiling\nOf a particular wine I'm probably not going to recommend that you buy that line because it's a wine that's being blown out but if it's a small boutique winery lot of times you know they don't have the marketing to be able to sell their wines at uh\nThe price that they're worth so they at some point are going to\nUnload those winds and if you can score some of those wind it's going to be wonderful but in the world of Google and all of these wonderful wind apps\nThat are out there so many people posting so much information on wine do your homework\nYou're standing there and you see a twenty case high stack of wine put it in your own you know and it you might be surprised if it might come up and say this is a you know eighty three point wind ... don't drink that but it also might say the winery gotten a lot of trouble they make too much wind and\nThe two thousands damaging and they've got to dump it there's some great buys out there buying you know it's like anything else Kathleen gosh I hate to say goodbye to you we've had\nSo much that I really appreciate your time and and yet the part of the time and having a conversation with you it's been really delightful All right\nTo to find the book once again you're going to find the book at a Amazon dot com Barnes and noble noble you're going to find it a on line at a Kendall\nKendall and or anybody in

sisters to defeat anti Semitism\nAnd where's the forces of hey\nWell eleven people were killed in the massacre the suspect forty six year old Robert Bauer is in custody as emergency dispatch recording show he was making threats against Jews as you fired\nUm unemployment right now it's a spectacular employment rate right now a three point seven percent has not been this low since December Nineteen sixty nine\nA compared to where it was a under Obama which is four point nine percent uh for women it's an incredibly dramatic it's got a four point four percent down to three point three that the lowest number for female adult unemployment since the days of Dwight Eisenhower\nSo the Trump economies bringing us back to the level of prosperity we've not seen since like it's incredible uh and the reason for this is\nA GOP policies reducing taxes cutting regulations and having I think a pro business tone from Washington DC you know under Obama we heard that you know you didn't build that you're part of one percent shame and knew your evil and\nA President Trump and the GOP what we hear is great you want to start a business go for wonderful please a building or American Dream hire people and good luck and we're proud of it\nAnd so people in that kind of an environment like well I guess it's okay to hire people I'll start by new company invest in this business of expand my factory what have you and boom all of a sudden people are going back to work and the good times of rolling\nSo uh yeah it is it a great for the money to restore its beautiful story that's a great great story so why are we having a problem\nI think part of it as the media have no interest in talking about this of course want to keep everybody's eyes focused on different shiny objects whether it be a Stormy Daniels are this is a relentless Russia Russia Russia probe which is which is prove nothing we're all still waiting to see any evidence whatsoever of\nTrump Russia collusion that's like the Loch ness monster big foot you know maybe it'll suddenly pop up on the middle of a of the\nTwilight zone or something like that\nAnd uh so the media don't want to focus on this because they obviously are rooting for the left and right for the Democrats [noise]\nUm I Do think that you'll pick do much better job of asking is very simple question are you better off now than you were two years ago just boil it down to that one sentence and I think it gets people's heads it gives them something to focus on and I'm a stay at a lot of people are just talking about a whole bunch of different topics and that's a shame\nYou don't ... in your in all of that is true and there's all kinds of statistics out there and if you look at African American unemployment I mean it's it's as crazy as it is crazy good at it in a meeting positive or if you look at Latino if you look at women\nAre a lot of these groups that you know in the demographics you know when the economy has been booming maybe they not have they have not been doing as well but that's not true this time around it's not true but yet you know at least the media would have us believe in and there's a lot of truth to it\nThat Latino is you know the overwhelming majority or against president from a African Americans the over over overwhelming majority are against President Trump\nAnd so on and they were they also want you to believe that all the women of America are are are um are against President Trump and those that aren't are just subservient to they don't have a mind of their own you know right yeah they will into their husbands and that's it that's it they they can't think\nThat if the ... but what what's wrong with all that why why is it like that\nWell I think what's wrong with it as it's largely not true uh right now we have a black unemployment at I think it's a fifth of I point nine percent or ... six percent now it was five point nine percent of believe in may ...\nSteak and that was the lowest ever recorded I Believe at the moment Latin America Latin I'm Hispanic or unemployment I Believe is at the lowest level ever uh so we were at or near record lows unemployment for minorities in this country I think Asian people Asian background I Believe the\nLowest in history this is a remarkable uh and uh you also find at the same time maybe maybe it's not a coincidence\nOr according to the ... a recent Rasmussen poll thirty six percent of black Americans approve of President Trump's performance so that's a big number but it is amazing that it's not one or two or three percent because you hear every single day he's a white nationalist he's really a klansmen hates black people blah blah blah to switch here from the left wing media nonstop\nOn site it's nonsense it it ... it\nIt's a ... a pilot real real real relentless lives I mean if he really hates black people white it candidate Trump GO Campaign in black churches in Detroit in Flint, Michigan why did he campaign Eddie and it probably black charter school in Cleveland ah why was the first\nThings he did as president to bring in the president's ah of the historically black colleges and universities have them in the oval office and it set up a White House office to assist the historically black colleges and universities like Spelman at Howard University ah why did he have county\nKanye West or at the oval office and then have him over for lunch I mean people I don't like to invite over for lunch and if Trump relates black people why do they bring a colony of West and and jump around as much a lecture them at the White House\nSo the left left the screaming racism and bigotry they pull it out of the air it's utterly meaningless and its other than saying somebody is murder it's about the worst thing you can call somebody and that the left throws around all the time without any basis in fact and despite that\nDespite that a Trump is seen thirty six percent job approval among blacks if a half of those people show up at the polls vote Republican and the Juppe as Eighteen percent support among blacks it's him he was very very sad like the Democrats on the\nGame over at that point you know they can\nThey because I mean in in ... no Republican presidential candidate or you know on a national level it's gotten more than ten percent for like forever right\nThat's right yes exactly correct and so the black folks are such a large part of the Democratic base that if I'm Eighteen or twenty percent of of black voters either vote Republican or just don't bother to show up the Democrats are in dire straits I think they know that and that's why they're freaking out and and and behaving the way they are\nAnd I think if a especially if Trump were to go this do for a visit some of black neighborhoods as he should do between now and the election and say look things are so much better now that we're under Obama and you keep voting Democrat in these people maintain rotten schools a lot of crime and and your neighborhoods the economy's not as well as it should be black neighborhoods and yet\nEighteen months into Eighteen Nineteen twenty months into the Trump Administration you're seeing historically\nLow black unemployment you know that that's a pretty dramatic difference and not a lot of time\nSo you're right I think also is it is immigration policies do is also helping situation because you know these are the people are taking away the jobs that are African community are Latino community in others in in urban areas depressed areas they need those jobs in you know

you know the things in the products we make the services that we provide it it's all paid for in currency\nAnd then obviously the people we hire and you know all the services and the things we need to
