sounds like right by your voice you couldn't take candy from a baby [laughter]\nI'm Glad to call because I was calling to say you know peaceful protests thing it's fine whether it's on the left or the right as well just peaceful but wants mum start breaking out attacking people in their cars getting into their faces and to their personal space where they feel threatened\nAll bets are off some actually split open here\nAnd I'm not kidding you saw what happened in Portland right\nI Know about what happened with the cars were attacked some elderly people I'll tell you what people think I'm not kidding\nWhat's actually cause pepper spray or whatever but when you are in a state where you were there we stand your ground somebody gets right into your face you feel threatened not people's I'm telling man let's not come from the Bronx you get into my space\nAnd into my face and I feel free you're going down and you know what they what do you do what a bully get punched him in the mouth and these people were like sitting ducks it's like we're like little flowers around the country and we let these things happen it's got to stop\nA Paul is bringing some Bronx justice to the streets right now and listen this is when I see these mobs when I see the the crap going on there that's exactly what I think too that is what my instinct is as well this is what is it I don't want them to be violence\nI don't want there to be a a a riot in the street but I can tell you this to echo what Paul said\nI I'm not going to throw the first punch but\nIf I get pushed over if I get confronted if I get\nPunched you're going to see my response\nI think that's what most normal Americans are thinking and feeling right now and that's exactly why the Democrats the less the media\nThat's why they don't even want you to call him a mob let alone push back against the mob I'm Larry O'Connor and you're listening to the ... show\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrying to talk radio station nine to Eugene cw Johnson City\nI find to be fascinating and I think that makes sense but what I'd like you to tell me is why\nWhy do you think this is true American men actually favor female politicians\nOver a male\nPoliticians midterm elections are just around the corner and so it could be a potential turned the tide in American politics when it comes to gender says the skewed article from study ... out of work a record number of women are running for Congress and there may never be a better time for such a breakthrough a new study finds that both men and women prefer\nFemale politicians over males and survey fourteen hundred American men and women over Eighteen connected by researches and the Steven's Institute of technology and I won't get bogged down in a lot of the of various analyses that they do here but I I Will point out this because I find this to be a sort of the most important part uh when it breaks it down between\nA Republicans and Democrats or this is fascinating ah Democrats Democrat men specifically tend to favor a female politician mailed Democrats\nWill favor a female politician but when it comes to Republicans Republicans can go either way Republican men and women\nAre fifty fifty they don't have a preference one way or the other you know now me if I'm looking at\nTwo Republican candidates and they're pretty much on paper the exact same in in in terms of their their a resume their track record it it is it I'd have to flip the coin between two Republican candidates in one man and once a woman\nI'd probably go for the check I I'd probably put the baby up there I don't know why I got I think it makes\nUs look better when we have more women up there and frankly speaking generally speaking for the most part in in the modern era of the Republican Party some of the most to nations fighters\nFor the conservative cause have been women\nI'm just more impressed by them and I think they're used to take him to death a little bit more and they give it back a little bit better I think men are are are are are too easily cowed by the media they oh they don't want to be called names\nThey don't want to be a a old don't call me sexist don't call me racist oh no no I'm I'm going to do whatever I can to make sure that the media is my friend for the most part I'm speaking in general terms that's what we do in talk radio\nBut women see for a woman to be a pro life true red blooded conservative woman in American politics they hurt at all and they don't give a damn really the life I'd had\nFight my way and the professional world being married for decades raising kids raising ... and you think I'm going to be concerned about about a Don Lemon calling me a name about Lawrence O'Donnell not approving of me please I've given\nBirth\nI don't know I Do need to worry about you I've been through it all that I tend to want to put the baby in there and I like the checks generally speaking generally speaking\nUp but I Do find it fascinating that when it comes to Republicans that conservatives it doesn't they don't show a preference which truly shows\nThat it's the conservatives who don't judge people by their genitalia but don't judge people by the chromosome or make up we actually judge people based on who they are the character that they bring forth\nWhere Democrats men they're like oh well if it's a woman you betcha because I Want to show how woke I Am\nI'm I'm I'm more feminist and Alan Alda just wait I'll I'll you betcha I think that this is a way you tell me I'm interested in your take on this eight seven seven three one three at one one but I think that that generally speaking Democrat dudes are\nThey they want to show women\nHow incredibly wonderful they are looking Harvey Weinstein I mean you couldn't have found a better Democrat then Harvey Weinstein he exemplified personified the very model\nOf a male Democrat in the United states of America he gave the all the right causes he raised money for all the right candidates\nHe was pro choice he he's never met an abortion he hasn't liked\nHe made sure that he was in the forefront of every liberal cause in America because that was his suit of armor that was his protection\n\nHe was able to be as as abominable and sexist and horrible and despicable as a man can be but as long as he gets the where the mantle of feminist liberal Democrat\nWho checks all the boxes on the list of the causes the support and the candidates that you throw money at and raise money for a while then you'd get a free pass up to a certain\nPoint it makes sense to me this is this is how Democrat do ... ah get the ...\nSay they they they can walk into what a coffee shop and order the right kind of ... and and\nWhere they are pro choice buttons and have a conversation with a barista about how they're going to the uh save the spotted whale rally\nTomorrow and uh that's they're opening line that's how they get their checks most of them married not the checks the ... but

on the marquee event show than Ferguson filling in an eye hello\nAnd thank you so much and like you're doing an excellent strap thrown into mark\nThank you I appreciate that\nThank you um I have two comments one I Want to let you know first of all that I suffer from depression and I had a suicide attempt a number of years ago I Am doing somewhat better but I'm\nA couple of years ago I realized that I was probably living a little bit ahead of my time and that society was dying in this direction as a whole um even though I had depression I didn't have any kind of psychosis or thoughts disturbances\nBut when I started winning in mental health housing and I spoke out\nAbout somebody abuses that were going on\nAnd some of the hill quake nut rolls and what have you all of the sudden I seem to have like thoughts disturbances although no one could that explain to me what it was prior to that no one ever thought it had anything but you know mental illness from depression and uh then they made up story that I was violent and I got kicked out of two places\nEven up to the age of forty four years old I never had any kind of a history of anything on a new homeless twice I've lived in my car but it's also suicide prevention month\nAnd I think by making it sound as though ... what kind of mental illness whether he guys left I think it's not even an issue because as you said they had nothing to say that about him the four of them spoke out about Bush\n[noise] it makes it very difficult I think the young men in particular\nWas and it was that you get out or day was it yesterday if I'm not mistaken mental health awareness day\nIt's a whole month you know how it is unfortunately a lot of there's a month to everything out there must be honest you know what it's supposed to be\nTechnically we're just it just so people know that we were\nWhen we make it clear what it yesterday was world mental health day two thousand Eighteen\nWorld Health or a world mental health day uh it's it's on October the tent that's the reason I say this is where's the compassion and and I say this first of all thank you for\nYour sharing your story and I'm so thankful that you were unsuccessful in your attempt to take your life uh I ... my best friend in college um took his own life and it is something that sticks with me and and all of our close friend group ever since and have great compassion for\nThose that suffer with mental health and it's something that we shouldn't make fun of but to to score political points with Kanye West as the left is doing saying you know we're clearly and again they say that the president's taking advantage of a man who clearly has mental health issues as a token\nA black man uh and and there and he's taking advantage of using him by putting them out there today no one said any of that\nWhen Kanye West came out and said George Bush doesn't like black people\nBecause it was a narrative they wanted to be out there it was the narrative that they wanted they they they were OK with that narrative then you are on the mark of an show Ben ... and we didn't go ahead\nStole my thunder but the uh\nUh President Bush hates black people man I was like I was all part of it that um they check this out so now Herschel Walker is going to be the next soaking negro because he said that Don Lemon ...\nUm I think it was horrible at these lessons are doing but that's a whole other thing let's talk about or colder Eric Holder\nNot only him I Will first he's the only attorney general to be a\nContempt of Congress but that's a whole nother issue with the Obamas good or we'll you when you know you really gone too far in the show probably grabbed her by the IRS and said you can't do this for quite yet we're not there yet um but\nHim Hillary Clinton Maxine Waters who Democrat power base that's all they do is there any violence\nAnd then they said in the in the means of\n... and then and then they act like they get they get all you know their paintings in a wide when they when you say they're acting like a mob mentality\nWhen you have people screaming and beating on the doors the Supreme Court because they didn't get their way that's that's a mob mentality when you surround a senator like Ted Cruz at dinner\nA that's a mob mentality when you go in and you can you do these eat in and sit ins and screaming in the hallways and you get famous people to show up and then they're asking do you want to get arrested and you say yes that's a mob mentality\nDeal with it I mean if you want to talk about being honest be honest with it yes we are acting like a bunch of children were acting like a mob yes we're out here to to seek out and destroy people when we think about the ... district mob mentality you have to have\nTo ... to ... to first of all you have a woman that doesn't and Mrs Ford they didn't want her name to come out and you do it anyway\nSo you say we don't care about you were going to use use the canary\nWe're going to force you to defend your story about sexual assault so hopefully we can find others it will say the same thing about Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd then what we're going to do is we're going to find people to say we had sex we had a boat in the eighties well wait we got to recant destroying their might never happen well he he he actually in high school was was every weekend making parties for gang rapes and gang banging and and it's running trains on women\nNo one else was ... but we got a porn star lawyer an Avon Audi that will that will act like it's a legitimate and we'll throw it on the news to try to find other women out there\nThat this is what I mean this is the left this is what they're doing right now this is the normal for them and the reason why they're doing this is all I or go back to what I said earlier than\nThere is not a single issue that Democrats can actually run on right now except for personal hate\nAnd and to turn people into villains so that you hate them\nThat's the only way you can't scare people on the economy you can't scare people in the war in Iraq and Afghanistan you can't scare people on on healthcare because you you are the ones that created the health care disaster\nYou can't scare people on Social Security Medicare Medicaid so the only thing left for you to do right now is to say this guy's a racist and you don't want to race has to be in the White House Kanye West is mentally ill so you shouldn't listen to him if you're a black person\nYeah I mean it's terrible they they really have no platform will go for it they also have to take away the tax because we have to take away your problems away um we also got to have open borders and\nI'm abolish ice high crime I mean that's what they have to stand on you know speaking about the mob mentality I challenge any of these people to walk down\nI'm downtown Portland or a I've got friends done awesome such as you go to parks down there and it's nothing but a ... and they will seek to living heck out of\nYou you will get the antifa protesters this week that were directing traffic and yelling at white people is that not a mob mentality is the Democratic party not endorsing teeth but they do there's a Democratic Party not endorse black lives matter saying after the police and what do we want dead cops and when do we want them now and that's a mob
