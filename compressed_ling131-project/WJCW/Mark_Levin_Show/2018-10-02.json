see what happens after that\nOther headlines are a little bit more worrisome in some way and I've been talking about it\nFor a while now which is the economy member I I was saying you aware of all the fiscal conservatives gone remember a few weeks ago I was referencing where have all the fiscal conservatives gone\nRemember I was saying to you that if a when Obama was in fact running up the deficit with a deficit spending we were screaming bloody murder but now all of the geniuses on the conservative\nSide who make an awful lot of sound and fury have nothing to say about the spending that we're seeing on the Donald Trump is out of control\nIt's not tax and spend it spend spend at least with the Democrats we got tax and spend which kept things somewhat under control of the Republicans it's Ben and spend and spend some more\nAnd so the skyrocketing deficit will eventually reaches its peak new\nWashington says who cares Trump's as it doesn't matter they say Trump doesn't matter just keep spending the money they don't care how you pay for it\nDoesn't matter how you pay for it because nothing's going wrong yet\nBut if you know anything about history you know that everything that goes up much comes out\nAnd then eventually this economy blowout I've been saying it in my own family no one believes me I'm known as the pessimist in the family by the way I'm sort of the no man\nThere all the optimists they see nothing but sudden sun and roses coming tomorrow I'm the one who has always said no no no slowdown slow down slow down\nWell they've been largely right and I'd be largely wrong but eventually I'll be right and there'll be wrong and it won't be a pretty day in America when the Nineteen twenties begin to look like a picnic compared to what's coming because when you have a skyrocketing deficit like this combined with the all time high of the stock market as we do\nYou're seeing echoes of the Nineteen twenties before the big crash\nThis bull market run as that goes in

central government gets stronger and stronger and more and more ubiquitous you can't escape it\nAnd the federal government makes a decision it doesn't matter what state you moved to you can escape and it's a winner take all situation like abortion like Obamacare whatever the issue is it's a winner take all that's not at all\nWhat the constitution created and so in many respects where they post constitutional government they post constitutional Supreme Court and on and on and on we absolutely do and I've talked about that at length I've written about it at length\n\nSo what you're watching now is the breakdown of the constitutional order\nIn the United States Senate respecting the Supreme Court and what's interesting about this is the institution of the United States Senate as it sits today\nIs not what the constitution created\nIt's not what the constitution created you had this progressive movement that became especially strong the earliest period the turn of the last century the early Nineteen hundreds of his building in the late Eighteen hundreds\nAnd you're the sixteenth amendment the federal income tax which was always a desired result for the heart left and then you have the seventeenth amendment which utterly destroy the United States Senate\nSenators are elected members of the house are elected no there are six year terms of course\nThe reluctance by the people of the state the Senate has no actual purpose anymore\nOh I understand treaties and so that's not my point in terms of its fundamental foundational purpose it's been bastard that\nThe Senate collectively was supposed to represent the states collectively\nIn the federal Congress to members from each state states would determine how they're chosen they can be elected by the people although very few where they can be selected by the state legislatures most of the more\n\nBut the so called populism movement\n\nAnd the progressive movement eliminated that\n\nAnd so you have this kind of pure democracy as opposed to Republicanism when it comes to the United States Senate and you see the consequences of that\nYou also see the consequences and another institution the United States Supreme court the United States Supreme court even though some of my constitutional listened conservative friends heated Lee disagree with me I've written about this and the ... versus Madison decision the Supreme Court\nSeized power seized power from the other federal grants\n\nJefferson knew immediately what took place as did other individuals who believed in diversified a government\nHave libertarians today that argue strongly in favor of Madison versus Marbury and when you really read the case and you know the history of it it's a ... not only the constitution but the parties involved\nThere's no way Marshall chief justice Marshall should have been involved in that decision I'm not going to go down that road right now I'm just I'm just explaining that the Supreme Court's power today is far beyond anything that was contemplated by the framers of the constitution and certainly the rabbit fires in the states the states\nWe're still very suspicious of the central government and the constitution almost was not ratified in Massachusetts\nIn New York and in Virginia hence the federalist papers the advocates for\n\nTwo of them from New York one of them from Virginia John J. Hamilton and Madison they honestly believe that they had created a governing system that would protect the American people not just from monarchy\nBut for mob rule and more and more we're both\nWith the permanent government and Washington DC\nAnd the lifetime appointees when the Supreme Court\nAnd Marlboro\nBecause of the the unraveling of our Republican little are Republican system\nSo you see the development of these factions and the faction on the left has become extremely violent extremely aggressive\nWith its restaurants are airports whether it's hands teeth are black lives matter before that other movements in the Nineteen sixties\nThe weather underground and the association between these radical elements and members elected members of the Democratic party it's really quite shocking\nAbsolutely shocking and the association between them and most of our media is unconscionable\n\nAbsolutely unconscionable this is why the constitution is so important and this is why Republicanism is so important\n\nAnd the left keeps trying to destroy them one of the reasons if not the main reason that you see the the obliteration\nOf the confirmation process when it comes to the Supreme Court one of the reasons you see it is because Kavanaugh has pro fast he has declared that he's a constitutional is\n\nThe enemy of the progressive state is the enemy of the Democrat leadership in Washington the enemy of the Democrats' Senate members on the Judiciary Committee is the constitution truth be told it's why they always talk about precedent\nNot the text of the constitution not being original meaning of the constitution that's why they always\nDeclare that our original documents our founding document and our governing document\n\nAre really legitimate in many ways you say because too many people who are involved in the process were\nSlave holders therefore they are to be dismissed or used\nIn order to advance their destruction in the cause of progressive is again you're seeing this play out in the United States Senate not to the extent we're discussing it here intellectually but this is the consequence\nFactions\nDefamation violence or we're gonna take a look\nExactly what I'm Talking about when we return I'll be right back [noise] month\nMay\nYou know what's not smart job sites that overwhelm you with tons of the wrong resumes by you know what is smart zip recruiter dot com slash love in L.

defection what air is to fire endowment without which it instantly expires but it could not be less folly to abolish liberty which is a sense of the political life\nBecause it bearish is faction then it would be to wish the annihilation of air which is essential to animal life because it in parts to fire it's destructive agents\nThe second expedient is that it's impractical as the first would be
