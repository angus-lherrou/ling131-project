try to this point\nAnd let me tell you something my brother they're coming after that electoral college they made it quite obvious that they want to destroy that too\nI Am saying there's a small town America or can talk\nA little town and I hope for that local bell bottom line and sham and in an office jam that you're not communist socialist because there are other name that what they stand for

rushing charge up a ... man they could complicate the learning process for the confirmation of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh my son is still mattingley as Republican senators Steve Gaines says he has to be back home in Montana on Saturday for his daughter's wedding\nWell we know right now is including Steve dance Republicans have forty eight members that are yes votes and there are four undecided between three Republicans and one Democrat they need to those Republicans or Democrats to come over tomorrow and then they would have the requisite number of votes they need to have at least if you want to get at least fifty one\nIf they get more than fifty votes in Steve dangerous use anything here on Saturday and it's very possible that they hold a vote on Saturday anyway\nBut first the candidates to take a key procedural vote at ten thirty tomorrow morning the Justice Department named seven Russian intelligence officers in charges of cyber attacks including one on a U.S nuclear power company corresponding Alexander mark Clark has details\nThe justices do not sit on opposite sides of an Iowa they do not caucus in separate rooms so I've said repeatedly if confirmed to the court I Would be part of a team of nine committed to deciding cases according to the constitution and laws of the United states I Would always strive to be a team player\nNow during the confirmation process I met with sixty five senators and explain my approach to the law I participated in more than thirty hours of hearings before the Senate Judiciary committee and I submitted written answers to nearly Thirteen hundred additional questions I was grateful for the opportunity\nAfter all those meetings and after my initial hearing concluded I was subjected to wrongful and sometimes vicious allegations my time in high school and college more than Thirty years ago has been ridiculously distorted my wife and daughters of face violence and violence threats\nAgainst that backdrop I testified before the Judiciary Committee last Thursday to defend my family my good name in my lifetime of public service\nMy hearing testimony was forceful and passionate\nThat is because I forcefully and passionately denied the allegation against me at times my testimony both of my opening statement in response to questions\nReflected my overwhelming frustration of being wrongly accused without corroboration of horrible conduct completely contrary to my record in character mice\nStatement and the answer is also reflected my deep distress at the unfairness of how this allegation has been handled it was very emotional last Thursday more so than I've\nEver been I might have been too emotional at times I Know that might turn was sharp and I said a few things I should not have said I Hope everyone can understand that I was there is a son husband in that I testified with five people for most of my mind my mom my dad and my wife and most of all my daughter's\nGoing forward you can count on me to be the same kind of judge a person I had been for my entire twenty eight year legal career hardworking even killed open minded independent and dedicated to the constitution and the public good\nAs a judge I've always treated colleagues and lead against with the utmost respect I've been known for my courtesy on and off the bench I have not changed and will continue to be the same kind of judge I'd been for the last twelve years and I will continue to contribute to our country as a coach volunteer and teacher\nEvery day I Will try to be the best husband died and friend I can be I Will remain optimistic on the sunrise side of them out and I will continue to see the day that is coming up a day that is gone\nI reviewed the constitution I Believe that an independent and impartial judicious raised a central direct constitutional republic if confirmed by the Senate to serve on the Supreme Court I Will keep an open mind in every case and always strive to preserve the constitution of the United states and the American rule of law\nBrett Kavanaugh to beautiful up it won't matter one with the Democrats or the media\nAnd the three Republican stooges are really wanting their own careers positioning themselves and don't give a wet about judge Kavanaugh his wife his kid George parents\n[noise]\nSeveral times the judge mentions in this op ed the constitution and therein lies is probably\n\nThe reason he's hated by the left the reason is under attack by the Democrats the reason the media went with gossip and rumor\nAnd really defamation is because his declared support for the Constitution's they do not support it they do not support the constitution except both take the free press part because they think it protects them\nBut when it comes to the constitution they trash constitutional originalists and ... were throwback stops you know\nUnless we embrace the progressive agenda and and trying it as a constitutional matter there by rewriting the constitution with nearly five justices\nThan we justice Kavanaugh must be destroyed it is the constitution that gets in the way the progressive agenda don't you say it's the constitution that they despise\n\nThey make no sense whatsoever when they talk about the constitution when they talk about precedent when they talk about precedent we know I suppose that they must embrace Dred Scott ... plus it and you must embrace Korematsu that's precedent\nIt's precedent that was rejected as precedent the case of Dred Scott it took a civil war to undo it\nCase a plus it took fifty eight years to undo it case Korematsu it still hasn't been done\nThose were activists judges who did not follow the constitution of the United states\nThat's why this is an important debate\nThey insist on abortion it's not in the constitution so they demand precedent they insist on their entire social agenda there environmental agenda it's not in the constitution but they demand they insisted on all powerful centralized government to advance their agenda\nThat's not in the constitution either and they insist that the individual states\nWell that they accept this new rewritten constitution despite the fact that you and I have never participated in amending it\nIt's because judge Kavanaugh rivers that constitution not just the name but an action as he declares that he is despise and he is hated because it's a threat to the progressive agenda\nSo the more he talks about reverence for the constitution the more he talks about following the constitution the more he is despised I'll be right back [noise]

asleep or his back there in the back of your within the outstanding receiver\nHe may go in motion let's see here's Courtney on first down from the thirty seven he's actually gonna keep it up the metal out of Reed option to the forty and up across the forty forty three our line before John collie makes the ... good the handling of the football by trade Courtney the quarter back\nIn the reduction and he runs it up the middle for what looks like about a we'll call it a five yard gain second down and five yards to go for the cheap\nAt their own forty three are in line with\nCourtney looking over at the sidelines for the play called Crockett\nOn defense jumping into a Forman front Courtney and the shotgun two running backs beside him Kurt singer and price he'll handed off to price he's got running room to the forty five fifty and price into Crockett territory and about the forty nine yard line it'll be a first down for the chiefs as price\nFrom the forty three down to the rocket forty eight so he picks up by yards on the carry [noise] so first down Cherokee moving left or right and they started at their own thirty seven yard line they're down to the rocket forty eight\nAll this action coming on the left hash mark across the way as they move left or right here on pioneer field Courtney hands off the price tries to the middle down here to the left gets to the thirty five and his tackled at the thirty four yard line\nAs its micro Robinson coming up\nWith health\nAnd uh he comes up there and stopped price after again of forward will be second down and six\nSo it will be

it's incomplete intended it for a laborer I think labor was running a\nOut up and instead\nOf all way overthrown and then I think Courtney thought he was just going to run a go round straight down the sideline solo miscommunication there first pass attempt by court and he goes in complete it'll be second down and or rather third down and six yards to go at the rocket forty four four Courtney and the chiefs\nThird down six verse big third downplay as Courtney now looks over the sideline for the change of the play\nAnd now Courtney\nThey're trying to use up as much time as they can here's Courtney back to throw looking down the right side is passes incomplete down at the thirty five yard line that pass intended for a well covered receiver who was breathing Gilliam and so now it's going to be for down\nFor the cheap since six yards to go at the crack at forty four yard line so the drive stalls a bit and the chiefs will send Walker into bug [noise] so it will be Dawson Walker their outstanding kicker and punter\n...\nAnd now they fake it they run a fake and it's got to be a first down they snapped it to the outback and it was Kurt singer and Jay for\nKurt singer runs to the rocket thirty seven so it's again on the play of seven yards for Kurt singer on the fake first down Cherokee as the punter Walker acted like it was a snap over his head\nAnd instead it was a snap to the up man Kurt singer the block or and he runs down field for a first down so Cherokee keeps the drive alive with a fake pun\nAnd they have it at the pioneer thirty seven yard line first in ten nine thirty eight to go in the first quarter rockets up and you have to be on the field here's a double wing set or Cherokee now as they empty the backfield hears Courtney\nIt's going to be a slave liquor

when I write and skill lucky he made the recovery\nSo that'll go as a nine yard loss\nFor Courtney [noise] and so now it will be crack at first in ten of their own forty six yard line after the turnover we mentioned that has been a big problem for the chiefs they are now minus eight\nIn the turnover category this year ... back to throw looking right fires a pass complete on the right side line on the little out wrap up to the midfield strike the passes caught by\nDante heckler [noise] and let's see if there's a flag down on the play the pass if it stands good for about four yards we'll

march it back to the forty one yard line and make it a first down and Fifteen yards to go for the pioneers\nSo big turnover as gates\nScott like he came up and recovered\nThe pitch that went awry back
