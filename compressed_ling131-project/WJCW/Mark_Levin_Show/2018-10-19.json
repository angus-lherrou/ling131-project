this matters more than just you know some sort of gap for some sort of outrage the outrage of the day a Democrat is accusing Jerry cushion or a ring the hit on this guy and working in concert colluding if you will with the Saudi Arabian government and the crown prince\nA ... that's certainly all valid and true but here's the most important thing you need to understand\nAbout this he's one of their stars ... the Democrat\nWhen the house two and a half weeks from today and he is in the leadership\nI mean he's he's he's a rising star ... they're going to give him power more power than he has right now\nThis guy who was peddling a conspiracy theory that is completely debunked unfounded and atrocious he goes on CNN in turn national television and accuses Jared Kushner the president's son in law and a White House advisor\nOf delivering U.S intelligence to Saudi Arabia so that this is a columnist or ... could be killed\nAnd and they're going to give him power\nNow that this may not be the most important election of your lifetime but if you care about the direction of our country for the next two years if you care about anything positive getting done if you care if if you are sick and tired and fed up\nOf the ongoing drama that you see play out in cable and broadcast news on a daily basis with regard to the Democrats are acting hysterical about this president and about this administration than this is a no brainer\nThis really is a no brainer you cannot give Joaquin Castro\nAny more power than he already has in the house of representatives frankly he has too much as it is\nAs a junior congressman from Texas He shouldn't be on that committee with that kind of irresponsible behavior with that kind of irresponsible language by the way he he came out later this is this is amazing he came out later and said I didn't intend\nTo a accused Jared Kushner of any illegal behavior and I didn't intend to accuse Jared Kushner could you\nMay have with U.S intelligence delivered a hit list an enemies with to the crown prince the NBA or Saudi Arabia and that the president may have acted on that\nOne of the people that he took action against Mr ... soldiers get\nI did he did you hear what he just said and\nNow he claims after the fact via Twitter is how they do it these days that I didn't I didn't intend to accused Jared Kushner\nOf calling a hit or doing anything untoward are delivering this information well here's the problem with these Twitter denials these cowards who won't go on television he's fine going on international television on CNN and making this charge\nThe reporting that Jared Kushner may have with U.S intelligence delivered a hit with an enemies with to the crown prince the NBA or Saudi Arabia\nHe goes on international TV and delivers that and then when everyone starts screaming bloody I mean and I'm Talking about liberals I'm Talking about the Daily Beast website which is which is a new left leaning left complete total left the site\nSays I Can't believe that Joaquin Castro did that he doesn't then go on television and has an exchange with anyone no no no no he puts out his apology non apology denial non denial walk back on Twitter\nWhere he says I did not intend to say that Jared Kushner blah blah blah blah blah and of course there is no reporter not that there would be but maybe poppy Harlow over there at CNN would actually a raise their hand and say okay congressman Castro uh I\nUnderstand your statement saying that you didn't intend can you tell us what you did intend to say because it seems pretty dang clear what you said\nAnd and and here's the best part of his denial\nThat never got any follow up and never got any challenging as just accept it oh well he's ... he says he didn't intend to do that so let's just take him in his words they didn't do it he said all I said was there was reporting to the effect that Jared Kushner may have done that and Congress needs to investigate I\nYou see and now and now\nThat's that's the crux of it because\nThey see everything that happens in this town Washington DC everything that's happening down at the border right now everything that you're seeing on cable news night after night after night\nOf it has to do with the midterm election that Kavanaugh hearings that was all about the mid term elections\nThe the the the way the media and the Democrats and some Republicans are reacting to this story of this a columnist for the Washington Post who apparently was killed\nBy officials with the Saudi Government the way they are all react that has everything to do\nWith the midterm elections the caravan is they're calling it of thousands of Hondurans Salvadorans Guatemalans waving their flags and marching across Mexico to illegally cross our border and stay here in this country because they believe they deserve to be here\nAnd we can't do anything about it that has everything to do with the midterm elections\nAnd I in Joaquin Castro's non denial denial via Twitter he revealed something that you need to understand because this is the next two years of our lives if the Democrats when\nHe\nSaid it's being reporting it's being reported that Jared Kushner did this and therefore Congress needs to investigate\nDr Christine Blasey Ford comes forward with an allegation that has no corroboration any witness that she names refugees\nHer story and certainly can't confirm her story it's thirty five\nYears old and nothing anything close to the allegations she made against now justice Kavanaugh had ever been made up until this point but what did the Democrats say what how\nThe allegation is out there and it's very serious so it needs to be investigated in fact we need an FBI investigation and it needs to take\nWeeks and weeks\nAnd not liking Castro adolescent it's being reported so it needs to be investigated and that's\nThe next two years of your life well the New York times is reporting this so it needs to be investigated the Huffington Post is not reported this I don't know if it's true or not but it's very serious it needs to be investigated\n[noise] I\nThink Republicans if they're smart and ... let's be clear the jury is out on that they need to start telling voters in key states and key districts exactly what the next two years are going to be like there should be a picture of representative Maxine Waters holding a gavel\nAs chairwoman of the financial services committee making banking laws and regulations and financial regulations for our nation for our economy\nMaxine Waters chairwoman of the financial services committee you want that for the next two years because that's what you get they need to show Joaquin Castro heck he could be the next chairperson chairman of the intelligence committee\nYou

Hayden keenly the player [noise]\nUh well he was a three star force a new early on you know he was he was like another coach on the field he could really\nAh really wanted to ... scheme wise you know really wanted to know the ins and outs of\nOf everything every opponent and the you know all of our adjustments that we did a weekend and make those on the on the fly and uh you know just a really really smart player and a lot of ability uh really uh you know by both sides of the ball for some more of a defensive player though for\nFor us here at um one of the time if I may be out one of our ... either top two or the or the leader in the interception too you're always around the ball and I'm just made a lot a lot of big place force here in his tenure\nDoes it surprise you what he's been able to do that first year David rocking\nNo because you know he's you know with his upbringing with his mom and dad and and uh you know being around the people he had and that he knows that doing steal what he's going you see is he is a staple on that place down there the other one they do things the right way they\nThey really do a good job of running to the ball and tack on on the fans and allow fans you know they they were really nobody stopped him yet so uh you know it's kinda he's doing a really good job down there\nAnd we build them earlier this morning you know of all the winds have had this year that went on friday when you had to be challenged and you went to over time that they may have been the most impressive one of the year so\nThere you know and ah and any time you go up there to stone castle and can we know that they took us we it was the to the wire to sign the same exact thing you know last play the game and uh\nYou know at at three good teams us and them and Tennessee how all three of us right there at the top of the region won five a that uh you know or are you were hoping there will be successful in the next you know in the in the postseason\nAre are you locked in the one or two then we're going on in Iraq or one or two and I had or what happened I I don't know I've\nBeen looking into scores all you're watching your team coach it just seemed like playing better every week\nWell you know we we really I thought the thought the again kind of gave us say\nA spark has shot in the arm their ... well you know we've we've ah we've really been playing well the last couple of weeks you know scored fifty nine and sixty one you know the last two weeks and\nAll kinds of line has gotten better a quarterback is planning whale and you know and and and we got you know eat and you get some people got Charlie behind the ball off to you know it's\nThat the good things for hill so uh but uh you know like I said we're kind of of of doing some things and you're trying to get our passing I'd gone to a little bit more balanced there\nLater down the stretch but I'm really ticket with the way we are planning out ... ... it's been kind of we give up some big place here they are but you know for the mind mainstay we're we're playing a little bit better over there as well\nIn that light or what Harold has done it quarterback for you both throwing in running the ball trying to balance that out a little bit don't talk about it is here as\nWell so you know going in you know when you lose a kid like nowhere shelled you know you you really you didn't know a lot of people you know what I'm saying you know and what what are you going to a quarter back where we knew each and it was a great\nUh it just a football player he's his leadership has really been the key you know nothing really phases Sam hey uh like I said he's a cow Jonah fail to get in and out of place and just\nHis his demeanor of you know let's go you know being that far a top person in the ... which you don't see that a whole lot um\nOn that side of the ball but he's he's more of a defeat the mentality playing off limits and uh he's had a great year for sand or you know we can get him a going a little bit more here's oil you know I think he's rain for seven hundred yards and the throne for about seven hundred yards too so we hope to get him or you didn't go on on both sides here\nAnd our kids are ready to go um had a great day yesterday a prep in\nUm look forward to two two more days of of good preparation and\nI'm getting ready for bone to come in here on friday and I would have been exciting to\nSingle out any one you want to let's talk about ... and what he means to the football program\nKnow Kate is a you know I call him the coach on the field is a great kid um Haiti he had four point oh no I'm just as good of a football player years he's a better young man and um you know never hear any trouble out of him and are just does what you're asking to do and\nYou know get the ... plays on off pants and you know he'll check into a play and and he'll come to the sideline out say thanks for her making me look like I Know what I'm doing and uh you know he he he just does a great job\nGood leader forced on and off the field\nI mean like I said make make sure we get into right in the rye play in rock\nRespects and things like that and then uh you know the offensively um I'll point out mark Sadler a more quakes and Patty and fork as well um but he's kind of our quarter back on the field on the fat\nYou know get their climbed up correctly and any adjustment that we went over through the weaker or anything that we need to be adjusted especially up for a defensive line you know he gets lined up and and make sure we're in the right front and things like that so\nI'm definitely blessed to have those too on our side you know market thing there are going to be graduating next year and then you know we're fortunate enough to get paid back for one more year next year so\nI'm definitely glad that those two on our side and want to have the game playing against\nHayden generally David rocket what exactly is the playoff standing right now for David Rock and you're you are going to be at home that'd be a first ever right\nThat would be a first ever uh uh with the wind last week uh we did Clinton say I'm a home playoff game um and then um\nYou know being in the war in order to to see 'em depending on how the rest of the season shakes out um I Believe it's between us and boom I'm for those top two spots\nSo both teams would hosts the first round game Daniel Boone or their record is really good at seven in one that I got a day and they looked like they just continue to improve each weekend\nThey do and and and they're they're stream only a discipline and and and uh we'll machine on often thrown into football you know they're they're off into the wind is a good job getting hands on your getting good push a and then they're also they're off in front of the great job of getting up to the second level and um\nYou know they've got to you know a fluid backs back there along with the quarterback run a box really hard um so we'll have to definitely know where those guys are at all times and and play our assignment and do a good job reading your keys and\nUm you know hopefully it'll take us to the football and the defensively you know they get after ... they've got a four guys up there that that really good afternoon and push a lot of scrimmage backwards um a lot of times and the other teams are trying to run the football\nUm their linebacker they're really good job of flown to the football and and do a good job of getting sidelined is on line\nAnd trying to cut you off like that so uh but definitely definitely for us the biggest things will be defensively and I'm not letting him keep the ball for the entire game and things like that\nUm you know Tennessee how was able to do that to us a little bit um so you know that'll be a focal focal point this week and in some coaching points there I'm trying to get off the field on third down I think we gave up I'm a third and Thirteen Thirteen and a third nay on the first half I'm against in the high\nIf we want to be successful friday night you know we've got to be able to get off the field in thirty ...\nWell you don't give up a home game where
