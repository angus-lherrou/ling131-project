of information relating to um the head of the executive branch in his activities\nBut this is day in and day out with this gym accustom its day in and day out and he wants to win is awards from the

cannot a journal your punk you're a self promoting punk that's what you are we learn nothing from your series of self serving idiotic questions nothing\nLaw that's going on in the world he didn't ask a single question during that round anyway about what took place in Pittsburgh did you notice so carrying his of the people who were murdered didn't ask a single question about the president says we're the enemy that nothing\nNow John Carl ABC News they're White House correspondent cut it go\nAnd look for someone who\nVoices rallies or somebody on a man with a\nActual immediate phrase for for

the only person responsible for carrying out either of these heinous acts or the individuals who carry them out it's not the president no more than it was Bernie Sanders\nFault individual who shot up a baseball field is congressional Republicans you can't start putting the responsibility of individuals on anybody but the individual who carries out across Germany\nJohn ... where are you concerned

president fighting back when he was regularly attacked there's a difference does it matter if there's a mid term or not the president's going to defend himself and he's going to fly back\nFrom a political perspective right if you're making that from any perspective but at what point does a national tragedy take precedence over the president needs to punch fast ...\nThat's a fascinating question let me ask you something highly Jackson at one point to the media stopped creating scenarios where the president feels he needs to punch back why have you drag Donald Trump into what a deranged Jew\nHating mass murder did you know he has no responsibility for whatsoever any more than Brock Obama had any responsibility for the fourteen mass murders that took place on his watch

scholars ideas and here's what he said about birthright citizenship and the president by the way the president didn't bring it up\nI heard one of the miscreants on on cable say the president brings this stuff up to divide than they first of all he was asked about it he didn't bring it up secondly it's not about dividing the nation it's about upholding the constitution okay\nNobody really knows how birthright citizenship was instituted we've investigated this\nIt started in the sixties bureaucratic like the old ins started doing triggered it that way as the bureaucracy does this all the time there's been no law passed that conveys birthright citizenship on to illegal aliens\nThere's been no Supreme Court decision that definitively confirmed birthright citizenship onto illegal alien children\nNobody's a hundred percent certain how this came to be\n\nBut everybody seems to be a hundred percent certain that the president can't fix it so the executive branch unilaterally somehow somewhere in the bureaucracy decided to interpret this\nAs it's being interpreted today nobody knows exactly who exactly what office but there it is and so when the president is asked about it and says how did you find out about this yeah we're working on an executive no you can't\nChange the constitution by executive order well does the constitution confer birthright citizenship on the children of illegal aliens\nOf course it doesn't which all explaining a minute that here's the\nCurrent speaker of the house Paul Ryan who is silent for months\nBut now he feels compelled to speak yeah go ahead\nWell you obviously cannot do that um you cannot in birthright citizenship with an executive order we didn't\nLike it when Obama tried changing immigration laws the executive action and obviously as conservatives um you know we believe in in in the constitution [noise] you know the conservative I'm a believer in following the plain text of the constitution and I think in this case the fourteenth amendment ... pretty clear [noise] um and that would involve a very very laying the constitutional process\nThe ignorance on this subject like so many others is unbelievable the speaker of the house who cares not one ... about the history of the fourteenth amendment not one where\nYou have so called experts constitutional experts professors former trial judges in New Jersey who say the same exact same ignorant beyond belief illiterate when they come to the fourteenth amendment\nSo I decided let's play a little piece that I did in twenty Fifteen\nOver three years ago we can go back further but that's long enough to provide a basic foundation of understanding of what those who wrote the fourteenth amendment and ratified the fourteenth amendment actually meant that's got to cut Eighteen go\nAnd yet nobody did a better job of explaining this then professor Edward earlier who I've talked about over the years\nAnd he's a professor at California State University was also at the er Claremont Institute senior fellow there for more than a evidence to me right\nAnd he testified before a subcommittee a Congress many years ago almost Twenty years ago and he set forth the case now he's not the only one professor Thomas west that ah you know ... has professor at the University of Texas law school but even more than them the framers of the constitution\n\nOr set forth that is a primary the fourteenth amendment go\nHave after the civil war three amendments to the constitution the Thirteen fourteen Fifteen called the civil war amendments and we know pretty much what occurred\nProfessor earlier was testifying you said it's my considered opinion Congress has the authority under section five of the Fourth Amendment\nTo define the jurisdiction of the United states of the fourteenth amendment accords and did it as my contention that Congress has exercise that power on many occasions and most recently and immigration reform of control lack of Nineteen eighty six and I would say they also exercise that\nWith the illegal immigration reform an immigrant responsibility act I'm Eighteen Ninety six he points out senator\nJacob how are you are now going to know more

you really get into the substance now we have fun don't get me wrong we do our thing too\nBut we do really get into the substance it's one thing to say yeah yeah yeah obviously the constitution doesn't provide\nThat's not enough that's\nNot enough so when you're in a debate format or political format or a classroom format or this format\nYou need to back it up and that's what we do here we back it up senator Jacob Howard the author of the citizenship clause in the fourteenth amendment he spoke he told us what he meant\nHe defined who would fall within the quote jurisdiction of the

began\nNot even interpreting the constitution just conveying citizenship on the children of illegal aliens there's absolutely no historical basis for this there's no constitutional basis for this there's no statutory basis for this\n[noise] my buddy Andy McCarthy wrote a brilliant piece of national news they just want to do and he said well the fourteenth amendment has been codified was in Nineteen fifty two I think he said well that doesn't really in my humble opinion address the issue\nCodified in the constitution as a way of describing an aspect of a statute is really\nPretty a pretty frequent practice it doesn't really lend anything to interpretation but we know what the authors of the fourteenth amendment meant because they told us we have no real Supreme Court decision\nAre conveying a citizenship on the children of illegal aliens\nAnd then we have Paul Ryan let's play cuts six again Mr moose and Paul Ryan saying that you can't change the constitution with an executive order who is changing the constitution it's the executive branch the president of the United states who is the executive branch checking back the Saudi do interpret and enforce the fourteenth amendment go ahead\nWell you obviously cannot do that um you cannot in birthright citizenship with an executive order we didn't like it when Obama tried changing immigration laws the executive action and obviously\nStops who's changing immigration laws you know I brought as a guest here Daniel Horwitz who's an expert in this area as he is in many incredibly intelligent you write so very conservative review a and a Daniel Horwitz what is Speaker Ryan even talking about\nOh great to be with you mark and first of all condolences on the last year patriot dead he's a he's in a better place\nThank you um you know this is constitutional constitutionally illiterate I cannot relate to what these people are saying let's put this in plain English here basically they're saying mark I could break into your home kicked down the door drop a kid there\nAnd hit the right to live there for the remainder of his life and there's not a darn thing you could do about it even henceforth that's what they're basically saying it's nothing to do with the president there arguing we can't even do this through Congress\nOr the reality is\nThat even if we agree to the notion of birthright citizenship that there is a legal mandate a floor requiring a Congress and the executive branch to issue\nA citizenship to any child of any legal immigrant under any circumstance as the court didn't want kids are a very active his decision but let's agree to that\nThere is no way you could extrapolate that to people who came here without consent a key words are consent and sovereignty nothing ever supersede that nobody could unilaterally\nThe jurisdiction and uh make it that there is nothing we can do to stop this and I think mark more broadly speaking what the disturbing trend we're seeing is that throughout the last number of decades past administrations have actually use the executive power to subvert sovereignty\nIt looks like Trump is doing a lot of things executive Lee but the details matter and what he's doing is actually pursuing the law and as you mentioned there is nothing in statute requiring\nThis and it all actually happened by accident through laziness and lack of enforcement\nExplain that because people are under the impression including the current speaker of the house who's taken an oath to uphold the constitution and some of these fools on TV who pretend they're experts\nThey seemed to think that the fourteenth amendment says what they say it says now were originally this and that includes ... list and you look at the language as intended as written at\nThe time and they tell us exactly what they meant and nowhere do they mean affirmatively giving citizenship to children of illegal aliens\nI think this is where some of our colleagues go awry ... doesn't mean Amelia Delia style liberalism right um even if it didn't say and subject to the jurisdiction thereof if it's just that anyone born in the U.S is a citizen I got news for them\nFor a hundred and Thirty years there's an uninterrupted stream of case law including cases written by the one Kim arc justice Horace Gray saying that if you come here without consent\nAnd you do not have legal status it is in the most literal and physical sense as if you were standing outside of our boundaries in terms of access\nTo the courts in terms of rights in terms of everything so literally you are not on our soil and and that is settled law so when Congress nearly cut and paste the text of the fourteenth amendment in Nineteen fifty two they could've never fathom such an egregious argument\nThat someone who was in Nineteen fifty to the constitution was not interpreted as giving citizenship to the children of illegal aliens\nExactly it's like saying proved to me that the fourteenth amendment didn't mean to mandate gay marriage will I mean no one would have thought that and and and that's the thing here what are the best I could see from my research is that\nFor most of our history we didn't have too many illegal aliens in the early part of the twentieth century it was in the sixties and seventies and eighties it started to grow\nAnd there was never an active decision what happened was because most people um are born here who who are born here are obviously legitimate citizens and we believe in birthright citizenship for illegal immigrants\nHospitals never asked any questions and H H death and the Social Security administration never clamp down on it on the back end how do I know this is true\nBecause everyone agrees that

Ron you had a couple of guys underneath you had a couple of times and the car was able to hang in the second lane up from the bottom is that something that just happened how did you know that you had that outside lane capability there when you started using\nWell you know I really ever since the last couple of years good years brought up a little bit of a different tire that really represent the racetrack and a force their drivers to move up the racetrack at Martin so which we've never will they will get a this higher really allow that ... and uh yeah that last run we're just\nA Helen made some adjustments to try to get our credit fire quicker because we had a shorter run known is only about forty laps or so and um it just didn't like it has a car with\nA off a little bit that Ryan and so I was uh doing all they can to to play the fed is tight as I was in the center I'm you're the only way I can make any speed was moving up the racetrack but the last thing you want to do sometimes when you're at\nAnd Martin houses move up the racetrack 'cause it's not a safe place to be a a that was kinda my only play at that moment\nWell and at the end of the race white black comes out you and Martin going for the win and\nThere was contact on the last lap which is which is resurrected the age old debate about the bumping run would you applied obviously the Martin to get the when um [noise] how long did you know that you were going to have that ... that that moved to play when did you know that that was your final option there to try to get the check or black\nOr going down in the back straight away in the turned three are on the last last that was that was the one that was only move I had left\nAre trying to hold them off your everything I can do for that for that moment but I'm going to have a back stretch says how well this is my only shot at the racetrack and get her beat them\nAnd then there's the aggregate it is our finish line that was that was the goal um yeah it wasn't to the crash tumor in like that which we did um we just say well the push my just enough to get I don't eat them in\nAnd try to uh play the power and and uh like I said have that drag races are finished one\nNone of us can understand the position that you were in because the\nMajority of us have never driven a stock car before and never will but when you get in that position and you know you have that one last option and that option is the bumping run what is it like trying to manage the the exhilaration at the moment the enthusiasm at the moment\nWhile I'm not trying to turn it into a jumping around you know what I'm saying not to go in there too hot and then turned him around like we saw last year\nYeah I think yes as an athlete you find a way to to control yourself in this uh in in those high intensity moments where\nYou think your heart rate may be going through the moon and my my they have done I'm not sure but\nI those moments you trying to find a way to take a deep breath and I remember it to to go I'm going back straight away and we're too wide rate the heck out of each other and I I took a deep breath for a sec yeah just to keep myself or your control than in the right a mindset and making sure I didn't make any mistakes 'cause\nIt was uh about forty qualifying lapse there at the end that you're trying to tie together uh and not make any mistakes at all um 'cause you know with on the line it's not just the race on the line is the championship a possible championship on the line so uh it's just it's a big deal and that's what these playoffs are all about though there is some great that\nA NASCAR is has the situations that\nAre they put these drivers in to to to to make\nIt hard decisions sometimes and it forces the race so hard that that's what that's where a sport knees that's what it's about\nOf course we mentioned that you've already been guaranteed a spot to race for the championship which leaves the next two races\nBasically I don't want to say stress free or reduced stress where you can go out and get the win what's it like now knowing that you're going to Texas this weekend and I assume Raceway the following weekend and you're not in that position where you have to make something happen to race for a championship\nYeah I I don't know if it if it reduces stress this your first part it just you just change the focus some you know we we can go to Texas and the Nixon racist nothing to lose a I Believe that's an advantage and that's pretty cool and there is to cope with that we really want to get 'em\nSo I think that's a nice place to be but it also allows us to shift our focus from a to to Miami and and have that advantage to where I was just build a an awesome car hopefully and and something that we can really race with ... and think about a lot right now\nWell you're going to be thinking about winning AAA Texas five hundred Sunday in Texas motor speedway attract that has been re can figure repay but it looks like the aging process is kicking in from your perspective what type of track is er is Texas motor speedway what can we expect from that mile and a half this coming weekend\n[laughter] Texas is ever since they repay that has really temperate climate or are you got one in ...\nAnd the ... we want to do anything yet to do and then he turned three and four and you're going so fast it's unreal I with all that banking over that and so it's it's a driver it's it's a challenging racetrack for everything with even more challenging I think trying to set up a race car for that uh you know 'cause you have to make that compromise is it's\nReally hard to get both those in a balanced well and and your race car\nWhat's the sensation the speed at Texas like from where you said\nUh I get the three and four is uh is quite the sensation 'cause you're\nYou look at the corner and thinking that I barely going to live at all and and qualifying you might not even left a depending on what the track temperatures are going to be well this is what they should just be for sure\nWell and I know that you're up to the task everybody's up to the task it's the it's the race that marks three races to go in the season and of course it's coming up this weekend through our friends at the performance racing network reshaped to stop the by the spent some time with us from graduations on getting the grandfather clock at Martin's bill and\nCongratulations on being able to run for a championship here two thousand Eighteen\nHam are in the greatest races the\nSort of rotting prime numbered\nLife span that go into the wall to wall\nHe is going to win a holiday mom for this afternoon\nThursday run on Iran dot com on demand on white girl that first day on an RN dot com\n\n[noise] this is NASCAR lived in a nice start selling it is going to\nWelcome back to NASCAR live as you heard there is any press the playoffs so far for young chase Eliot ... Dawson bill Georgia he's already won\nThree times in two thousand Eighteen two of them coming in the last round of the playoffs are ... sat down with chase over the weekend with the latest edition of face to face\nA standard statement of every race when will change Sally when he want to walk in school and he won at Dover just saying he wins in Kansas Speedway ... Hollywood casino more hundred three when\nThe season I don't know the thing you know you win wine once you get your first one and others can easily but from your perspective is that how it felt\nNo I think that's a myth uh personally I don't I mean you know to me the only difference is we've been in better position is I think the last couple of months versus what we were at the beginning of the year or whatever so\nI think that's been the biggest differences just having been in better position opposing a race which is all that kind of gotten just comes out to be a little faster and and me and erases out of the top five\nIf you're doing that and then\nYou know different strategies and things can be relevant to you otherwise you're\nHere on different game plans and and what not further back in the field and doesn't really matter so I think that's the biggest differences just\nRun and better looking at the next round is there one in particular that you feel more than the others that you guys could win and lock yourself into homes that\nI'd like to think any of them I mean I think that's got to kind of be your mindset and um\nI just don't think there's really any room so to struggle a whole lot you know in this round and and uh you know it's going to be tough there's a lot of you know a lot of\nYou know the cars and everybody's going to be pretty good so\nIt's a yeah like I said it's not a lottery here definitely not a lot of room to struggle and then certainly uh can't make any mistakes you know but yeah I like to think any of them you know I think a sexist to me it's probably been or\nAs of late in our biggest struggle since they repay that but um yeah I don't know we'll see\nIs there any fear that he might get complacent because Windsor night than obviously to in the last three is a big deal is there any fear that\nThey might just get you know\nComfortable with the winning situation and not put in the effort that you guys have seen over the last couple of weeks [noise]\nNo I think if we were going to get complacent it would have been this last round and and I was just really uh really excited to see that we did it as a whole\nAnd that's like a mindset was right you know it'd be really easy to take that went in Dover and cruise near the next two weeks and and not to bring our best effort Talladega was was really bad I thought you know in general obviously didn't\nWork out but to go to Kansas and and um\nSay on kill I thought was nice and I think that you know everybody kind of had that mindset said no I don't expect that to change now\nHindering recently announced are going to be a shift in plain Nineteen ...\nKind of work with Lee in Bahrain Kevin injuring maybe not like a Jimmy I Know that it doesn't affect your team specifically but you feel like it's going to pressure not paying over a hindrance in general I mean the\nWhole organization yeah I mean I think it has a has opportunity to um you know I think that uh I think the biggest thing that it's going to do is just make all for cars stronger [noise] um you know I'm I'm excited to see that you know I Know that uh you know obviously judge him you know some great things\nOver the years and then I think everybody kinda misses that narrative and wants to write about all the problems are problems I think they have but I think it you know just one of those things time for a change didn't want to do something different so I think we all need to respect that for one and give them a chance to do something different\nAnd see how it goes so yeah I think it's going to make make everybody better and for better as a hold and we're going to be we're all going to a veterinarian\nCould you encroaching on got potentially be the next challenge Amy because it seems like you guys have finally kind of hit their stride and you know it takes to win and to put yourself out to be ... contender\nYeah I don't know I mean I've\nI've uh I've always enjoyed working with him and I I enjoy our relationship it's really straightforward and simple and and uh he lets me do my thing I let him do his he didn't question me out of question him and that's just you know it's just a simple and you know we were ah\nThis is the mayor and his personality reminds me a lot of my dad and and uh yeah it's been fun to work with them so I don't know the future holds but I've been working with him and and hopefully we can have some some success over the years\nHe recently attended a Metallica concert doesn't seem like you're seen just 'cause I Know you love country music what was it like\nYeah definitely not my thing uh I got kind of a drug into that but it was a it was okay I'm I'm sure I get bash for say they metallic is okay but I just when I Can't hear the words the half of your uh half of your\nSongs um [laughter] I don't think that's for me but I don't know what ... it was for those a lot of people that I enjoyed it and so um I had a good time one of those things where you know they are legendary I guess in their own right so what I said I'm Glad I got to go like I say I went one time\nAny other concerts on the docket coming up uh\nNothing nothing as of as of late so I I don't know why I Need to work from all through the plans because they're pretty boring right now so we're uh we have some work to know the summer working on it will see\nThe new plans on a check or if I find that I'm saying this I thought that he means if that was the first thing you're gonna do when it finally the\nYeah well I don't know I go home for a first and you think kinda figured out from there but yeah I don't know my ass you know I get together whenever background homeless you friends but aside from that I don't know we we should because since I'm In Colorado throughout December and and a new one season's over and we still have\nThe banquet obligations and different better she sings for next year beginning a December so it's not over yet um but once that

I really need to do better at that I\nDon't feel like I'm not do it because I think is not cool I just hadn't been lazy and not going to get a coughing so I Need to work on that I'm guessing you don't have a costume or this year I Know I Know not not even thought about it so we'll see that\nThe Senate place finisher Martin fill this past week has chase on the outside looking in when it comes to the championship for matter of fact\nChase is thirty one points below the cut off line as we had to Texas motor speedway but then again if he wins this weekend in Texas were the following week in Phoenix
