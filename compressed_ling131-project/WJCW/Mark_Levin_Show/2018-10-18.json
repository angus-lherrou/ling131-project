nation they both came to this country as a student with a student visa legally\nDidn't break in and they didn't come in a caravan they didn't chant they didn't yell and they love America and the both of them are still here and both of them love this country and respect our laws and make sure that all their visas and everything are in order they did it the right way\nI have no problem with anybody

just say I'm going to break in your house because I Want your TV I'm not going to go buy my own\n\nThe president's tweet today was what a strong\nAdvocate for a civilized nation sets\nIn you know you look at what the media has done the last twenty four hours Donald Trump is standing with an evil nation in Saudi Arabia\nAgain he hasn't stood with them he said we're investigating we're taking time he said the day before he got on to that helicopter go into a campaign rally it it it seems that he was killed and if that's what the facts they're out\nThere will be a very strong response from this country to Saudi Arabia more than words remember don't trust somebody actions not words when it comes and stuff\nAnd of course they say where's the outrage from Donald Trump it's one of the most irritating things about all of this story with with with Saudi Arabia and I'm using as they compare and contrast to what we're talking about with the with how the media treating him with this caravan of of ... of illegal immigrants coming to America\n\nYou have a president that they say must be outrage and there's an outrage enough on this one story but then they say this president being outraged over the immigrants coming here legally shows that he's on hands and he's a terrible person a should calm down and she'll be loving\nWhich one is it to the media which one is you want a president that defends his country and fight for the country's interest ... like he's doing with these illegal immigrants care venting to the United states and then when he does that you criticize him for doing it saying he's on hands these crazy and he's mean and even when he's so many of these poor little people meanwhile he says about Saudi Arabia which again\nI hate that this journalist was murdered\nI also hate that the media acts like journalists are somehow more important than average people\nI'm In the media I don't think my life has any more important than anybody else listening I don't think my life has any more unique than any other person's listening I don't think that my job is it makes me any more significant in society\nOr should make me any more significant in society compared to someone else is just doing it normal hard day's work in something else that maybe doesn't get you quote famer or notoriety or whatever you want to call it the media is so self righteous that if one of their own gets tack they all come into ... and they all freaked out and they all go into overdrive over it\nAnd and the fake outrage is have you not been paying attention to the human rights abuses with Saudi Arabia do you not realize that they have killed women because the women were raped\nThey they give lashing to women who were raped because they were sexually and pure did they just allow women to drive and the only reason why they limited driving Saudi Arabia's because they were taking so much heat for human rights abuses against women they're like All right screw it let's give them a license that will shut up the world\n\nEvery president in my entire lifetime has had a relationship with Saudi Arabia I didn't ... and Saudi Arabia has been brutal you still in Saudi Arabia they will they will literally take off a limb they will cut off fingers they will cut off risk they will cut off arms they will cut off legs they will cut of meat\nAs part of punishment\nThey will give lashing to old people and young people in the hundreds and hundreds of lashing they will throw people in prison who are dissidents or do criticize the government they been doing that for as long as I've been on this earth\nAnd I didn't see any of this fake outrage from the media when Bill Clinton was having relations with Saudi Arabia and I'm not talking about sexually I Know we have to clarify what Bill Clinton\n\nNo one was freaking out when Obama had relations with Saudi Arabia\nThey weren't riding these articles they weren't they weren't demanding more out of ... Brock Obama with human rights my point is the only reason why this one has gotten headlines and has taken a life of its own because it was a member of the media and it's horrific what happened to him but his ... but the media who's acting like this is something we must\n... where I mean the media saying we we demand sanctions basically because of what Saudi Arabia did to this guy that's been happening to other people in Saudi Arabia for as long as they've been alive who are writing these articles it's fake outrage\n\nI don't like how Saudi Arabia does things I also know why we are an ally with them because they're extremely tough on terrorism and that part of the world and they do things that we don't do\nWe also need a place that we can land we also need a place that we can fire we also have it for oil interests whether you like it or not Democrats or Republicans have agreed that relationship with Saudi Arabia is incredibly important\n\nThey've agreed that it's important they've all said it's important Obama agrees with Trump and Trump agrees Obama and Obama agrees with Bush Bush grades with Clinton and Clinton agrees with the other Bush and the other votes agrees with Reagan Reagan agrees with\nJimmy Carter we've always had these relations with them\nAnd so now because they do something they've been doing my entire life and it was ... towards a member of the media now we're supposed to put in sanctions and change American foreign policy\nWhen we've known that this is the only been dealing with all along\n\nSo I gave you that compare and contrast so now how Donald Trump's a villain because he threatened to send US military to protect America's border and they say this is too strong it's there's two main meanwhile they're saying we want you to be mean and we want to be strong with Saudi Arabia 'cause we demand at because one of our own was ... was murdered which one is it\n\nHow is it the same demeanor from the same guy can be one eighty from one another all based on your perspective although I'm a journalist and I'm going to be bigger and better than you are and most journalists believe that they are better that their life is more important than your life\nMost journalists are self important I\nCan't use the word I Want to use\n...

reason why I say that is based on facts and the way that she tried to destroy Brett Kavanaugh with no facts\n\nWhere she did everything in her power to destroy a good man and his family name all because in the name of politics\n\nShe has now come out with an idea that many Democrats are very excited about\nSays that American families that are making less than a hundred thousand dollars a year should be eligible for a monthly tax\nWhere's that six thousand a year\nUnder new legislation they announced today by the Democratic party this democratic US Senator Camilla hairs of California\nShe then went on to say that individuals making less than fifty thousand dollars a year\nShould be eligible for up to two hundred and fifty dollars a month that would be three thousand a year\nNow she said quote Americans are working harder than ever but stagnant wages mean they can't keep up with the cost of living increases that is why Americans are working harder than ever before right\nNow because of jobs are good and the and the economy's good and many people went from part time employment the full time employment and wages are increasing\nEverything she just sit in that sense is is is nothing but a ... a lie and for all the people that I ever are obsessed with the fact checking every Republican and everything that Donald Trump says why aren't you fact checking her on that because that statement in our own words is why\nI'm not going to focus on that for ... that's that's almost like a technicality like compared to what I'm about to tell you\nHarris's office as she rolled out this plan today cited a two thousand Seventeen survey from the website bank right dot com they found that more than half of Americans cannot afford a five hundred dollar\nUnexpected expense such as it rent increase a medical bill or childcare\nNow bank rate survey came out and it said their headline of this phone survey went and found the article says just four and ten Americans have savings savings they rely on in an emergency\nSo what\nYou have is you have come out of hairs are saying okay Obama phones aren't enough anymore to get somebody to vote for me because people can actually pay for their own darned phone bill now\nFood stamps or not enough because people are walking away from food stamps where we are seeing record numbers of people fall off of food stamps because they're actually getting good jobs where they're being employed in the great economy and they're providing for themselves government aid to keep people in poverty is not enough so now I got to do something new I got to tell you that you still need more help from the government\nAnd I'm going to do it because of a website called bank great dot com that found that more than half of Americans cannot afford to pay five hundred dollar unexpected expense\nLet me just explain to you how worked this logic is this idea is\nI'll go back to her first part of our proposal she said American families making Ninety nine thousand nine hundred nine dollars a year\nCould be eligible for a monthly tax credit of up to five hundred dollars or six thousand dollars a year\nAnd the reason why she wants to give you that money every month this because she says you don't have you haven't saved a five hundred dollars for an unexpected bill that could come in with the rent increase of medical bill or child care so she wants to give you a government subsidized money\nSo that you making nine hundred nine thousand nine dollars a year\nHave an extra five hundred dollars so that she can pay for your unexpected expense\nNow my my quick question for you is this what makes you think that if you give somebody who's making nine hundred or Ninety nine thousand let me make sure I said it's number correctly because I said it wrong a moment ago so people on the left will freak out so that said it wrong so I'll correct it right now calm\nDown you're making Ninety nine thousand nine or nine dollars a year\nAnd you can't save for five hundred dollar unexpected expense you're an idiot\n\nWhat makes you think that idiot who's making that much money\nIs going to take your government money and then go Oh thank you you just said me for my unexpected next expense of five hundred dollars I'm going to save that money because at the same dumb a hasn't saved five hundred dollars of is Ninety nine thousand dollar a year job\n\nRemember when we had the tax credit that came out the Bush tax credit member that what happened everybody took their tax money and they would they do with it they went out and bought a ton of crap and boost the economy and George Bush and those economists around them are right people to save that money they got extra money and they went out and spin it right away\nDon't look at the stats\n\nCan airs she knows that they're not going to say this money for five hundred dollar unexpected expense they're going to take this money immediately just spend every dime of every single month on average\nThe idea that someone making fifty thousand dollars a year if you give them an extra two hundred and fifty dollars a month of the government's money which is our taxpayers' dollars subsidizing people to make under a hundred thousand dollars a year but there are now going to save that money every month for an unexpected medical bill or child care you're an idiot\n\nTwo hundred and fifty dollars a month is not going to save someone's life it means that they don't know how to budget\n\nThis is nothing more than buying votes this is not about ... and the fact that you're doing this under the under a survey from bank great dot com is the reason why we need legislation in this country which she announced today\nThat is going to save America's middle class by giving them extra money among subsides from the government that now they're going to save that\nMoney and not spend it on whatever the crap they're spending their money on now that they're going to become more responsible with that money compared to the other a hundred thousand or making your ... is just liberal incompetent see at its\nBiggest form you can make\nBring this to a ... a family level if I'm making Ninety nine thousand dollars a year and I called my dad and said dad I man I had a flat tire this morning can you can you let me borrow two hundred bucks I don't have it\nMy dad would tell me to drive on the darn fair and get my house in order in my life in order and stop being a screw up\nHe would not loaned me the money because if I'm making Ninety nine thousand dollars a year he would say you're an idiot for not saving any of that I Am thousand dollars a year if I was making fifty thousand dollars a year to use her other example\nAnd I had a flat\nTire and I call my dad or my mom and I said hey mom look I'm only making fifty grand\nI just had a flat tire I have no extra savings I Can't deal with this unexpected tire expense can you please send over five hundred dollars or two hundred and fifty dollars to use their math ... I I Would hope my mom would hang up the phone on me\nIn fact I Hope she would say I'm embarrassed by you\nYou're an embarrassment to the family get your life together you moron and then hang up on me\nThis is nothing more than buying votes\nThis is nothing more than welfare on a higher level than the welfare that we're currently in that they've been offering instead of food stamps you're offering people cash because they're not getting the food stamps anymore so you still got to keep them addicted to you\n\nYou still got to get them addicted to ya that's what you got to do just get them addicted to you won eight seven seven\nThree one thirty eight eleven one eight seven seven three eight one thirty eight eleven than Ferguson filling in for Marco then we'll be right back\n\nYour data is everywhere data breaches Facebook breaches big companies mining and sharing your information these are legitimate companies but they are putting you at risk and now you at in all the crux since ... cameras and the risk of ID theft it's insane look the best thing you can do is protect yourself and your family it's why I switched to my\nId care for identity protection they're the best in the business\nTo plant starting from less than ten dollars a month and only my\nId care offered say one hundred percent money back recovery guarantee you can sign up at my\nId cared dot com slash mark my id care has taken care of fortune five hundred companies for years but now they're protection is available to people like you and me and you my listeners also get Fifteen Percent off at my\nId carried dot com slash mark and our promo code marked learn more and then let my id care take care of you my id care dot com slash mark ... mark that's my id care dot com slash marks enter ...\nUse credit card debt and ruining your life\nFrom what was one find us on ... gas or wherever you listen to your I guess\nThat's a good day to make me applied individual results may vary the website for details\nI'm buying a huge flat screen TV so I can finally see it without my glasses why can't really\nThat's what I'm hearing my glasses and contact her pain I I'd love to finally get rid of these but\nWho can afford lasik you can\nBecause some basic mission is to do is offering dramatically low prices and an absolute free consultation tax we're nine nine two three five zero three five zero the basic vision Institute has already perform over a million procedures they use the latest FDA approved lasik technology\nThat helps the majority of patients itchy twenty twenty vision for a fraction of what others charge\nLet her vision better value the late sixties she needs to to make this year you finally get lasik for a free consultation plus an extra twenty percent discount text and clear nine nine to three five zero three five zero you'll see for free if lasik is right for you that the L E A R nine nine to three five zero three five zero\nOr life with Dr Sanjay [noise]\nHow many of you mom and dad steel like extra curricular have\nGotten out of control [noise] I'm Dr Sanjay Gupta scene in the medical course now I've got three daughters let me tell you I can relate to my girls and involved in a different afterschool activity in sports on the weekends that's a challenge to get all three where they need to go it's important to them it's important for that\nBut what's it doing to us parents scene and help contributor elicits drowsy says it's important to ask yourself\nWhat do you mind me fit into all of this\nHappiest parents she says tend to have a hobby or an extra curricular of their own [noise]\nAnd when it comes to your kids make sure you understand\nWhich activities they actually enjoy and which ones they might feel a little ... pressured into doing most of all don't forget the importance of and the growth that comes from an structure play time I'm Dr Sanjay Gupta helping you with a better life\nIn law who do I performed for\n... and composer whose new deserves the hiring\nPerform for all of a stagehand\nMake sure I never missed a Q\nPerformed for high school choir director who taught me to breathe send the guy saying I'm going to\nA speech to page theater using\nThe performing arts teach valuable life lessons that typically aren't taught in the classroom they help high school students learn leadership skills that prepare them to enjoy more satisfying productive lives\nThis mindset misses having my high school debate kind of would help me become more confident than an average ...\nThis message presented by the tendencies secondary school athletic association and the high school in your commute [noise]\nFor them to not be nine Seventy I listen to the show would be ...

you're going to keep an open minded as bad though right\n\nIt would be funny\nIf this wasn't exactly what they're saying all over the country in the Democratic party\nThis would be humorous if they weren't chanting it\nAll over the country you know you look at what Nancy Pelosi said\nAnd about people that she doesn't like now and she's coming after me Nancy Pelosi she she genuinely hate you and she made it clear in the last couple of days\nThat Joe is running for for Senate as it is ... ... and he's got a legitimate he's a legitimate candidate against Ted Cruz make no mistake about this there was an angry appetite destroyed Donald Trump and that those running not really against Ted Cruz as much as he's running against Donald Trump and when he just said was this vote for me and I'll help overthrow government\nImpeaching someone because you don't like them impeaching someone because\nHe didn't vote for you you didn't vote for him or you don't like him or you don't want whatever however you want to say it that you're in a free and fair election\n\nYou had someone that was elected in a free\nElection free and fair election and they say we\nWant to over throw a free and fair

what they're running awesome is pure hatred and the idea that we should in fact overthrow a government\n\nIf you are a Democrat and you're in favor of this\n\nImpeachment of president because you lost an election you know I can you were advocating for throwing a government\nDonald Trump whether you like it or not won an election in a free and fair election whether you like it or not I did not like it when rock Obama was president for eight years but I never once mentioned overthrowing the government I lost an election fair and square\n\nRock Obama won not once but twice\nI respect it to the office of the president I respected how our democracy works I respected the vote church\n\nThey don't respect anybody\n\nYou know you look at you look at what better to just sit here this is how
