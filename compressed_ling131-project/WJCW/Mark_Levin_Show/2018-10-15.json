U.S impose the sanctions on Riyadh they will stab its own economy to death\nBecause oil prices to soar to two hundred dollars a barrel leap Saudi Arabia to permit a Russian military base in the city of to book and drives the middle east into the arms of Iran\nThe overall message that they have repeatedly been hearing from the Saudi Government has been one of the science denial they're claiming that time I left the conflict the same day that he might ... not provide any evidence to back that claim which is another reason why they're just so many questions surrounding all of that correspondent\nRight exactly and what is it I mean I always thought well maybe I just have a misconception of what I\nWould like in a man and maybe it's unrealistic and maybe I Am looking for something that just not out there my why is it that men just are not being as authoritative as women with like these is\nA a you know I don't want you to overthrow did a good sounds like but can I highly as a single leader and it's really because so many men today really weren't taught\nThese things just like us to learn these things come naturally to them\nAnd you know we learned from her father or another male role model and just seeing so many boys today they grow up in families and parents are divorced or if they're not divorced her father's work long hours or maybe the forefathers were just like Syria or they weren't really a healthy role model\nYou know they go to school most teachers are women they watch television men are portrayed as you know and cable buffoon Z\nAnd so when you say to them you know you got to be a leader and make decisions will take responsibility and don't blame your wife when something goes [laughter]\nRight so it's like they were shocked at ever heard this before we got to be given talks to groups and all of explain these ideas and mental turn to them and say he's not right that's a little more than one [laughter] yeah listen to them that's exactly what women want\nExactly so what kind of woman do instead of getting so frustrated with her husband where I feel like she could then start lashing out\nOut of just being upset she just starts getting mad and that's when fights are because the husband doesn't understand why she's on his hate so much what could a woman do you encourage the guy to be the man that she wants him to be\nWell versed ask him to take charge of a situation see men like a lot of times it doesn't matter to them or do you do you handle it or if he's afraid of being criticized anything's Lewis was playing it safe if you're just avoid leadership so he doesn't realize you know she's losing respect for him so I'm going to protect Georgia association but don't tell them what to do\nThat and I just say well I don't know do research on what I Do and then you know don't contradict him 'cause you know it's like it's like a sampling of trying to encourage them to grow and be a leader so\nDon't contradict them unless you know he's going to do something very dangerous and then when he finally does it and realize he may handle it differently than you but that's OK will tell them how much you appreciate them and praise them for doing it and the same thing with the surgeons you know if he says you know you want to go to restaurant restaurant they just said\nYou decide and then don't say another word\nRight on the side\nSo that um yeah the hill says so they're all about them as minor thing I'm being a nice guy a letter to the side I'm showing her I'm not controlling\nSomebody wants anybody controlling but this is a mud or can make a decision so I've heard so many women say this is it's really fascinating and then the men just don't get it that you really have to teach it to them and the courage to let them make the decisions don't criticize on that it was a bad decisions as well as we learn from it\nSlid right I don't encourage them\nYeah and that's a really good point because I think women demand that guy make a decision but then when they do like you said they might be criticized there's ever been arguing with them with a guy thing though that my father why bother making that decision\nFor you they feel and there might I'm playing it safe I that's what she can criticize me things around but she goes through the size ... said well why don't you let me make that decision you knew it wasn't the right thing to do one and to say anything that you know\nJust let them decide and his men don't really realize that the woman really wants them to be a man and a shows a leadership a lot of controlling tiring but\nOne step forward you see a problem step forward and that's what I tell him and you know how do you so much is over the leader look for ... not being dealt with the need to be dealt with adult you know she's handling it don't undermine or for look for the situations but not being dealt with stuff for a little find a solution to implement that\nAnd just keep doing it it's like whoa it's like you'll become beer hero 'cause that's what you want\nYeah exactly now what do you do because there are certain things I say to my husband I really wish you would take care of them at the end of things that I really wish you would look into this I really wish everything didn't fall on me and he would just say well I'm not good at that stuff you're better at it than I Am\nBut I just the way she would try to take their little minor things so how do I encourage that\nWell if he says he's not going to decide but no I think you'd be very good at it I really would like to take care of us and and and please take care of it and then don't say anything more just let them do it just\nDoesn't it doesn't get done and sits around and nothing gets done [laughter]\nWell I Do say this done by such and such a date could you please take care of it to send an in no more you said your show that you really mean it I knew praise him his men like to be praised women's who you know but everybody likes to be president really feel that their workers value they don't want to be heard and I was just so\nNo I think you you know the right person to make this decision I think you're a you know I Know your background you have the ability to those really well so please take care of it 'cause I I don't I'm going to mess up [laughter]\nYeah yeah I like that so you are the author of seven non fiction book in addition to this one what here or there bucks revolve around what types of ...\nWell you know they're they're all those are all outdoors books like that's what I was a really enjoy their books about the hiking bicycling so\n[laughter] but then I I like this book is being was ... so far of a story of\nA grandfather going with the rent on on a hike and they and the grandfather teaching the grandson these insights that men need to learn that he didn't learn from his own father and and you know 'cause he's having problems with his marriage and you can understand that while his wife was so frustrated with them\nThat's the thing like men thing I mean so nice I mean so non controlling why and she fed up with me why she's so frustrated with me so that women say to me you know my husband and I understood those are ... out of disintegrated you know or a single woman say how could I get married with a man who will take responsibility\nYou know and he wants to marry him I'm trusting him with my life and he's he passes\nA hundred percent ... alley cats and this is all great advice I cannot wait to read the book being the strong man and woman wants timeless

part of what I Love\nTo do is going to see Broadway shows and I'm lucky enough to be located here in New York City\nSo even though I haven't seen one and quite a while because my baby with a newborn and then things just get really busy I finally got back to the theater and I went to go see here of enhanced and last week and it was incredible\nAnd I don't know if there was a dry eye in the theater it was so impactful and so amazing and I feel like I probably would have felt emotionally connected whether or not I'm a mom but the fact that I'm now a mom and I\nWatched the dynamic between Evan hand than his mom\nThe other family in the show it was so powerful and still meaningful and so many levels and so I just to kind of tell you how much I enjoyed it so if you are visiting New York city or if you do live here this is definitely a show you have to see especially the parents\nAnd I can't believe the show has been open do reading on Broadway\nFor two years almost did open a Broadway the music box theater in December twenty sixteen it broke all box office record it's still playing to sold out house which is incredible\nThe show and fix Tony Awards including best musical also one that's twenty Eighteen Grammy Award for best musical theater album and Taylor trench who just joined the Broadway company is Evan Hanson he joined in February twenty Eighteen he was starting alongside Bette Midler David Hi Pearson hello Dolly\nIs incredible and he took on the role and he made it his own and he just really draws you and what's really exciting now that you're Evan Hansen is that they just launched\nTheir first national toward this month in Denver so even if you can't make it to New York city the show is going to play more than fifty city over the next few years the production will also have sit down production in Toronto and London so\nDefinitely a show I recommend go get the cast album it's amazing and I have to say you know I had heard some of the songs before I went to see the show\nBut I just didn't realize how the show is going to play out based on those songs and even the woman that was sitting next to me she says yeah I I knew the music but I just thought that there was a different story line and\nSo that's what's so neat about this it really is still a very unexpected storyline and there's the prizes around every corner and I just I worry about it because I just thought it was so such an important show\nFor both parents and children and teenagers\nTo see and I don't want to over explained the plot because I Want to leave it to you but I Will say that it does tie in to anxiety and children and teenagers and\nFor that I wanted to bring an expert on to the show and I have with me ... and she is a psychologist speaker and parenting coach with over ten years of international experience working with children and parents with emotional and behavioral difficulties as low as adults with mood and anxiety issues\nTheodore thank you so much for joining me today a Hi Michelle thank you so much for having me shores so tell me you know I think a lot of times parents\nDon't realize how prevalent anxiety might be within children whether they're younger in elementary school middle or high school what was your experience as a psychologist in working with parents who are maybe have children who are going through anxiety issues\n[noise] yeah well one of the the most important things really is to understand what the symptoms of anxiety are and they do appear to be somewhat different with with younger children as compared to\nAdults but I think overall there are I'm very few surprises there in quite a few overlaps in in terms of the symptoms so\nFor younger children\nOften manifest through ... behavior so things like not wanting to be too far away and the parent or caregiver and not feeling well or with new and you know unknown settings and people there's there's just a nervousness there\nUh that isn't that difficult spot actually and again with younger children especially we'd you often see physical symptoms come up so things like headaches and stomach aches um inability to hold down food things like that you might often you hear the you know I Can't do\nX Y or Z because my company hurts\nAnd then in terms of the the emotions and the the behavior of this\nThings there that I think a really important for parents to just kind of keep a lookout for so\nWhat you often tend to see is that a couple of our oldest emotions will play out and these are angry and fear and it's important to be aware of the fact that anxiety does come from fear um and and to set the Tories fear and so you're likely to see your child exhibited this emotion different ways and for anyone who has seen 'em\nInside out the fantastic Disney Pixar film you may remember the antagonistic relationship between fear and anger so anger was always bowling fear\nWhy well because if you're afraid I'm you're feeling insecure if in vulnerable and powerless and the shortest path to feeling powerful again is getting herself worked up angry no you'll often see anxious kids and kids by the way exhibiting this angry behavior so\nThese are some of the things to to keep in mind in terms of what to look out for if you do suspect that your child is experiencing some anxiety\nYeah and that's one thing in the show deer Evan Hansen there are two children in the show who both are experiencing anxiety but they do play it out in different ways one maybe a little more reserved and afraid to mingle with his classmates and another comes across as that fully\nYeah yeah absolutely that's an absolutely accurate a portrayal of\nKind of the emotional dynamic that goes on and that was one of the reasons why I and I'm so many of my colleagues globally I think we're so impressed with inside out as well because they they really got that dynamic\nSpot on 'em and from the sounds of it that show did as well there's definitely that interplay between the fear based emotions anger based emotions and then with with certain children again every child will be a little bit different but sometimes you may also see\nThat in moments of of great overwhelm as a result of the things id children may shift from showing 'em anger even fear to showing sadness this cleanest again that I mentioned before um and withdraw as well if it just all becomes you know a little bit uh too much for them\nRight and so what kind of parents do what would be the first step that a parent can take if they see this in their child and they're wondering is this something that they're going through\nRight right so one of the the things that I think parents\nI'm also need to to keep in mind especially if they have a more than one child and if they have boys and girls as well\nAs at girls do tend to experiencing anxiety more than boys do and this is true for depression as well and we would need kind of a whole other conversation to they're going to the biological and hormonal developmental reasons for that but I think that the first and most important thing for\nI'm Dr Sanjay Gupta CNN chief medical correspondent kids like labeling things like rules kids like putting things in little compartment so perhaps it's no surprise that partition plates with pictures of different foods in each section got preschoolers to eat more vegetables\nLead author of this new study out of the University of Colorado Denver said this is a really important time period and children's lives to experience fruits and vegetables she found the kids were often are eating in a food the veggies relax according to the USDA two to three year old should be eating about a couple of fruits\nAnd vegetables everyday beyond the increased veggie consumption these kids' teachers said the

you a paragraph or two and a few minutes I have left in this hour uh for peace to war and stop mass hysteria she got a flavor what I'm Talking about if you think I'm only on one side of this area you're mistaken\nDuring the summer of Eighteen sixty eight rumors spread that radical Republicans were quietly provoking blacks are riot mhm I wrote that\nBy fall hysteria among southern whites was growing and two shipments of arms arrive for the purpose of arming Democrats [noise] it was shut that a large Republican gathering plan for Washington a village north of overlooks this was a cover for black plans to pillage\nThe gathering it last at least was real and peaceful if they use the word spread most likely I'm sure that hundreds of all I'm white men were hiding in nearby woods at one point a white supremacist leader pointed the gun Bentley's had speeches worker tail and the gathering broke up without significant violence\nLess than a week later Bentley wrote about the washing them gathering and the Landry progress\nIn the piece she called out the Democrats for their tactics\nOn the morning of September twenty eighth indignation and anger was transformed into mass hysteria but mass hysteria with the will to mandate and the tools to set things right mass hysteria that didn't burn off with the settling of a single score three Democrats visited the school ... see I'm trying to show you that when I\nStudied the history of mass hysteria in this country\nIt cuts across both sides of the aisle you have to understand that this is a very fair a book I realized that Democrats Democrats will not by it because their minds are made up and they're all basically bigots they begin to towards anyone who works for a living and bigoted towards anyone who loves America particularly those who voted for Trump\nAnd that's a sad state of affairs so what can you do except try to tell the truth and now let's look at\nThe website the one stop shop for me on civil rights movement being led by Hillary Maxine Waters and dams young Muslims Doug beats up elderly Jewish man of Brooklyn uh that's not in the San Francisco chronicle doesn't make the protocols of the hours of

fourth\nWhich would respond to one great great great great grandparents would not qualify lying Warren for membership and aiding the enemy Native American tribes nor justify her claims to Native American identity\nMoreover as Breitbart News was John ... noted today percentage wise Elizabeth Warren can claim somewhere between zero point one percent to one point five six percent native limit

actually care about any of this it's it's crazy the whole thing we know that warrants claims to Native American identity was a complete fraud and we know that she's still pulling a fast\nOne on the

correspondent Clarissa war\nSaudi Arabia is preparing a report in which they will acknowledge that Jamal ... she was killed in Saudi conflict that it was not intentional that it was the result of a ... a botched operation\nA a a botched interrogation that was likely supposed to end up in in a kidnapping or abductions are taken from turkey presumably back to Saudi Arabia\nPresident Trump has gotten a firsthand look at the devastation caused by hurricane Michael in Florida and Georgia\nYou know listen there's these tax cuts and wealthy people are going to do well under these types of of course they are they're wealthy they pay a lot of money impacts is of course they're gonna do well under a tax cut that's not the question the question is are middle class Americans working Americans going to do well to what is the economy going to grow\nBut it's not a Republican just answering like that oh yeah\nOh they haven't been a hawk and they're terrified and they'd backtrack and they let people like Leslie stall run the table\nBy framing framing the question to advance a narrative they are not looking for an answer they're looking to put you in a corner\nWhat Trump did in that interview was just beautiful and it is a PHD course in owning the lives completely\nIs a PHD course in how to handle the liberal media he does not accept the premise of the question and turns the question to an answer he wants to answer not in ...\nSir that's already a you know that they they think they're going to get out of abide by a pre existing narrative in trying to advance he re frames it in his way\nPerfect example was the question about the Washington DC with Trump starts talking about how bad the media is\nThis is a a this is Trump's narrative it's a narrative that is true by the way that the media is biased against the American people were weapon to be conservative or even moderate Republicans this is a that's a that's a almost taught a logical\nTrump knows that Trump is comfortable with that territory talking about the media and they're biased towards working class Americans and others right so what does he do we re frames Lesley Stahl who's smart\nShe's listening she's not dumb she's very bright she's just the liberal says liberal you know pretending to be a journalist right\nShe automatically census Trump's getting into this media war she knows that works for him and she tries to stop them she cuts them off by the way she interviewed him I I saw something on Twitter the sixty four times and when they interviewed Obama they interrupted him four times\nBut we figured that because that's what they do right she interruption to stop 'em\nBecause she knows she's now playing on on on the way basketball court here\nShe knows she's playing and his territory she tries to stop him and he doesn't have it he doesn't have it he keeps going and going because Trump knows that authenticity cells and he's going to be authentic even if it comes with battle scars at all\nThat's Trump's MO he is not going to talk and focus group test the talking points he's going to talk like Donald Trump talked period and the story right\nSo the takeaways here\nFor anybody thinking about it or ... or interested at all in running for office becoming a conservative activists takeaway number one is you re framed the question to reframe the arguments went answer you want to get not to the pre existing narrative they want to advance\nTrump does it all the time watch you know folks\nThey sell this guy short constantly constantly the liberal media paints this guy as some kind of a buffoon yet he is constantly having them back on their heels\nSo it makes no sense\nNow he did something else that support not just any turn around and reframe this thing\n\nHe got the last word in this is critical he would not let Leslie stall that sixty minutes and if you get the last word he gets a last words he did it constantly and he did it one time and what happened what's the benefit of getting the last word on this is simple this is really easy\nTo benefit of getting the last word in is Utah class then that's what everybody remembers\nSalt tries to stop 'em on when he goes on this uh when he goes on attack with the media right and he keeps going and then he says at the end and you know Leslie ... and that's why I'm president and you are not and boom that's what everybody remembers at the end\n\nFolks that's what I think this is the tough time the media is having with this guy they don't understand that it's the sense of\nAgain a battle scars and all and authentic natural way of conversation sometimes it's sometimes it's heated sometimes it's not there are hills and valleys there are the natural vicissitudes of the ... because of the conversation he goes up he goes down but when he hits hits hard\nThat people are attracted to that authenticity\nSo he understands he has to reframe it number one and secondly he understands fully that he needs to get that last word in and he did and that's what everybody remembered because I'm president and you are not\nNow\nThe reason I bring this up is not to just you know law does performance at the point out what he did but to show you how that performance contrast what's what's going on in the Democrat Party right now which is a just a litany of frauds in and out of the people who are completely inauthentic who they're they\nBased their entire campaigns around identity politics in class warfare and it's collapsing everywhere exhibit number one Elizabeth Warren that I\n... I mean who what other presidents other than Donald Trump what other forget about president what other Republican anywhere\nAnywhere in the in the entire movement could have gotten a ... a major party presidential candidate twenty and twenty twenty which everybody knows Elizabeth Warren is going to be to actually released a press release indicating that she's possibly one one thousand and twenty fours\nNative American who else could have gotten so much to do something so stupid folks who ever is running the PR shop in Elizabeth Warren staff\nShould resign for a felony level political malpractice immediately I have no idea what you think you were getting out of a press release indicating that your great\nGreat great\nIs it for grade so I'm not even sure for three great grandmothers back may have possibly been Native American I don't know what you think you were getting at is but it was quite possibly the dumbest press release in political history\nWho else could have done that\n\nTrump has a unique ability I'm telling you to constantly owned the lives by driving them when Saturday\n\nThis is entirely inauthentic\nElizabeth Warren will not let this go ... go let aces embarrassing do you understand how this plays\nTo the average working class Americans sitting there toiling for a living at a whatever kind of a job you're working hanging sheet rock driving trucks\nPlumbing electric work you're an architect you got to sit here and listen to a woman who put down on her for them to gain some kind of advantage that she had Native American a Native American heritage wrote an entry in a cookbook about powwow chow\n\nThat's real by the way it is and and as possibly one one thousand the twenty fourth America this is I'm not give it a Democratic Party a vise I'll just say you constantly wonder gosh how did Trump beat us how did Trump beat us because he's just a normal guy\nBattle scars and all your people are fakes you got this guy in Texas I'll bet I'll

message cells because of an authenticity that authenticity is not necessarily without battle scars I'm not suggesting you know anybody here is without sin I'm simply suggesting that one of the messages that resonates with the American people is\nHe's a plane speaking authentic guy who says what's on his mind and after fifty plus years of PC politics and focus group tested nonsense this cells\nI bring that up in relationship to the sixty minutes interview where I I thought he just dismantled Leslie stall\nI Know it because I've got friends of mine who were union workers up in New York am I going to say who because honest to God I'm afraid they'll be targeted but who texted me during the interview like I Can't believe how great to be with\nContrast that with the frauds on the Democrats' side Elizabeth Warren putting out a press a press release today that she won five trillion Native American or whatever it was one one thousand uh twenty fourth or whatever it's so ridiculous the guy running against ...\nIn Texas who whose whose entire campaign seems to be that he ... he can skateboard and play the guitar as if this\nIs that's great that's wonderful what the

Gillum running down here for governor in Florida\nHe's got their socialist they don't want your money they want the whole economy\nAnd they try to frame it in this off the rich people the rich people are getting over they're not paying their fair share really\nBecause I saw a fascinating piece today I got a lot to cover thing but I saw a fascinating piece and Bloomberg of all I'm not a big huge fan of the ... but once in a while they have good articles on economics and Bloomberg of all places talking about the actual\nPercentages the rich and the very rich of our income tax they actually pay these numbers are going to blow your mind\nHere's the first\nIf I say let me just say through something numbers so much it's the comparisons\nYou'll see what I mean I'm In the top\nOne percent of earners that's right earners people earn money\nTop one percent of earners\nPay an astonishing thirty seven point three percent of the income tax load in this country\nI think about that one out of a hundred people\nPay thirty seven cents of every dollar in taxes in this country\nChew on that one for a minute you may say okay well\nYou know that one out of a hundred people at the top one percent they're very rich\nFolks the bottom Ninety percent meaning Ninety out of a hundred taxpayers the bottom Ninety percent view liberals who have a tough time with this kind of stuff pays only thirty point five percent of the ...\nTo pick up about this for a second this is why I I this is what I Love about Trump it's not just that he doesn't accept it out of a liberal ... you're not that much I don't pay your fair share of the ... thing right\nYou don't pay your fair share you don't pay your fish you it's not the Trump just doesn't accept that he turns around and just throws it right out of the guard right out in the garbage that narrative and he starts over with a\nYou know what they pay a lot actually pay I think they pay to watch let's cut their taxes\nGod job\nThe top one percent of earners pay seven percentage points more of the income tax load than the\nBottom Ninety what the hell is a fair share of that is not is you hear what I'm ... there's more of a isn't just that there's more of these comparisons in this this isn't a Bloomberg\nPeace again not some right wing website here\nI mean the son and a negative way but I'm sure the liberal listening will be like nah you got that from uh some right wing slanted website there there was just trying to manipulate the fact this is from ... okay\nThe top one percent pay thirty seven cents of every thirty seven percent income tax load the bottom line the only pay thirty\nWhy is is so sensitive to make us liberals are frauds they keep talking about this fair share some as John Kerry doctors vote in Rhode Island to avoid

talk about Elizabeth Warren everyone\nJust kinda like a point that you're talking about the one guy skateboarding\nBut then like cheering on because because he got all those of us want to do that like what did we wait I mean when I get my get out there was one like I think it's kind of it\nI mean I I just think it's so like I I just think that the white is going social justice and the opposite direction of a lot in the way it's driving me crazy and I'm really going to Trump's orders if they get Elizabeth and it's funny it God\nJohn I disagree though I Know I'll tell you why\nThe last ... having run myself up albeit unsuccessfully almost doesn't count politics is you know but you know listen I gave it the old college try out a lot of experience um in liberal states Marilyn specifically where I did run and one of the things I've always not white respected about the Democrats\nIf their ability to almost ruthlessly stay on message\nFollow me whether it was an Obamacare the Obama tax hikes Obama regulatory assault in red tape on our businesses they are on message don't matter what\nObamacare was about to get more coverage the tax cuts we got to make people pay their fair share about regulations we gotta protect the environment and you still end up like\nThey are almost ruthlessly good at staying on message Donald Trump has been so fragile so frazzled that just and it's why I'm not trying to be a target this why no you're wrong\nThat just weeks before a mid term election a major party representative for their party Elizabeth Warren releases an ancestry or whatever a DNA things showing she's one one thousand twenty fours Native American\nAnd even Jim Messina who is in Obama big shot advisor tweeted out today why staff heck are you doing three weeks before a mid term\nSo I with all due respect John I get what you're saying\nI could not disagree with you more I think it was a genius political move and I'm not I'm not a golden calf worship or of any politician I think it was a genius move to entirely get the Democratic party cannot talk about anything of substance and to focus on what Trump wants to focus on their fraudulent nature\nRather than say so I got to take a break sorry thanks for the call I see your point totally totally disagree series and no one trusts you got a PHD in owning the lifting of sound like you get some of their skin like no one on the part I'm Sam Pacino when from Marshall then do you want to give us a call ... seven seven three one two three four months he\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[laughter]\n\n\n[noise]\nTrying to talk radio station Eugene cw\nJohnson City [laughter]\nOr they need is one now ABC nightly news NBC nightly news CNN story on how the Clinton surpluses Mitt they would go away forever but they won't do it\nThey do this and now\nThey're doing it now and the reason I bring it up is because they are good at staying on message that's how they get these myth to persist over\nTime Trump pass them scattered all over the place they cannot stay on message you got one guy who Spartacus you got one guy I skateboard in the parking lot to bed oh you've got one guy talking about\nFart jokes at a at a serious Sheldon Whitehouse this is the Democrats\nI fundamentally\nSo agree with just about all of their policy positions but I'm telling you I have always respected there almost meticulous ability to stay on message however false that message is not in the era of Donald Trump they cannot do it\nThey are so over taken with rage at everything this guy represents the anti swap rhetoric the anti media rhetoric when they go out there and they spout off untruth in straight up live they cannot they simply can't contain the rage\n\nHe's caught them talking about booth failing in Senate hearings he's got a Cory Booker declaring he's a sporadic is from the or at least you're silverstone clueless movie\nHe's got Elizabeth Warren releasing a press release I'm One one thousand Native American jobs by the way a Fox on in the background the Cherokee\nNation just responded and and in a brutal brutal response to this basically full laying her statement Elizabeth Warren who what\nWhat was she thinking the answers they worried this is the era of Trump the gas lighting is not working anymore\nThat guy's got what forty million followers or something on Twitter he goes out and give speeches all over the country the media is forced to cover his soundbites he re frames questions from the media turns it back on them\nHe and he gets the last word and just about every interchange even with the sixty minutes thing over the interview making sure that's the soundbite everybody remembers any talks like normal Americans\nThis is constantly has the liberal media and the liberal focus group folks and their swap rat Democrats back on their heels because they don't know how to respond anymore\nThe standard arguments are no longer working there are collapsing they're falling on deaf ears you know I said with his fair share stuff\nThat I was talking about before the break that this argument that Trump is done apologizing for taking money out of the pockets of the government and putting it into the hands of the earners in this country even if the owners happen to be successful and wealthy everybody used to apologize in the past oh no no we're not given tax cuts to the rich why why are we not doing that\nWhy well because it'll look bad well is it good for the economy\nYeah it's good for the economy so who cares that make the case something it's such a was\nMake the case Trump does say\nI told you the numbers before the break this one I Can't get this number out of my head\nThat they'll fourteen hundred wealthiest taxpayers in the country pay the same percentage of income tax three percent as the bottom fifty percent of income tax payers this whole country\nDo you understand the gravity of what I just told you for teen hundred taxpayers who are successful in wealthy pay the same percentage of the income tax load as the bottom fifty percent of income tax orders in this country\nCan't let the delusional liberals who are one percenters themselves Bernie Sanders Elizabeth Warren\n\nJohn Kerry John Kerry used as a as a one percent of one percent or\nWill still insists you don't pay your fair share they have no idea what that even means it requires you to be a sucker to do no further analysis of that\nFolks turning your money over to the government you might as well turn it you might as well burn it you're\nFlushing it down the toilet\nMilton Friedman I haven't brought this up in a while you know it's always worth bringing up again the great Milton Friedman late great Milton Friedman he had this\nThing about the ways to spend money but she used to tell people what you hear it you can never on here and there's no turning back\nThis way to spend money summarizes completely why the government giving the government money is a total complete epic disaster\n\nWhat are the most efficient what's the most efficient ways to spend ... way to spend money right\nYou spending your money on yourself or your family you on yourself why\nBecause the cost of the product you're purchasing matters if your money\nBut the quality of what you're purchasing matters too because what you're buying you're buying for yourself or your family you want a good car you want to go home you want good clothes you don't buy crappy stuff is going to fall apart cost and quality matter when you spend your own money on yourself and your family\nWhat's another way to spend money left going down the efficiency scale you spending money on other people Friedman would make\nThe argument there that when you spend money on other people the cost of what you're buying matters because it's your money but if I'm buying a product for Mr producer this equality\nMatter well I like rich so maybe but let's be honest it doesn't matter as much as if you're buying it for your wife or your family I Know richest feel a little insulted right now but don't take it the wrong way when you spend money on other people the quality of what you're buying a matter so much\nIt's not yours other people there's another way to even less efficient other people can spend other people's money on themselves you go on a work trip\nYou your job is is a is paying for the hotel that's other people's spending other people's money on themselves you're spending other people's money on your hotel room this quality matter yeah you're damn right is your hotel room you want the best hotel room after but there's the cost\nOf no no it doesn't matter that's the jobs money yeah yours give me the the the the top floor of Trump Tower I'll take it cost them matter you may say wow that sounds like a really an official way to spend money on our own weight that's worse it gets even worse\nOther people spending other people's money on other people\nThe most inefficient way to spend you can never run here this folks other people's spending other people's money and other people what is that it's the government it is the the cesspool of government taking good tax dollars think about the government's taking your money and spending it on other people\nThat's the costs matter how low it ain't their money they don't care what they're buying this equality\nMatter if they're not even spend it on themselves they don't even care they're just giving\nPeople money while we're going to pay for their health care yeah but it's crappy out we don't care taxpayer money whatever just go to spend that just keep spending\nThat's government it is the worst possible\nWay to spend my the government's better off taking your tax dollars and buying themselves lamborghini's at least they look for a quality car and boost the economy or we need we need quality you're not going to care about the costs when they take your money and they spend it on other people the cost or the quality none of it matters nothing\nFreedman was a genius a genius\nYou know understand why it is an imperative to not fall into this gas lighting trap that we're not paying their fair share your fair share as much as you can keep us possible because every dollar over that amount to fund our military and the constitutional role of government is wasted by people who don't care about the cost or the quality of what they buy beer essentially flushing your money\nDown the toilet bowl and that's a fact jak\nWe need the Reagan days ... when Reagan made the argument the government is the problem in Trump's doing that right now\nYou're just force their hand in Congress to get a lid on some of the spending we'd be a okay All right I got to take a break\nThe law here I'm damn bungee no in from work within eight seven
