I Want you to just jump in and let's tell people what you mean by bottles shake how it relates to the wind industry and how it relates to the lives of people\nWho want to do some exciting business so ... is a geo driven mobile application that allows professionals to set up targeted wine bar and caffeine meetings the idea behind it is sharing a bottle and then potentially shaking hands with someone that might\nEarn trust and respect for potentially doing business with so we just updated the data stream of cafes and wine bars on the app store\nYou're able to specify the type of professionals you want to meet for example was wind borders you take the time in the next five days to three or four people total when you're shake as you know our dialogue was naturally synergistic when you'd mentioned that not only do you who's grieving counters but you have gripping counters emporium\nOr we spent yesterday just inviting by having right now I'm like meeting some of the community and so that's the idea if\nWe can get two to four professionals to congregate in a place and intimate setting where did share ideas you could talk to ... potential clientele a network and so forth you know if you do it at your local cafe or wine bar\nWouldn't more productivity hopping and be increased in the communities where copies and wine bars are so\nWe've had around a number of different applications and programs and the things that you can sign up for if you wanted to meet somebody for a date in other words if it was a potential romantic interlude they have well let's just launch and they're all kinds of different apps that I've come across where you can\n... you know meet somebody out of wine bar but that\nSocial this is a social this is business where I guess it could be social to write\nThat will make it really is mainly geared towards business networking because we want to keep that the general use of the out when you log in through your Lincoln it exposes your\nProfessional background and there is a level of professional validation that goes along when I see David Wilson shake I see are linked in background so you're meeting wine bars if I'm a journalist a review everything see her credentials than that enables me to trust that I'm going to meet the person that's representing\nOn the Lincoln Bedroom but every shake is supposed to have a purpose right in other words you have to clearly define what your expectation is\nFor getting people to come and meet you at a certain place at a certain time you're going to discuss a certain topic right and and how much you're going to disclose because sometimes you know you want to feel people out first before you share the big idea with them\nSure so when you post a shake you actually specify that type of professionals who want to meet one line you get about twenty two characters described ... and after you accept or pass you except the user that's requesting to join up your review their wing then you get into a public chat room and you could the schools as much\nTo users are elaborate on right in any type of some topic you'd like to go into before the shake happens and of course work out any details facilitating the actual meeting okay\nSo I Want to back up a little bit and first of all defend wine in these kinds of applications because I Know that there are plenty of people listening right now I Would assume it pretty much everybody listens to my show is a wind enthusiast of one sort or another but there certainly are going to be a pretty large number of people that are going to say\nI Can't sit and drink wine and do business of course for me I Can't sit and do business without there being line there because there are just it's just the nature of things although you want it to drink\nWine in here while we were going to have this interview [laughter] I think I may have suggested it last night not a really good idea you know sometimes those interviews go downhill pretty fast I Want to point out something I'd been working on an article for something else and something about the nature of wind and I think people need to understand\nAnd that is is that when I was never created and we can take wind back ten thousand years okay but wine was never created for the purpose of you know just having a drink to enjoy a beverage that in other words ten thousand years ago a ... a bunch of folks were sitting around going you know that come up with the newest hottest beverage\nYou know is if they were creating Coca Cola Pepsi\nCreated wine for a variety of purposes some of them were religious purposes\nSome of them were celebrate tore purposes some of them were to become more loosened up for a romantic reasons but one of the most important purposes was just that the water was bad\nAnd so they made this really low alcohol wind and they drink that instead of water ... and ... you know it so it served a very important purpose which was to keep human beings alive but the one that I Want to focus on is\nThe purpose of using wine to stimulate ideas and a lot of philosophers and and thinkers going back hundreds and even thousands of years used lying as a catalyst for the generational ideas\nThat's right you know are approaching bottles shake is we wanted to be practical when having the entire selection of cafes and wine bars and um as you mentioned the other coffee houses anything that was drink oriented or the alcoholic and on and just make it a a\nPlace that would be easy for people to get to and have a non awkward minimally invasive type of professional meeting where they can discuss ideas collaborate potentially signed new clientele in such\nSo this is really the replacement of the two martini lunch you'd\nMentioned that last time and I you know I Know that people used to have martinis [laughter] not\nWell you know but that's the thing that you know the joke was in those days that people would have two martinis invoke on I was made from ... which are basically the same thing and the amount of alcohol into martinis to intent is going to be vastly\nNine oh yeah free dog Winston town and for those of you who were out of the area which is most of you\nWe have something that we called free dog not F. R. E. E. dog night\nAnd we do it here once a week and it's a lot of fun and you get free hotdogs and we'd go crazy with the hype and you have different types of winds that you're going to suggest nah I don't even know what if somebody wants me to pair of wine with\nSomebody that we create one gourmet dog and then we have like we'll have veggie dogs chicken dogs we buy the ... the really good ones we don't get the little budget pack for your kids gotcha we get adult dogs right off of that and I and then it will create something like we created a week ago the Italian dog\nAnd it was so good it had a ... sauce on it up so that it had to shoot out on at parmesan cheese what's your allergies and oh it had sliced\nPepper cheese on it gotcha yes oh my gosh it was delicious so good so I could find a way to parent that I could bear away with anything anyway back to bottle shaped let's get this part of it out of the way if they want to explore the app it's free right you don't have the worst rate itself okay so you go to the app store it's on the app store gr okay\nAll right man right now we are launching in California are making available trying different areas out a geo areas and yeah it's one word bottle shake Sunni feedback how I can prove experience for you on my email address is Winston at ... dot com hum wow check out the website\nOh goodness really sexy radio voice you're going to be your single Archie right my goodness because of the women are going to be writing you just because they want to shake with you I mean hey get told you the show's offbeat Winston brand oh\nOkay I was a minute we'll talk to a professional meetings [laughter] All right um\nSo our mission ... jobs in productivity through believer not pivotal Weiner coffee meetings now when you have this meeting with someone that maybe it's a client prospect\nWhen you have as you put it the social lubricant in front of you\nKnow what better way to get to know the person the business mind the collaborated the artist behind someone that you may work directly or indirectly with or potential keep as a as a business contacts than exchange\nIdeas you know spend twenty to thirty minutes sitting down and when you get that face to face meeting as you put it when when wind was invented as a community\nTool facility later you just I was just trust and respect or when there's trust and respect established then you end up doing business with people and we all know this because I did is this development for company for this and for four years we always wanted to go out there and you know our clientele and when you do\nThe productivity increases because you get commitments project commitments time commitments and so forth and so the problem we're solving is that digital connections\nAre not professional relationships you know so you mentioned before you're you're we're talking about your linked in for David so when you get an except or ignore invitation crumbling ten member sometimes that might not amount to anything right and so what we're trying to do is bridge that gap that missing piece and\nWhere that connection now actually means something to you in terms of your experience with that person the feeling the vibe you got you know for you to in order to continue business as\nAnd you know ... we had a show on a couple of weeks ago the main guest that I had on was the author of a book that was about speaking human and the gist of that conversation is we are becoming less human all the time because we do everything on line we do everything in little short word bites you know whether it's Twitter or just a simple\nMessage through your iPhone and\nWe've lost that human touch and I think that the idea of getting face to face once again with people and adding a social element to it is something that we have really really lost\nTouch with absolutely ... on ...\nThese days ... phone to her laptop and then if someone can't reach you live via phone than the voicemail has that expression of emotion and for me when I Do business with people I I Want to know who I'm dealing with you know or get a good feeling good comfortable feeling of trust on who I'm dealing\nWith so reconnecting people with it\nAll right that is all the time we have so for those who are interested in getting the application just go to the store and a search for ...\nFor having me that's it you know you'll find it there and I think you had said also that if she is not available in your particular area you could write them and they'll try to do everything in their power to make you one of the next to be brought on line\nAbsolutely we're taking feedback right now again the emails wins in the bowl sugar calm you know say all oh let me know what region you're at and we're going to open up

President Trump says the U.S would be punishing itself if it cancels weapons sales to the Saudis\nFrom the standpoint of jobs economic development a lot of other reasons I Would like to do something where we could maybe a look at other thing is I Will tell senators because that's a tremendous order for companies for\nEarlier Andrew Brunson the American pastor released from turkey was welcomed in the oval office and the president had a question for him\n[noise] yeah it is it is a uh unbelievable in fact I think you are your eyes or any of us it said this five ten years ago we wouldn't have left off stage because it's something that every president\nSince Nixon since the little early seventies has said where you want to become energy independence and at some point it became a mouthpiece because it was totally unrealistic right well the fact is it's not totally unrealistic gets here it's coming and it's fantastic\nYou know the Obama administration was saying well you're not going to dig your way you're not going to drill your way it is not going to work the irony of it is the one sector in the United states that we're doing right was energy and then and then Obama turns around and try to take credit\nThat he was he was doing everything we can through you know make energy sector where I mean I just wanted to be the hyperbole was ridiculous\nSo bring and tell us a little bit about um you know one is going on in in in Texas right now I mean there's news reports this week I'm I'm getting all kinds of news reports Texas will pass\nA OPEC partners in oil production by twenty twenty three that means that it it it I mean this is this is amazing I mean there's other reports out that the you know the Permian Basin in Texas\nAlone will be equal to any of the OPEC countries except for Saudi Arabia and that's just one field so what is going on Texas what has happened why are we in this remarkable position today\nYeah well we're in this remarkable position because we have surrealistic policies that have enabled us to go back new technologies made about by hydraulic fracturing and other techniques that allow us to get at a lot more oil than we were able to produce in the past and\nYou know it's it's pretty simple a U.S crude oil production is uh eighty percent since two thousand and five and you were talking about the imports and you know shockingly with that net imports of crude oil or off by Seventy percent\nYou know as a former military officer myself I spent time in the sand or different places around the world wide because we had to be there because we needed at energy\nAnd we needed a strategic alliances but what you're seeing right now is the U.S is producing all laws we're averaging just under eleven million barrels a day\nAnd uh that's that's pretty amazing and it will be twelve million barrels a day next year and all of that are men right now is kick in about thirty five to forty percent of that total\nAnd it's going to continue to grow and what do I mean by that and by the next seven to ten years the Permian Basin alone can be producing over seven million barrels a day\nContrast that with the block and which is a big deal but it's coming in at one point two million barrels a day\nHoly cow how how much of Saudi\nRomp Saudi is producing or somewhere around a a eight to nine that day right now\nHoly ... little bit more of that but\nYeah we're producing more Saudi Arabia were producing more than Russia is\nWell you know it's really great about this soon in and I guess the Obama administration just didn't understand that but as I understand a lot of things about business but\nThe fact that we can produces oil poses a dramatic threat not just because of the OPEC scenario but let's look beyond that and beyond those borders and was look at Russia\nAnd let's look at what ... by us being successful and becoming a net exporter of fossil fuels you know what in his rhetorical question what does that do to Russia\n[noise] yeah that is a there's a couple of things to Russia Russia does it like that right because they need American hard currency they need hard currency from other people they want Western Europe\nAnd central Europe and their former Soviet satellite states to remain dependent on them for oil because oil that's black cash that's what they need to keep\nNot only their economy going but to keep doing a type of thing that they've been doing to keep waging those proxy wars and a design Ukraine and stalemate in Georgia et cetera\nSo this is going in the right direction Neal we do this\nVery very very much so and but you know for the American consumer arena we ... we still haven't seen a maybe the the result of this or that the the the fruit of of this incredible resource this watching that our country has because of wine because because of the pipelines and and we just don't have the pipelines I mean there's been a whole lot of\nDiscussion on the bottom in ministry Asian about the evils of pipelines and so on and and and yet we're producing all this energy but we're not seeing it right the benefit at the gas pump right we're not seeing in our energy bills yet because we're not we don't have the delivery system for it\n[noise] well yeah no that's true we were seeing it incrementally I mean if you look at natural gas prices ten Fifteen Years ago\nUm they're they're very low compared there a third of what they were mud near right on the crude oil side we're not seeing quite as much reduction as we would like to see in the retail cost of gasoline and other supplies at the pump\nAh that's that's due to a couple of reasons number one we are all tied together it is somewhat of a global economy number one\nAnd so we have to look at world energy demand number two and this is where I come in as the former ah had it energy transportation for the federal government we can't get our stuff effectively from point a to point B because of environmental opposition to pipelines which you like I Want to throw out there right in the beginning\nI regulated or a planes trains and automobiles they're all safe but nothing beats a pipeline\nFor safety for her to less carbon footprint for efficiency and yet we have people out there that have decided that if they can't get their agenda ... across by keeping products in the ground there sure as heck I'm going to do everything they can to make it difficult it's possible to move those supplies to market\nIncredible incredible hey look but it's but it but it's looking good man this is this is a great story is a great story it wasn't a great story not long ago but boy this is this is wonderful and the American consumer American businesses American manufacturers everyone is going to benefit our allies or if it were\nThe right direction now's the time just to keep the paddle down and we're going to see the fruits of our labor\nAbsolutely bringing things for being on the show bring him McCown former senior executive at the

a an amazing thing what an amazing thing for that to happen\nAnd here we are here we are uh right now\nUh with Vince Patton who's a or a ... a master chief petty officer retired I just want to make sure I get that right he's now senior vice president of new day us Amy and he's joining is right now Vince welcome to made in America\nWelfare afternoon or good morning advocates wherever wherever you are but hello everybody\nWill thanks thanks for being on the show it's it's it's really great and um you know getting our vets into the workforce we we we often do segments on this and it's something that we're very proud of and and talking about this all the time and bringing this message a two American business owners\nUm some incredible skills so tell us what is new day USA and what is your work and and what can we do better\nWell first of all new to us say our financial a mortgage company or that caters exclusively to veterans are primarily both with a purchasing a home as well as refinancing\nA on a mortgage and so forth but we've focused towards a veteran community and our efforts to that is really his first and foremost has opened\nVeterans a particularly many for the first time getting into a home of their own as well as for many veterans who own home get lots of too many to uh to to get some extra cash to be able to do some upgrades films are\nThings that they needed to get them better so uh our focus is solely with working with the veteran population\nWe've had this conversation for a while I think it makes all of a sudden to the world a you know one of the things that drives me crazy is that we we had these wonderful men and women you getting to the armed forces doing jobs that are so technical but you know the the the military right now is a very technical environment which is what makes us so good\nYou know without wonderful people it means nothing\nBut we have these terrific very well educated trained people doing these very high level of technical function on all sorts of different projects and then when they get out and we should be able to take advantage and work with these people I think it makes so much sense so to hire a vet\nAnd be dealing with somebody with experience in somebody who knows how you know a can do person knew someone who knows I must have finished the job and finish it right because that the military way uh I Can't imagine a better person to go to the top of the list when you're I'm interviewing\nA lot of discipline higher to a lot of discipline you know in a ... which is very important in the workforce is you know getting there on time and and uh you know putting in the hours and and just just doing the common sense type type of thing I mean skills at the U.S military is really great at the at teaching ...\nWhat is the unemployment rate I mean this economy you know a lot of jobs you know we hear a lot about the jobs and you know the unemployment rate and you know getting people back working again so for veterans you know one has this economy meant\nYou know how how we made progress I mean our our our our veterans you know at the front of the line right now I mean are they doing better than the general population were were they sent\nMany of them are working but they're not necessarily working and skill levels that they really are qualified to do ah many people getting into jobs because they're getting the jobs that they can get but I see this bill as uh\nUnder employment situation and that uh uh we do have a lot of folks who served in the military service and very highly technical uh types of feel and and that's sad is that infant treating men to day\nOr if you were to look at a picture of an army or Marine Corps infantry men to see how how what they carry and what they have compared to a World War two Korea era or Vietnam Era vastly different because the infantry men of today\nAre asked to be highly technical with the information that they have to do their particular job so that still translates\nTo the civilian market that you're getting from one that has the technical expertise to know how\nNot to mention of those other things which point out of all the attention to detail ah ah ... Williams of coming to work on time and so for all of that together and you have people that are truly are the best for America's worked for\nExample in criminals are are there any sort of skills that are\nThat you know you were you just mentioned the technical skills but you know what's in the most high demand I mean if you're an American veteran right now and you're listening to us on TALK and you know you don't quite got the right job right now is that what what could they be doing about what should they be doing about that how should they be maybe perfecting getting this message out that\nThe skills that they do have and and and get them to the marketplace to where they do get that dream job\nThat's a good question because one of the things that I've I've been very critical on you know I've been retired from the from the U.S coast guard a for sixteen years now and I think the ... but I Will say for the time that I retired and the transition assistance that I had gone through back then as compared\nTo today is much much better but still it is lacking with giving a those people who are getting out of service as well as those who are already out of his service\nTo be able to effectively translate what their uh training or what the occupational specialty that they have translated civilian turns and there are some\nGreat tools that are on the Web that they can easily use right now\nWhich is that a net dot edu a C. E. N. E. T. dot edu why that website because it has the military guys that are that gives all of the evaluation of educators educational experiences and the armed services this is a great tool for\nOur veterans that they can use when they had during their resumes that that better describes there that the uh the military ease of the things that they do to civilian tires and I think that is very helpful for them as they do their jobs\nEven say thanks for being on a show I mean this is a great service that you're doing Vince Patton master chief petty officer of U.S Coast guard retired now senior vice president for a new day USA helping veterans find jobs I mean what a wonderful calling thanks for being on the show Vince\nBut thank you for having me greatly appreciated\nComing up we're Brian Darling joining us who's the president and founder of liberty government affairs he's a former senior communications director and counsel for Senator Rand Paul a very very famous and if you're doing great work for our country he's going to join us just in a moment talking about the tax cuts in what they mean for our small businesses\nMay in America [noise]\n\nA suicide is a National Public health issue that affects all Americans but it is preventable the U.S department of Veterans Affairs is working to improve the health and well being of our nation's veterans\nMaize in America [noise]\n\nGet fat it out and many of my ... you can you get from North America to Europe on mustard seed wait what well a recent United Airlines flight from San Francisco to direct was partially propelled by a biofuel created by us for that company to clean up the skies\nAgra so much by a scientist as the company behind the biofuels which is made from carrying out a mustard\nDesigned specifically for the aviation industry thirty percent of the jet fuel was replaced by the biofuel leading the jak cut greenhouse gases by one third previously ten percent with the highest level of biofuel used on a commercial flights\nCarrying out a mustard can grow in difficult conditions and on land that's not meant for crop so unlike eats it all cultivation is at the expense of food the goals they had fifty percent of the fuel on commercial flights worldwide more at ... dot com that way you can't get out many rocky fighting [noise]\nWhere's the love for a car coming from the cars of super legacy the answer would be the symmetrical all will drive\nPower goes to all four wheel all the time for optimum ...\nSubaru boxer engines lower center of gravity makes the Subaru Legacy more responsive around corners and gets better fuel economy than front will drive competitors what you have then is midsize sedan with grip handling an enviable fuel economy it's no wonder it turns people into people who love cars love is what makes a super super\nWhenever it rains it's hard not to think about the folks right here in our community who have no roof over their heads wouldn't it be nice to give them a dry place to sleep tonight or warm cup of soup or just simply an umbrella well you can by giving to the salvation army where every donation fights for good\nVisit Salvation Army ... listen and give dot org now to help fund programs that provide shelter food and hope to our neighbors most in need that Salvation Army Douglas and and give them ... or\n[noise]\n\nOne of them the made in America I'm your host he allows very together with co hosts actor rich ... rich when\nThe show today it's amazing I mean a time just flies\nI mean it's a wonderful story about the American energy industry in specifically what's happening down in taxes but really it's happening across America this\nEnergy renaissance that we're going through in our country absolutely spectacular what it means for our economy what it means for our future what it means for our jobs and what it means geopolitically\nAnd untangling America from a lot of places in the world that these energy resources exist are not necessarily our friends and it just seems every time we get involved with these places no good comes out\nSo why are not more Americans saying forget for an energy let's be energy independent let's do it here in America let's create the jobs and let's get out of all these conflicts in the world it seems like a pretty good bargain to enrich", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Mark Levin Show", "city": "Johnson City", "day": "13"}
