rating is sort of fifty one percent\nSo whether it's the economy immigration are federal judges I could not think\nOf a better president than Donald John Trump he makes Reagan almost looked like a liberal because unlike Reagan and the bushes who were pinned cushions this guy fights back when Trump is hit he hits back harder what he did on a Monday Night last night\nWith the Supreme Court saying that I hereby find you're not guilty judge Kavanaugh you are an innocent man\nAnd he went after the Democrats with the other eight members of the Supreme Court sitting there and the Republicans to me it was beautiful it was wonderful this guy's got no backup ... stack up he continues to teach all of us about winning in Trump's world and it's about the fight and you're fighting spirit and your ability to be bare knuckle and think about this\nKavanaugh\nWas a Yale middle aged judge who are educated and yell undergraduate and laws go spend about twelve years on the second circuit court of appeals\nHe's not the kind of guy to fight like Trump\nBut when they push Kavanaugh further and further and further Kavanaugh\nKind of local looked over Trump and said that's my motto that's the guy I Want to be they never imagined other wimpy middle aged judge from Yale headed in him to fight back and no holds barred straight broiler fashion but Kavanaugh studied Trump\nHe learned from Trump so all of his brilliance and eloquence all of his uh all of his grade school girls' basketball coach and you're teaching at Harvard would not helping all to win this fight\nUs people like Chris Wallace of Fox News who said after the testimony of that liar and she was a liar Christine for she lied about what happened at a maximum she was mistaken at a minimum we might go over that later\nBut Chris Wallace of Fox News said after she testified that it's over for the Republicans the Republicans had a bad day I'm a trial attorney I see it all the time a witness testifies and and you buy it hook line and sinker and then the other witness testifies and you say you know what\nI don't know what to believe now Kavanaugh he in a sense hypnotic ... took on Trump's personality and he fought no holds barred bare knuckles and guess what Kevin all one by Trump rules he knows that if you want something in your life bad enough you got to fight for justice Trump proved\nAnd ah he won the Supreme Court after\nChristine forward testified about the second front door and about afraid to fly and about the costs are phobia and how it changed her life\nAnd I thought okay that's under refuted evidence Kavanaugh get up and spoke and you know what I thought I cannot believe cabinet and then I waited for the next week to transpire and it did and the next week clearly demonstrated that Christine forward was not telling the truth what was she lied or not it's a different matter\nBecause she said there were four witnesses in every whatever witnesses refuted a story or had no memory of the gathering question whatsoever the therapists notes were critical to this\nThat she released to the Washington Post but not to the U.S Senate committee she said for boys tried to rape her when\nShe was in her late teens and the time was in the mid Nineteen eighties now she says it was one boy\nAnd it was a in at the age of Fifteen nod or late teens and it was Nineteen eighty two not the Nineteen eighties and she flipped on that because in the Nineteen eighties Brett Kavanaugh was not even in Maryland He was in Connecticut\nSo everything she said that the therapist was probably accurate because she said at six years ago before politics entered the fracas so when she said for boys tried to rape her she she was in her late teens what Eighteen or Nineteen years old and the Nineteen eighties what Nineteen eighty four eighty five eighty six\nThat didn't fit the scenario of Brett Kavanaugh so she flipped and change what she was saying in order to try to take Kevin down and it didn't work\nAnd the second front door was put in and twenty overweight and twenty nine because she wanted her psychologist slash therapist to have an office and the direct entry into her house into a room so the second front door was put in not because she was scared of only one exit but because a person she wanted to run out some of her house\nTo a small business owner a psychologist to have a direct entry way\nAnd of course the other thing was she was afraid to get on planes her boyfriend of many years testify they took single propeller planes all over Hawaii that she traveled to Haiti travel do ally travel to Central America travel to South America travel to Israel and travel to Europe\nHow is it does she swim all these places hell no she flew everywhere including on single propeller planes which are quite claustrophobic if she was so nothing she said that any relationship to reality and over the week delay brought about by Jeff Flake\nWhose last name by adjective describes his character refuted what she said and that's why Susan Collins put up on Saturday about three o'clock and gave that great speech I never thought I Would say this\nSusan Collins is a profile in courage as his Lindsey Graham Mitch McConnell Brett Kavanaugh and of course the president Donald John Trump those are the big winners and now today Brett Kavanaugh his first day on the U.S

John please go ahead\nAnd show following us think France tally from start to where it is now and absolutely I agree with your opening bottle first off facts are stubborn things you know and and the words of our of our\nOur president you know John Adams a if you're just dissect it and look strictly at ...\nAnd you go off the values of the country that you tell proven guilty it's absolutely mind boggling offer you can't wait to no kidding of course you know all this guy he's guilty\nAnd you know John last night I watched some of the left as media today talk about how how unfair it was\nThat the president declared a innocent a Brett Kavanaugh isn't that what are you aren't you innocent until proven guilty and this wasn't the case but it just wasn't closes wasn't fifty one forty nine give me some small example Rachel Mitchell who I think that a lousy job is to prosecute drinks before the Senate\nAnd it kind of walk a Christine afford down to perform rose path when she oddly questionnaire about coaching a friend\nWho was taking a federal lie detector test now I'm watching Rachel ... said she must know something and what she knew was that the ex boyfriend or Christina Ford and bother why Christina forward cheated on the ex boyfriend who sold his credit cards but I redress\n... what it was the reason Rachel Mitchell said those questions about coaching a a friend for taking a lie detector test\nOr the under oath through a sworn affidavit that boy friend Christina forward of the Nineteen nineties said that she coached a friend of hers are female friend preparing to take us governor administer polygraph exam\nAnd so practically everything\nThat Christine Ford said was either a lie or a fall sewed\nWhether it's the front door the fear of flying not taken airplanes whether it was coaching someone on a lie detector tests\nAnd she did coach somebody on a lie detector test so Christine afford lied about little things that a lot about the big things and assuming she lied John what does that mean for Brett Kavanaugh's sanity and for a status\nDoes not mean he's innocent until proven guilty\nWithout a doubt I mean that's the only conclusion one could come to feel absolutely sad for the for the\nAnd I feel a lot of fear of getting that kind of a tactic is actually a lot of [laughter] that's\nThat's terrified because you're now take somebody with a lesser degree or a lesser a common life whatever the case may be a you know sometimes they're just coming back or something like that there could be no coming back\nWhether whether you know just a fear factor and it could be absolutely false at something like that you know gets thrown at someone and that's it life as\nWell when John Waters threat cabin all go to get back his reputation if you're in the marine corps if some other fellow marine a woman accused you of rape\nAnd there was no evidence that took place she didn't know where it happened I didn't know when it happened I didn't know how it happened and the four witnesses she possessed applied to be witnesses turned out to be\nNon witnesses because they didn't they didn't they didn't see what she said they saw ... and here still found guilty of that and bounce out of the marine corps where would you go to get back to your reputation\nRight [laughter] that would that would be a hell of a road and wouldn't come back you know uh but then again I wouldn't get their due process went from such a thing\nAnd you know John I I'm a criminal defense attorney I've been in the attorney general's office when someone comes in and says I was sexually assaulted unlike many other crimes I tend to believe them if you come in to me and say you know what a\nOr someone stole my Chevrolet I'm not going to question you to say wanted someone still for no it was a share of her life so if you go in and say my left foot is hurting I'm not going to say well don't you mean you're right elbow no but when it comes to sexual assault\nTen to twenty percent of the time there are false allegations\nOf sexual assault that later on proves to be absolutely alive for example the Innocence Project has listed hundreds and hundreds of men who've been exonerated years later\nWho are wrongly convicted of sexual assault or Gregory counts in Van Dyke Perry uh two black guys spent thirty seven years in jail unfolds rape charges\nThere was a hub store university case were for college man into hubs or were chores and raping an Eighteen year old fellow students and it came out a year later she made it all up and it was a lie there's thousands of examples how a woman or man falsely accuses someone of a sexual assault\nFor all kinds of reasons and all I'm saying is\nGive bread Kevin all due process the right to cross examination the right to confront its accusers the right to be in the same room and look for in the eye which the Senate denied and now that the weak took ... you know Jeff Flake oddly enough it was a good thing it took an extra week because conservative media\nTore apart the story or seen afford improve that she was either a ... or a lawyer or both\nAnd they could prove that Brett Kavanaugh was in fact innocent and not even present\nAnd so when this has happened is that going to stop the radical left now from perpetrating allies against Brett Kavanaugh the answer is not just know the answers hell no they're going to continue\nA tactical along though this is what they do that and that's the part that just absolutely mindboggling [noise] you know it's like\nLiberal elites without some common sense is that your muscles and show [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\nAnd when I was thinking I put to rest the idea that this president is not normal I hear about the norms of\nThe presidency let's talk about norms a presidency going back to Bush forty one read my lips no new taxes was that normal\nHow about the eight years of a William Jefferson Clinton sexually assaulting Kathleen Willie inside the White House raping Juanita Broderick having sexual relations with numerous interns including Monica Lewinsky then he violate the norms of the presidency\nMoving on to Bush forty three increase taxes increased Rosa regulations greatly enlarge the role of the federal government got us involved in a war in Iraq that caused four thousand of our best cost trillions of dollars Iraq has lost now part of Iran\nThat Bush forty three get us into the norms of the presidency is that normal then you had Brock Hussein Obama who won an MTV and talked about using cocaine and other illegal drugs while president on MTV it's not the norm of the presidency\nSo please save me liberal media the idea that somehow this president forty five is violating the norms of the presidency\nThat John F. Kennedy violate the norms and the presidency when he passed off as a young and turns to\nOther male cohorts in the White House to perform oral verbal services on them was that part of the norms and the presidency when LBJ lied about the Vietnam War getting sixty thousand of my generation killed many murdered the Nixon violate the norms of the presidency with water great in line did he violated\nHow 'bout Jimmy Carter his mirror presidency\nViolated the norms of the president's so please save me the embarrassment\nOf trying to convince me that Trump is somehow violating the norms of the presidency is if Obama\nAnd Bush and Clinton and Bush\nAnd LBJ and John Fitzgerald Kennedy and everyone else violated the norms and the president say please save me\nWas continuing our way of sharing and Downingtown, Pennsylvania sharing welcome to the mark live in show bleach sharing go ahead\nI I just wanted to I'm a thank you for noting that list of people that were profiles in courage I totally agree with you I also wanted to add Chuck Grassley Raul arc that he really had to hold the line on some pretty\nStrong personalities you wanted to pull any direction and encourage it causes much trouble are great courage and I just wanted to ask him to the left and that was that otherwise I'm I really enjoy your show\nSharon thank you and let me have shown as your question talking about the norms you know I'm Liz listen to a liberal media today because they think Trump last night\nViolated the norms of the President's Day by being political in front of the U.S Supreme Court did Kamala Harris violate the norms of the presidency how about Cory Booker the one with the crazy eyes crazy eyes Booker\nDidn't violate the norms of the Senate their behavior in front of Grassley in front of the nation Grassley cannot even make an opening statement into Kamala Harris and Cory Booker in the war hero Richard Blumenthal did they violate the norms of the Senate and did that eight hundred people who showed up and about and I don't know how many two hundred arrest inside\nThe Senate did not violate the norms of the ... I think a little bit\nI think all violated annoyance than I think their behavior was extremely heinous and I think that you know age has now marker for maturity and I think it was terrible\nAnd and another point and the third debate I can recall Trump answering a question about whether he would accept the outcome the twenties sixteen election and the third debate Trump several it depends on what happens in he didn't give a hundred percent yes answer\nHillary Clinton and the liberal media viciously attack Trump for saying three weeks before the election in November I think I remember the eight twenty sixteen that he may not get it might not accept the election since the election\nAs Hillary Clinton and the Democratic party accepted the outcome in the twenties sixteen elections\nAre heaven they become what they criticized\nOh absolutely and worse\nWorse because they are determined that just Russian and dedication to things that do not bring this country together in any way it's terrible it's really very very bad and I know as far as\nHow about accepting the results of the election\nWhether it's the Russian collusion delusion or whether it's all the other investigations because we have a foolish attorney general\nNamed Jeff Sessions he should've resigned as soon as he resigned from the Russian collusion delusion and as soon as she could not do his job is attorney general he should've offered his resignation at that moment and right now the Senate seat would not be in democratic hands without challenge character out of Alabama but what happened is\nThat that uh one Trump has criticized for not acting normally if this is abnormal\nIf this economy as a result of animal abnormalities I say let's have more of it if the southern border which is being guarded by this president is abnormal please give me more but if we have the trade deficits we used to have with Canada and Mexico and South Korea this president has corrected the trade deficits\nAnd the only reason the communist read Chinese are doing what they're doing is they're going after the Trump voters\nThe Trump base in states like Iowa where the president's going to be tonight\nAnd and at some point the Chinese need us more than we need them at some point they're going to recognize that they rip them off for five hundred billion dollars a year and that's way too much so\nI fall basis abnormal Sharon I Want more abnormal because if this is abnormal I cannot think of something better than what we have right now\nI'm with you and I also have to test the fact that they will not acknowledge anything anything or not everybody has heard and that they will not think that Donald Trump has it that\nDonald Trump never sit in front of everyone and said you know what I'm I'm perfect you know we never did that so he tries he tried hard working man for a yard says it has to do it right I respect for him and they will not acknowledge anything\nTo\nShare and we got to run thank you for calling from Pennsylvania\nSenate such Chuck Schumer which they get out and folks if you do not one Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer to be controlling the legislative agenda for the last half of the president's first term get out in front of a continuous more eight seven seven three one two three one one still coming out in the great American in for the grain when mark\n[laughter]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise] trying to talk radio station in Eugene W Johnson City for\n[noise]\nThe following it's the talk shows the photo racing for the voice of NASCAR\n\nThat's going to make some rock and roll out of the guys at heart\nRacing networks present NASCAR\nNASCAR on line of fire curricular you sign on our straight from the motor racing network studios in Concord North Carolina here is your home when he came to the NASCAR line back and we own special assignment\nUm and that's not always necessarily a good thing to do right hum\nTalladega as well as crappy races were just you know obviously it could be right along the line here over the next thing you know your plants here so I've been there done that so you just gotta be careful and and try to be as smart as you can throughout the day\nThis will be a a cut off race and you come into it a third in the overall standing behind a couple of guys who won the first two races or this round with the uh forty point cushion but Everytime I start asking you about math you say you don't really even pay any attention to that or you just taking a take it easy\nAnd when this thing how do you approach to race like this is a cut off raised with so many unknowns do it in as you say so many things that are really out of your control\nWell [laughter] the hardest part for all of that is is you know again that's trucks of showing just tremendous speed I'm On the super speedway so I feel like obviously every time we go we we've got a great opportunity to\nTo to maybe have a chance to sit I sit on the polar we definitely an hour and a qualifier pretty well so um that complicates things because if you if your content just go right around and you're qualified fantasy a little bit easier to do but when you when you show that you got the\nUm you know you want to get up there and dice it up and and race so I'm to be honest with you I've always had a hard time just kind of land back I've tried it once or twice and it's just not my style I'd rather be run and get crashed then\nAnd now you know the right around the back all day and then they'd be center so [noise]\nUm but the point of the big picture here and and um we just got to see on all played out or\nYou know honestly I don't think we have a strategy at this point I think it all depends on where we qualify\nUm you know I'm actually in ... and we built a brand new truck to go there so I'm hoping that it shows really gets fatally could sit on the pole when in fact maybe capture that first day to get those points that would be that would be nice and then we can race a little bit harder later on self\nJust got to be how it all played out circumstances when we get there and and I'm just see what kind of speed rehab and see where things shake out\nI was just about to ask you if you were going to take the same drug that you won within Daytona but you've got a brand new in\nTelling folks about how ... his progress because when when you won the championship everybody was talking about wow I Can't believe how quickly this team has come and such a short time but now you're you're cranking out new trucks and and you're you're winning ... won five times this year your teammates already won in the playoffs\nI mean it really seems like a just a an unbelievable story with how quickly GM is is not only started to compete but gotten really to championship caliber organization\n[noise] yeah no and I you know there's obviously a lot of lot of pieces and parts of the puzzle but the but all starts at the top so I'm Mr Gallagher and the Gallagher family I mean they're committed to this thing and and you know ultimately they want to be competitive weekend awake out so um that\nUltimately relates to just pouring resources into the program and um you know might be in that it's just wrong in the program and and uh I think a lot of people know what what he's all about and and now today she is an hour and how bad he wants to lend itself I'm you know he he knows what it takes you know he's been around\nA sport a long time and he knows that you know you gotta constantly keep developing and and building stuff and um and honestly done a great job of of just putting people in the places that need to be there as far as setting up shop in ... directors and all those types of\nPositions that they felt so um but he demands [laughter] results and uh so if you if you don't run well you got to answer to him but um you know it's just it's a constant process and um but at the end of the day I think anybody would tell you success comes from people um nine times out of town and\nHave the whole organization is stacked with a lot of people that have been around for a while and I have a lot of experience and and you know they're working really hard so I'm\nYou know I always say there's a lot in this sounds cliche but it's it's the whole program and and it's a team sport and it really is at its you know what you see at the racetrack on a weekend of the product of of what's been going on back to shop for for months a lot of times\nYou mentioned the ... committee series and then let's talk a little bit more about Talladega you talked about the chess game you have to play you know things are sometimes beyond your control near a give folks an idea of what it's like trying to make those moves in anticipate where you've got to be and when\nI had a super speedway versus a short track or or a mile and a half track particularly with the way you have to drive trucks when it's a mostly about momentum\nWell it's it's you know it's a lot of times ... kind of just\nReactive you know you're going to make the move and it got to decide right then and there that you're going to make the bumping around or whatever that move that you think you're going to where they are ... are they telling us to proceed racing almost after playing that role of\nThe time as one or two labs ahead of time a lot of times it's a hassle after you're sitting there trying to plan and what what kind of a ... so a lot of that is dependent on you know how fast ... what kind of sneak you have so it's you know if you feel like that's something that you could go out and make lives west that's what you got to do but\nUm you know it's it's one of those deals where you know it's you're trying to find and those are trying to work with hurricane that's there's just a lot going on obviously relying on your spot or a lot of communication going on there so\nI'm you know it's it's cool and it all works out and and in the end result is is what you want to ski but a lot of things you have to go right and a lot of things like we said before that are out of your control but for the most part you know you're they're planning ahead you're trying to make things happened long before you ever see it coming to fruition\nAnd moving ahead or ... when everybody can kind of take a deep breath and a sigh of relief if you if you survive it a point I was in in advancing was since two guys will be eliminated from the Trump playoffs after this you got Martinsville Texas in Phoenix coming up and those were awfully good tracks for you I mean the way it sets up\nA new nothing is certain like they see in the in the bank commercials past performance is no guarantee of future success but you're going to really feel good about the way the next round sent some were you in the team don't you\nKnow I really do um average you're looking at you know the ... the first round I was just glad we have to see that we had in the regular season to get those points that end bonus points and\nUm but yeah when I look to the next round averages you might have been great um you know on their multiple times Texas five times and uh\nYou know Phoenix last year or so and they're great racetrack that means places that I really look forward to going here and I think that helps a lot so\nUm yeah I I look at the next round as you know ... I feel like you know any of that and go wrong like you said that you might as well I think it happened that's sometimes can is dicey Talladega but uh for the most part I feel like you're a little bit better control of what the ... but um yeah good race tracks obviously\nSo that executed and and everything right and and tries to have trouble but for the most part\nUm I couldn't think of that race tracks honestly for an extra ...\nAnd one final thing before we wrap up ... you mentioned Phoenix I had to ask you about this how crazy do you think it's going to be having to start finish line coming off of what used to be turned to do when you're gonna have guys with all the next room to dive down low and try and make moves on to restart\nYeah I was a we were talking about that last week and in fact I'm\nYou know and the team a little bit and and uh yeah I'm just tired of sitting back trying to decide are taken in my mind is ask guy going to say okay I'm In Nashville starts or restarted yeah go down there is that is that off limits or what so I'm a little bit of that I guess that remains to be saying that\nUm if it's open or if you're going to see some [laughter] some wild racing into certain three there I guess certain one now so yeah um yeah I don't know that's going to be interesting I think you'll see stuff to Colorado for sure so I'm hopefully everybody takes care of their stuff but\nUm yeah it's definitely mix things up that's going to be a pretty crazy for sure especially um from what I saw a start finished signing basically um what needs to be the accidents turned cured it a little short shared is kind of in the middle there so or the little kids so that even makes it a little bit crazy here so I I'm looking forward to see how that works out\nWell like you said earlier about ... guys I get wide and things they might not normally do and we're probably going to try and pull off that's Johnny ... he'll be driving the number Twenty one I assume connects you ever leave for GM's racing this coming Saturday in the\nFree to auctions two fifty a country way twelve thirty eastern time on the motor racing network in our guest and listen to boot there's going to be ...

evolving always changing we're really proud of those relationships and look forward to I'd been health are continuing to build on that relationship and twenty Nineteen\nOh before we let you go get one more note a NASCAR announced the twenty Nineteen rules package a last week and one of the things are involved restrict your plates and they're making a move to tapered space mirrors so my understanding is uh the Daytona five hundred will be the last restrict or play race what do you think about that\nYeah you know we've been using both restrict your plate ... search for a couple of years and\nA kudos to NASCAR they they've they've finally gotten the technology to a point where we just don't need to taper space or it's redundant and the end or restrict your plate so you're going to a tapered space or give the the driver or more response and the throttle which I think is great you always want to give the driver every opportunity to put it in their hands and\nYou know the Daytona five hundred and the and the coach your sugar for one or two of the most exciting races of the year a fan love pack racing will certainly see that\nAs we go into twenty Nineteen and I I don't
