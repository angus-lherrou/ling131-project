I\nLove listening to the I just have a quick comment one question because I don't really know the answer or my comment is I think all they really were trying to do with plant the seat of doubt in people's mind I think that's how they wanted to try and come about that\nAnd you know sometimes that's all you need to do but my question is can they pull any laugh minister Ghana in that group that last second and go to like let's say the ... circuit court and try to get this stop illegal product\nIf there were no they they the courts can't get involved in a confirmation process this is wholly within the realm of the United States Senate even the house you can't get involved in it or to his credit or Mitch McConnell does know how to work the Senate floor he does know how what the procedures are\nUh I Believe they are planning on a Saturday vote or because the senator from Montana has his daughter's wedding maybe it'll be a Sunday vote but I'll tell you\nWe got to keep an eye on the Three Stooges of the Republican Party um ah Susan Collins Lisa Murkowski and Jeff Flake because even now even though that they got the FBI report that they\nAnd it even though two of them said it was full some or even now they're playing games and so these are very very principled individuals in those three\nAnd what they're really wing here ladies and gentlemen has their own political careers and futures and or how the lip media will treat them because that is the bottom line they're driven by how the lid media treat them shock\nBut no that if they don't their their careers are pretty much over because I don't think the Republican base with with what will follow 'em and it's just like really is thinking about running for president does he really thinks he can whim\nAny Republican support I just don't think I think they're not making a decision now because I just don't think they want to be harassed\nI sign I think flake views himself as a spoiler that's all he he's he's really

for county prosecutor and about how she knows about these things\nAnd then goes on to say that under our federal loose with evidence\nThat court must be considered radical because what she said to her therapist\nYeah cup search he's probably talking about ... which just makes you expect to hear say rule which only means that it can be it's reliable but she said it not reliable that is true but this person ... expertise would get in front of the American public and mix such a crazy statement\nYou're so right I read the Koran out on it and\nBy the way why doesn't she released those therapists notes we'd all like to look at them now that she waived any sort of privilege\nYeah well that's the next thing it's a pretty remarkable if somebody they tried to go to here say well that's a person you want and then you you put the whole thing but it's it's really crazy that's go wherever with confidence that some of these um democratic senator show\nThat you're a lawyer I like it\nWell yeah but I don't do a hell of a lot of our work even I Know that right ah it doesn't make a credible it just means that it's ... she got it and how somebody in that position and I know the difference is just
