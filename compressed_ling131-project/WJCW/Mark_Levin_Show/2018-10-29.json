president climate banana\nAnd an interfaith vigil for the victims of Saturday's mass shooting in Pittsburgh tree of life synagogue hum\nString quartet play among those speaking of the service was Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Purdue toe\nIn the next several weeks and months it will become increasingly clear increasingly\nNecessary to show our support of the Jewish community to beef up in the community as a whole and just say that anti Semitism is not even remotely within this disease forced\nYou know Jewish should replace a childbirth class or a place to preparation that a partner does with with his um you know with with the laboring woman or the pregnant woman but I Would say that it takes a lot of the pressure off for sure\nBut you know as I as you know Jordan was wonderful support to you he was\nNurturing he was very loving and I like to think that you would help the partners to be the best support they can be because they don't feel like it's all a hundred percent on them to have to say the exact right thing and do the exact right thing at every moment of the labor they can just hold your hand and look into your eyes and tell you they love you and how proud they are of you\nKnow because they know that someone else knows the nitty gritty of what positions to get into your now and you know or are you sure we're not seeing home too long are you sure it's not time to leave the hospital they can unburden themselves of all of those practicalities because the Jula takes care of all of that\nUm and and you know so I like to say that I you know in some labor's yes the dead you know would love to just sort of say you know what I don't feel so comfortable being you know involved or putting you know doing massage or or even being in the room I had had a few like that and that's fine you know as long as\nA mom and dad are on the same page about that that's fine but I find that many of the partners that I work with ultimately say that you know they they felt that they were going to not be involved at all or um or feel kind of shut out or Elle bowed out of the of the process\nAnd you know so many of them say you know what I felt so much more involved than I thought I Would be an effective way because either you showed me how to put my hands on her or you just relieved made for worrying about all the other things\nSo that I could I could be there to provide the kind of support that I you know that I Want it to provide I felt comfortable providing\nUm and you know they just they just so much safer I'm providing that support they didn't you know they felt like they had a guy to sort of show them you know more effective support like they they you know many men say they're afraid to put their hands on their laboring\nUm you know their laboring partner because they're afraid they're going to touch with the wrong way and if I show you know a partner how to provide counter pressure or how to you know touch her that I mean there's no like super you know uh there's no magic to this I mean it's it's all about you know just\nJust the kinds of things that you do to make your partner feel better any day that she's feeling crappy\nDay that like a little bit you know a little bit sore during the pregnancy or a little bit sad about something or a little bit overwhelm you know it's all of that it's just it's just a different kind of day that's all it's just you know the day that you're that you're giving birth but I you know\nEarners really don't need to be afraid and I think to his help them to to not be afraid\nYeah I agree a hundred percent I Know he felt the benefit a lot and he and everything that you said and I know that I Would have probably been at the hospital first thing in the morning when my contract and very few minutes apart and you kept me\nIn we have to be in a hotel room because we went there because of a big storm but you happen to keep me there\nFor ten hours which I Would not have done if it weren't for you and I was so happy that we did because I was thrilled to labor there than to go to the hospital and has to possibly get interventions which I knew I didn't want to get if I didn't have to you how do you improve birth outcome how does it do like general sees as\nWell you just touched on that a little bit I mean I think so many women think that you know as soon as they started having contractions that start to feel uncomfortable or painful that it's time to run to the hospital\nAnd the earlier you get there the more likely you are to have interventions thrust upon you because you know let's face it hospitals or tax resources they don't want 'em laboring women in their rooms for you know thirty six hours um because they need the space especially in a Manhattan hospital and you you know\nI'm we're not in Manhattan but I see it all the time you know people actually get sent home which is really demoralizing by the way I imagine you're going to the hospital it out until you know you're not in labor I sending you you're not in good labor enough and then right at home so I think you know helping 'em women labor at home for as long as possible\nUm as long as it's safe as long as there aren't any you know I I'm an exceptional risk factors that ... her being in the hospital I think that's really important\nUm and I think you'll is are kind of sherpas in that way I certainly didn't come up with that term I think Ricky lake did um but we just kind of know how it looks when it's time to go to the hospital especially on the more experience you have the more you just then\nI'm based and everything you're seeing from the laboring woman how you know how she looks when it's really time to go and I remember ... already actually looking at me hope you don't mind me showing this this this little tidbit in saying but Michelle's contractions or this far apart and lasting this long shouldn't we be\nGoing on and I remember looking thing I Know the books say that\nBut she just doesn't look like she's there yet like she's in that zone where we really needs to be there yet and I think we stayed in the hotel room another three or four or five hours after after he asked question and still got to the hospital and plenty of time we didn't like walk in and have you deliver in five minutes or anything like that\nYou know there was enough time to get settled and and and all that but um\nBut it's it's a you know I think the numbers um are are are misleading you know you should call you call your doctor and go to the hospital and which actions are five minutes apart lifting a minute for an hour and ... first time mom's not all but for most for my mom's that's going to get them there she rarely\nI once was or are we do is help women to navigate the system to ask questions um interventions do get to just all the time oh I just want to break your water\nOr a let me just give you a little chosen that'll just make things happen a little faster and do it if there were there to not to make decisions for the labor and woman but to just sort of say hey\nDo you have any questions for your doctor about this about you know why he or she is is recommending chosen or recommending breaking your water um you know because maybe it's not really necessary maybe it's about you know convenience and\nUm or maybe they think that you want it to go faster but you're very comfortable just sort of waiting things out and letting things\nProgress on their own the Jews are there to to help the couple to help the mom um to to get information to ask questions so that she can make informed decisions and I think that reduces unnecessary ...\nWhen I when I Wish I Wish we had more time to talk because there's so much more I Would like to share and so you'll have to come back on the other

ten years of growing up brand as well as growing by family and and I think there's a lot of women out\nThere who think motherhood means you have to put a pause button on the career but this was hopefully a guide for women to see that they can have both career\nAnd family now I'm not saying that you couldn't have everything but I Do believe you're going to have those two things and you know

wondering is it possible to could launch something new\nWhile also being intimately involved and engaged with my family and hopefully there are more and more business there could be launched my mom and dad I Can't get all of them personally but it was a great experience to write it and get that resource to women\nYeah I Will say personally that I struggle with that and that I have so many ideas and even launching my part of the business end with this radio show and at the beginning when I first gave birth I thought\nHow on earth can I Do everything is just takes up all night time and I was a stay at home mom I still am a but there's just things have to yeah right and I think a lot of stay at home moms have to say you know it it's okay if\nI bring my child maybe your program or a few hours

encourage families to take it to snow ski trips that they're used used to taking one or two and really getting some new families out on snow and specifically I'd love to see even more diversity out there on the slopes and\nUh we're we're really going for those families as well as mom trends\nRight so let me ask you because skiing is one sport that I never learned as a kid and I was really upset about it and I tried learning it probably five or ten years ago not very successfully\nAnd so I gave up and I thought but you know what I really want my kids learn how to ski and I want to be able to take those heat trapping so it is it am I a lost cause can I still learn\nYou can definitely still learned I didn't start skiing until I was thirty five um I\nGrew up in Maryland play the cross says

eight one one was an honor to have the ambassador\nTo the United states from Israel with us unfortunately under these circumstances run drummer first I'd like your general take on or what has taken place here and secondly I Know you've been in Pittsburgh who did you meet with um what did you see there's there\nWhile it's you know a horrific act or worse than a Semitic attack in us history they climbed eleven lives I I was in Pittsburgh yesterday\nGot to meet with the members of the community you got to meet with the mayor with the county executive\nI'm with Senator Casey was there we had a a congressman Republicans and Democrats and talk to a lot of people I have to tell you mark it's a very very strong community and I think a special community and squirrel hill a Pittsburgh they're they're very very tight knit\nIt's not just among the Jewish community but also the Dodgers community supporting them and I went to an event last night\nUh that really brought out the entire community faith leaders Christians are Jewish faith leaders of Muslim leader who actually spoke there as well and spoke very well and uh I think the whole community is just trying to support\n'em the Jewish community there and everyone told me the same thing we never thought it was going to happen here\nAnd I think they were just shocked and start and uh and what I wanted to do with Israel's ambassador to the United states is just tell them that Israel stance with them that they're not alone\nAnd in Israel yesterday morning our government may taught Sunday because some days like Monday and Israel the first day of the week\nAnd the government meets every Sunday and there was a moment of silence where the entire government of Israel stood because we are the one and only Jewish state so we feel a special sense of solidarity with Jewish communities around the world and that's why we support for me to be in Pittsburgh uh yesterday\nNow you were born in Miami I just want people to know this you're born in Miami your father was the mayor of Miami or brother was the mayor of Miami\nMiami Beach Miami Beach was about that yeah we're the ones with the speech that that's true [noise] um\nSo you know the United states very very well obviously you were an Israeli citizen and you are you're very close to the prime minister of Israel so when you look at this we see growing anti Semitism throughout Europe\nOr the FBI put out a report to the latest report you see growing anti Semitism or hate crimes as I called in the United states what do you make of this\nOr we kind of it is as you say a growing problem uh many people want to say that it began a two thousand sixteen with President Trump's election that simply\nTrue and you should look at the FBI statistics that you mentioned\nAh in two thousand fourteen and two thousand Fifteen\nA hate crimes against Jews accounted for over half of hate crimes against religious groups in the United states not it was only two percent of the population mark and their\nAccounting for over half and by the way there were periods over the last Fifteen Years was about Seventy five percent of the number of uh\nUh attack the crimes against Jews were actually much bigger than I was in two thousand fourteen of two thousand Fifteen I really think what you have mark is is the rise of anti Semitism over the last couple of decades which you had was about a half century after the Holocaust\nWhere it was politically incorrect to attack choose\nAnd I think what you've seen happen over the last two decades\nIs that it's once again become fashionable or to attack cues and it's no longer politically incorrect to go after ... now most of the attacks actually hide themselves behind the mask of hatred towards Israel to one and only Jewish state\nI but at the singling out of Israel is very much like they used to single out the Jews for special treatment so I think you've seen this on the rise it's not just in America\nIt's all around the world you've seen attacks against Jews in Paris attacks against choosing to lose attack against Jews in Copenhagen attacks against Jews in Brussels and in London and even in the United states uh this is not the first attack\nThere was an attack in two thousand six hundred you federation in Seattle there was an attack in two thousand fourteen at a Jewish community center a added outside of Kansas Kansas City which I think claimed three lives\nAnd this is just the worst attack but this is a growing problem and I think one of the issues is social media\nBecause you know you can have a very very small fraction of the population that are these are you know these crazy I don't know if I'd call them crazy but evil people um you could have a a one one hundredth of one percent could be thirty thousand Americans um and there's a stream missing I can be people like\nDavid Duke it could be neo Nazis it could be white nationalist all sorts of people but online they can actually build communities have hate in a way that they couldn't do before so I think as you get more and more people going into social media as you have this rise of these online hate groups I think it's extremely dangerous Senate dangerous and it it has given\nThem a sense of community of haters and I think it's important to take action against that I Will tell you marketed in Israel we monitor the Internet now we're a different country and you have constitutional protections here I Know that you're\nYou're a great defender of them are we don't have a First Amendment Second Amendment Fourth Amendment but hopefully your law enforcement authorities can figure out a way within your in laws and constitutional rights that Americans have to figure out a way to monitor this so they can see one sort of this kind of hate pops up\nAnd then be able to take action before the crime takes place that's what we have in Israel\nUm and it's been very effective at preventing a lot of these types of attacks I mean I Would love to believe that this was going to be the last attack but I think given that these all these haters are communicating with each other I think it's important for your forties to see what they can do to prevent\nThe next attack and you also have armed guards at many of your senator yeah that's\nThat's a reality that unfortunately Jews face around the world if you go to London and offend a God you are more likely than not to see actually a policeman or a police car outside same thing in Paris same thing in Brussels and other places around the world that you don't want to see that happen

Hawley versus Claire McCaskill Josh Hawley how are you sir\nI'm doing great thanks so much for having me\nWell it's my pleasure every election cycle Claire McCaskill tries to remake herself into some kind of a modern I just solar interviewed on Fox where she says hey look I with Trump half the time and I love post Kavanaugh because of his views on foreign money in campaigns and\nNow are the people in Missouri going to buy this trick one more time no\nThey're not you know Senator McCaskill is trailing in the polls that she's a she's a little desperate to be honest with you\nMark and as you should be because listen she is out of step with the voters of the state it's just that simple I mean they told her\nThat they wanted her to get with the program they voted for two thousand sixteen by twenty points by the way President Trump won the state by twenty\nAt dinner McCaskill turned her out to vote no on Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court no one justice Kavanaugh no on the tax cuts no on border security no on rebuilding the military I mean it's just she could not be more out of step\nWhat does she running a New Yorker Missouri yeah exactly\nWell most of her money comes from New York and California that she'd be a great senator for one of those places but for this state hardly and a ... that's her big problem and that's why she's down in the old she is just out of touch with the people of our good state\nI mean she really is a left us to be perfectly honest with you her votes really are not much different from a Bernie Sanders or ... and of course she will vote to make Chuck Schumer the leader of her up of the uh the Democrats in the Senate and she does that every time right\nAbsolutely she votes with him about Ninety percent of the time she has accepted twenty six million dollars and expenditures are from Chuck Schumer he has spent more money in Missouri than anywhere else in the country\nTrying to prop up a center McCaskill end up by her seat and you know that's the kind of thing that Missouri's just don't take too well I mean they they don't want anybody coming in and tell them how to vote and they have Chuck Schumer come into our state and try to\nJust isn't flying [noise] the the top three issues in Missouri or as far as you see them what are they in what are your positions on\nWhile I Would start with pro constitution judges and what happened to justice Cavanaugh is a big big issue in this race it really exposed I think the left thirst for power the radical nature of their agenda and the fact that they have not accepted and are not willing to accept\nThe results of the two thousand sixteen election and the rule of we the people you know they want to do everything they can to try to get their hands on power to undo what we the people have said\nAnd that is a huge issue in this race immigration is a huge issue in this race border security especially with this caravan as it continues to master the move towards the border Claire McCaskill is sponsoring and open borders bill in Congress\nThe most radical open borders bill ever introduced and that that is a huge huge issue and then I think ah ah economic growth wage growth Senator McCaskill voted against\nThe middle class tax cuts she's voted over two hundred times to raise taxes in Congress and that people want somebody is going to be a fighter for\nThe middle class and workers and not just another big government liberal\nBut you know these big government liberals think they found an issue you know that's a pre existing conditions on health care and they keep running around the country and every state by the way including your state with McCaskill saying you will oppose or ... or ... methods of protecting people with pre existing conditions is that your position as she just trying to make that your position\nOh she's just trying to make that my ... that's a total and ridiculous faucet and she knows it and I've called her out on many times in our debates\nI support or forcing insurance companies to cover folks with preexisting conditions on the same terms everybody else here's the difference mark I don't think we need Obamacare to do it and I think that we should stop holding hostage patients who have pre existing conditions and everybody else too by the way holding them all hostage to Obamacare in my state\nIncome health care prices have increased a hundred and forty five percent on those health care exchanges that is the national average things a hundred and two percent which is terrible but in Missouri it's a hundred and forty five percent families just can't afford their insurance\nThat's because of Obamacare it's because of Claire McCaskill she won't support any plan that isn't Obamacare because she's a she's a big government liberal\n[noise] now is she going on about Medicare for all or is she duct that one\nWell she she tries to duck because he says he's open to it you know she's open to of course we all know that that's\nWhere this is headed and we all know that that that she'll never vote against her party I mean she never does on ... any major issue an issue consequences and you know my worry is look they cut seven hundred and sixty billion dollars out of Medicare in order to pay for Obamacare imagine what they'll do\nTo pay for their government run health care scheme so you know it it is just a ... it will devastate folks who are or who have paid into the system that will devastate families who are just barely making it now and and trying to get a hold of private insurance and that this is part of the radical Democrat agenda Claire McCaskill's on board\nWith that you make a good point Medicare for all his Medicare for nobody because they have to abolish Medicare they have to abolish every employer based private plan that the polished all private insurance and basically turning us into one DMZ VA right\nExactly exactly and you know the fact is Senator McCaskill has voted already to cut that seven hundred and sixteen billion dollars out of Medicare that's money that goes to hospitals money that goes to home health services money that was supposed to go to hospice they cut all of that\nTo pay for Obamacare which of course is driven prices up through the ceiling here and now they now they want to cut further and that and take it all away and it's just part of their plan they all just like they want to throw the borders are just like they want to go back to uh allowing trade cheaters to take away our jobs are this is the wrong agenda for this country and I tell you
