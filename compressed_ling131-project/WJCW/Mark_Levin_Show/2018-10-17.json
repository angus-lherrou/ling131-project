I Want to talk about with what you were just touching on but um this is Taylor Swift thing could be even a larger on a larger scale where people are just rejecting a Hollywood talking heads as being anybody of\nAny value or lack of value whatsoever that's number one\nNumber two I don't know if you recall but on a night of nine eleven you remember they had that music vigil of ... a vigil with Springsteen and Tom Petty or their hand in the war drums the recall that\nNot really to be honest with you\nThey all came on and Tom Petty song is we won't back down um it was all a it was all of a kind of aggressive music that hinted towards we're coming at you but they're the same they all come from the same cost especially Springsteen were they were anti war\nA it they they are just so hypocritical I'm hoping to God that people are just not taken I'm Serious anymore\nI can take I tell you this much in in Tennessee in particular there's some places where this celebrity's ... if you're in California I have no doubt that plays in fact there is research that did show up from Columbia University back to two thousand eight\nA presidential primary to where there are Democrats or a percentage of them that are activated by celebrity but you've got to you know somebody's got to be open to the message is what I talk about when a I'll describe being politically persuasive one of the most common questions I get how is it that I find somebody who I can uh you know convince of of what's right\nWell it the first thing is you've got to find somebody who is open to the information if you find somebody who's close minded\nWell it doesn't matter how hard to try their not to the information so when the case of the celebrities when you're talking about what's going on in Tennessee\nWell you've got a large swath of that population that is not not going to be turned on\nBy a celebrity endorsement but what's worse and this is the most offensive thing and I say there's not really a true southerner in the sense that I'm from suburban Atlanta\nAnd to be honest with you I didn't even know what the the saying get out of the judgment until I was sixteen that kind of thing didn't come up where where I was from but I Do understand a lot of southern culture and\nYou know when you say that you have tendency now use\nAnd you're not only not from Tennessee

you know the more conservative area but I just ... hoping to God that these numbers who who who rely on these celebrities for their political opinions are shrinking more and more and more\nThat's my hope\nYeah I I think the only celebrity that are necessary have to worry about in terms of this cycle\nIs the president of the United states I mean there is an irony there are certain extent you know he's obviously successful independent up the celebrity but you know I just ah pointing out with somebody otherwise probably will as I don't appreciate uh Joe and Menendez\nI mean come on really ...

gunned down by some illegal alien but for the last week or ten days the media is in overdrive the blame Trump\nOr Jared Kushner or some relationship there saying somehow we did it that were

MPs is on speed dial with ... and Trump taking orders assuming he did it what does that mean what might be behind it is is\nThere are many in this country and in the media who\nThinks the Iranian deal was wonderful for our country and that brought Hussein Obama delivered one point eight billion dollars in cash on governmental pilots to use for terrorism by Iran man that was a great idea we ought to do more of that and so because Saudi Arabia is the pitch enemy of Iran\nMaybe those in the media wants to get back to the Iranian deal and weaken Saudi Arabia in the middle east\nSo that Iran takes over larger chunks of the middle east Iraq and Syria not paying enough maybe that's what's behind it plus as you may know if you've been paying attention Israel and Saudi Arabia have become brothers they become sisters they become friendly with each other because their enemy is Iran\nThere for the enemy of my enemy is my friend so because Israel and Iran are enemies and because Saudi Arabia and Iran are enemies now Israel and Saudi Arabia are working together and lots of areas so there may be parts of America that wants to get rid of that uh that budding\nFriendship between Israel and Saudi Arabia by weakening the Saudis but whatever it is we don't have a dog in this fight\nYou may want to strengthen Iran and the media does or weaken Israel which the media does\nBut by doing that were hurting our country after nine eleven which I think Fifteen of the Nineteen hijackers came from Saudi Arabia we got a little sideways with Saudi Arabia for a while but now we're back together and they're spending\nI think the president said the other day something in the range of a hundred and ten billion with a total cost the five hundred billion dollars a of taking our military hardware to upgrade their military to fight Iran who's our enemy they'd been our enemy since ... since we help get rid of the shah of Iran look what happened there\nAnd so whatever happen happen it occurred let the Saudi Arabians deal with it if the government ordered the killing of someone which by the way America itself has done on a regular basis countries do these kinds of things if Saudi Arabian government decided to murder\nJamal ... show gig and stupidly they decided to pick a consulate in Turkey\nTo do the Daschle deed and if that's a violation of some criminal law somewhere to the Turks are the sides you know what I say have at it\nBut according to diplomatic law the consulate Israeli Saudi Arabian territory and so what happened there stays in Saudi Arabia so whatever happens happens it is what it is can we move on absolutely not you see\nThe mid term so now only about what twenty days away twenty days from now the midterms and so things are heading toward\nThe Republican way in

to help Trump we can have that so they started this other thing about ...\nWho was killed\nIn Turkey and he's a Saudi now as we speak the last several days there have been hundreds of Americans who have been killed a few dozen ... illegal aliens there was a horde of some two or three thousand Central Americans making their way up to America\nPaying their passage MS Thirteen with are girls being raped and men being killed it's happening right now and so there's other news stories going on in the world and because it was kind of going toward Trump's direction and his resume and prove all reading was up to fifty one percent the media might have said you know what\nThis is going the wrong direction if we can go after some out the sides and you and in their place put Jared Kushner and

and we have a case in Chris in Josh and many others to lines are open\nTo the ... ... if you'd desire to join his eight seven seven three one two three one one\nLast night before I go to you I keep babbling but that's a good look at it this way Tony days from now\nAnd uh I met with the president or two or three days ago we are going to share with you some of his thoughts later on\nThat ah it appears to me\nThat the number one issue right now is the court system is I just told you Seventy percent of the judges are appointed by Democrats great majority of the cases Ninety nine point nine nine percent never get U.S Supreme court and so if\nIn twenty days the Senate flips through the Democratic party Chuck Schumer will hold back and not come from any\nAny of the White House's judicial nominees through twenty twenty which really is January of twenty Twenty one\nAnd then at that point if Trump was reelected which most of us believe he will do this and that state's democratic is not going to be twenty Twenty one and it'll be twenty twenty three he will not stop\nThey will not nominate a you could nominate but they will not confirmed one judge so what's on the ballot and twenty days is the court system and whether the destruction of our constitutional several more rights than traditional values will continue\nOn or else we can make the turn some out back to the mental secondly all the investigations if the house becomes democratic which is appears to be very likely the investigations of every aspect of Trump's live his\nWife's life Jared Kushner's live everyone's like from the White House will be laid bare and the next two years or not be about legislation but rather investigation so if you want the mob rule that you've seen the past several months where Republicans are shot\nRun off the street cars blown up and beaten than incentivize the mob by giving the mob power by putting their house back in Georgia Nancy Pelosi and watch what happens\nIt's going to be unbridled is going to be unbelievable another aspect of course is foreign policy right now\nDespite the efforts of CNN and others to destroy our relationship with the sides\nThings are pretty good North Korea's not shooting missiles anywhere right now Iran and Iraq are somewhat quiet right now Syria is heading toward a conclusion I've got a horrible war incentivized by the Russians by the Iranians and vibrant Hussein Obama who allowed the Russians and the Iranians to come into Syria\nForeign policy wise things are pretty good that's on the ballot\nEconomy according to some national international experts the American economy right now is the greatest it's ever been in American history\nHow were the stock market react and Nancy Pelosi begins investigations of every aspect of the executive branch of government it won't be good plus you got the impeachment issue is there any doubt in your mind that the Democrats who went to eliminate Trump from office so if you went to the next two years not to be about judges\nNot to be about er and only about investigations and impeachment and hurt the economy and that's what's on the ballot\nSo when Trump comes to one of these states and he came to Cincinnati a few days ago I spent some time with them and and play some of his thoughts later on if that happens\nDo they're just don't talk which is all we do go they're physically in confront and say yes I Am here as as testimony to what this country can be and should be do I like all the tweets do I like the horse had comment about the strip or no\nBut the policies the procedures what's happening with the court system what's happening with the economy what's happening with Foreign Relations you know is damn good it's really good and so\nThink about what's on the ballot and twenty days because the Democrats are incentivized says they've ever been and it's going to get more ridiculous they're going to be more incentivize interview incentivize the mob by buying them off or paying them off is going to be nothing but difficulties so let's go to your calls now\nWe have a case in Los Angeles than Chris in Atlanta one becomes available you know the routine let's continue with more Keith in Los Angeles welcome to the market live in show hosted by the great American bill Cunningham please go ahead\n[laughter] hey bill thank you for taking my call you asked a question if the U.S is complicit with a democracy okay I'm murder I Would say two hundred percent yes and ran and won fame that because I've been looking at al Jazeera English and they've been reporting from day one that us and tell us I don't know if it's the deep state\nBut they link that they had conversations with authority plant and his entourage around arranged a kitten that this guy though and if you look at regularly um John Brennan the last two days and then and they say he confirmed that the CIA operatives so I think\nUm yeah we are complex and even though we didn't have involvement in the murder and we did not warn him and that's what a big issue on the bottom point\nOut on on that point do you believe al Jazeera any more than you believe CBS\nWhy why why do you rely on al Jazeera which is an arm of the extreme Muslim Palestinian Authority why do you believe outages era how to cut her why do you believe them I wouldn't blame one word they said\nOkay I hear what you're saying but when they're right there at the same\nFor twenty four seven out of your family the factual information all doing is recording the factual information where both on the ground though I don't\nKnow how we're going to get them because they're they're the member grow their there when the team members grow out you cannot deny what you see what your own eyes and a lot of point\nFor you to hold on Cape assuming those things happen and and I certainly except they're true is not not nearly as bad as a few hundred Americans killed every year by illegal aliens how come we're focusing on that awful murder and not what's happening inside of our own country\nIf you can't seem to stay ahead of your bills than this messages for you how would you like to have a large portion of your credit

be back with you on Monday\nBy the way mark ... dead jak live in say the name Jacqueline as a book coming out on October the thirtieth through Amazon our police which is a fabulous children's book\nIt's available now on Amazon thirty percent off name of the book once again as our police by jak live in March dad and a pre order now saved up to thirty percent to talk about police and the way they're treated well\nIf CNN and the national media went into the killing of police officers all over the country by individuals that have not been solved of which there are many not solved and what if they spent the time they're spending all ... in a ...\nFinding out who killed police officers when the murders of not going to resolve including wandering barge town Kentucky with a police officer who was killed about two o'clock in the morning and they're looking for his murder he was pulling off a highway that night two o'clock in the morning and wife and two kids\nAnd some more than a quarter to a a limb across the exit ramp on the interstate highway so a police officer would stop he stopped got out of his lights on poll dilemma way and was shot several times\nIn the back and it's that there are numerous killings of police officers in America as I speak unresolved\nAnd if you think every life has been saying which I think in God's eyes it might be Ninety percent\nOf the murders on the Southside of Chicago go unsolved\nOr to CNN instead of caring about could show you so much found its way to the south side of Chicago to discover why there's about four thousand people shot and seven hundred murdered every year under the leadership of one of the dailies around me man you're well or Iraq Hussein Obama and Michelle Obama Jesse Jackson or Louis Farrakhan\nOr the fame would cover murders in Chicago or the murder of Kate styling or the murder of police officers unsolved with the same level of interest that they care about a Saudi citizens murdered seemingly bothers Saudi Government and in a\nConsulate in Turkey ... what is it about this event which suddenly the entire media is a meltdown as it possibly trying to tie Trump to the murder\nIs that what you had a we had a caller earlier today that al Jazeera now there is a reliable news source says the U.S intelligence agencies knew about the killing to take place at a time and didn't stop it and not a nice thing to say I hope we didn't know about it\nI Hope that we knew nothing and that or if he was the cap potato do put an asset or tortured for seven minutes that's off what's bad those responsible should be held to account by Saudi Arabians or by Turks how are we involved why some media trying to pin this on Jared Kushner\nHow come some murders are created more equal than others\nCage dialing the person the illegal alien that killed her got off for basically nothing\nThe CNN cover that story to the extent that murder goes by without punishment how many hundreds of American citizens are murdered every year by legal aliens can we have some coverage of that or do I get nothing but crickets from the mainstream media just seems to me like some murders are more creative\nEqual than other murders and you didn't know I didn't know Jamal could show he seemed like a nice guy at a wife and some good kids should not have been murdered along with the half a million Syrians murdered by the Iranians and the Russians and and buy a Assad who was praised by Hillary Clinton\nIt's all bad outcome some murders have this kind of media attention and others do not [noise]\nContinuing your calls as you were going to go to Josh and him and John and shady and many others alone ever becomes available a seven seven three one three eighty one one\nHe'll Cunningham the great American and for the gray one Mark Sullivan [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrying to talk radio station in Eugene cw Johnson City for the first [noise]\nRecordings requested Russia probe defended Africa's\nAnd Trump said to us has asked tricky for audio and video related to the missing Washington Post journalist democracy ...\nUnless you're using exist probably does possibly does a a level on record on that from my point of\nSecretary of state Mike compound that with officials in Turkey and Saudi Arabia about the journalists disappearance alleged murder inside the consulate in Istanbul Republican Senator Ben Sasse says this is not a small matter that will be swept under the Bronx\nOr his family didn't have peace in the front door people came in and out there were a black lawyers and black doctors and black pharmacist and black business leaders black insurance men all over the place functioning black communities\nGenerally controlled by the Republican Party because the ... the Republican Party was a home of African Americans from the Eighteen sixties through the Nineteen thirties and be on it was functional\nAnd so what if CNN spend its time saying okay we're going to go to an area that's been completely controlled by the Democratic party for or at least a half a half a century and see how those theories are working out to see if it's occurring to see if\nI'm is non existent to see of job creation is happening everywhere to see if educationally the children are exceeding Adam\nAbove their their grade level\nTo see families are being formed to see if families wanting to move in\nYou want to move into those communities and we want to see if there is moving trucks bringing new families in the south side of Chicago and then the barriers of Memphis in Tampa and San Francisco and Los Angeles and ... Texas we want to go to the poorest areas where the Democrats have been in charge the longest to see how successful\nThere are theories have been\nI'm waiting for CNN to do that why haven't they done that\nEverything's Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump what about the lives of average Americans according to the ... according to the department of education about half the black kids\nThe poor kids who go to an inner city school don't graduate they give it up along the route and they have to do graduate the best academically agreed on average at the eighth grade level with all the money being spent in Washington DC\nGood chunk don't graduate twenty to thirty percent don't even go to school any particular day the vacancy rates are through the roof and the reason is not race because most poor people in America mathematically or white\nThe reason it happens is the lack of family formation whack a job opportunities rampant crime because the drugs and the Democrats had been when was the last time there was a Republican in charge of Washington DC and the city council of the ... what was the last time there was a Republican who was the mayor of Chicago\nWhat was the last time any of this stuff went on the answer is decades up to a half a century it doesn't happen so of these series of Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi or operational and they actually work\nWe would see a completely different result wouldn't we\nMust continue now let's go to Josh in Alexandria Josh and Alexander a welcome to the article of in show and Josh please go ahead\n[laughter] well thanks for taking my call ... ... I wanted to ask since when did the last start to want us to vote on other countries' businesses I mean the Scott Korb or what happened but you know Saudi Arabian citizen it happened and Saudi Arabia or at the sea and turkey\nAnd last last time I checked they spent a decade saying\nOh why are we involved in Iraq why it out with all of with all the war crimes with ...\nWith Iraq and and uh Saddam Hussein and now they want us to start meddling it just because they think they can tie Trump to it I mean it's just crazy to me\nWhat what can we what should be the reaction I guess October the second or ... was killed in a horrible way\nBut in America there are cops killed there's American citizens murder by legal aliens there's horrible domestic violence happening there there's crimes happening tonight somewhere terrible not solved why does CNN want to use that crime\nEight thousand miles away as a cudgel against Trump what's the reason\nI ... I mean personally I think it's because it's a horrible story and be a Trump is looming on all fronts right now and they are desperate to find a way to to bring him down and that's just one little thing they're going to try to throw them but I personally don't think it's going to work\nBut it's a they're just desperate for anything to try to try to bring him down and tie him up at the center says she doesn't know\nWhat this thing what is there about this thing what can show gay I guess it wrote some counts the Washington Post who had a green card but it is a Saudi Arabian citizen killed in Turkey I guess on Saudi Arabian territory\nAnd yet and yet what ah it's\nIt's what I mean it's interesting when a when re most in lieu were murdered in New York City in cold blood by a black nationalist who came from Baltimore to specifically kill in uniform in their car\nPolice officers in New York City that was like a one day story\nNationally and then it evaporated died because it didn't fit the agenda of the liberal national media can you imagine if some Trump wearing M. A. G. A. had had hunted down somebody to kill somewhere how big without being story how long without going on\nOh would have been the top story for a week and I think you brought up a good point\nWho do you think the left is wanting to the site and click or a journalist or one of their own or a police officer and I say that all the people who are amount of others don't like police officers but they're gonna be much quicker to rush to the case of of one of their own and works at the Washington Post rather than a our of our um police officers\nIsn't that a parent I mean why why do we spent I mean I haven't seen it tonight I refuse to watch it I imagine it right now it's the biggest story on CNN and MSNBC holidays as about Chris choking 'cause showed me what to Jared Kushner knew who knew NBS better was a ... or was it\n... or was that Trump and did sod spend money and wanted Trump properties at some point they keep making these connections you know what I care about\nIs the murder of re most in lieu\nAnd what that said about Brock Hussein Obama meeting in the White House with representatives of black lives matter who advocated the murder of police officers and when B. L. M. got what they want it what are we went dead cops when he won them now and ... were tortured and killed\nThat was a one day story and the media quickly dropped it because of who did it one officer Jason Ellis was murdered\nIn a barge sound Kentucky ambush Kelly we don't know who did it and at this point\nWhat is in the media spent time instead of a ... show geek in Turkey take up the calling of a police officer who was tortured and murdered in uniform\nAnd spent time as to who killed him and why was murdered re most so Lewis killed according to the black nationalist he said that he wanted to come and kill police officers because what cops had done to Michael Brown\nAnd Eric Garner and so the media covered those stories as if cops killed wrongfully Michael Brown in Ferguson which they did not do Michael Brown tried to kill\nA police officer Darren Wilson and it was proven beyond a shadow of a doubt\nBy Obama's Justice Department than Michael Brown should have been killed because of his behavior and Eric Gardner killed was killed he died because he was resisting arrest\nAnd so but when the media cover these events there was a sick mine in Baltimore who thought police officers ... fold because of the way CNN covered the killing of Michael Brown who was an unarmed robber who tried to kill police officer Darren Wilson\nAnd grab his gun inside the police car and that was proven that was proven but the media cover these events in such a way that causes black murder nationalist how down ... New York city and murder them why didn't CNN covered that aspect to the story and the fact that Obama in the White House repeatedly\nMet with representatives of black lives matter that advocates murder of cops who were killed in Dallas in Baton Rouge why didn't CNN cover it that way\n[noise] [noise] because it doesn't fit their narrative 'em and they think that that they've doesn't ...\nIt doesn't in other words they can't use that as a weapon\nAgainst a either John Banner or George Bush Ronald Reagan or now it's now it's Donald Trump see the media ought to call balls and strikes\nBut instead of doing that they take sides in a dispute and ignore all this other evidence that doesn't fit their agenda\nAnd then they go after the obscure fact I'm some saw being killed in Turkey which they can use as a club against Jared Kushner because Assad's have invested in real estate ventures of Trump years ago and they spend money at the hotel next to the White House so they keep looking for reasons\nThat tight Trump to the murder and ... seconds me Josh thank\nYou for your call let's continue with more we have a Kim and John and JD and Tom are a couple of days ago I met with the

deep into this ... playing a little bit difficulty and is doing quite well so instead of dealing with that let's talk about ... trip to Africa how things go\nWell she's a terrific first lady and a great human being and she wanted to go and see for herself Africa because we've heard so much about it some very good step but some very tough stuff in the sense of the way people live\nAnd she made forceps and she also went to the pyramids and Egypt and that was quite something special but uh and the poverty is incredible you know the level of poverty it was very sad a beautiful in one way and very sad and I know the kids were beautiful they loved her\nAnd she came back and she said I Hope you're going to continue to give a lot of money because they needed it's not a question of it's not a question of defense is not a question of it it's just it's on the human race as they need it and she had a big impact on me I Will tell you a bill she really had a big impact on\nMe and the other thing the mid west I look at Canada Mexico and South Korea\nMillions of jobs have been credit and you were told a year or two ago by Gary Cohn and others that you know the candidate deal is probably not going to happen Mexico's too tough NAFTA is ingrained what'd you do that caused Canada may not be real happy right now in Mexico may not be real happy and then South Korea\nTo kind of play because we're the big dog in the kennel but they don't treat it that way what did you do with the\nDeal and we're also the piggy bank that everybody wants to come and Rob and uh Mexico we made a deal and we told him look otherwise we're going to have to just actually car industry which would have been bad for them and frankly I wouldn't have wanted to do it but we will go\nTo do it and we made a deal with Mexico we could not make a deal with Canada they just wouldn't make a deal that was fair for us because NAFTA was a total and complete disaster you know that better than all of that you saw what happened over here with you still have building's empty with just everybody moved out\nI don't know what they were taken so that's why I refused to call it NAFTA I said the deal with making I refused so we call it the U.S embassy a and it works good but we made a great deal with a\nWith everybody what happened then is Kennedy came along in the end\nWe were unable to make it I said we're going to tax you cars coming in and then what happened and they made a deal they made a deal they made a deal and it's a deal that we're very happy with I Hope they're very happy with I Hope everybody is but it's a fair deal for us and\nUh we have now we just made a deal with South Korea which is fabulous much a much improved approved deal you know improved I Will say that Hillary Clinton do you remember she made that deal and she said it's two hundred and fifty thousand jobs and she was right for South Korea so they got two hundred and fifty we didn't get two hundred and fifty\nIt was a terrible deal so essentially we terminated that deal and we made a new deal with South Korea are so\nMany jobs and talking to my Everytime I cannot Mexico we're talking about a million\nWell you're talking about millions of jobs for potential don't forget we've opened up countries that were just totally close to right if you look at Canada we couldn't sell our dairy products out there and if we did it was a three hundred percent of people don't talk about that you know if I put on a ten percent or twenty percent the Arabs they make a big deal of if they have three hundred\nActually three hundred percent two hundred and Seventy five percent two hundred and eighty five percent these are the terrorists they charge so essentially that's a wall\nBecause if you have to pay a tariff like that you can't sell the product is so expensive so we've opened up Canada and we have a very good relationship now I think they respect us more than they did before\nBut now at least it's fair in our farmers are in love with it you see what's going on it's beautiful now we're working on China and we're working on the European Union which have absolutely taken advantage of our country is the European Union has been brutal and the way they took advantage of the United states for many years\nI mean they were formed to take advantage of the United states that was a reason they were formed how can we\nHow can we take from the United states\nSo the European Union they formed and they uh they're very unfair to us they have barriers where we can't sell into their into into their countries\nThey have a tremendous tariffs that make it impossible and yet they still Mercedes Benz and BMWs by the millions they come in there and Indians and we charge him essentially no tax it's two and a half percent but for the most part they don't even not elected\nSo we charge them virtually nothing and they send millions and millions of cars if we want to send a a piece of grain okay we want to send the piece of grain we can't do it and to the European Union so it's unfair or we met with them I told them I'm going to start\nTaxing your cars because Obama they wouldn't even talk to them right they said we're very happy the way we are and that's that was that Obama just went away and then ah with us I said look we want to talk I didn't hear from I said we want to talk I didn't hear third time I said listen we're not every call me back but\nI'm going to give you one more chance and in ... that's okay I'm going to tax the cars at twenty five percent coming in which is frankly more money right it's devastating to them but it's more money and they immediately helped in a plane and came over and talk to and now they want to make a deal I I don't know that we're going to make a deal with um I can tell you they want to sure but we're going to make it one way or the\nRebuilding either way of five hundred million a year five trillion over ten we've built Shanghai we built Beijing at some point we've got to
