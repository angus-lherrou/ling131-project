actually during the opening\nAnd it says beyond behind the scenes of stop mass hysteria chosen my opening today it's getting it's like a fresh video it's up there already I Love technology\nSo I had my assistant to film a little opening with Donald Trump's speech my comments and then there it is for you to look at you might enjoy fake news comes to academia this is such a huge story and you don't have to be an academic\nSomebody put out one of these fraudulent journals called feminist geography you know the kind of talking about the amount of these are filled with these fraudulent useless journals that they publish to advance themselves and so there's a journal called gender place in culture another fake journal\nLet me explain something to you or I got a real PHD for a great University in Nineteen Seventy eight real one not in the crackerjack box not an honorary degree I worked so hard for it University of California Berkeley huge unimportant and there were no such thing as fake departments in those days\nBut with the assault on the university's by radical feminists and others they've created their own departments\nTheir own journals and what happened today proved beyond a reasonable doubt that most of them are completely fake\nAnd you have to read the article because an article was written by an author by a woman's name that was completely fake and it included a reprint in the back of the article of mine come by Adolf Hitler this isn't a feminist journal\nBut the actual co authors of the study were not the woman who submitted it to the so called peer reviews feminist journal\nIt was actually written by a some\nScientists\nTo show that most of these humanists publications or crap\nAnd was written by Peter ... an assistant professor of philosophy at Portland State and Helen pluck rose a London based scholar of English literature and history\nAnd then the author was supposed to be a Helen Wilson but it was actually a man named James Lindsey math doctorate so they put out fake studies and they concluded defect study with reprint the mine comes\nIt was so called peer reviewed by the feminist journal the gender journal and published by the so called gender journal\nSo even academics are starting to revolt against the revolting\nSubspecies that has dominated the campuses though and a destroying them with fake news and they form of mass

Trump should apologize\nPresident Trump's outright mockery of a sexual assault survivors riddled as it was with false woods was reprehensible nice the office of the presidency and beneath common decency from one person to another\nThese are the same lawyers for Dr Ford who refuse to turn over to the Senate Judiciary committee copies of her therapist notes even though they wave privilege

it's important the media attack this woman radio\nHosts attack this one TV\nHost attack this one senior judicial analysts attack this woman I said no no no no she's doing this exactly the right way\nNow I'm going to prove to you that that's the case not just tell you and it's not the pat myself on the back it's because I think you're very intelligent unfortunately most of the media do not

been trashing the ... prosecuted the Republicans hard to ask questions of Ford what was your name again Rachel what Rachel Mitchell I Will take a different view\nI Want to congratulate her she did exactly what needed to be done\nExactly what needed to be done this is why I Believe that in the end Kevin all now will be confirmed\nShe walked Dr Ford through various aspects of her allegation\nAnd what amazed me is some of these cable analysts were unhappy with it it's taking too long the people aren't going to follow this the Democrats are they're making speeches and they thought that was wiser because this was all based on emotion ever let me tell you the problem folks\nLet me tell you the problem\nI'm Sorry to say this but whether it's on cable TV and even this business people really think you're stupid people really don't think you're going to be able to follow these things you're smarter than broadcasters including me whether they're on TV or radio you have a great\nSix cent

saw\nSo I take exception to some out there I I thought she did a hell of a job it was very solid that was her purpose that's what she did that's what she accomplished and she she had to synthesize understand and then use an enormous amount of information a very short time and she did and she found gaps\nAre that's me from September twenty seven last Thursday and now virtually everybody's hanging on what she said\nAnd they should and there's even more\nAs the ex boyfriend comes forward noticed the Democrats don't want to talk to the ex boyfriend notice they don't demand that the FBI interview the ex boyfriend noticed the Democrats don't demand that the lawyers for a doctor for turnover her therapist notes from twenty ... twenty Thirteen have you noticed that\n\nNotice the Democrats don't demand is I've been saying repeatedly that Dr foreigner Laura's go to the Montgomery County police department in Maryland\n\nSo now they're saying the FBI did an interview for it and didn't interview cabinet well of course the FBI didn't interview them you know why this is not a criminal investigation we say this over over over and over again it is not a criminal investigation\nThey already know what Dr Ford has to say how do I know because we all know what Dr Ford had to say they already know what judge Kavanaugh has to say how do I know because we all know

up it really does create a problem doesn't and Mr producer\nI mean you go through this one thing after another after another and of course now they're indignant at the interview cabinet why you're going to change your opinion\nThat argument doesn't even make sense why is she going to change your opinion of the FBI that can be perjury I don't think she'll do that I interviewed judge Kavanaugh well why should they changes opinion I don't think so\nAll we need to get to the truth you know all they\nDo is to interview people and ask some questions to write it up and handed over it's only been said four billion times that that's what a background check it\n\nSo what is it that the FBI needs to find out now if they really did interview\nDoctor for it then they should take with them prosecutor Rachel Mitchell's memo and says well as several the ... tribe and racing and then have Dr Ford square the circle\nThat would be a real criminal investigation\nAnd they could do the same with Kavanaugh but I don't see any contradictions in his testimony deal\nI really don't\nI don't think you have a lot of ex Kavanaugh girlfriends coming forward and saying a while he lied about this and he lied about that and now that's not true\nHe did like the fly and er he wasn't claustrophobic and er he did this and he did that there's nobody who said that\nWell yeah I have this old guy and what they said it's real nice\nIt's realize and luckily didn't throw a lab or an ashtray ally Hillary Clinton\n\nCFCs are we talking about the truce anymore in my life I had a dear friend to use it to

our because devastating news coming out of Florence county in South Carolina this evening after five law enforcement officers were shot the latest from corresponding gene therapy\nWe have been able to confirm or affiliate are saying that one of the officers had died one of the five that we could have been shot had died in Florence South Carolina\nThe governor of South Carolina issued a statement saying this is devastating news from Florence asking for prayers for all officers involved the shooter is in custody\nThe FBI expanded its interviews beyond what it was initially directed to carry out as it looks into allegations of sexual misconduct involving Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh correspond Jessica Snyder fills us in\nSpecial agents are talking to additional people about uh July first Nineteen eighty two party that was listed on Kavanaugh's high school calendar already interviewed\nThat oppose slavery and oppose segregation those were not a Republican governor standing in the door house and then the Democrats trying to rewrite history well you know the old Democrats or the new Republicans no they're not\nNo they're not in the least the old Democrats are gone they didn't turn into young Republicans\nBut this mindset of nullification you can see with sanctuary cities secession you can see it in California where the radical left\n\nMindset about destroying individual human beings\nThe mindset about old white men and phrases like that it's the Democratic party\n\nThey just change their approach tall about power the Democratic party cannot survive if the nation is United what is the Democrat Party the Democratic party is an entity a political entity\nThat is\nMade up of disparate parts based on race based on religion or no religion based on income based on age\nAnd so forth and so and it is the party a balkanization as the party of tribalism\n\nAnd so when you and I when we try to discuss the constitution of the declaration these are very quaint ideas to the Democrats but they really have nothing to do with anything\n\nThere objective is always how to get power and how to keep it had to advance the cause whether they win elections or lose elections why do you think we have this massive administrative state the early progressive to tell you why because elections come and go Franklin Roosevelt tells you why\nThat we will only have temporary control over the instruments how these of government but we need to make permanent our policies\nAnd so they have bastard eyes the federal judiciary they've created a fourth branch of government in this massive administrator state so even when they lose elections from their perspective they're supposed to win when they win elections they tell you they have a mandate\nSo they never lose\nWhat Obama said when they lost the when he lost the mid term during his presidency\nThat all those people didn't vote he represents them and the ones who voted Democrat so in his mind he had a perverse idea that he represented the vast majority of the American people including those who didn't vote and the Democrats did vote\n\nLook yesterday and now today the New York times a massive story Fifteen thousand words that's like three chapters in a typical book\nOn Fred Trump's taxes and tax returns going back to the early to thousands\nWhat did they get that information\nWhere did they get that information is is a civil liberties union we are forced to file federal income taxes we were forced to file death taxes we have no choice we have to give it to the IRS and state authorities\n\nThe New York times said it had a one hundred thousand pages\n\nThey went through to be more accurate went through one hundred thousand pages that boxes and boxes of material if it were you know hard copy as opposed\nTo a a electronically provided well they got it from the government obviously\nThe question is which part of the government the U.S attorney's office the attorney general's office in New York\nBob Mueller's office\nThe Internal Revenue what did they get this information from does anybody care notice anybody even raise it now\nAnd half of the article\nIs an attack on Trump effectively as a failed businessman that for his father he could never have achieved great wealth you've never seen that peace like that written about the Kennedys ever and you never will\n\nOr any of these multi billionaire families\nWith a father and grandfather created the initial wealth\n\nMost of you are familiar with New York city aren't you all those buildings with the president's name on he created those\nEven in areas where it used to be warehouses and so forth along the Hudson River he rebuilt that entire area\nThey want you to believe that Donald Trump\nIs a lousy businessman as a lousy developer and but for his father he couldn't succeed\nThere's some concern about that and they go on about how he he's a tax cheats first of all as I understood these were his father's tax returns but\nWhy is he attacks cheat has he been adjudicated attacks cheat now has he been adjudicated attack street administratively or judicial ... no\nNo he has\nNow what is the president's supposed to do now you know full well when you have these kinds of holdings you can't actually follow your own tax returns you hire professionals and you signed the tax return and you submit it\n\nAnd of course the goal is to pay as little taxes as possible\n\nI asked Bill Clinton that I seem to recall one year he deducted is used underwear remember that Mr busy\nBut there's never been a New York times investigation into the Clintons' like this the wheeling and dealing they build a damn thing is there a single building in New York or any other part of the country with the Clintons name on it now what do they do to make a hundred and fifty million dollars\nDid they pay their taxes\nHow about all these foreign speeches that they influenced the Clintons particularly when she was secretary of state or a senator\n\nIn New York Times doesn't care anymore than the New York times doesn't care that Hillary Clinton violated the Espionage Act multiple times or Bill Clinton raped Juanita Broderick and been molested so many other women now what's the me too movement\nIt's interesting isn't it it's the me too movement except when it comes to Keith Ellison and John Conyers remember Joe Scarborough defending John Conyers despite what was coming up\n\nSo there's a big article and everybody just keeps regurgitate again everybody just keeps repeating out of the New York times because the New York times is always right don't you know\nThe New York times is never wrong\nWe have ah the economy of the mayor of a New York city they went to recoup any money that Donald Trump owes the people of New York that's what he says Donald Trump created thousands and thousands of jobs in New York\nBoth directly and there's buildings in indirectly through suppliers that's not the way communist like it's not the way they think at all\nSo what's Trump supposed to do go through a Fifteen thousand word document respond if one after another after another of course not and the New York times knows he's not going to do it\n\nBut who you're going to believe the Trump family or the New York times\n\nI've talked about this many times I had before me an article that appeared this is just one of many on April Eighteen twenty Thirteen and the Daily Beast\n\nBetween Nineteen thirty nine in Nineteen forty five the New York times published more than twenty three thousand front page stories of those eleven thousand five hundred were about World War two twenty six were about the Holocaust\nTwenty six\n\nSo why did the paper of record which\nPresident Franklin Delano Roosevelt is said to have come through every morning decided to bury the bulk of the Holocaust coverage deep inside the newspaper nestled between the advertisements\nWhy did they do that\nBut why do media today rely on it why do media today rely on the New York times when it comes to the greatest active genocide in modern world history\nIn New York Times covered it up shouldn't that destroy any credibility any institution huh\nI'm
