prime minister of ah Canada\nTrudeau young Trudeau trip all the old man's block Trudeau has set in the past say we we uh welcome aliens illegal aliens I guess he calls them undocumented migrants\nFrom all parts of the world we in Canada we're loving people we're compassionate people\nWe welcome all people hear some thinking to myself I have a solution to all this stuff\nA solution for the illegal aliens who were trying to come into the country illegally a solution for the Trump Administration and the solution for the Trudeau administration here's what we do\nPresident United States picks up the phone and he calls Trudeau and he says hey we got seven the fourteen thousand people coming here legally I Know you support illegal immigration I Know your borders are wide open you've said it over and over again and you've said you're very compassionate about these things so here's what we're going to do when I get a whole bunch of greyhound buses\nAnd we're going to have as many of these caravan marchers as possible get on the buses and we're going to drive them you know the way Mexico does it lets these people go through their country and our country we can learn something from Mexico oh we can and what we'll do is we'll put them on greyhound buses\n\nAnd we'll drives them to our northern border and won't let them out because Canada wants them\nThese people want to leave they ... they come from my lab to say that I mean if you're marching a thousand miles or two thousand miles I assume there are ... even though they're carrying their flags and in the United states this president believes in law and order and enforcing the immigration laws so there you have your\nSatisfy all three the illegal aliens wind up in Canada leaving their hell halls Canada receives them because their arms are wide open for them and in the United states we enforce our border and our immigration laws I think that's a brilliant idea of us can produce\nAnd on top of that like a greyhound greyhound makes a profit to they could probably use so that's my solution\nLadies and gentlemen for the caravan ha a parade of illegal immigrants who are coming into our country\nSupported by left wing groups south of the border left wing groups within the United states funding organizations within our borders funding organizations outside our borders like in Venezuela and so forth\nBut here we can accommodate everybody\nOK well YouTube or two I don't care if we can use humor can use taxis\nGreyhound whatever\nI'm not particular about these things [noise] while Mr producer Mike call

talking to you a first time caller oh ... yeah on the war rhetoric that going on um one thing I noticed that some things to push the buttons to push this guy was that\nUm you know it's the first time where supporters of a particular candidate have been directly or ... or attacked\nAnd attacked regularly for a long term and you know and that's a thought things that people when they when they pick a side and then they're attacked by that\nAnd that that's my point is you know they're going back and forth that it's the it's the rhetoric between what Donald Trump that and and what the media and the Democrats say it it showed directed to I don't ever remember Donald Trump I'm doing something that the supporters of the Democrats the way that the Democrats\nI think I think you're giving this not way too much credit CERN two thousand two he threatened to bomb a or a public utility because he was angry with a worker\nSo I'd be very very careful about playing into the less hands that this is uh some guy who who's angry about what the left is doing and so forth and so we're all angry about what the left is doing but we don't send real are fake bombs to a bunch of people\nNo I don't support that at all it's more of the ... the you know you're you're asking why do we push the button why go there anyway why ever order that does in the right way to do things the way that we're fed up\nIt's the president who's called Hitler if the president who's called a Nazi it's his supporters us who are called\nNeo Nazis and racist it's the president who's called a racist and he's called a racist and

got in people's health care\nAnd they they don't have to face that truth with like so it's all about this right you know that that would say James Carville says look in the word I'm looking at work yeah that's exactly what's happening except now it's Republicans doing it\nThis guy this guy really is a mental image you\nLook at the brown people\nThe brown people\nWe want to enforce our laws and you see it's about the brown people\n\nJoe Scarborough the white as men on TV next to Chris Matthews it's about the brown people really when Shelby Steele was one of my uh Fox show several months ago and life liberty and then he pointed out the guys at talk this way\nThey feel like they immunize themselves from criticism that they're better than all of you\nAnd so they can position themselves you see is\nSupporting brown people but you folks out there who aren't brown you obviously have brown people because you don't agree with Joe\nThis is a sick mindset and they want to\nTalk about\nBut fuel and the fire when they constantly push this racist narrative\nConstantly\nAnd then secondarily Republicans have gutted people's health care\nObamacare's in place other than the individual mandate nobody's got it anything Medicare's in place Medicaid's been expanded Obamacare's in place all kinds of welfare programs out there what exactly has been got it\nWhat's gutted quality affordable health
