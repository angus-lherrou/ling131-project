{"month": "10", "state": "TN", "station": "WJCW", "content": "A roller coaster that actually caught fire and I wrote a zillion times as a kid but anyway there's another New Jersey senator that so what was that was that Spartacus oh no no that's the senator Booker right or broker\nAnd and he said this week and I and and look this guy you know he's he's serious about running for president and he's talking about scary just common Iran is just what it doesn't matter anymore it doesn't matter anymore if he's guilty or not if he's darn it\nI mean look at all these accusations you don't look at all this talk in the chat or look at all of this sort of commotion that we that we created I mean if he's guilty or not what difference does it make it this time you know it wasn't about\nThe truth the truth no matter no longer matter it was about the spectacle it was the spectacle that Matt so you're going to crucify somebody who has worked so hard and their career a beautiful family with your family there in truth doesn't matter\nIt's because of this cycle that we've created so therefore which trash this guy let's throw into the waistband and let's move on with somebody else\nSo this is the country that they perceive\nWell I totally agree with that and and I think that probably the scariest thing that has come out of the whole cabinet scenario that we've been watching for the last few weeks\nIs the fact that the Democrats could say look you know the presumption of innocence no longer exists will it we don't have to have that with Kavanaugh because after all this isn't really a jury trial this is more of a well it's an allegation you know check ups scenario in the Senate\nAnd therefore well he look guilty or the allegations look bad or there are many alligator order or he fought back\nOr or yeah when it when they when they can't win and the only thing they say they'll have the temperament to be in the Supreme Court and and he drank a lot of beer in college yeah many fewer why you're white\nYeah but that temperament because he had the nerve to fight back against all of these accusations and therefore he doesn't have the temperament to be on the court\nSo therefore he's guilty therefore he he should be resigning after all joy bay or that oh I Know he's guilty they all said that I Know he's guilty he's guilty 'cause he's a guy and him and and the meat you thing to say well you've got to believe anybody any female who says what happened to the guy you got to believe the female does\nIt presented is that what you're in Hawaii a was a whole oh yeah yeah yeah yeah all the men should just shut up shut up shut up shut up because they just shut up 'cause you're a man right we know better you know a real good advice and what made\nMonty Python so successful you know scenarios like that's what make them successful you know and\nAnd that come from ... why do you find that that sounds like it could come from\nLike the whole thing it come from Monty Python but there's hang are there any women here at the stoning any women here no no no no no no no they don't cut because they're wearing fake beard is do we know women but but but you know you know when it comes down to it comes down to\nAnd this is what you know a Spartacus or you know for the gift advocates are known as Booker in in in the Senate\nReally comes down to the fact that it's the image that's created by the media which obviously they controlled really define what you think of somebody and you know that that goes back to the movie the matrix\nThe matrix is worried that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the troops\nAnd the point of the matter is in the matrix the truth is relevant the truth is what it needs to be the truth is malleable the truth is the agenda and if you don't fit into the genuine the matrix you disappear the guys come with the glasses and if you're gone you're that what do you think it is right now Neal\nWell I I don't know I I I really really don't know all I Want is that this whole chapter this chapter in our country\nWe kind of we just went behind you know and let the American people a way you know there's not going to do this very soon and we don't know what they're going to do what I Believe they're going to get it right and and they're going to send a message they're going to send a message that this behavior\nIs totally unacceptable and that's what I Believe but hey look you know stay tuned I'm sure you're not going to be talking a lot about that we're gonna have a lot of fascinating guests on our show to continue to think about these very important issues and what it means to our economy or jobs in our prosperity or string\nTheir pursuit of happiness rich on that note we're out of time unfortunately unfortunately

renegotiating free trade agreements acorn component\nOf his campaign now president Donald Trump has delivered a new free trade agreement with Mexico and Canada here to take a look at details of the new NAFTA is very nuke the ruby burn it\nIs a senior research fellow at the Mercator center at George Mason university\nVeronique welcome back to American radio journal burned they know that\nThe Trump Administration has arrived at an agreement with both Mexico and Canada on what is essentially a new North American free trade agreement tell us a little bit about what you see as the strengths and weaknesses of the new agreement\nThe biggest strength is that we have a deal\nI mean there was so much chaos and uncertainty surrounding NAFTA that how big a deal is a really good thing it's also a good thing that the deal is honestly just cosmetic for the most part it's not as\nBad as it could have banned it does that make as about changes as it could have banned the positive changes that are made honestly they were already included most of them and the TPP deal\nAnd the one for liberalization feature that at Canada agreed slightly to agree to to open slightly it's dairy market by zero point three percent ... very much but at the change I mean it is important to note that\nWhat that most exports\nFrom the U.S to Canada and Mexico we're we're already facing\nThe hero tariffs dry and there was this exception was dairy and Canada or the bad side though is like the auto segment of the deal is pretty bad at basically increases the cost of producing cars in particular because\nThey now have to force more from\nCanada Mexico and the U.S forty percent of the car and have to be made with workers who\nAre paid sixteen percent and our said these are all provisions that increases the cost of doing business for an Oscar maker and this is also the purpose of paying no duty between when you explored cars the tree in the U.S and Canada and Mexico\nPresident Trump of course Veronique had placed the number of terrorists on various Canadian goods did the imposition of those tariffs\nHave the desired impact of bringing the Canadians to the table and make concessions did that actually play a strong role\nIt didn't because TPP already got these concessions from the Canadian dairy remember for the most part there were no tariffs between Canada\nAnd the U.S and they're still keeps a lot of the protectionism that had that was still an aftershock and so it just the president created this chaos by withdrawing from the BP\nWhich had a lot of these features event imposing metals Harris and that's hurting was oh tariffs\nThen getting concessions that we would have gotten the TPP and by the way that metal terrorists are still so we're still worse off\nThan before it all started\nYour reference TPP a couple of times in your answers ... listeners who may not be familiar with the term what is TPP\nTPP was a a multilateral trade agreement between\nA bunch of nation not not Europe and also a lot of Asian country and the purpose was to create more free trade and and the purpose of multilateral trade agreement is basically everyone gets a little and the Canadian had agreed to reduce their their ... they may have actually kind of\nGive up a little bit more than and TPP but but also the second\nBiggest biggest biggest goal of all of this is to actually put China back against the wall by creating this very attractive free trade zone between other Asian countries and countries and and the U.S and Canada\nAnd and also to uh exclude China and the only way China could have actually joined was to agree to concession on I. P. protection and on a state owned enterprises a lot of the things that we claim I Want to see from China\nOr the president was true from TPP and at that threatened to withdraw from NAFTA and so here we are today\nSo we have this new NAFTA new trade agreement and there was a perception at least that the old NAFTA\nWas unfair to the United states of course the president made this a big part of his campaign and twenty sixteen\nSo bottom line here Veronique is this an improvement on the old NAFTA\nThey're small improvements for sure I mean this is the idea that was over twenty year old\nSo it it happened before the rise of e commerce and things like this it needed modernization some of a deal\nSome of the still ... says and that's a good thing I mean there are some as I said the uh the slight opening up the dairy market for Canada is a good faith also it what it does is that it increases the threshold for selling stuff through the Internet for individuals for it to be a duty free it used to be very very low\nAnd so that's that's a good thing but the\nBalance like that the negative side as as probably worse than the good things are getting better get a base find was not the old NAFTA pre President Trump our new base side that we have to look at\nNow realistically as we were in a world where there was a potential uh west a fool was drawn from NAFTA there was a potential of the difficulty to find a resolution that was extreme chaos and uncertainty and that uncertainty uncertainty has been lifted so yeah we can lament\nThe fact that this deal is making things a little worse but at the end their reality whether they go shovel this administration was going to rock the boat for better or worse and now we can hope for\nBased on more peaceful environment\nWhile at the very least another items checked off of the to do list we have been talking with ... who is a senior research fellow with the Mercator center that at George Mason university and burning tell us a little bit about the ... center also where folks can go to read your writings on this and other subjects\nThat work at a Center for mark at a Research Center based at George Mason university and non partisan and redo economic stuff not restarted where regulation up a long time ago and we are at ... or you can read on my stop there but I I doubt creators\nColon I'm syndicated creators I I'd like at the corner\nAnd I also write a con for a reason magazine and sometimes I write for the New York times\n... there were the other Mercator center Veronique thanks as always for being here thank you for having me\nAt the offices of the club for growth in Washington DC Andrew Roth is keeping an eye on US Senate races and key congressional races all across the country and we're going to take an update one month before election as to where things stand\nAndy good to have you here thanks for having me lemon\nLet's talk first about the U.S Senate it's been it's been an interesting couple of weeks for\nThe Senate Republicans have a little bit of an advantage by virtue of the map you might want to just give us a bit of an overview on that and then we can talk about how things are going in the individual states\nYou're right the Republicans do have an advantage right off the bat thoroughly defending eight seats or nine seats rather and the Democrats are defending twenty six so just right off the bat there they're in good shape plus at least ten Democrat ... seats that are up for reelection\nTrump won and some of them Trump won big time like West Virginia\nAnd North Dakota so the Republicans are definitely in the driver's seat now there's a lot of money involved and there's a lot of spending involved and there's a lot of good candidates that were recruited involved\nSo it is making the situation a little bit more difficult for Republicans they have a fifty one forty nine advantage in the Senate which is very slim the best guess right now is that perhaps they'll pick up one or two seats\nBut I could easily see them picking up more than that or having the the election be a complete wash where nobody wins or loses net seats and I could even see a Democrats picking up a net one or two seats so it's getting hairy\nSo a month out nothing is settled and the situation's going to remain volatile right up until election day let's talk first of all Andy in terms of all these democratic seats that are up\nAnd change the entire complex of this race jokes ... Boyer thirty fifth year today clip\nAnd Alex we're in good shape we're moving on but now they were in the bottom for let's check off the play offs and things after race for chase selling it obviously with the wind is going to move forward regardless of what happens the next two weeks in a row or Kevin Harvey cup there Kyle Busch\nMartin ...

S C I F Eighteen year veteran that\nUm you know the actors are all working hard all the time to to make what he says it is opinion is important and we understand that the name of the shows that the ins and we it's not that we're doing a documentary but we we do try to do things honestly well and try to keep the agency in mind or do\nYou and the other I I think cool thing about in CIA as in the season premiere was this week a what a consistently great show in terms of not just the quality of the performances and the story lines but also kind of the above board way that you guys are approach that is that something you think about\n[noise] uh you know I I've always thought that this show has a creative foot you know uh when you read the script or at least I read the script of this show I was surprised by some things because I read it as a procedural but\nI was interested in the characters and ... and it had humor\nAnd that was something that impressed me from the start that part of it and uh\nYou know it's we've had a lot of changes there's been a lot of different things going on over the years but we're still doing really well and the idea that maybe some of these changes have been some of the reasons that were still there and and and the changes helped us and I think that's where the show as always Ron\nYou're talking to mark climate here in the national defense\nAnd you don't talk about some of those changes I'm watching the the season premier this new season and it is kind of struck me because in in uh the final a kind of episode\nOr are in the final a few minutes there's a lot of technical situations in IT situations and I'm thinking back to maybe when you started that show\nWhy those kinds of things in even exist\n[laughter] yeah right yeah and my character that kind of in the dark ages about that anyway but I'm a which is probably not too far from me\n[laughter] but but I think that's what makes a ... well\nIt and I I I was always interested in plan I never wanted to play the guy with a red out on his chest and and uh I I as an actor I'm always more interested applause and a character and the things that make more real and more\nUh or believable more approachable that maybe some others you know and the group of writers has\nDone such a great job over the years of of filling\nThey care so much about what they do it you know in in the first say four or five years of the show we went through a light or a lot of writers on this show is very tough place for writer to work\nAnd then in the last ten years this show has\nPretty much kept the same staff and and they're all very different they all get along and they all like each other early lunch together you know they they know each other um so I I always put my faith and that I'm not someone
