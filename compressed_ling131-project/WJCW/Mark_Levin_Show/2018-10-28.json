W yeah exactly I have a runway light is like a football player which I'm not obviously\nThrough the airport to make my flight that fortunately you know you're gonna have to knock some people back because this is a wall you do I almost fell down the escalator I Love to see that I mean I Love to see so many people are traveling I don't know whether you're going to be on the rich can manage things are happening out there it's good\nPositive stuff I think a lot to say something about the Federal Reserve yeah I have a question I find it amazing\nThat you know we can criticize a senator or congressman the president that's for sure going any channel right now on NBC ABC CBS the union and so forth they criticized the president and the Supreme Court and the Supreme\nCourt you can do all of that but for some reason they deal by the Federal Reserve why is that why can't we you know say wait a minute I didn't know why you're going to have five or six different raises basis point going up this year because you're saying you're going to do it why where's the inflation\nSo don't you think we have the right don't you think the president has the right to make a statement just because previous presidents never said anything maybe they were part of the global environment but don't you think you have the right to say something because he represents the American people I'm concerned with that\nWell you know what I mean here's the conundrum right is that under the economy you know the anemic economy of Obama\nThat you know if the fed didn't come in there and\nLower interest rates I mean there was gloom and doom I mean you know the whole private economy you know was\nWas really really feeling insecure and they were feeling the bottom was only hurting the bottom was willing I there's no question about it so the Federal Reserve kept lowering interest rates to at least put some life into the economy you know put some good news out there with some good news out there\nAnd so of course you know President Obama sitting there you know I Can't get this thing figure it out I don't know what the heck is going on so you know the fed the Federal Reserve came and helped\nThem out these oh we're going to worry about what led you astray yellow or orange outer edge in it if he had zero rate I mean this is amazing what did the right today with zero you're gonna get any lower no no no moron and can't get lessons zero just want to tell you there but and you know in in Japan are actually negative negative interest rates are okay so it's at the point is\nImagine if you had that at the same time he freed up the regulation lower the taxes the economy would have just skyrocketed and analyze\nHe's getting penalize by the Federal Reserve or his success\nAnd now the Federal Reserve says hey you know we're we're in a good place\nTo get the interest rates back up a bit you know makes them real hard to make ... you know this sort of marketplace that it had to be a full market under Obama because there was no other way I mean there was no other way\nTo put some optimism into the marketplace at least people say well you know I don't really feel good about the future and all of this regulation and we don't like the country's going and we talked about that a lot poll after poll you know people not like in the direction the country the people having no confidence in the economic leadership of the country but at least\nInterest rates are low you know at least interest rates are low\nYou know so people are still out there trying to put something together because it was cheap money not because he believed in the direction of the government but just because it was cheap money historically cheap money was a great opportunity of evil so now you got you know all of his economic activity and I say it was you know put interest rates you know back but but still truth be told\nThat interest rates are still you know if you take a look at you know thirty forty year period they're still at a historic low will mortgage or to what about ... percent right on workers and hey look you know not bad I mean look minute you know over the last forty years you know four percent is is is still a great deal you remember Jimmy Carter here oh yeah the misery index Nineteen twenty Twenty one percent\nRight rates for mortgages right I mean not available are going under it wasn't pretty so they couldn't for cleaning anything you know I guess you know ... and\nYou know one thing I guess your your hedging the future a little bit because of the increase interest rates at least you have the ability to start reducing good\nFriends with our you know this is what goes up getting them down and\nThey they they blend the bank dry trying to support the economy which you know we're supporting the president's political agenda but rich\nI Know you're going to die out I mean hey I Can't believe just went so fast it was a very good show yeah very passion I learned a lot today I had

people all the laws and our ...\nAnd saluted right you know what I mean I think everyone agrees and sometimes it takes something like this the proposed airspace marking on its development which is really larger than any single obviously any single county would be involved with in northeast Tennessee something like this a larger if you will\nTo pull all of the various counties together I think it was Ronald Reagan who famously said to Mr Gorbachev\nYou said you know the one thing that might bring us together speaking to Gorbachev about the two countries at the time was if we were invaded by aliens the implication being that it was something larger than all\nThe other things that seemed to pale in comparison when she looked at the larger thing there and I think in a very positive economic development way that's been the case where there is a smart to let's see if you will not allow the Joe Grande Washington County mayor\nHe's on on route right now to Chattanooga for official business\nJoe if you will kind of expand if you will do a little bit on your view of economic development the status of it in Washington County that right now irrespective of the airspace part but generally speaking are are we getting theaters are people curious about Washington County\nThey are and um\nYou know as as you recall the last\n... years I'm\nCourt order of watching the one together

week's American radio journal commentary [noise]\nI'm woman Henry and welcome to American radio journal\nThe White House office of management and budget has announced the Trump administration's efforts at regulatory relief have resulted in twenty three billion dollars in cost savings\nHere to talk about the lessening regulatory burden on business is Ken Cuccinelli Ken is a former Virginia attorney general who now serves as director of the regulatory action center at the freedomworks foundation Ken welcome back to American radio journal\nCan we know that the Trump Administration has made regulatory relief a top priority can you give us an update on the progress that the administration is making in this area\nThey just put out a semi annual report\nAnd a lot of these things have been very boring in the past and frankly very burdensome but they're very proud of their work and they have every right to be the most recent period of time they've they've saved annual savings of over a billion dollars\nWith a lifetime savings of twenty three billion dollars and\nWhen you compare that to the same period for the Obama administration during the same period they imposed two hundred and thirty five billion dollars worth of regulatory costs and\nThat produces nowhere else it makes no one richer it makes our economy poor by that amount of money because these are just transaction cost that businesses have to bear gesture exist so to reduce them as the Trump Administration has done and has made clear it's going to continue to do has really helped boost economic\nGrowth and opportunity for every American\nWhen you talk can about regulatory costs on business most Americans of course don't run a business although everybody has dependent upon them for income so tell her a little bit in a little bit more depth what you mean by the term regulatory costs to the business what burden does this place on businesses and how does that affect the ordinary worker\nSo she's a simple example when I left the attorney general's office of Virginia I've been doing a number of things since then but one of them you might not expect with three other people that I Know we started an oyster business in the Chesapeake Bay\nNow and it's still going four years later it's going well ... Illinois her company in the ... in the middle of a\nWell as you know seafood has certain safety risks with it and we have to when we pull the oysters out of the bay we have to do it before ten am during the summer so there's not much sun and heat we have to have them on ice and in certain temperature ranges\nAnd their reasons for that those are health and safety regulations somebody like me very minimal estate person when it comes to government regulation thinks those makes sense that we had to take classes and learn them and so forth but if your business like\nA barber say you wanted to start a hair cut I'll call it a salon you have to go get a cosmetology license from your state\nAnd typically you have to take hundreds of hours of classes and this is just to cut hair let's set aside using chemicals and coloring hair and things like that just to cut hair\nWell why on earth should you have to do any of that and what does it do what it does is it doesn't allow poor people to just boom start up their hair cut business and I'll tell you what if I go to your hair cut business and you know cut my hair well guess what I'm not coming back\nThe market will take care of it\nWhen there aren't a health and safety burdens at issue government shouldn't be regulated it shouldn't be regulating and the federal government regulates building codes and other things that should be left the states and local governments the closer the government is does the more response of it is to us\nAnd that that's a principle the founders talked about this isn't new and the Trump Administration is peeling away layers of federal regulation that give us more opportunities to start out small businesses\nOne of the things we saw in the Obama administration is a nosedive in entrepreneurial spirit that people America has distinguished itself in our history by our do it yourself\nThe two up by your bootstraps willingness to take risks and part of that is starting businesses well\nThe effort to start new businesses came to not a screeching halt under the Obama administration but it dropped to record lows and that has all turned around\nA a very common response of the business person five years ago to the burdens that government was placing on them was if I had to start my business today I wouldn't do it or I couldn't do it with that attitude is changing and you see it reflected in the optimism of small business owners\nAnd their organizations that measure that optimism it's the highest it's been in decades\nAnd a lot of that is not because of the just the tax bill which is what a lot of people focus on is lower taxes\nIt's because the government is making an effort on affirmative effort to get out of the way to expand freedom and opportunity\nIn the form of getting rid of unnecessary regulations that has real big affects all across our economy even if you don't own that business that business can now higher one more person\nIt can invest in R and D It can buy a new machine or expand to a new plant it can do all those things because it's not spending that money just to comply with regulatory oversight\nInteresting those surveys that you just referenced can often show that\nRegulation is a bigger problem a bigger roadblock for many businesses then even taxes are yeah as a matter of fact some of the recent surveys with the economy doing so well showing finding qualified workers has risen to the top of the list as a problem followed by regulatory relief\nAnd taxes now in third place so when we look at this regulatory relieved that is occurring and now regulatory relief is not the number one problem because of it can you drill down a little bit and tell us one specific areas has the Trump Administration been successful in terms of cutting regulations and where might we see them go in the future\nIn the last year you've seen a primary driver is health and Human Services and you'll see that over the course of the next year as well\nWhere because of the massive cost of health care as the federal government has stripped away regulations blocking what businesses can do and creating more options\nMany of those options costs less money\nAnd so give them those businesses the opportunity to get health care at a lower cost and to do those kinds of things and those have been major major cost drivers I'm using very rough numbers here but ha chest has been responsible for about half of the regulatory savings and most of that is in the health care area\nTo know that kind of thing you see him who and blood line again and I know\nI don't know if not say hey we are here that\nWe will\n... play Ariana Grande okay\n[noise]\nWith Amazon Music of voices all you need to get tens of millions of salt download the Amazon usually
