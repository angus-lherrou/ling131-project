knew nothing about it\nThe individual who is this is science so he obviously was a tremendous mistake made the mistake was to try to cover up\nIf you have good sex that actually stimulates desire it's kind of the reverse of what we usually think desire yet desire and then you have sex\nIn actuality it runs in the reverse especially for parents who have good sex and and then if you do that a couple of times maybe you'll start to have some desire but desires optional do or if you don't have it\n[laughter] okay so you mean you could not like your partner at a certain time itself sex with them I Know that's not what you mean\nBy oh totally it's totally absolutely absolutely because\nOf who likes their partner all the time you know these are the nightmare years is a very stressful [laughter] you know people people of the really really are at odds\nYou know they don't listen to each other and they feel that it's it's a simpler if I wasn't married to this person you know everybody feels that\nRight so how do you push past that and still have the sex because I find it very challenging for both men and women to get themselves at that point\nI Would technique is that I kind of dubbed the two step\nAnd you know it's it's not a dance uh it's it's a sex technique and it's an alternative to the date night because you know what you're supposed to do according to most sources is you're supposed to just put something on the couch or get a babysitter and go to bed and have sex or actually that doesn't work because it's like make a reservation at a restaurant and you get the time we reservation hungry\nSo what are your new so instead you make an appointment on your calendar could go to bed and do absolutely nothing at all\nNow for most new parents that are very welcome thing it's just going to hang out and if you're lucky enough not to live in Manhattan you could actually see the sky from your window [laughter] nice\nAnd you can look at that and you can just ... experience your breath which most of us don't\nExperience very much unless we're like mindfulness fans is kind of a version of mindfulness and you experience the weight of your body in the bed and the temperature of your toes and all those things and just kind of experience you know you go from thinking to just awareness\nThat state of awareness of the world the good stuff happens so if you're in that state of awareness then maybe a chat a little bit but nothing heavy don't get any arguments or anything just\nA blah blah blah blah blah blah blah\nJoy that and then after time or perhaps one of you will notice something radically interesting about the other's body wants to pursue that just you know just in a relaxed and kind of leisurely wages for its own sake than that's just a appetizers and then sooner or later you're in the restaurant\nI Love it that is I think ... stupid too much pressure on themselves and most men will say I cannot schedule sex they don't want to schedule ... maybe ... or just ... they said it I I Can't do it\nExactly and so uh the other the other issue for a man's point of view I represent this 'cause I Am and I were were my wife and I are actually empty nesters which is wonderful what\nHave you with a guy who really having kids\nCan't wait to have kids and you can't wait to get rid of them um and uh the most wonderful thing for a man being an empty nester is the first time an Eighteen years you actually get your wife's complete attention because most women after they have a child if that's where they're all her attention is let's roll their libido is really right\nOh I'm so it's just really nice to the main thing though that a couple of can do if they want\nTo keep that connection um and they don't have a lot of time is they shouldn't wait to when they're having sex to get excited to get they get excited together even when they're not having sex unless you get excited together even with their clothes are on when they're in the kitchen\nSo instead of kissing each other goodbye in the morning you want to what we call insects there'll be field simmer each other goodbye just a minute you know just like to teenagers or with a a break between class we had three minutes you know just going to hold each other and\nInhale each other's sense and kind of remind yourself why you're with this person in the first place because you kind of like the way they smell and just kind of just like groove on that again for its own sake and hold them a little tighter brief together maybe stare into each other's eyes\nTo the breath and then go all goes well you experienced a little bit of arousal you lost a couple of IQ points as quite as to hear it when you leave and that's good if I could do that every day there's no reason you can't do that everyday when you're kissing each other good and I will kiss each other you know similar each other good night\nAnd I love it now what if you have somebody who is just not on board with that that they're just not a goodbye parts and I know somebody that they say I just not me I don't kiss goodnight at UNC say goodbye I just leave right here's\nThe thing here's the thing is is really really important passion is selfish she'd say to this person I understand I just want to enjoy your body for a minute just selfishly for my own pleasure mhm\nThey don't have to do anything you may if you're a woman take the person's hand and just\nHold it or kiss it or fight it or whatever you want to do with it and if you're a man you may want to put your arm around her waist and hold it and\nPerhaps run your hands through her hair if she has already done her hair um and uh just selfishly for your own pleasure and most people really like to be enjoyed\nThey'd like to be enjoyed without having to do anything\nSo you ... you can do that that's what I Would recommend say OK doesn't have to be mutual I just would enjoy you you can do it every night\nAnd and that's a good advice because then maybe they will pick up on that and say oh you're not necessarily night and like you had all of a sudden you're in the restaurant later exactly\nExactly you know a couple of sitting together watching TV and the wife says to the husband how come you never grabbed me anymore or something like that now that's not such a\nTurn on um however if instead of the wife says you know what is it okay if I just kind of enjoy your body from my own pleasure\n[laughter] that's what they know sorry I didn't exactly\nWhat I have to do nothing at all just don't do anything I just want to just enjoy your toes for my own\nLittle hold of some you know and uh you know people like that people like that that people forget to do that ... enjoy each other they're just like I said at the beginning that just so busy that uh they forget to enjoy each other\nRight I agree a hundred percent great advice right and well I'm\nGlad I'm Glad that ah that that we're in agreement there yeah these are Israeli or the nightmare years ah you know when you need and picked up all the time and they're always\nHaving you know cold and you're up all night and stuff is this is not so erotic and so you just need to cultivate those little things a little one minute things where you can just remind yourself that yes you are sexual being\nRight and they're great reminders and I think all parents need to be
