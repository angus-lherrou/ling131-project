in doing this we found out that that there's different facilities and different things available on different um places like in Sydney apparently they have these great mama rooms or family rooms and all the malls and\nRestaurants with like couches microwaves and um where you could just like hanging out with your little one and breast feed and um you know and they even have play areas if there was another sibling around and stuff like that\nUm so so we've really put a lot of work into that um we also have airport maps that are included but tell you where the playground is in an airport why at\nThe bar and have a really long layover\nExactly um and then what other oh and then we have trouble um travel medicine and health advice so what's the equivalent of baby Tylenol in France\nOr what kind of what brand of diapers can I find in the u._k. ah things like that so it's really\nAll of the questions that all our community members have when they're traveling we've kinda collected them at an earnest them and put them all into a handy travel guide so so you don't have to go through all the Foreign Relations and it and kind of sift through all the information yourself we've collected at all for you and put it together in a handy travel guide so\nThat's amazing because what you just listed off really is everything we need to know as a new parents traveling and I know\nMyself now I feel like I'm a pro at those but at the beginning I was nervous wreck and just all the things that you need you don't need what it's like you said what to look for when you're there are so you don't have to bring all your diapers but you know what brand to go by once you are in the destination\nAnd you also have a baby boy I trails geo had image rich trails in cities around the world to me about those\nExactly so that's actually your this is like a sneak peak or audience members are getting the first ... with with us because they're actually coming out and about two weeks on end there exactly what you said there ... trails and the idea is that they're basically tours\nThat you can do in a day so it's like\nYou're going to Paris for the first time and you have a baby\nHow do you how do you see the Eiffel Tower and ... and ... and uh the ... is it possible to do all those in the day is there like a good restaurant along the way what stroller accessible it's not what do I do if it's raining like is there a museum somewhere along that pat\nAnd so is their playground also\nOh it was like I\nNeed to just to stretch out or whatever um and so that we made these trails 'em and they're all made by people who either living those cities or the travel there very often with small kids\nAnd it's things that you can realistically do at a day that's going to be fun for the little one that's going to be fun for the parents you know there's always like the the foodie stop also where that would be no there is a good ... what's the closest\nA good restaurant near the playground a so that when I went to the kid has had had their playground opportunity than mom and dad could go and have a glass of wine and a good meal um and have their time to\nWrite a ... that sounds excellent and you hit on a key point what show are friendly what's not because there's nothing worse than getting to a destination and realizing no strollers allowed and then you're stuck with this massive stroller and either you can't visit where you were going to visit or you have to find a place to park it\nTotally or what's happened to me and struck home for example is that they they have everything is like super thriller festival except in some places have stroller parking\nAnd it never occurred to me to bring a lock and so everybody else has their strollers like that but I'm like oh no I just leaving by stroller here a lot of so so things like that we've got covered for you and um and we've done all the research and will hopefully make it a lot easier for\nYou and the other families to travel with their little ones\nYeah now that's interesting that you said a stroller law because whenever I leave my stroller among tons of other shoulder as we were just in Disney I thought what is to prevent anybody from just coming up and walking off with our stroller you hope that people don't\nBut that's really really believe is that something that they just doing sock home that they have actual where you can lock it up to something\nLike I've seen it in soccer and trying to think and I say there are other places but basically it's just like a bike lock you know people just my bike locks and then and unwrap it around a poll or a ... like I I\nYeah at the wherever sting the biggest the kind of a stroller parking area is at the union back in which is the ... children's museum that way to be long stocking and like all those I'm Swedish kids' books that they had this museum there\nOf course there's lots of kids and and they just have this like covered stroller parking area\nUh and they just have post like the same way you have like post where your bike there's just all these posts to our and people like their strollers to them uh and\nYeah so yeah ... picking up a bike lock an extra bike lock when you're traveling so that you can like her stroller someplace is actually not a bad idea\nYeah that is great to have do you have we have about two minutes left what are their tips do you think moms need to know when traveling with little ones\nWell another thing that we have our packing list and I don't know about you but no matter how much I've traveled to get someplace and I'm like
