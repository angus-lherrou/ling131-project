vote early and the more people who do that the better now tell us\nHow your race looks in your district\nWell uh you know it mirrors in many ways Sen Cruz is raise a and it is a a you know tight and

Medicare for all and he wants to take away resources from the border patrol and give him the other country and I can go down a long list but he is trying to run as a centrist then he's not\nBut I think the people of Texas are seeing through it just like they're seeing through Mr O'Rourke a efforts to a claim centrism and if that set for them that were in San Francisco and not the center of Texas\nAnd a lot of these leftists in\nTexas and Florida and these other states are really trying to disguise in camouflage their true hardcore left wing agenda aren't they\nOh I mean I Can't even begin to describe to you how much ah we're seeing that both with congressmen award as well as my opponent and others are the Democrats very purposely went out and recruited leftists\nWho could run because they may have worn a uniform or otherwise good a wrong with the veil of centrism or moderation because they know liberalism doesn't sell in Texas and I'll tell you something market I think you'll you'll appreciate as well your listeners you know and I mentioned this to my opponent he never as a response\nWhy would my opponent or why we're better or not want to run in Texas for governor or state rep or senator to do all of these social as things were at least it's constitutionally reasonable to have the debate but they know that stuff doesn't sell in Texas so the only way to win the

I'm almost because\nI was ... a chassis guy I Love those springs and shocks controlling my own destiny of making that car behaving and all\nThe way I wanted it to in the short track their ... they'll reminded me of a lot of the short tracks Iran when I was coming up through the ranks one of his me Donnie Allison a Bobby and some of those tracks Allen quickie all those type of guys mark Martin we learned a little short tracks\nAnd some Martin's they'll kind of my style and I knew what I Want to my car to do at that particular race track so I just stayed working and working and so when you get your car handling good then you can control the breaks you know burned the breaks up and you can put the car where you want it on a racetrack you don't have to take take all these daredevil moves that might get yourself in trouble or might get yourself wrecked\nSo a really good handle and car solved a lot of problems it just didn't make you over driving over think everything right\nWell one of the things that I hear you talk about\nIn your progress accused of the race is keeping your nose clean on that road now Martinsville it's obviously a small racetrack that didn't wrote speed is thirty five miles an hour what's it like whoa into thing down and getting on that road and maintaining thirty five miles an hour because from where we observe it looks like you could get out walk faster than that cars going\nI Know what you're saying that you're exactly right well I'll tell you one of the key things that I did and I don't see many people doing it is I always pit in the front strayed away spot eleven I think is the one that's called it's a last opening in the frustrated with before you're going to turn on the ... area\nI don't like being that term you can't see what's around there as you pull up people can run over ya\nBut when I was in that front straight away I Won so many races I think I Want seven racist by putting almost the same exact spot why did I get that spot because I qualified real well there and why Everytime I qualified well I got a good choice of pitch selection\nI always wanted to be in the straight away side blanche in near as I was pulling out didn't get hit are getting run over anybody I'm totally against being in the corners of last year number one all the way down their unit poll sitter\nIf I was number two I'd want to be on the spot number eleven without opening in front of me a rock and rock and in a rocket ride out\nHow hard is it to keep your cool Martinsville 'cause I Know there's always at one point in the race or someone gets a beating on ya banging on you you get into a pack of cars that want to run you over you're trying to keep the vendors on the thing and then a man can only get run into so many times before all of a sudden the temper starting to go up how hard is it to keep the peppers and checking Martin's mother\nBeaten and banging is kind of expected this thing that drove me crazy was a slower car that just kept block and your dad was in front of you and you you know you're a faster you don't want to run into beat on him\nBut you want him to give you some respect and maybe as you cannot have backed redwood dart outlet you get the inside lane than if he'll just kind of closed in right behind you\nWhen you get guys won't do that that just block it that's when you get mad that's when you start your temperature starts by then you give them the barber a little bit going at the corner or give them a little tap in the middle of ... catch was hey man I'm here I've been putting up with this long enough to give me a little respect\nBut when they walk into respect that's what got me hot it wasn't going in the corner get little nudge here a little bump in a bank because we know that the it's close quarters we know that's going to happen\nI wanted to know respecting kicks and that's when you get a I have a problem\nWhen you look at the drivers that are going to be racing in Martin's build this weekend you've got guys like Kevin Harvey\nBush all of the cup drivers that are very talented that are seem to always find a way to the front of the drivers we have in that cup garage right now who has the temperament and who's got the skill to be a top Martinsville this weekend\nI I'm not saying this is my little car but I look at Keselowski every time he goes there he he just flat flies around that racetrack he his upbringing is on the short tracks he knows how to get around there he's good at that track I'm I'm going to say Brad Keselowski and then\nYou know then I'm going to step out of my comfort zone a little bit and go with some guys that are you know really respect the sport currently in are doing really really well\nAnd that kind of grew up in a short tracks also and I'm going to say Eric I'm a roll of this guy he's got a good car a really good car he's had he's got a recent victory he's got all of them are tapping his step\nAnd I think a guy like that can be one I could I could mention\nThat's rusty Wallace she'll be in the ... booth this weekend and Martin's bill for the first date of five hundred and eight rusty Wallace is the Martinsville master that our next guest is the Martinsville maestro track president clay Campbell joins us on the hotline light welcome back to NASCAR live\nA good Mayor Mike how you doing\nI'm doing fantastic you got the old gal buttoned up and ready for us this weekend\nButtoned up ready to go where uh you know like I said before we came on air it's it's writes week we're excited we're pumped up ready to go great short track racing with a first date of five hundred this weekend\nAnd it's our last short track race of the year for those that perhaps maybe are coming to your race track that had never ever been to Martinsville before or those listening to us that now want to attend what will greet them when they pulled into the city limits of of Martin's know Virginia and the surrounding areas and what awaits them when they pull onto the property the racetrack\nI'll tell you what it it's so interesting coming to a race here because really you get a glimpse back in the past\nYou get a snapshot of the\nThe current situation and the and look into the future because we've always done things to to modernize the facility but the race track itself\nHas never changed you go back and look at Nineteen forty seven and when it was built of dirt track the the shape of it linked up and everything still the same just everything around it has grown so when people come onto the property you feel a sense of history you feel a sense of\nWhile all the great to NASCAR have competed here and you're getting ready to see one of the most\nExciting races of the year and and that's what people come to expect when they come to a race here in ... it's short track racing and like you said it's a last short track of the play offs\nOnce they leave here Sunday night three races to go so I mean the intensity has ratcheted up to you know it's off the charts and people remember last year's race how exciting that was\nFinished under the lights were starting at two thirty Sunday probably do the same thing again this year but it's just good racing fans come to expect when you come to marshal speedway\nThis weekend you've got the Texas Roadhouse two hundred and for the NASCAR camping road truck series coming up the first date of five hundred for the monster energy NASCAR some series both of those obviously in the playoffs and both of those races\nThe winners of them will be rewarded with the Martin's will speedway grandfather clock we hear about it all the time but what is the history of that clock the ball the trophies that you can give out why did you folks go to the grandfather clock as that trophy\nWell it goes back to my grandfather player old who started the place and\nThe ... the manufacturing facility that that made those clocks with just about three miles down the road from the track here so that family and my family had a connection and and my grandfather just decided hey let's\nMaybe maybe I shouldn't be a race car driver and and how did you overcome self doubt and having low point because again it seems like only now you're getting\nAll you can and you've got a team that's being able to showcase everything you have a driver [noise]\nYeah I think self doubt and it sounds very natural or anything it's just human nature right to um when you don't when things don't go your way [noise]\nYou you have two choices you can either blame everybody else or anything or you can reflect on yourself and so for me I there was plenty of times where I had self doubt like land maybe I'm not good enough maybe I'm not getting the most out of my white men maybe I'm not you know X\nY Z whatever
