home with a sixth place finish one of those playoff drivers describe your day in how valuable this points they what were you and your team\nYeah well I mean certainly started off with a\nBit of an ammonium and at the front and a possible at all I think just about all the playoff drivers in the top ten qualifying so there you know there's a chance to that um that doesn't work out pretty well for the first days but we actually had a president we'll or something going on there so we actually had a sacrifice instead of tires about halfway through that per se so I'm for us it's kind of coming back from that and we got some states points but\nUm you know takes place was good for us there and just\nHad we had that side of tires there at the end you know you're looking at the top five in there so\nUh that's good we know we're a within where we need to be but I'm certainly this is one of our better we can from all that\nTipped always wanting more has come home safe here today

overview because you grew up Mormon right\nI did see I'm fourth generation Mormon my great great uncle is Brigham Young so my grandfather's grandfather with Brigham Young brother\nOkay so I'm going to step out on a limb here and say this is the first one show that has ever had a direct descendant from Brigham Young [laughter]\nMaybe you know yeah the fifty something wives and and a lot of kids with possible there might be some just a relation with someone you talked to in the past but yeah I mean I have a pretty close relation\nBut you're litigious like things right straight down the line right so how does your great grandfather's great grandfather was Brigham Young Z little brother\nThan that my grandfather's a grandfather was Brigham Young\nFor the rent 'em so very close oh\nMuch closer jak so how far does that go back at a\nTwo ... two Eighteen forties bringing him died in the Eighteen eighties and so you know my grandfather was born in the early Nineteen hundreds Nineteen away and so pretty close\nSo suffice to say you're never got a birthday card from Brigham\nYoung [laughter] I never did\nGet alright the reason that we're talking to you is well first of all you're launching a new site and it's called Mormon wind snobs dot com\nAnd you've written a lot of stuff you've done a lot of interviews and you know you're challenging something that to me if I was in your shoes I Would find a little bit scary\nBecause you know religions religious organizations political\nOrganization they're powerful and they're also tight families in a lot of respects and when you have very strong beliefs about things like alcohol you don't just I think try it out and say you know what I've got a different idea about it than these\nHundreds of years of history but you decided to do that and I've known a number of Mormon folks in my life have Mormon friends and some of them actually do drink alcohol\nA wine especially but you've never had it right for most of your for all of your growing up\nI never did not until about three years ago my wife and I decided to try one for the first time after we had a change and beliefs and and became an active in the Mormon church for a variety of historical a history of reasons um and we had never tried alcohol uh we didn't drink coffee we didn't drink tea\nAnd so it it's been a new experience for us it's been a an amazing wonderful beautiful new world for us over the past three years\nSo here's where I Want to be really clear with my disclaimer it goes like this I never\nNever try to encourage people\nTo drink wine who don't drink wine\nBecause that's got to be a personal choice I think I can certainly explain that somebody why I like it when I get out of it why it's enjoyable to me you know oddly enough I had a letter just yesterday from a guy who does not drink wine at all but listens to the show all the time\nAnd he listens to it because he's interested in the lifestyle elements of the show\nAnd the ones just not his thing and it's not a personal choice based on religious beliefs or\nHealth reasons or anything else he just doesn't like the the flavor of it and that's okay but he likes the lifestyle that surrounds it and I think we would all agree that you know wind generally is associated with fun stuff what do you think\nYeah I mean what I Love about it is the opportunity to just meet incredibly generous loving amazing people and so when my wife and I travel now it's all centered around one\nWe go to Italy and we go to Portugal we go to France at Napa Valley a well all I we've been everywhere and we have the most amazing experience with these incredible people who are so passionate about what they do\nAnd it's inspiring it's something that we didn't even know existed I mean we have driven through wine country before as Mormons we didn't even see anything I mean when it's not in your mind's eye you don't even see the beautiful than the average it doesn't even register your consciousness and\nNow when we go and we sit in the living rooms of these winemakers in these um owners of these domains and they're telling us stories of all of the history surrounding the vineyards and how\nThey're great grandfathers and great great grandfather is for generations and generations of made wine in the past and they have for it and just how generous they are I mean it's really been a fun experience for us\nWell I'm I'm Glad you're having this adventure and and again\nThere's a I'm sure was a very difficult choice for you to make the life changes that you have made you and your family including your children again I'm not here to recommend that anybody challenge their belief systems that's a personal choice on your part and\nI'll leave that up to you because I Know very little about the relationship between various religions and wine other than to say that wine\nFigured very importantly into a lot of religious practices and does to this day as we all know so it just depends on what your belief system is and how you grew up in all these things my guess is Jeremy Young\nAnd what would we call you the great great nephew great great nephew nephew of Brigham Young unbelievable and uh he and his wife are on a very interesting journey as they kind of challenge their old believes and now our devoting much of their attention to\nA life that is a wind centric\nAnd we'll talk more about that because Jeremy comes out of the big time tech world and now he's turning a lot of that attention to whine and there are a lot of\nTwists and turns the story we'll get

continues [noise]\nYou know some people discover wine at a very early age in fact if you talk to one make and families and you know and this is one of those things I mentioned this once in a while I get letters for saying this but the wind making families they introduce their children to whine at a very early age would\nBe frowned upon by some people but I Will take no position here because I'll probably get tired and feathered it just happens that for so many people the discovery of wine and especially fine wine can sometimes come late in life\nAnd when I say late in life you know long after you were legally able to drink for others I've met people who never had a civil winning till they were in their eighties and I'm Sorry for them but that's just the way it goes Jeremy Young story along with his wife is very interesting because\nThey come from the Mormon church\nWhich is Germany I guess there are they still call it the Mormon church you they've they've changed things now right\nThey have a last weekend during general Congress the prophet of the church president Nelson I'm told everybody they can't use the Mormon anymore and if they do it's a victory for say ... so\nUh they've eliminated it from him in the Mormon Tabernacle choir so now it's called the required ... square yeah so in fact after he gave that announced when I went into my bathroom turn off the lights on Mormon three times and Satan came and gave me a bottle of ground crew burgundy so it was perfect [laughter]\nAll right this is this have to travel Jeremy [laughter]\nYou know it like I said you know it's it's not I'm not making any value judgments here because it's not my place and I'm never going to say to somebody you know you haven't consumed wind your whole life and maybe you should start because\nYou know it's you know there are people who get in trouble with alcohol I'm very fortunate that I I I Know where to stop and I appreciate the beauty of wine\nNot the ability of wine in massive consumption or in massive volume to take me to another you know stream of consciousness but you and your wife very very active in the Mormon church but then I guess it was\nThings that you are studying that you didn't feel\nReal comfortable with and they were things that you were I guess we're reading documents history books that you weren't supposed to be reading but you started doing your own discovery and the thought you know this is\nThis is not where my heart is where my heart belongs that was step one for you it wasn't like I Want to leave because I Want to drink wine\nRight yeah it was it was really historical historical issues or what kind of let us out of the church and then we ended up resigning uh because of a policy that they are created in November of two thousand Fifteen where they said if you are\nDue beauty or if you're a gay in the Mormon church you automatically considered an apostate if you get married to someone\nAnd your children even if you were married to a woman had children and then you came out as gay and divorce which happens all the time in the Mormon church you know\nChildren can no longer participate in the church can no longer be baptized ah can receive the priesthood ordinances and things like that and so my wife and I are huge algae beauty advocates a specially Mormon\nTour elder beauty because there's such a huge suicide rate for children who are gay and in the Mormon church and so we decided that we were going to have to remove our names from the records of the church and so we did that to November two thousand Fifteen\nWow that that had to just be for you guys just a stunning change in direction of your life\nCredible change I mean my very very hard on our family is um like I said before we lost to most for friends um and to move neighborhoods kids had to move schools because we are we do live in a predominantly Mormon area here in Phoenix and so it was a big change for us um\nBut ah we wouldn't change a thing we would do it all over again I Do\nYou know and I I don't hear you criticizing the church's rights to believe is they believe what I guess I'm hearing is\nThat their values were not consistent with the values that we're evolving with your young family as young leading a double entendre I guess but use the family are involving and you're sitting with your kids and\nYou have to be able to explain things to your children\nAnd as a husband and wife be some ... on some fundamental things\nAnd it sounds to me that you looked at where you were and where you had been and and came to the decision that you this is not where we feel comfortable\nYou one hundred percent yet I feel very blessed because Mali and I are on the same page and our children are on the same page and not a lot of people who leave leave the church just don't have that they there's a lot of divorce when someone doesn't believe anymore and so we we feel very fortunate that we all arrived on the same page\nWell I said this about most everything in life I mean I I certainly have if I was doing a political show and I've done political shows believe me\nI I was down in Palm Springs Coachella Valley for a few years and I did afternoon drive down there and I talked about politics and I would take it certainly was not afraid to take positions down there I just I spoke to my mind one is different because I I I don't like wind to develop into ugly conversations\nBut wind figures so much into so many people's lifestyles and you know I think this is just such an interesting subject that you know deserves to be talked about because I Would say this that having started my career as a speech in debate coach\nAt a university Pepperdine in Malibu which is largely funded by the church of Christ you know there are some very strong rules there are two we couldn't drink on cat but we were supposed to drink at all we weren't even allowed to dance we weren't even allowed to look at the opposite sex\nThat's not true um [laughter] you know but they had they had their views I respect those views there are people who you believe very strongly in certain things because of things that they read and they were I Would just simply say listen this is true of wine is well it's like you know learn all you possibly can if you're trying to make some decisions in your life\nI I often tell people you know you may find out that you're going to be perfectly happy for the rest of your life or the six dollar bottle of wine you don't need to drink a sixty dollar bottle or six hundred dollar bottle of wine because you physically may not be a person who can enjoy\nThe listeners are feeling sorry for you Jeremy [laughter] you you know speaking of Napa our station that covers the entire one country up there Napa and Sonoma located in Santa Rosa California just won the Marconi Award and came out tops\nI'll give you more details later on became out tops among seven like Seventeen thousand radio stations in America\nAnd I'm really proud to be a part of that team so just wanted to say that that's why things are expensive in Napa because things are just that good they're All right so you're going to take the test in London and are you feeling pretty confident about it\nI Am I've been doing a quite a bit of studying I have to blind tasting groups here in Phoenix and I get about fifty to Seventy five percent the winds correct and I feel like I've got the tasting down and\nYou know the W. said three you just to to different wines or rather than a white and you get thirty minutes and so I I think all male that I'm not worried about that and then I'm studying the theory currently and the W. sets a little bit different because there's no service portion I don't have any interest in learning that because I'll never work in restaurants but yeah and a lot of fun and I'm excited to do it\nSo how were you emotionally impacted by what happened here I think it's been about two weeks now I mean just to bring people up to date for the quarter master's there is the opportunity to gain your master certification but if you've ever seen the movie you saw them especially the first one\nAnd you'll see it's an incredibly rigorous process and\nPeople say and I believe it to be true that it's the hardest test in the world\nThat you can check now every year a couple of people pass the test there's less than three hundred I think is their masters arms in the country right now less than three hundred\nAnd all of a sudden twenty something people passed and this is where um you're you're standing in front of these experts and you're identifying why not just what is it but where is it from and picking it apart down to the last detail all of a sudden a whole bunch of people ask\nAnd then we find out later on that some snake leaked out a lot of information about those winds anyway all all of a sudden you know you take this test you pass this test\nEverybody's throwing parties and having a great time and then you get notification I'm Sorry we're going to strip you of that certification ... this is my opinion only there got to be people that took that test that used to that information and I heard quite a bit more in the last couple of days\nAbout the kind of information that might have leaked out but the quarter masters has kept it ... for the most part in terms of offering up too much information\nMy question is this is that if you genuinely took this test on the up and up should you be\nForced to do it again it's one of those things where it's so hard you could you could get at one time and then not get it right two times in a row and especially if you're going through the emotional turmoil of knowing that you have potentially been accused of being\nThat you know and it gets even worse than that because if you understand the way these tests work you have to pass three different service theory and tasting and you have to do that within three years or to reset\nAnd fill your but who knows how many of those people that twenty I think there are twenty four twenty seven people who passed that now if they take it again and don't pass it doesn't mean they cheated before and they might be in a ... year we'll have to do it all again I think a lot of these people will just say forget it it's just too hard\nAnd it's just it's incredibly unfortunate I just feel so badly for these people I\nBelieve that there are definitely people that took advantage of this leak of information but I also got to believe that there were people who didn't absolutely and if they didn't and they take this\nYou're under the kind of emotional arrested they are now going to be under when they re take that part of the exam they're going to look like criminals right and for no good reason and that could potentially destroy\nTheir career that they've been working toward for many many many years and it's a very you know there's no easy way out on this one I I don't see an easy way out so I'm I'm Glad that you weren't tangled into that but you will be Sunday night they're going to tighten up the the restrictions\nAnyway sad state of affairs but I'm very interesting and wonderful state of affairs to meet you Jeremy Young I'm going to be following your career as time goes on I think it's really exciting what you're doing and\nAgain if people want you know more about you they just go to\nThey can either go to our blog Mormon wind snobs dot com or they can find a punishing them again that handles Mormon wind snobs or or they can email me Jeremy at young dot org\nYou know

[noise]\nPulling out of ins drunk and Biden ... campaigning an\nElk owner better President Trump says he will pull the United states from the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty with Russia and says Russia is not living up to the agreement\nAs long as somebody is violating that agreement then we're not going to be the only one I think what\nThe president wasn't the only one stumping for his party in the battle before the midterm elections former vice president Joe Biden was in Las Vegas to fire up Democrats where he said Trump is attacking American values\n[laughter] you know I think it's the the threat of of getting so so wealthy that we can indulge ourselves in ideologies that we know has failed time and time again or you know I just I I haven't got the answer is I have are probably not as good as anyone else as to how to reverse that but the\nBut it but it is it is terrifying you look around you look at the uh\nClose to a hundred times that we've tried communism around the world and each and every single one of them it's a it's fail it ended in mass starvation it's ended in an economic collapse and and if you see the success story that the United states is the other\nAround the world that when we when we let an individual and their own money we let businesses or decide what to produce and where to produce it all off it creates tremendous wealth and that's a that's what we're benefiting from today\nYou know and then and then I find it astounding and this is crazy that just happened today Kamala Harris came out with a statement today uh uh of course in California that she feels that you know every family making less than a hundred thousand dollars a year you go to a five hundred dollar a month stipend\nBecause evidently a bank rate I'm I'm a survey report that was done in twenty Seventeen said well a lot of the you know families out there can't afford a five hundred dollar ... expense that they weren't counting on\nSo if you feel that we should be giving six thousand dollars I mean when you when you listen to that\nAnd then you just oppose that against what we're talking right now I mean we even have the inhouse senators fighting us on the basis of a free market and listen and you can make more money if you work harder we can make more money the economy improves and we can all share in that in that goodness and yet we find our senators particularly on the on the left\nOr the finding was completely on that\nSaddam I mean what's gonna happen in this election cycle or let's say presidential cycle which is going to be like a\nYou know at twelve or one after the midterm elections I actually they've already started but you know they're all going to be out of socialism you know they're going to be out doing each other's socialism and it's just going to be ... this is I'll put in a hundred socialism and all up you another hundred I mean it's just gonna become socialism on top of socialism who can be the biggest socialist\nI mean this is this is amazing I I didn't hear that Richard senator Harris saying you know everybody got six thousand dollars a month yeah\nIt actually what happened today about eleven o'clock in the end it just hit the uh I was just on line right now and I came across my computer while we're talking and she's putting out this concept you just did it today\nThat if you make less than a hundred thousand she's going to put a bill in a few things that you should have five hundred dollars a month is just to support you that's an awful long with the other concepts deliver health care for free and housing for free and you know we'll be broken in a day\nSo I don't I mean is it going to definitely take away from us being the most competitive economy in the world I mean we do things like that\nYeah the I think the thing that most people miss when they're talking about how strong the economy is doing is ... is\nIs not necessarily to lower taxes and all that good a regulatory reform but simply knowing that the government isn't going to come after me at every turn that I think the past\nOr an owner Obama bad ... ears of businesses looking over their shoulders the EPA coming after me is is that the Labor Department coming after me like what would they just constantly in fear of the federal government coming down on you and so I think a lot of what we've seen thus far I Know there's more to come and it just\nBusiness as realizing that they are free to create jobs and opportunity and so if whether it's socialist policy X Y or Z all of them turn that on its head and now\nThe government is an adversary to to people that are creating wealth that are creating jobs that are that are living their lives are at to\nIt however they they see fit rather than how Washington bureaucrats effects I think that the whole agenda is really really worrying and we could could turn around all the good news or in an instant\nAdam will uh our trade war will that potentially be arraigned on this parade\n[noise] [noise] yeah that's that's one of the two things or anything or the biggest concern to me right now the the the trade or a continues to escalate a terrorist our taxes\nAre just like a just like any other and they and they they've fallen consumers date they distort where things are made and make us less less productive\nBut I'm also even more concerned about the mounting debt in are rising deficit that we've made\nIt and now there's there's people today and over the last couple a week all concerned about how big the deficit is and they're pointing to that the tax cuts that were implemented and and that's it I'm happy that people are concerned about the deficit but we've had a mounting deficit and a growing debt for for many years now and the tax cuts didn't change at the ... the\n... and the deficit are spending problem at the end of the day and we need to we need to rein that in otherwise all the only option we're going to have is to increase taxes and the future\nBut I you know what I tend to agree with what you're saying I I think the the the this island they know ... in the room bad person in the room is the debt and people that first the first of all I don't think people really understand the the the nefarious ... of national debt\nBecause it doesn't touch them every day they don't get it it's not main street in the sense that they can you know embrace it with their own vocabulary but I think that's a very very big threat to us right now I I don't see it personally the trade war I'm a as a recall some people call it\nA really as a as a big threat I see that a a a legitimate way to get what we need as being an example with the U.S Mexican Canadian agreement that we just know pending that we're trying to do with the EU given a celebrity against the really bad guy which is China\nSo I see that as from getting us from here to there but I agree with you that the debt is a major threat to our survive ability economical\nSo Adam does this five percent a reduction of the government bureaucracy that President Trump is a is promoting is that something that will make it would that make a big difference and can you even get it over the finish line and I will the Democrats push back on that\nThey'll certainly push back a and it's a it is a step in the right direction we do with it I mean the the bureaucracy here is is far too large and there's a lot to cut but I wouldn't say that it will make a big dent so it's a it it's really bad addressing those those\nThose main unsustainable drivers of of our debt that we really have to come to terms with and no one right now seems to want to have that discussion for political reasons\nYou know it's amazing hay Adams thanks for being on a show a great discussion\nWall Street journal this week uh reports the U.S as the world's most competitive economy for the first time in a decade that we should we should all take a moment in in in applaud that I mean that's a heck of a an accomplishment we've been listening to Adams Michelle from the Heritage Foundation thanks for coming on the show thanks for having me on\nComing up Dr rough going to continue this discussion the number of things that's in the headlines this week uh that impact your jobs and some very good in some not so good you don't want to miss this [noise]\nMaze of America [noise]\n[noise]\nWe see it

I mean they're absolutely winning I mean if you take a look at female unemployment is at a Fifteen year low wages are increasing are leaving the sidelines a woman entrepreneur realism is up more small business ownership\nI mean this is a really really great story so very pleased to have on with his right now and when Parker who's presidents have job creators network foundation which just published a piece in real clear politics women are winning and the Trump economy you got to read this Elaine welcome to made in America\nThanks for having me now in which I appreciate it\nSo I mean everybody's wanting it seems like you know whatever a demographic you take but but while the women in the economy are doing really well I don't know what I've been on the sidelines haven't even been working over the last several years and now they're rejoining the\nUh economy and yet unemployment rate still remain so low what that says is that you have many more people working and still be unemployment rate going through for the year low that's a very hard thing to dueling\nIt's insane Catholic distance economy has been made it and we are seeing um women benefit in as well as on the other groups and other minorities Hispanics and black ... well that when you look at just a that email unemployment rate you mentioned a half since ...\nTwenty nine percent overall unemployment of courses even lower at three point seven percent it it it's incredibly critical numbers um we've got to GDP at one point two percent per second quarter and more waiting for third quarter it's likely going to be at least four percent um again\nBut when you look at women we we've seen a million new crime age women and that's ages twenty five to four years old that have entered the workforce\nJust since last November and and what we're seeing is that women are coming off the sidelines and put those who want to move into an entrepreneur notch entrepreneurs them and and start their own business they're able to because\nI'm as a result of the tax cuts in jobs that historically childcare has actually been a big barrier between women and entrepreneurship\nAnd the the one of the things that um we don't hear a lot about end of the tax cuts in jobs that is the doubling of the child tax credit that's not a deduction it's a credit it goes from one thousand two thousand per child so for a family that has two children they now can duct\nFour thousand dollars off of their overall tax bill and that that can cover childcare and I don't have kids that are in childcare age anymore they're grown up but he was a huge line item and my budget\nSo rich rich you're you're hearing that I'm not that educated women ... specifically or urban suburban educated women the polls are saying that they're they're against Trump I mean it's it's kind of\nCounterintuitive that you see all this form of people making money everybody's in the job force an entrepreneur who was a ... small business ownership by one of those um but yeah you know the polls are saying that the women are going against Trump what do you think\nWell you know I did that to the conundrum that's the thing that that concerns me and I don't know if I Believe the polls anyway 'cause I I stop believing the memorial back particularly with twenty sixteen\nBut but I like to hear from from link you know how to use this convert to what's going to happen in Nineteen so days from now\nWhen we we come up to the midterm vote if in fact the women are doing so much better which they are in fact all these good economic signs are out there which they are then why are we hearing you know well you know a a good plurality of women or ... or or not in favor of Trump or they're going to leave the here the oxymoron a ball you gonna vote Democrat\nAnd and I would think that would put his back where we were eight years ago so I like your thoughts on that I could I find that to be a total confusion\nThat you know it it's really unfortunate because the media has not recorded\nOn the benefits of the tax cuts as much as they they cut it as a matter of fact\nThere's been a lot of misinformation out there about the tax cuts and how it benefits middle America um and small business and has helped the night this this ah economy um Ninety percent\nOf Americans are going to benefit and see tax relief from this tax bill that includes women and minorities men um everybody and and and that's important but this is\nThe small business I'm really had a great seat at the table at the but the tax cuts in jobs that that and this is another thing that can help women who want to move intelligently newer ship\nIs a twenty percent tax deduction small business tax deduction that included which will continue to help than these planes of entrepreneurial them even more this protective of their income so that they can reinvest their income into their business inch their wheat\nAnd that's exactly what we're hearing small businesses do we have thousands of numbers across the country who are telling us through their emails through um are newsletters they're telling us that they are giving wage increases\nHave to keep going back to them as well but Venezuela was the richest country in Latin America and bad policies have made it into a complete and utter disaster but the students\nDon't understand where prosperity comes from\nAnd they don't understand how easy it is to destroy\nProsperity so uh you know just the biggest unknowingly aren't we aren't what she's saying we aren't teaching them and I I Wish we were I Wish we communist at least we're teaching them more than we're doing now\nWell a professor thanks for being on a show professor for Reuben from Emory University\nA route a great piece just recently with the statistic
