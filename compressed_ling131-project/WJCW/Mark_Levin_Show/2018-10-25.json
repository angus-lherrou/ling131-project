there's a race for the Senate Mississippi it's not talked about much outside of Mississippi and there's a gentleman running who I've always been a big fan of and his name is Chris McDaniel and he's running for the Senate and Mississippi how are you sir\nI Am great mark thank you for having me so\nWell it's my pleasure and explain to everybody in the nation as well as in Mississippi how this particular election works\nWell it's a special election you might recall twenty fourteen I rather just a forty one year income but by the name of Thad Cochran we're feeding Mr cook with the first night\nHe came back out any scared forty thousand Democrats and the Republican primary and they go away from us at ... ... well I remember that yes there are just like yes that was but does they'd than time a senator Cochran stepping down perfectly so they get heavy subtle back\nThe next senator from the Mississippi were so happy to be a lifetime Democrat Hillary Clinton supporter by the name of the ... so they appoint Kirk and prevention and now that means we're in a special race\nTriple the order of ... that term so for people in the race non heartless and that is no parties declared and what happens is the top to advance to a three week well after November\nBut the bottom right here mark here we are again for the established by conservative person at the same old machine and discover going to take them out\n[noise] why would the governor Brian I Believe his name is why would he appoints somebody who's been a lifelong Democrat who voted for Hillary Clinton who are more recently became a Republican why would he appointed to the Senate\nMark I think this may surprise liquor listeners but Mitch McConnell doesn't like me very much and I don't feel very much either so well then then Mitch McConnell met with the governor\nAnd hit the structure to the governor work anyone but not Daniel\nSo sure enough they polled all the statewide against me and they didn't work out very well so they finally found this one person who didn't help much name id the thought process was despite the fact that she was a lifetime Democrat we can all pointer we can write a whole bunch of money we can find her as a ...\nPublic and even though she hasn't been seen may have a great chance to win so that's why it was Mitch McConnell hand selected or this person to be the appointee\n[noise] you know I Know ah there's a lot of my conservative brothers and sisters out there who are now think the world of Mitch McConnell I Do not I think what he did in the case of Kevin was something that any Republican leader must do and should have done if they can't deliver\nA a Supreme Court position or when they control the majority in the Senate I don't care how small majority is\nUh that would've sank the Republican Party for a decade in my view now having said that\nIt's actually more than that you are a constitutional conservative explain your views\nWell I'll go all the way back I was the state's lawyer against Obamacare I represented the lieutenant governor and ten other petitioners against Obamacare but here my positions\nAre I guess outlay outline for you I I Believe strongly that the constitution I'm an originalist orientation I've I've read your book men in black and understand the power of the court and the bottom line here is we've got to find people that can construed the document as originally intended\nAnd that means rejecting this a living constitution nonsense that's pushed by the likes of Kennedy and the Sotomayor and the like\nWe need to find more skill is more a Clarence Thomas's more individuals like Gorsuch that can stand the construe this document the way it was meant to be\nWhat that means simply is the federal government is way too large it's doing way too much article one section it gives an over our supposed to have all the other powers blow to the states and the people respectively so when every vote that way casting every speech could we get the idea of the things centralize the power of the federal government\nAnd give those hours back to the people\nChris McDaniel tell us a tell us about your race in Mississippi how's it going\nIt's going very well obviously the establishment or they work hard to cut off our money supplies that is one of the big five but we always have\nWhen you stand up against the establishment when you push back\nThey punish conservative for doing that and yet we still have to have the courage and the guts to push back because they cannot be allowed\nTo destroy this country the way they have over the last several years so what happens is they turn off our tickets of money and we have to find new ways to raise it and the spy despite the fact we'd be outspent ten to one we're still winning the race\nThere's at least one pack poll fills us up between eight and ten other polls whisper it around town show us up two or three other polls show us down five but bottom line is we're winning this

other\nOr as coach Jake told me when I talk to them a little bit earlier tonight will let the fan sure about that when we play the interview [noise] they're all big when they get together but that was probably the highest profile which was probably a better way of putting it as a there was more on the line and that one that never ever had before\nUh yeah no doubt about it you know I can remember as a kid growing up hearing about the money they would all go replay it in the middle east at stake it's always been a big rivalry between ... and you know whatever they do\nIt it's a big rivalry so yeah

team has had to try to bounce back from a law\nIn an emotionally big football game and it's going to be interesting to see how this football team response that I\nHave no doubt when you when you have

in the regular season finale\nThis is just one of a number of games that we've been moved up till tonight to tonight because of the threat of a pretty heavy rain tomorrow and uh you know I'm not so sure that feel that the field conditions if it\nPotential gate a combination of the two things\nBut I I heard somebody in the press box earlier tonight they are playing out right now [laughter] but not the only place they've done that and that that that David rocket down at\nMore counties to wrapping up the regular season in court they've already clinched the number one the for the for the district Daniel Boone has cut the number two seed regardless of what happens tonight Tennessee Hi is going to be the number three feet\nOr so a\nDavid crack Daniel Boone both knowing that they're going to be on this jerky football team with the team that was actually to win this region before the pre season and then the project starting quarterback alec friend a junior went down with an injury\nBefore the season started and uh they have struggled throughout the season they've had some games that they have been very very competitive and they've got to senior quarterback running the football team but\nHe says just not coming together and you know as well as I Do in football that if you get a bad break things tend to snowball a lot of time\nYeah you know it and when you get your your quarterback is probably going to be one of the main leaders on your team he goes down early in the seats are even before the season started it kinda takes a little\nTakes a little thing in a little when I was real and these young men has not really handled it as well as they as the coaches maybe thought they would have or maybe they should have but nevertheless\nI got news for you guys out a jerk you ain't gonna lay down for nobody\nDeep and has been a while the fences has scored points in game in the deep end of that kind of what's been letting them down a lot they open up the season\nWith a forty nine to twenty eight lost against Campbell county and then losing sixty one to Twenty one against the good self to football team that last march counties twenty four fourteen [noise] losing to seem more Juanita Seventeen losing the first war in a row then finally picking up a win\nIn the battle of Hawkins county can volunteer ... twenty seven and then have lost or straight since then losing to thirty eight thirty five and get\nMore kind of West yeah that's an impressive lot yeah I mean you know the you lose to more a school like more than ... who opt out Bennett beat them last week down at their plate [noise] they've got\nA lot of firepower on that football team\nBut jerk he was able to thirty five points on the board against them and losing another shoot up to ... county [noise] thirty eight to thirty or ... county is a good football team then losing to David crack at forty one to ten and then Tennessee Hi last week forty nine fourteen now based on those last two scores\nYou know you look at this and you say well then you build should have a pretty easy time of it you can't look at Scott and people\nPeople far too many kind of look at this [laughter] I mean look at look at look at Central Florida last year old they made all they were beaten beat Auburn who beat Alabama so central port is supposed to be the national champion right don't comparatively scores you can't do it without a\nHead to head competition match ups are completely different than looking at scores on on on a sheet of paper\nAnd every time they get out on the field anything can happen you never know how the ball was about ... rates are going to get\nYou just never never no that's why the hell is that the old saying goes that's why they play the game you gotta lace them up to see what's best but looking at their schedule Don I'm looking at Campbell county which is probably a sixth grade school is it not oh there's their father they dropped down back down to five ...\n... is is a bigger school that's five heirs are probably a more stay on the\nUh there there are there but those are now they're more time with is the only thing that goes but a lot of those schools\nThey've got all you know they've got a a\nA a bunch of kids in there I mean even though they're classified as a very but you and I both know them or to the school there are very good schools in there and it's you know there's some some athletes in some talent floating around in those places and you know every now and then they might come out on the football field and want to participate especially Campbell county in South there were\nTwo programs that were expected to do some pretty good things that you know and and you talk about crazy things happening during football games with Daniel football team one of the things that that has driven them just so much success is years the fact that they've done a very good job taking care of the football\nOr it it will that hurt thing when you're when you're a five foot nine hundred and Seventy five pound defensive back the first thing you see six foot two when you say six to uh to twenty five coming at you you know what you do you go over there you\nGo ahead do about it but yeah I'll see if I can grab you wrote behind and grab you by the shoestring yourself is if I Can't stop you know you don't want to tackle anybody that big company full speed ahead\nI still think it's extremely impressive the fact that the trailblazers with the success that they've had this year doing it with three sophomores they've got to seniors left tackle I say acquaintance is a senior\nThe a white guard Jeremiah Solomon is a senior\nBut the other three starting line and our sophomore and to be able to let's face it when you've got to pick up different reads as an op ed Lyman I I think most the casual football than does not understand\nHow much [noise] in our fence of line that has to be able to adjust to changes in in you know in in not made any changes in plays that are being called or maybe a situation where you have different blocking schemes because\nYou know depending on the play you might have an offensive lineman that's calling the blocking assignment and they're also are all things that do not come easily now especially the young football players and the fact that they've been able to do this\nAnd do it successfully with three thought more as I said it before I'll say it again I'll probably said three or ... or the night is over it's extremely impressive to me yeah I I\nI Know I Know where to visit one college uh football lineman who who was who had the direct traffic it on the college level and at the high school level a ... and you know those guys say what you want to about football but you know bits of lamb and I'll probably\nArguably the smartest guy on the team because they've got to know they've got to know you know where where everybody's at what the market the tuition is what the defense is what these kids coming at him and where they need to go to block it and\nThat's a lot to process and let's put it this way if they're not no your team is not going to see a lot of that about that no I'm not that you know certain not at all but the fact that they have done so well\nThat bodes well for the culture that it'd be very good very good coaching um they're learning how to do things the right way and ah you know and you know Jeremy ...\nHe's been around this game for a couple of years ahead of the guy and he's got a solid stamp around him and that said that breed success football team oh no doubt about it when you've got good coaching you've got kids who are willing and wanting to learn is paying attention and do what it takes to win a ball game\nA that's a recipe for success you know I've known Jeremy for so long my youngest son is thirty one\nAnd when he was a little league baseball Germany you some pirates ... and so we we go back from before that and ah it it's just always good when you get an opportunity to catch up with him he's such a good guy he's a humble guy he just he he shoot straight yeah he does it I mean he's he's not one of these guys\nIt's going to tell you a lot of stories he's just straightforward and honest with you and uh it it's really a pleasure to be able to talk to him yeah you you you appreciate\nThat you appreciate your appreciate the honesty the brightness of coaches when they say hey look we're I got news for you were just probably really your\n... and it didn't you know we're probably not ... you know or on the side of it we're not good or or you know these kids can do X Y and Z or you know and we're lacking here you know we're lacking all on another part of the day but you you want you want to hear that at the coaches in a one on one conversation now\nOnce you once you put on your media had it it may be a different story is just one on one\nYou know you get too strict truth and that's what you really want to hear from as well\nAnd you know we ... and for those who don't know Michael and I do Donald spending on a regular basis on the sports monster will be up in Kingsport tomorrow night for the season finale we will be back here for the Daniel to lay off on the sports monster next week\nBut um we're very fortunate in that while they have not had a successful season we have a head coach at ... at coach in the past in Grant Park in the head coach this year enjoy Christian who is much just saying he's very very Frank wouldn't be very very forward\nUm and you know there are a lot of coaches in this area and and we've talked about that during basketball more on the character of the guys that coach basketball around here\nAnd you find in the tri city area and I'm going to stay the tri city area because dominance Bennett science feel incompetent play a lot of teams from down the road or in town Jeff counting Knoxville and I'm not going to say\nThat it necessarily carry down that far but the coaches here in the tri city are all good guys and good people to deal with an R in it if you show them that that they can trust you yeah they're going to be very straightforward with an honest with you about things\nAnd that's of course something that we pride ourselves on I Know that's something that Tim cable prides himself on a course he does has done a Daniel going in and David Cross it all season long that something you you you develop a pride in in the fact that you're able to develop a relationship with coaches and they do trust you and and you know we've we've met\nTwo coaches you especially if you're not been doing this thing to do now for football for five years basketball with them and they\nCertainly longer they're on and off on an island that there'll be a ...\nRegular season doing football or basketball together and and so you know we'd have we'd have developed a relationship with your coaches down to way toward more stand on a little bit further down that way and it's nice when you can come in and they know who you are\n... you know the low down on what what who's who and it gives us a little bit more than we should we could work was also we mentioned to\nYour knife and a senior members of the Daniel Boone football team looks like we've got cheerleaders and a man good golly abandoned and maybe even some probably cross country and of course regional cross country meat

absolutely you know come out we want to establish law scrimmage and get back what we are we are really at a crowd ourself and doing it benefits going to allow screams on both sides of the ball and come back and\nTo do that it gets quality of only watch your team was picked and when the cockroach or so we know that got a lot of our power they just\nI've had some injuries like like everybody has turned the ball over some but we know we're going to have it work it out or especially going to beep and saw the ball but like I say we ought to be a you know our kids are really shocked at the bit to get back at it and they're really hoping to jumpstart recent post you\nKnow everybody knows you got an outstanding running back but when you look at the ... there and so to a lot of people that might be a surprise that you've been at that are running the others yeah well yeah so you know you got got our our our second call or a great quarterback\nIn running gay but you know it all starts at four

have the blazers can get off the field in his first first opportunity here\nRunning back to the left Courtney too wide receivers\nGates side corny it's going to keep an eye on the back yard he fought in the middle get across the forty five of the trailblazers down to the forty three yard line Daniel Boone and that's going to be up for change our pickup yeah ... ... they're going to market at the forty two\nOf the lasers yes certainly Rob is on the tax again that Tom bones which right there right there at the ball is being snap and I think they got out of your life on the fence and the quarterback doesn't get through oh\nCourtney again ended up to the big guy and side that number thirty three jeopardy Kirk singer and he's going to get to the forty or pick up a couple of days before\nThe ... go for\nA second the native you got to down to the forty yard line this ah this was a jerky cheese all kinds of ... just back early in his ball game to us\nThat can aid from the laser forty\n[noise] Courtney is going to keep it goes on on the left and finds a splitting a little bit tougher outside picks up a couple of down to the thirty eight you know it's going to be third and fourth she drinks on their act came in from\nKind of shocked to get the comet trail that a little bit just as a quarterback was trying to get back you see posters like there to\nWrap them up they'll stay with\nKurt singer as the running back three wise to the near side one of the far side and they got the blaze all around them\nYup hard count got a job that's going to move it down to the thirty three yard line and get a third in that it will be third and one down to the thirty three and you got to believe that turkey is more for down territory now\nMost definitely and this is not the way it goes Jason's wanted this while to come out\nOn his own defense was on the ball in his first quarter mile and that may be why Cherokee wanted started out authentically like this\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nFor me it's going to keep it comes out the right side gets the purse down inside thirty to the twenty a yard line and he was the only one in the backfield yeah H back on the right side too wide spread 'em out and then just ran straight off to right tackle\nThat Tom Bowman random blitz and the quarterback shorter had been delayed by itself and and as soon as the the furniture players shouting went by him to the side quarterback went right where it came from it right through the whole thing through\n[noise]\nBack to the left of Courtney to lie to each side man in motion for my lap jet sweet left with the old ... old broke one tackle but then he's gonna be stacked up on the Gary Jonah sleeper\n[noise]\nIt was tackled by gang of ... kind of got it first kind of joke that attack which there was a whole the whole day Israel birds is wiped out and once he broke their taxes\nAnd they place that right after twenty eight yard line so it's no gain second intent determine our sideline one\nSeven thirty one remaining first quarter do score opening position of the football game Cherokee started out their own twenty seven yard line it and they stand for the Daniel Boone twenty eight that content\nFor singing the loan running back he will line up to the left of coordinate the quarterback who's done most of the damage only seven yard than for Kerry back to throw looking to the left stepping up throwing Harlem dinner stepped it oh trailblazers had to red shirt and\n[noise] I don't know I ... a big guy he was wrecked a sports team the bottom why yeah that Sammy Sammy ... Robert ... back during coverage and I know what he looks at what he's trying to get their appetites back window\nOf on white diving in almost came up with the football just couldn't quite get there in time third intent and other big third downplayed ...\nThree ... near side trailblazers and jumped again did they but they were coming in with the blitz jump\nAnd that's going to make it instead of ten it'll be Thirteen medium and boy you can't make those kind of it that makes things too easy though you're given a you're given away easy or you don't you talk about momentum\nA moment of sailors this'll be the builders in drowsiness which I feel the well and now you put them in a position where they might go for it on for down yeah no doubt about it\n[noise] [noise]\nDropping back drunk to the right side going towards the corner incomplete pass was well out of the to the editor receiver Leeper yeah we ... the balls and underline it up there ... there is for them to have fun when you got more than five why not yeah\nWell are are they are they\nWell no I look out at I've been to send in a and it's going to be a ... yard field goal attempt yeah betrayed court and his whole robbed a no oh no they're a this is kind of a\nThey've got everybody lined up to the left except for three players and the quarterback this is one of those green formation let's see what they run out of four and five from\nAnd it's not and Courtney is going to roll life he he wants to Iran wants to run all he's going to be hit and drop and I bought tell you what that blew up on sure yeah yeah yeah he writes trickery and it didn't work and it's going to actually be a lost back to the twenty six yard line\nA lot of three and I I I got to believe that you're out for themselves at play that district race it did\nNot work and I think they're trying to get a pay cut through your\n... they got down in the state of positions that the ball was going to go out and ... and there was all kinds of people who are not bringing in court and all he could do is try to run the blazers stopped the\nChiefs on down the takeover first intend to their own twenty six\nHerald a quarterback\nYou'll handed off to who else but Cole and get hit it the line at a ground ball I picked up by jerky and they're gonna blow the whistle and I think I was down\nOh my\nAnd boy I tell you what trailblazers have been holding on to the football season turn it over time I heard over and they are going to call it a bumble\nThrough the whole I thought he was gone and Adams as you said made that ... saving a grab for such a\nTimeout called by Daniel Boone it can be first and goal is to stand for the chief you know coach Jenkins was telling his defense before the football game he was telling the guys listen we got to make ...\nUp a defensive lineman if you don't make the tackle linebackers you've got to make the pack a linebacker as if you don't make the tackled the only people left or the or the secondary secondary if you don't make tack of what happened\nTo touch it and right there was a touchdown saving tackle as we saw by Adam but I'll tell you what by the shoestring yeah barely that I'm an adult looked like he was going to be lining up\nFor the tying extra point momentarily but they are knocking at the door first and goal at the gym with for fourteen remaining in the first quarter [noise] I'll tell you what for seven nothing score\nIt's been an exciting maybe they were a lot a lot of stuff happening here it and you know it after two terms you know starting to ball over it and you know a good job of boom left town down and down this time churches is putting together driving it looks like they want to go into school score test here\nIt's going to be priced lining up to the white officer right up to the right to coordinate got to watch the ... the left side one of the years that now price which is to the website to coordinate\nFirst and goal from the sand blazes come with a black flies around the right side dropped or after one yard kickoff gr team\nMan like Daniel Daniel less just rock they got in great great got in a great sense dot and just wrap them up that can go from the nine [noise]\nYou know it's been mostly either one between the tackled yet of that effort the blazers than I Do the outside stuff they've done a pretty good job stopping\nRunning up in between the tackles probably will jerky was going to want to make some hay but still the granted outside is not working for\nA second ago from the nine for the chiefs and they're going to throw this time oh way over the head of the intended receiver Micah don't and he had he\nHad he had to step on the deepest bass she's just over to the past three thirty and go from that I don't I I you know I'm old school football I'd love to see the guy did it for the standard and just getting the power formation and just\nSee what happens with this this spread formation down here it is a yard line is you know how I feel a little while that is one of the reasons I Love the trailblazer exactly exact their old school day grind\nIt out I'll throw it when they have to but it's it's a controlled passing game and uh just just it it complements to run all the blazers jumped the ghetto they didn't they did not get a cold every now and that was you know had trouble finding in this play\nThat was an awful long time oh no no it's just it's just oh somebody jumped on Cherokee part\nYou know while while we go back to the fourteen surprise surprise surprise above that so it's certain goal from the fourteen now\n[noise]
