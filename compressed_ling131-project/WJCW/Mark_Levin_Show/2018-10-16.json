life I really enjoyed it\nBut there's been a break in the case a real break in the case over the weekend I should say break a revelation to break in the case up in a long time ago actually but the revelation over the weekend by Congressman John Ratcliffe he's been doing a tremendous job um exposing along with Devin Nunes ask Mark Meadows Jim Jordan and various others\nHave been doing a great job of exposing the a disgusting\nGovernment corruption in our intelligence community or department of justice in at the upper level management the FBI in this scandal to get Donald Trump now folks ah here's what happened this week and let me put it in context for you for a moment for those who\nI don't know seemingly missed the story somehow I don't know if you've been on ... or whatever for the past maybe your space travel\nIt's like that Bruce Willis movie or what was that with Ben Affleck where they're drilling into the asteroid you've been gone for\nThe Donald Trump team was spied on by the United states government there were Pfizer warrants issued to spy on the Trump TV may miss some of that but that is what happened and the FBI is given conflicting accounts repeatedly of how exactly this investigation started that sit in a nutshell it's a very wonky case\nMy book as expensive footnotes audit even buy a use liberal footnotes that way to liberals camera few when they said in the past on it but\nThe cases very simple in its essence\nEight opposition political parties from Donald Trump Brock Obama's White House weaponize the intelligence community and in some cases the law enforcement community case to the FBI the upper levels in their management\nChain to go after the Trump team that's it\nNow why am I bring that up now not to give you the go what's great what else is there are lots to talk about them bringing this up so the break this weekend makes sense [noise]\nRatcliffe unleash the just the poor enough information to Maria barn Romo show on Fox News and that at Arizona on the weekends\nAnd he said that there is some potentially exculpatory material hanging out there about George Papadopoulos why does this matter folks and what the heck is going not remember the FBI's reasons for starting this investigation the most critical counterintelligence investigation possibly in modern us history\nAgainst a suit to be president Donald Trump at a time a presidential candidate the explanation as to why they did it has changed so many times\nThat they cannot seem to wrap their arms around why they did it themselves\nIt started as a whole is all about Carter Page that it was all about George Papadopoulos that as I explained in a ... show which was all about alpha bank\nIn my book and lays it out alpha bank oh you haven't even heard that story and I'm sure you I\nPromise you folks the reason the story keeps changing\nIs because they were constantly looking for new reasons to spy on the Trump team because the ovaries kept falling apart\n[laughter] this is what's going on they tried the alpha bank oh that didn't work let's try Carter Page oh there's no evidence he's a spy either let's try George Papadopoulos man up is working out there no shocks what do we do now\nThat's the reason the story keeps changing now here's the problem here's the problem they're having the last story they settled on that was advanced by the New York times back in December of\nLast year and that they've stuck to since you hear the liberals Paris this too is you know George Papadopoulos did\nGeorge Papadopoulos is low level Trump advisor met with Alexander down or this Australian diplomat in the United kingdom talked about this Russian dirt and that's what did it he passed on the information and there you go bingo we got\nWell things gentlemen what's the problem with is\nThe problem is when you go into a fight that court there's a verification process for the information are you supposed to present\nExculpatory information to at some point if it be indicates that the the target let me give you an easier example this week sometimes a little complicated me ever been a federal agent\nIf I Walk into court and swear in front of a judge for a search warrant then I Believe there's probable cause at a prime a crime has been committed that there's evidence and this location and I fail to put out there evidence that indicates that the person I'm targeting in the house we're looking to get a warrant on\nIs in fact not the place and I I felt to include evidence that that person may not be guilty of the crime\nLadies and gentlemen the chances of losing their job if not being put up on criminal charges yourself depending on the severity of the allegation\nOr significant it's becoming clear as day now\nThat the FBI according to multiple members of Congress you've seen this information had information that George Papadopoulos\nWas completely innocent of this that this Russian collusion thing was a fairy tale is made up but the information they presented to the Pfizer court was not that folks was not that it was only the stuff alleged basically in the ...\nAnd here say based items that can never be verified now why is this important that there may be exculpatory evidence\nIs important folks\nBecause of this whole entire case right now is married to this latest narrative this is all they have\nIf the entire reason for investigating the Trump team was based on a case where the FBI and information the guy they were targeting was not guilty at all this whole thing collapses the whole thing that's why this is so

distinguish whether a person's ancestors were indigenous to North or South America\nSovereign tribal nations set their own legal requirements for citizenship and while DNA tests can be used to determine lineage such as fraternity to an individual it's not evidence for tribal affiliations oh by the way\nHe was in a DNA test to lay claim to any connection to the Cherokee Nation or any tribal nation even vaguely\nIs inappropriate and wrong\nAnd makes a mockery out of DNA test and it's a legitimate use as well also does honoring legitimate tribal governments and their citizens whose

might be a rambling gal but\nBecause all of this is going on and you even have the president of the United states being asked about twenty twenty on a near daily basis I feel the need to tell you this president Donald Trump will likely be reelected\nDone by the Trump\nOdds are he's reelected now\nYou just said they're going that sounds pretty baseless no it's not even anything to do with the economy is not anything to do with all the record improvement so we've been saying here's the first reason why the odds are in his favor\nHe's an incumbent president running for reelection so let's start their sixty five percent a president to run for re election\nIn order to when you have to be as lame is kept in the night before mentioned Jimmy Carter you have to do something no new\nTaxes and

[laughter]\n[noise] the following the fuck shit if a voter racing that for the voice of NASCAR\n[noise] [noise] well you know I'm running eyesight and in mile and a half\nUm for me it's been I worked really well\nI'm an ... running a Chevrolet and extend a serious seems to work really gets me on these strikes and you know whether that was\nJust thought you know uh you know I thought at first it was just you know I just couldn't get nasty race car on the mile and a half race tracks and as soon as I got my own house with chain of our sports we had that same speed so um\nI myself have a lot of confidence in the crew chief in my guys have a lot of office when it got him on a house\nOn top of that when it's a track when you move around and got him up against what counts um yeah that that falls right in the wheel house of in my biggest comfort zone so um that's going to be a little bit chilly there last year so I think you'll see it or be as\nQuite as top down the dominant you saw last year ... serious but I suspect you're definitely we move around that race track 'cause it's you know it's five six years old now and I'm tired of the world a whole lot but it just seems you know what these ecstatic cars you can just keep the momentum built up so much butter and such\nYeah it is it really does\nNot a question for you here Tyler oh what a year for junior motor sports and and and you started it often we talked about that when at Daytona when you're when you're in a situation like that particularly that southern or just an old they're winning races\nUm are you one of those guys that that's just totally encouraging or is there any degree of frustration that you know that there is only one ... everyone here's one are pretty good but there's one team that just seems to find a way to relearn what does that as a as a team driver up there\n[noise] uh it's frustrating because we have all the same tools that that they have um Justin and has died and just an outstanding job days executed perfectly on those races that they've won um I don't know if we've had seven races that we could have one or sex or even half of the greatest he's won but um\nWe've definitely like good good opportunities for ourselves slip away from us and most of them have been you know before that race even get started we have something go wrong in the first forty laps or you don't you come in like ... itself out of the race after running up front there\n... parents make the wrong block ... ... you know make the wrong moves in not winning the race there's too many things you can go back and look at but um you can very quickly get frustrated doing that so\nI'm just looking ahead to Kansas and last year was ... we're kind of say think somebody maybe had a shot at winning that race just couldn't GET requests for ... for the longest time I'm On that last run but he took off and it was really fast so we know he's in a very challenging when we get there but um I think we've got a really good shot at winning this race this weekend\nAnd we just got to be smart we've got to do what we've been doing and the first round the playoffs we just got to be smart response but can't be afraid to get aggressive at the end of it\nCan you even imagine what it'd be like to win this one to know your husband the homes to do with their dream or think about that\nIt's been my dream all year long yeah OK quite\nHonestly you know my ... I thought our biggest challenge this year was going to be getting to the first round of layoffs I um I have just that much confidence in my in my guys if we\nGet to Kansas with a you know\nIn the in the in the playoffs so that we have a really good shot at capitalizing there um and winning that race not going to be easy and that can be a cake walk but\nThe most confidence in my guys um and if anything else we have a very slow date Kansas we're really really good at Texas too so we can have two really good races there I feel like going to Phoenix another place you know more sports outstanding um\nShould be really good shape I'm really looking forward to what what we got under the heading of unless you ever like this\nWeekend at Kansas yeah yeah that sounds encouraging that's great to hear tolerant British up the time thanks for joining us\nAbsolutely thing very much\nThat's junior motor sports driver Tyler reading has he spoke with the postman earlier today coming up on

seasons and seven championships together chats going to be moving over to the number twenty four car driven by William Byron ... and had a chance to catch up with William and talk about the big change\nWhere you Byron you've won and everything you've been in whether it's a video game where the truck series or the extent of the series now you're at the cup level and you're about to start working with one of the all time great crew chief does that kind of make your pinch yourself a little bit and go\nWow yeah it's a it's incredible I mean to get an opportunity to work with ... is a great chance for me and a chance to grow and learn I feel like it's a big blessing so I'm looking forward to that next year or we obviously has some great thanks to accomplish this year and a and we look forward to that as well\nJimmy Johnson said earlier that you were a lot like him when he was about your age in that he worked well in an environment where he's being coaxed and he liked that and he thinks you enjoyed that as well is that something that's true a and B that are looking forward to from a guy like that\nYeah I think so I think you have to be open minded when it comes to racing there's a lot of things that changed conditions um last time you know and\nBasically every very bill you can imagine so I look forward to being coached and kind of understood a little bit better and I feel like chat and I will have that relationship to go back and forth and and have a healthy a relationship to compete for wins\nYou work with a another veteran daring grub this season and boy he has been there done that in seeing a huge amount of things in the sport what's what's going to be the take away from working with Derrion that you'll carry forward with you\nYeah I think just learning the ropes the cup series is what daring has helped me with um he's helped me understand a feedback communication\nUnder understanding how to handle each person within the team and uh we we've grown a lot so I look forward to working with them the rest of this year and I feel like there and brings a lot of intelligence and he has such a engineering mindset or that he's able to\nBring a lot to us\nWhat's been the most challenging part of the on track competition for you this year\nAre probably just going to the different ... um I've been to most of the racetrack but I'm going there for for probably the second time whether I went there in ... the one time or two times and so I get a chance to go to different race tracks but also the competition is very tough\nSo I feel like the combination combination of those two things is is very challenging but um it's still just a race car a it still takes the same things to be competitive and go fast\nYou know when I watched you come up through the truck series and the extent of these theories for that matter you you learned your ropes as you say a little bit in the early part of the season and then about halfway there was a seemed like a light bulb it came on and you took off like a rocket to the end of the year with a cup series\nEverybody is you know a notch above the same way as people say college to pro sports but what has been the thing that has encouraged you the most and kept you off the emotional roller coaster of the highs and lows in that situation\nYeah I think having good teammates I think having a great team owner that has confidence in you or Mr Hendrik has given me everything every\nOpportunity to succeed and especially with this opportunity next year so um he doesn't put much pressure on me when it comes to this rookie year and performing but I Know that that we both want to perform really well so um I think when you have people that have confidence in you you avoid the ups and downs of of a

if they're a check and stuff they're pretty pretty easy ride\nKeep up with your favorite NASCAR stars easily say on NASCAR today the day you're on the mogul racing network the voice of NASCAR [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nIs NASCAR live\nNow to Mike badly thanks for hanging out with us this week on NASCAR live\nEarlier this month the national or announced that brand new aerodynamic package will be used in the upcoming two thousand Nineteen cup series season when he came caught up with NASCAR executive vice president and chief racing development officer Steve O'Donnell and chatted about the\nChances are it's going to be new for everybody you mentioned Paul new rules I mean these talk on Mars have gotten a lot more now more than half of them in a lot less attention [noise] this is something NASCAR racetrack is to try to see if it weren't\nSo Steve tell me the idea behind the number of races that you got to show to bring this new packaging because there was the author writes and talks about maybe some more racist then that was held off into what you've announced now yeah I think the goal ultimately was to try and get some one Arab and when we looked at that that wasn't only for a\nFor next year but I think as we looked at a long term for the sport and was the right move\nFor not only NASCAR but for the owners are as well so [noise] so we ran all the simulation and felt like we're in a good place with the ... as well so made the decision to go with a number rations we did\nAnd what fans are immediately going to compare the two of what we saw with the all star package but understand this is a little different can you point out yeah it is I think we've we've learned Everytime we've we put the ... out there and particularly around the all star race on one of the things we heard from the drivers\nUh was you know the the you know being on throttle timing in horse power so made a move to the five hundred fifty horse power I think that matches up well with the arrow package that we have an open on an even better race and that compares with the all star package horse power was how so an extra hundred and fifty horsepower in terms of what was added\nTo the packages we head into twenty I see the seven fifty or so that we have right now fish kill ya ya to two hundred a few hundred less um but matches up again to kind of how we match that I'm with the dynamics that will be part of the factors in terms of spoilers\nAnd there's also the changes are they talking about hundreds going to say exactly the same as we saw in twenty Eighteen but after that even the super ... feet ways are going to change and we'll have papers face sorts of different tracks\nWives a smaller space there were some ... and no air notes versus here don't send a different space or some other trucks what was the determining factor I think if you start with the Daytona five\nHundred that was really a in talking to the engine builders um\nYou know having that image were already in place a lot of work it already been done towards the Daytona five hundred so wanted to leave that alone and really prepare for Talladega tapered space or so\nIt allows us to have that common package throughout Tom fans will still see the great side by side racing that's there used to that Talladega in Daytona once we get through uh the Daytona five hundred as well he's\nNot rich by going into that one I think\nThere's a lot of unknowns we don't know or how it's going to be but I think there's a lot of opportunity for it to be better as well um you know I think you know the [noise]\nHalfway test that we've kind of had is um the author race and and what we've seen in the city series so far or would they package that's close to it and uh your your foot in the gas Bible out more but at the same time you know you're able to uh you know make a lot of moves and I'm with the draft and\nChanged a lot different lines and um [noise] you know\nIt also raises a lot of fun um you know but I'm just an author race so I think we have to have a plastic next to it and say what\nIs the author race and everyone's racing for all or nothing and have that attitude but I think at the same time this package ah you know it it's at a lot of race tracks I think it will be better in some respects it may be similar to wherever I suffer the kind of wait and see all of a sudden\nDriven a lot of cars over the years and all generations of cars [noise]\nHad some opinions mines too much out there's not enough [noise]\nI don't know what next year will look like ultimately there's something wrong enough learn together is is a group\nI think there's been a couple of great races that have shown that package puts on a great show I think we'd be naive to think that it's just going to be awesome everywhere but there's a big attempt being made to improve the quality of racing and I support making our sports stronger and that's that's where I stand on it and are you on the day there's still passing out a trophy now like trophy so I'll make one of\nThe ... year old Ryan Whitey will score and I think it's good you know they they adjusted it from the all star package honestly I thought they all start back it was too so\nJust I said it's more power back [noise]\nUm [noise] a mile and a half\nStay the same as a as a short tracks and are are of course the so that's nice for um
