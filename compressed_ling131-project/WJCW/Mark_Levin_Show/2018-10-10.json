over towards the swamp river this is the time of year where the ties are the highest but called the king tides and they keep that of course in there are thinking when they put out these warnings\nHard to prove this a hate crime they wouldn't be hard to prove they hate us\nIt's not going to happen in Oregon I guess but what about the U.S department of justice doing it what about Jeff Sessions in the FBI and all the rest of what about that\n[noise] I agree that's where should come from the top\nYou know in Charlottesville ... went out one white skin ad ran into a crowd and killed some woman he was

this practice law would choose most of my professional life I'm disgusted by that ah ... running around Charlottesville at night with tiki torches talking about the N word and about Jews\nThat's bad stuff it happens but ten times that stuff\nHappens on the left all the time and it's never confronted in reality for what it is which is ... from the left\nThere's much more hate from the left and from the right there's many more hate crimes on the left and on the right but they're never prosecuted that why are they\nNow know they're not\nWell same we gotta go thanks for your call this move on to John and California John and California Welcome to the market limited show John please go ahead\nI Want to ask you a great legal mind to question since this whole against them out to vote over they're controlling the streets in Oregon\nAnd the mayor's ordering them to the police to stand down so that people can be assaulted their property can be destroyed the mayor be charged for aiding and abetting a um those who are against\nYou know forty two usa Nineteen forty eight is a statute that deals with one state authorities act or under act on their color if state law to violate someone civil rights\nThe mayor of Portland, Oregon is part of an unspoken conspiracy the object to which is to violate someone civil rights you have the right to travel and when these individuals confronted Ted Cruz in a restaurant in a private restaurant on private property\nAnd then when authorities did not arrest those individuals this happen in Washington DC this was under color a state law or city ordinances\nCity or state officials acted in such a way so is to deny the human rights\nOf Ted Cruz and his wife Heidi and so the answer is yes if we're in a functional department of justice under Jeff Sessions\nThese things would be prosecuted for what they are which are hate crimes under color of state law and the fact is not ... not and the other thing that drives me crazy John is that the national media doesn't cover this do they as a hate crime why don't they cover it can you imagine\nLarge numbers of radical individuals taking over as intersections and a great American city like Portland, Oregon allowing only the people of color to go through and attacking white citizens'\nHow is it possible the mayor wheeler doesn't arise and say not in my city there's tape on Fox tonight of Portland police watching it going on and doing nothing about it because the mayor wheeler doesn't want anything to happen this is despicable and this is wrong it can happen in America\nIs lying is political gender to go for it or even expect the governor to step up and saying I'm going to bring up the national guard I'm gonna take my state back I'm gonna take my city back I'm not going to tolerate this maybe somebody above it needs to step fan or the federal government but we can't have America like that they have to do all this violence what\nWhat I think the mere Portland believes what he's doing is politically popular he's doing what the citizens of Portland want him to do and elected them to do it\nAnd so how is it possible that a great American city not in the south but Portland, Oregon allows in ... to take over city streets block intersections line in front of federal buildings making an impossible for federal agents to do their job\nAnd the mayor of Portland a clown effect was full name wheeler does absolutely nothing to stop it because politically it's popular to do that in Portland, Oregon\nYou know John how is that possible how do we get ourselves in

couple of lines as the host knows what's gonna happen\nAnd she was ready for the mob word right she jumped right on it and then she had a rich joined her she had her one rejoined or what we saw a mob in Charlottesville I mean honestly if if Matt had been a little less politically correct he could have easily immediately said well now which is that are you talking about the white nationalist racist mob which was a mob or the antifa mob\nWhich was also a mob I remember two mobs in Charlottesville\nBut he did not do that the way the media reports on these things though you know they all whenever there's a protest from the left or my friend Chris plants who was also a radio host national radio host\nHe uh he pointed out that uh they always report these has mostly peaceful\nIn the mostly peaceful protests it's always a a left wing protest is described as mostly peaceful in the mostly peaceful protests abducted ended up in the mostly peaceful protests on the campus of UC Berkeley in the mostly peaceful protests following the inauguration of Donald Trump in the ... if they're mostly peaceful that means there are a little bit violent right\nRight I mean that just by definition if you're mostly peaceful means you're not entirely peaceful and that means you're actually a little bit non peaceful or violent so I mean maybe Matt Louis would have said well yeah we did have that poor woman lose her life down in Charlottesville but you know the protests were mostly peaceful\nThat was mostly peaceful mob in Charlottesville but I don't think Baldwin would have taken it the right way because listen to how the conversation continue\nWhat we saw chasing right\nWhat about the people who were at the Supreme Court banging on the wall what do you call that civil protest or that a lot I think it's easily and\nYeah and if there was a party or as we call it um out for sure come on like this area\nYeah so that's married after and ham jumping in there and and by the way at this point it's a visual ripped bald and actually puts her head down because she can't respond because she didn't say she didn't think she was going to get pushed back she didn't have another rejoined the only one she had prepared was the Charlottesville sign of what a and then she goes on to say if you can play that are real fast Richard\nLet me let me let me will pass in or because I feel like that as part of the weaponization of what's happening now ah the\nN. word and the weaponization of it that's right the N. word is mob and he ... she says and she's not the only one says that Republicans people on the right Trump is weaponized saying that word\nAgainst Democrats against the law you know by calling a mob mob that's weaponized saying the word mob well she's partly right actually in a moment I'm going to actually play some audio from President Trump at a rally\nWhere he first raised this issue and uh and and she's partly right in the sense\nThe word is being weaponized in so far that it is properly describing exactly what's happening in American politics today\nAnd it's being weaponized in such a way that it is ... devastatingly effective\nAgainst the Democrats that's why CNN doesn't want the word used that's why the Washington Post doesn't want the word used that's why the next thing we know Facebook will start a silencing you if you take your own social media and start

function the way they could have done that\nBut they didn't they actually encourage it\nThey this is their base they've decided that there was more power aligning themselves with the mob right now than in condemning the mob that's how all those protesters that were in the gallery of the Senate screaming during the vote or jumping up and creating their demonstrations during the comedians they got there because members of the Senate gave\nThem tickets to get in they knew what was going to happen\nThey are accessories to the crime that we're seeing going on right now and and to make it even

Phil basic function every roles in the United states government and the executive branch politics because they still think Hillary should have one\nAnd they're trying to make life a living and health for this president they want dysfunction in the federal government so they can run in twenty twenty saying well he couldn't even run the government right\nThat's what they're trying to do\nPresident Trump nominated Jeffrey ... Clarke says the wall Street Journal editorial to run the environment and natural resources division in June twenty Seventeen\nDitto Erica dry banned for civil rights the third is an assistant Pentagon secretary who would oversee manpower and reserve affairs Democrats vow cloture on every nominee which kicks off thirty hours of debate\nEven if no senator as opposed to understand this\nBut Democrats care about the environment so Trump dominates Jeffrey bus or clerk to run the environment and natural resources division at the Justice Department in June of last year of last year\nAnd they haven't allowed it to come to the floor for a vote\nThey say that every single one of the nominees that Trump has put through remember Richard gr now the ambassador to Germany right now who people are saying should be the investors you and I would love that by the way wreck when I was a great guy\nHe was the ambassador of Germany he languish without a vote for over a year we had no ... in Germany and and once he got there\nBoy he is is ... and then into shape not just Germany he has been the the tip of the spear for the Trump Administration in on doing the uh the the free for all that happened with regard to Iran\nIn Germany and all these other businesses and banks and industry suddenly doing business with the terrorists mullahs Iran because they were functioning without Trump's man in Berlin\nThey finally get Rick right now as the ambassador after languishing for a year without a floor vote he gets there and within two months all these businesses are divested from around oh we had no idea that that's what America wanted we had no idea that's what Trump one way that's because they didn't have as a basket or there\nThat's just one example\nSo Democrats filed cloture this is a Senate rule that can be changed and should be changed I don't know why McConnell's allowing it to go on as far as he had he should have just said okay we're done with us\nWhenever a senator files cloture it means that automatically a requires thirty hours of debate not think about this there's something like I think two hundred a ... roughly two hundred nominations\nRight now there languishing for each one of them they would require thirty hours of debate they won't get anything else done they won't do anything\nAnd so so McConnell wanting to get stuff done has sort of just said okay we're not going to put those nominations through the floor votes because we can't just hold progress\nBecause of the thirty hours a foot and by the way the thirty hours of debate that is triggered with every single cloture that the Democrat forces\nThey might not even have a rational opposition they might not even have a reason why they oppose the person they just want to mock up the works they just want to slow everything to a grinding halt\n\nGoing back to the editorial here at the wall Street Journal which is brilliant they figure if they can't defeat nominees they can delay and consume valuable time Democrats have forced one hundred and Seventeen cloture votes\nVersus twelve in Iraq Obama's first two years and four in George W Bush's\nSo here we are in the first two years of the Trump presidency and Democrats have forced one hundred and Seventeen cloture votes on his nominations what are the Republicans do during Obama's first two years twelve\n\nYou don't hear about this in the media you don't hear about this on Jimmy Kimmel\n\nThe question this month is whether Senate Democrats will accept a deal to confirm more judges and nominees which allow vulnerable members to return home to campaign see see now McConnell starting to instead of just saying screw it we're done with this rule which he could do\nInstead he is now saying hey it's a nice mid term election coming up in twenty seven days be a shame if you couldn't go back to your state to campaign\n\nHey Joe mansion I Know it's it's it's not a long drive to West Virginia from DC but it'd be a real shame if I force you to sit here for all these cloture votes in the next four weeks a quarter McCaskill hey you're not looking good in the polls there in Missouri I bet you like to go there and press the flesh and\nHand out some walking around money to the voters in St Louis not going to be able to do it if you're forced here to vote on all these nominees so McConnell's playing hardball now and he said you guys want to go back we got to make a deal on these things\n\nAre let's hope Republicans extract the high price for that privilege some one day I hear it is here it is I was looking for the number earlier I was right outside it was close to two hundred\nOne hundred and Ninety eight nominations are backed up right now I'm awaiting confirmation there's no wonder can you imagine this is the defense department we're talking about this is the Pentagon there are positions and the Pentagon right now\nThat have been left unfilled nearly two years into this president's administration key positions at the Pentagon that involve national security that involve the functioning of our military\nAnd the Democrats don't care\nHundred and Ninety nominations backup awaiting confirmation according to the partnership for public service tracking the nominations range from State Department under secretary of Labor Department spots\nCharles Stimson was nominated in June twenty Seventeen

doing you still don't have a vote right now is another vote don't have a vote I don't know what's going on June is twenty Seventeen college Simpson was nominated to be the uh counsel for the department of the navy\nGeneral counsel that means the top lawyer for the for the navy\nThis is a guy who is eminently qualified he has not only cleared committee once he's cleared committee twice he
