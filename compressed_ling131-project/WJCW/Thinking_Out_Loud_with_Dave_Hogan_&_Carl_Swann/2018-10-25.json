been successful and um he was gracious enough to ... to me and ... novel and he liked it and you know\nWell let's step back a little because you have a career in law enforcement uh what decided what was your decision what was the genesis of the decision to start writing something\nI guess the seed was planted way back in the early days or a partner and I had been working the graveyard shift and we'd had several interesting calls throughout the night and uh uh well after one of those particular calls we took a breath and slowed down and he you know one day we should write a book\nNow ah yeah and you took him up on it the ... eventually yeah oh yeah so um did you just sort of go in cold had you've written things before where does one begin with a a budding author\nI had not to I did I didn't have any kind of the history yeah with with riding on really what I Would I put down on paper was to collaborate just a\nIs just such a fickle thing into such a long shot to to get a pilot made and have a production company a take it on and then you've got to go to the studios and you've got to sell it to the studio and they have to finance\nIt and it's a it's a huge job process and then we've been through it three times I thought this past one that\nFacility series was going to get made into a TV series and it fell through at the end but you know what what happens\nOn something that

nothing to do with the book right by the end it he had to sit there and watch that\nYeah well I tell you sell your soul to them yeah you know once you once they pay you for the rights they can do whatever they you lose all control they started to contract right is while it is\nAnd the adaptations that I've seen actually uh that they've done and tried to sell to studios\nI've thought if you left it alone so that oh yeah I don't leave it alone leave it like it is don't set it in Memphis and said here don't do this to this character that just leave it alone it's been successful the way it is but\nFalls on deaf ears they can yeah they can't get an amateur mess with it\nWill mark a don't let that be a a damp a damper on your your desires to go ahead and continue to ride I Know it's not
