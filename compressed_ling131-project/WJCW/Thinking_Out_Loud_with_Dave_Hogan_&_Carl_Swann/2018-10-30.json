chili this morning So Liz unlike me or you might want to grab\nA jacket as you head out I I did not wear a jacket I just for this fleets top that I've got on that and that was 'cause it's gonna be in the sixties day's gonna be a nice day yeah next couple of days can be really\nWarm yeah over Seventy tomorrow yeah for Halloween yeah\nAh speaking of Halloween it's a haunted refrigerator night later on tonight and what they say about that is there are things that are are haunting in your refrigerator that relapse you need to get rid of okay like moldy food yes and so that's\nWhy it's haunted refrigerator night ah and um my question to you is how do you typically leave things in the refrigerator until it just kind of becomes a science experiment or do\nI have another I have been known to do that yes you know but ah since my mom moved in with me almost three years ago does not happen nearly as often as what it did before because she tends to say ... throw that out that's what I was going to speculate yeah\nWith your mom with you I'm sure yeah things like that don't happen as much as they could sell her house um but yeah I I don't think very much and you know you'd have to know my wife to know how this is she is a and I tell people she's\nThere's people that are clean and she's not a you know OCD as far as a ... to the extreme you know even though I call you ever seen the show month the ... yeah uh I call her Mrs among some time oh yeah as you mentioned that yeah or but she is and I tell people to use military clean\nAnd what that means is she is uh to the point to where the really she should have been in the military when it comes to her a attention to order and cleanliness and neatness and all that and so as you can imagine not much has a chance to develop any science experiment in our refrigerator\nSo I don't think we have a haunted refrigerator a right now I Would almost bet you one hundred percent but they say tonight is the night to take care of them haunted refrigerator night\nYou know when you say military clean 'em\nReminds me of a story and my son used to tell me\nA who's in the marine corps mhm when he was at a stationed in cherry point he was an instructor there\nBut the classes I forget how many weeks they ran I think I Want to say like twelve Thirteen weeks [noise] and when he was at the tail end of his duty there it didn't make sense for them to assign him a class to teach because he wasn't going to be there long enough to teach the entire session and so what he was in charge of was inspecting barracks\nMhm the ah the rooms that they stayed in\n... he used to it was funny because he would go in and check things\nAnd you know everything had to be there was a set guidelines for how things had to be and if you did not pass ... you had to redo it and then he would come back and I forget what privileges you lost if you if you didn't pass inspection\nMhm well the ... the thing was was they would come and he'd go in and he'd fail a month something\nAnd so they would fix that\nBut then not have something else you know something else that was okay when he went in the first time they would think that okay well he's just going to come back and check what I failed on last time and he would go in\nAnd he may or may not even look at it he'll look at something else and failing because they let something else slack and so it was just it was just funny [noise] and um\nWhen he left he had he had made this comment because he was known as a particularly difficult inspector yeah and um\nSo when he left a it's a it's kind of a a a thing in the marine corps when you leave an assignment guys to work with give you a a little placards something yeah some cute things on it yeah and what they did on his was they said it was his comment that he used to say\nI don't fail the students the students failed themselves [laughter] that sounds pretty tough yeah but it was funny because he said you know I'd go back in and whatever I had failed him on before they'd have fixed but then there'd be something else it'd be like\nReally [laughter] you don't think I'm going to ... you think I'm just going to come in and look at what you failed on no I'm going to come in and I'm gonna check the whole thing yeah\n[laughter] so but it was just funny\n[noise] and he was a yeah he was a he is not the type that likes to sit around yeah there were guys I'm that he had had it at different places and then when he went back to the to the fleet at new river and they have these cubicles that they work in\nThey call they're called bans but they're just portable boxes that they work in right and they were they are parked on the base are called the van pad and well empty van pads if they didn't have work to do he had him up their scrubbing the van pads and so he was not\nReal popular among some of the men because he would make them work instead of sitting around twiddling their thumbs yeah imagine that [laughter] [noise]\nAll right so a today is also national candy corn day oh let me some candy corn you know I never cared for that much really but the interesting thing is if you take candy corn like if you buy a bag of it and you stack it in a certain way in a cylinder performing vertically you can form a corn cob\nAnd I I actually saw a picture of that and I'm Out here's my question yeah\nHave you ever tried to stack candy corn no yeah it how you tell me how somebody's going to get the candy corn to stack up and stay like that\nUm without blowing it together yeah something some type of it he said you'd probably have to have because I'm not gonna work yeah you'd have to have some gay and just is not going to work because yeah\nYeah it's not going to work you know not back\nIn the day when years ago when I trigger treated about five years ago or ... three [laughter] you know back in the day I'm you know we used to go all over ... people just trick or treating has changed so much of course\nUh with society the way it is today\nAnd security and safety and everything but uh years ago you know we'd get a we'd get pillow cases full of candy mhm I mean just incredible ... go all over the place like within two mile radius of the neighborhood I mean it's just incredible\nAnd I would have candy leftover you know on up into a winter and spring from Halloween and the candy that was a one of the candy that was always leftover was candy corn I mean you could find candy corn that I hadn't eaten\nProbably scattered around under the couch and all that all those kinds of places I just\nNever cared for the candy corn very much it was just too sweet or something for me\nThere was actually some a bowl with some candy left in it from our trunk or treat a Sunday at church and there was some candy corn and I grabbed me a pack and double that don't look but I've got a little out of your pick me up yeah I got I was gonna say gotta sugar rushed before going and listen to the pastor sorry

morning guy drills and thanks for joining us here\nWell it's great to be here and thanks for giving me a chance to chat with your listeners well glad\nTo do it here too we we like to get the individuals in the issues out before the public in key races and uh you of course have declared for the uh the congressional seat in the first district why did you do that\nWell I'm a physician and health care was the reason that I decided that I should take the plunge and when I look at the patients I take care of and the citizens in the district we have some of the poorest health care in America here\nAnd win back over a year ago the Republican Congress just voted to repeal but not replace the Affordable CARE Act I knew the sixty thousand East Tennessee and lose their insurance and these are people I take care of\nThese are people that get up in the morning can't go to work because they've got a disease it causes them but it's a treatable disease but they don't have insurance 'cause they don't have a job there in that vicious cycle and the thought of sixty thousand more of my neighbors being throwing the vicious cycle to me was\nJust offensive and I thought I should stand them say that that was wrong if you were elected to what would you go to Congress saying\nI Would say that we can be more efficient with our health care dollars we can take care of more patients and we can cut some waste to and we can do a much better job with the money we already have for example the pharmaceutical industry\nThe average cost of medication in our region is and the United states is a whole was three times what it is in the United kingdom there's just no reason for us to pay three times as much for a medication as they pay in England\nAnd so they're they're ... and one can fix that but you just have to have the will to fix it\nOkay would ah one thing that has been obviously very much for front healthcare number one issue in the country Medicaid expansion when it's not a real about that when I ask you as well to what ... what do you think about where it is and where it could go\nSo Medicaid expansion is more of a state issue but of course have an opinion and the the state legislature could decide to accept\nA hundreds of millions of dollars actually it's ... it's a few billion and they've decided not to do that so what that means is that your taxpayer dollars and years to him at mine they're going to Maryland and Virginia and Kentucky to help them with their health care expenses\nWhereas our patients don't have that to me when we think of the problems we face only think of the hospital closures we just had a hospital closure in our district last week\nI mean these are things that could be protected if we would accept those Medicaid dollars\nAnd uh the hospitals have even stepped him said let us help with that a bit of the Tennessee a commitment to that but that was turned down so to me it's it's wasteful for patients but it's wasteful for communities because it's forcing hospital closures is forcing good jobs to leave it's affecting the health care of the citizens even that have good insurance\nThing out right now is Dr Marty Olsen candidate for first congressional district seat opioid problem nationwide problem uh it's been called an epidemic and worse what would you do about\nThat I'd like to point out is five times as bad here is nine states as a whole I take care of pregnant women who are addicted to opioids myself and so it by when I say five times is because we have five times as many babies per capita born in this area ... compared to the rest of the United states\nAnd I have worked with these patients to cut their doses so that their babies are born addicted and we've had success with my patients have taught me is that we can have success in this\nAnd the epidemic is growing the epidemic is getting worse the epidemic also causes a problem for our economy\nIf you look at our economy you find that uh people are not willing to move their businesses here they're afraid they can't get enough employees that will pass drug screen if you look at our schools we are now finding that children the first and second grade that survived\nDrug withdrawal is newborns enough studying in school this is just that we have an eighty year problem we have to address now and yet we're watching it get worse\nSo this is an why would I Would like to criticize my opponent I think he's had ten years to work on and he's now getting started but yeah it's been getting worse for ten years I think he's failed to take steps to rein in the large number of first opioids the second Suboxone is on the streets that\nUh if we would a diminished the number of prescription medications that people are getting addicted to first we can stop digging this they hold of opioid addiction that we're in what would you advocate for treatment\nAll for treatment we have to get a system where patients can access so in our community let's imagine that your family member decides that ah they're tired of getting up every morning and saying where am I going to get my ...
