a wide range of products China\nBut try comes we'll cut import tariffs on textile products and medals including the new products\nTo aid for like eight point four percent down from eleven and a half percent effective November first according to the ... finance ministry yesterday the checkouts have pledged\nSteps to increase imports that means products from us\nThis year amid rising tension with those some of its biggest trading partners such as the United states bottom line Trump said he was going to do X Y and Z and a B and C in trade and if we started ab and see I think he's pretty much closing in on see\nHe has rebuilt the economy he has created new jobs is economic policies have uh the elimination of onerous regulations which is an ongoing thing continues to show vast benefits\nFor Amri ordinary American who makes this country work and it's something he said could be done to only he could do and in fact he was the only one I thought it was necessary to do\nAnd it's now done here is the president\nToday at the White House Rose Garden we have three ...\nI have long contended that NAFTA was perhaps the worst trade deal ever made since NAFTA's adoption the United states racked up trade deficits totaling more than two trillion dollars and it's a much higher number then that\nWith Canada and Mexico and lost vast amounts of money at the last four point one million manufacturing jobs and one in four or do jobs lost about twenty five percent of our order jobs even more than the\nThroughout the campaign I promise to renegotiate NAFTA and today we have kept that promise\nFor the last half hour the pres maybe even longer\nThan maybe forty five minutes or an extended statement\nOnly recently started taking questions for the Trump is doing here which is something that I Belong advocated he wasn't just announcing that\nDeal got done he was teaching why it was important including the drive by media who for the most part are clueless uh don't understand capitalism a think that it's a big bad\nMimi and Trump is taking the occasion of all this attention to actually explain how trade works and how the United states has been victimized over the course of a many many years because of\nAmerican leadership believing well you know where the super power in the world where the richest we can afford to take it in the short now and then it promotes good relations with our allies\nAnd Trump stood up and said there's no reason we should have our back pockets picket\nThere's no reason that we should just let people have what ever they want from our treasury there's no reason we should feel guilty about being powerful and wealthy that doesn't mean because we are so much wealthier and powerful that those who are not\nHave ... on what we produce those days are over that way of thinking is over\nAnd he went through the whole process and explaining how trained works why it is important how the United states was getting the shaft\nBut more importantly why it matters to ordinary everyday people and their jobs and their careers\nIncluding farmers and a number of other people about whom Washington thinks\nNot very off and thanks very little it's been a masterful performance there is no question that Trump not only knows what he's talking about he is the architect of what he's talking about\nAnd he got to run the rings around people in this in discussing the process and in discussing this substance\nAnd the details of this new agreement just it puts anybody else it's ever tried this to shame everybody that has a chance to listen to this is going to understand exactly why it was important what happened why it happened and why we benefit and why that is good\nAnd you know teaching as well as announcing is fundamental I Believe that's why the Republican Congress Nineteen Ninety four actually\nSquandered its majority after a while it's because they stopped teaching what they were doing and why as they did it\nMade the fatal mistake and believing that the Republican victory in Nineteen Ninety four men somehow that the majority of the country and overnight turned conservative and so when they began to announce this caught that cut this reform that reform a lot of people didn't know what they were talking I got scared to death\nAt lesson hasn't been learned by none other than a dozen oldest Trump here's the next bite Trump saying it is a privilege to trade with\nUs [noise] [noise] it's kind of thinking we haven't seen we've seen thinking\nBut both parties who who believe that that it's up to us\nA ... or in the\nRespect of authors it's up to us to show them that we don't intend them any harm it's up to us and Trump is turning this a hundred and eighty degrees around so it's a privilege to trade with us we're the world economy\nWhere the future of the world economy where the future of world freedom and liberty to the days of the America as the world's piggy bank are\nOver steel will also imposes new standards requiring at least Seventy five percent of every automobile to be made in North America in order to qualify for the privilege of free access to our markets it's a privilege for them to do business with us\nAnd I'm not talking about Mexico ... I'm Talking about everybody everybody\nIt's a privilege for China\nTo do business with us it's a privilege for the European Union who is treated us very badly but that's coming along\nTo do business with U.S Japan every country it's a privilege for them to come in and attack the piggy bank\nYeah it's a privilege to come in now and I as I say if folks it's it's a new way of seeing ourselves and our country without the need to make excuses without the need to apologize we really we really happened is you know\nYou can see evidence and scientists on our own culture of the achieved any accomplished somehow feel the need to apologize\nFor it or to downplay it\nAs some sort of new definition of humility rather than having used as a teachable moment there's something inspiring\nIs this Trump points out we want every country making that country great we want to every country putting our country first we want everybody doing it that way that's the whole point for everybody\nTo do better but not by piggy banking the United states by doing it on their own these kinds of things are just they're they're far in the United nations types diplomatic types here's the final bite\nA don't don't forget who told you this was not possible do not forget\nIt was barrage Hussein ... who said none of this could be done\nIf you remember the previous administration said we're not going to have manufacturing jobs anymore essentially we're not going to have we're not going to make things anymore no\nJust the opposite going to be a manufacturing powerhouse that allow us to reclaim a supply chain that has been off shored to the world because of ... fair trade issues\nSo there you have it it's um it's\nNot a sexy subject NAFTA never was I mean it was in the command that a lot of

tonight on NAFTA trade deal and not going to have a lot of\nPeople tune in it's just the way of the world so Trump is making sure with this extended event in the rose garden of the day that people get it's important in terms of its important says that election issue it's crucial\nIt is um I wouldn't say crucial but it's it's very important in terms of Trump being able to say to his voters stick with me\nI told you I was going to do this I told you it can be done and I told you the United states was going to come out as the champion ... in the subject of World Trade don't doubt me and in that sense it's a confidence inspiring that Trump left alone\nIn the oval office free and clear it to be who he is will me in a bunch of great things happening for the country and this can be part of lead in to any number of campaign ads\nFor the upcoming their terms because it's going to be about a lot of things not just the Kavanaugh nomination and other things that this is going to be a fundamental

get to your calls in due course a written to wait two to eight eight to [noise]\nSo the president continues to take questions in the rose garden from Dr by me I Would jump at but the things I Want to get to hear\nA and I can just as easily relate what the president said he just laying the Democrats out he was laying them out for the lying trickster present skunks that they are he is linking the media to the Democrat Party\nWhich uh\nWe do with all the time I hear but uh you don't really hear the president um make it that direct ... is\nHe has just if Mr rated the credibility of all of these accusing Democrats or Cory Spartacus Booker to Richard Blumenthal the NIH and find that uh what are you there was Feinstein if you'll recall\nToward the tail end of the hearing on friday before the vote came\nSomebody raised the question of how the world that Christine ... forge a letter to Dianne Feinstein week\nBecause it was it ... we are made to understand that the letter said that she didn't want anybody to know her name and that she didn't want to come forward yet the woman had written in the Washington\nPost she called the Washington Post tip line the New York times she has an op ed published in the Washington Post but all along we're told she don't want to go public\n\nSo people were trying to claim you know for all this talk about what Kevin O's none of this for a woman it's the Democrat Party and the Democrats on this committee that have taught her for a busy you most a note ringer\nIt's so unfair it's sort of spotlight and it\nBecame obvious that there could be only three sources for the week because of limited possession of low water one would be Senator Feinstein and or her staff\nThe other would have to be somebody in the media or the lawyers for Christine Blasey Ford who had seen the letter\nAnd so some senators began to say that it could well be Senator Feinstein and she sat there and filmed while this was happening and as all the other possibilities were mentioned she eventually asked for point of order the German Grassley\nAnd and said a German restaurant I ... I Need to react I Need to respond to this outrageous allegations that I or my staff have lead\nThis letter or just for the record I just asked my staff I just asked my staff at any of that Lisa and they have a short me that they didn't\n\nBut what we saw when she was she turned around to her staff sitting behind her and she starts now that we can't her what she said 'cause it's off Mike but she's obviously asking them\nDid anybody here to leak it she turns or did you did you look at ...\nShe turns back to the camera wait a minute like this is a German we didn't Lincoln and Trump made fun of this and mocked it in his West Virginia appearance on Saturday Night by say\nIt's how we're going to determine who leaked something she gets to turn to her staff and asked them and they deny it and back yet meanwhile Kavanaugh sits over here and has to undergo his seventh FBI background check\nHis accuser has no corroboration and no evidence and he's presumed to have done it\nAnd Dianne Feinstein guess will turn around and ask her staff hey did any of your latest letter and they form nor nor was it was all does she turns back around so we we didn't do it with German as though case closed it wasn't us they had to have done it it was strategic\nJust like what happened on friday was to teach strategic\nLadies and gentlemen I became aware yesterday\nOf a transcript of a conference call\nThat have occurred last week among and between Democrats activists who were planning exactly what happened on friday it's laid out in this thing now unfortunately I Can't\nReproduce this and put it at Rush Limbaugh dot com because I don't legally habit but I've got it\nI'm not going to mention any names but the names of the Democratic front groups in organizations are here and the strategies that they use and it makes\nIt crystal clear that they were going to target Jeff Flake\nThat he was seen as the most malleable and the easiest to intimidate the elevator\nIncident where it just happened\nThat to nearly insane anti Kavanaugh pro democratic activists ended up there in flakes elevator with us CNN camera right there to catch what happened and they started shouting and they started accusing and they started pointing fingers he got scared to death\nIt was all part of the strategy to turn him\nAnd it was there was there was a three point strategies a flake strategy was number three if the other two had bombed out\nAnd they made it they pulled it off they did it\nJohn Fund has a piece today at National Review who was behind the flake set up\nAcorns tactics live on in the senators elevator confrontation with activists from a George Soros backed group on friday morning two women raced past reporters and security officers and block the senators on the elevator and the capital\nThey cornered Jeff Flake who adjusted announced he was going to vote yes this is in the morning is before the hearing began it was on his way to the hearing\n\nThey cornered flake who adjusted announced that the Republican caucus he was going to vote yes on Kavanaugh\nOut of the committee and onto the Senate floor full debate the women would not let lake leave the elevator until

seriously affect the term\nI was curious to hear if you think this Kavanaugh's nomination that's gone sour is that incident\nWell could be I mean the but the point was uh I didn't have anything specific in mind it's just that we get a poll in June her opponent mayor even July and it tells us what the\nPublic is thinking of doing and the November elections in my point was this is silly this poll doesn't mean anything there's anybody remember the pole in July of two thousand sixteen or in August that doesn't mean anything because it's not when the election is and I said the ... the events are going to shape the midterms haven't happened yet I said that in July\nAugust September a and this is exactly the kind of thing I had in mind but there's going to be something beyond this oh

confirmed a than\nWhat a democratic voters going to do they get us going to be really rage didn't show up and vote are they going to be mad depressed and stuff\nWho knows but this thing is going to get rid if this if this is not resolved before the election and it's a defeat anyway because all the Democrats won ears delayed delayed delayed\nBy my only point was that those polls in the summer are

choices tape resumes\nThat much ... stops at at the halfway point anybody want to change their bed anybody want to double down players go into gear making their beds half the final turned ballot checked stops the tape of horse race again asks the players if they want to make an additional ... or get out of ones they've made\nLayers do what they do that much jak resumes taped to the finish line makes the point it didn't matter at any point in this race when I stopped the tape there is no way\nAnybody could have known after first turn at the halfway point or at the final turn who is going to when you look what you were doing you were making ... guessing somebody you're probably were certain the bottom line\nIs finish you never know\nBefore it's over who's going to win no matter what any kind of expert tells you\nIt was a motivational technique designed to get the players to realize first quarter half time or third quarter\nThem to do your job\nSame thing here posing January\nIn front of a November election doesn't mean anything polls in June July don't mean anything\nInteresting for the media which is trying to shape public opinion with these polls but at the polls do not give any indication the final outcome appalled in July or August would not a contained any of the Kavanaugh\nNews so how relevant could have been answered none zilch zero not up\nAnd so now here we are on October second CNN is panicking\nRacist or type thing in the house this wasn't supposed to happen why they had all their pre election polls they had the generic ballot they've had this in in in the in the can it's been in the bank since last December in their minds it's been over it's just a matter of letting account of lay out now all of a sudden\nHouse races tightening and there could be a blue wave in the Senate red wave red wave and the Republicans could come out I didn't know where\nAt about fine old her in and take over\nWell\nWe don't know if the Republicans were ever really far behind we don't want anything because there wasn't a vote back in December or January or July or August we don't know anything\nAnd we don't know anything now and we won't know anything until the day after election day or maybe later that night now one of the brief observation here\nOnce again do you notice Mr engines knock it and\n\nI think you know there's a lot of talk Brett Kavanaugh this whole confirmation messed that in fact might hurt Republicans it doesn't seem to be so\nLadies and gentlemen high and the reason he's saying this and everybody else because of my viral prediction of last week that if the Republicans don't confirm Kavanaugh as the Democrats are going to win everything that production\nOf mine went viral as Dr buys loved it they love it when the leader of the G O P and their minds me starts ripping the Republicans when I started predicting Louis that's when I become totally credible that's when they run with sound bites me predicting and all over the world\n\nYou notice how easy it would be to trick them\nThey run with that and they right now all of a sudden it's just the exact opposite\n\nHe's just the exact opposite why all this attention on Capitol on what the Republican is actually going to help on how can that they live on just said they were going to lose\nThey are totally totally confused\nAnd as I said yesterday what what what is the sense in saying that we have to lose in order to win and the people that will lead Kevin I'll go down that are really find them up that will fire buddy up no\nThe way you get on the bandwagon the way you get people on the bandwagon the way you get people wanting to be on your team is when\nIncluding winning the capital nomination now let's go to further news buttresses some of this from the hill dot com ran state Democrats face nightmare scenario on cabinet this article shows\nBeyond doubt that Democrats are brought up all of these unfounded sexual allegations announce

along and without having Rachel Mitchell ask her some questions which turned out to be brilliant but at the time\nWe were all kind of curious what what the purpose was um all Trump is still\nIs reminding everybody what she said she doesn't she doesn't know the people she says we're there say they weren't there [noise]\nThis is not mocking her and this is a sign of what really goes wrong in

depending on the day she's telling it whatever it is is it is not mocking\nKristin balls the Ford now\nTrump has a lot of people saying but this is crazy rush because last week Trump was saying that she was credible and her testimony was compelling\nI have explained this before and I'm going to explain it again Trump all ways eventually will tell you what he really thinks about anything and he may not do that out of the batter's box\nI have a name for this I call it pacing\nTrump woman necessarily go out with a general opinion like on gun control after a shooting or the dreamers or in this case Dr ... for your caller credible testimony compelling and he'll even go so far to say that yeah if if she's telling the truth yeah they're my nomination might be in trouble yeah I'll agree with that\nThat\nGives him credibility it makes people kind of cock their head and they don't think Trump can be that's fair I'm Talking about the media and the left Democrats they don't think Trump can be that that a reasonable\nBut he does it to them every time it gives them the credibility later\nTo be critical and to step away he said yeah I found a credible I've found are compelling then as we learn more and then there's events play out Trump is able to parlay his original statements into what he really thinks based on\nWhat is not a knee jerk reaction if Trump were to heaven sent initially when he said last night at the rally why there would have been held up pay but now he can back it up now there's all kinds of evidence that her timeline doesn't make any sense\nWe've got an ex boyfriend claiming she is a polygraph expert and has taught people how to beat them\nWe have people challenging her account we didn't have that last week it is perfectly fine for Trump to do what he did\nIt gives him a credibility later to be critical of the stuff away it's a common technique you use as he does it on everything\nIt's why I've always told you don't take his first draft statement or his first tweet as a sign that he's caving or flipping you people you I'm sure you remember there haven't been many instances in fact I may have fallen for one myself that's how I learned that Trump\nWill tweet something or say something it'll make you look like he's about late ... before he pulled out above the Paris climate accord\nWhat did he say\nClimate change a very serious thing to do with looking at it than we are looking at it than moving to the rights\nOh so he's on record as being open about that later on when he's learned when he needs to learn comes out tells you what do you think's\nReally thinks it's a pattern it's a technique if they trumped developed I don't even know if he developed or it's just how he does it naturally and instinctively\nBut I call it pacing now

what really irritates ... he gets away with it I cannot tell you\nHow ... irritates them see he shouldn't have survived the Access Hollywood video he shouldn't have survived anything they've thrown at him the fact that he has an just continue to prosper and triumph I cannot tell you how blindly insane it has made the with rage other Republicans have not developed the golden adds to do this\nAnd

written bed is actually what they're looking for and they don't just want revenge against who ever did whatever to them they are now demanding that every representative of the group that ... or the individual that did something can be made to pay a price for it\nThat's what the ... this this uh ... well\nThe me too movement in large part was never bipartisan it was thought to be said to be but it never was\nA and even if it if you okay even if it was it's been co opted by the Democrat Party look at look at the uh\n[noise] Occupy Wall street move but look at black lives matter I take take any left wing group that you want it's made up of people who for some reason I think they have been unjustly mistreated by somebody\nAnd instead of dealing with that in their lives they enter politics and they demand that the Democratic party take up their cause of the Democratic party willingly has the Democratic party has become the party\nOf all of these disparate constituency groups\nWith their singular causes because the Democratic party realizes that they can combine all of these things into a singular assault on the concept of America that America is responsible for what happened to these people\nThey capitalism is responsible that the power structure that the founding is responsible\nAnd so people with psychological disorders are being granted the status of normalcy\nAnd then the big donors come along and under write them and fund their efforts and they become political movements\nAnd then they become victims and then of course allows them to blame everybody for what has gone wrong in their lives and then they demand reciprocity or revenge or what have you and I can tend to view that most people in our side have no idea how to deal\nWith this no idea whatsoever so we ended up and debates about weather [laughter] [noise] ... boys I Want to pretend to be girl so they can go on the girls' bathrooms and becomes legitimate [laughter] that's sick\nIt ... it in in many it's not that specifically but just the whole concept of what is happening here and it is a violent bullying intimidating\nMovement\nHas been constructed to push all of these disparate various agendas\nAnd the target is America the target is America is founded the target is\nAmerican Capitalism and so when our caller says that Kavanaugh is simply a stand in for men who have abused every woman out there he's right balls\nFord will end up being supported by other women who have been abused whether she's telling the truth or not it doesn't matter\nBecause it didn't happen to them these women we do know that are out there watching this didn't happen to them and by God somebody's going to pay for it in this case I mean capital that's how they're going to be heard\nRather than just deal with the specific incident that happened to them it's the same thing I think with\nBlack lives matter or the NFL players kneeling for the anthem a all cops are bad every white copies of rape every black convict is in is\nIn every instance here points to the country at large as being responsible in unfairness in biased in discrimination it racism all of this\nThe Democratic party is the organizing party the collection agency for all of\nThese complaints\nDemocrat Party he's happy to make victims out of anybody who wants to be one and Democrat Party is happy to promise these people then they'll fix it and they never do they never the rage and the anger never end if only gets worse because the Democrats don't fix anything and finally\nIt doesn't even depend on being fixed it just means somebody's got to pay in this case capital he's got to pay\nWhether he did it or not\nNow Sarah Sanders White House press briefing is going on and she just lay the end of the press and\nShe said exactly what I said if I don't mind saying so she said Trump didn't mock anybody last night he simply recites did the facts\nAnd he said all of this can be laid at the feet of the Democrats they are to blame for this none of this needed to have happened in public they had Woolsey forge email or in a letter ... way back in July they could have done everything that's been done to investigate her claim [noise]\nOff record behind the scenes nobody knowing about it but they didn't do that they waited to use it as a Hail Mary [noise]\n\nShe dispute the idea that Trump mocks she said all he was doing was reciting the facts here it is again this is what the press the media everybody is out now ripping Trump claiming that he mocked Christine ...\nHow did you get home I don't remember how you get there I don't remember where is the place I don't remember how many years you don't want I don't\nKnow [noise] what\nWas it and I don't know why don't I don't know what I mean that's the only thing are in [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Thinking Out Loud with Dave Hogan & Carl Swann", "city": "Johnson City", "day": "06"}
