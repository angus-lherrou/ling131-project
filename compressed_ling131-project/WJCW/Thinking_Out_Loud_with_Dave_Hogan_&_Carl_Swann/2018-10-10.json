you know I told Jay Saturday\nWhen you looked at when you looked at a at\nWhere the program was last year\n... um because they really really I think in a lot of people's minds under performed last year mhm for where they were at and I think the expectations were for this year had they been where they X or expect to be last year I think the expectations would have been high this year\nBut considering how far you know the fact that they they back slid a little bit last year and to come in and be five in one at this stage of the year I think is incredible yeah um you know who knows where they're going to end up but it's certainly a it's certainly been a very good season so far this year\nVery good yeah I'm proud of him [noise] so uh we'll see they'll play the ... the Saturday yep on the road and down in Charleston South Carolina well here's a I ran\nAcross this yesterday Don I thought this was very interesting um\n[noise] you know certain characteristics about certain animals are are folks ever curious about what chickens can see\nChickens have a three hundred degree field of vision really three hundred degrees that's almost completely around yeah uh giving so if you get in the chickens blind spot you're really doing something they're\nUh giving them a very wide field of view for detecting predators this type of vision is known as ... knock dealer vision seeing with one eye of the time\nWhen you have ... one eye at a time you know\nA chickens field of vision never overlaps because his eyes are located on opposite sides of its head which means more area is visible to the eye but with limited depth perception\nBy contrast hawks and owls have by macular vision allowing them to have better depth perception for catching pray but a smaller\nField of view ... in an interesting have you know they're all birds mhm but some have him on the size of their heads like chickens mhm and some on the front like ALS and hawks and so forth\nSo I thought that was very interesting it is and that was never really\nThought about I hadn't thought about it either and and if chickens can only look through one eye at a time mhm I you know I\nDo have a three hundred degree of vision with one eye because if they're looking out the right I could you walk up on the left side and I'm not ...\nWell they probably are just very quickly I Would imagine and they switch over to their left I back and forth type thing yeah sure sure yeah enlightening quickness yeah imagine I liked that lightning lightning like quit quickness um I was watching the show yesterday was talking about some sharks\nAnd uh the hammer had shark it was talking about yeah and it has a three hundred and sixty degree field division\nYeah with the way we're at size ... get it that makes sense all the way around can sneak up on one of those guys\nYeah I don't know that I'm going to try to sneak up on a hammer had shark anytime soon [laughter]\nI don't think I'm going to try to sneak up on any shark anytime soon\nI just you know the animal kingdom sometimes fascinating and\nThose hammer head sharks the way their heads are shaped of course like hence the hammer mhm and ah you know it's just incredible some of this stuff just absolutely incredible if you start looking at a lot of uh\nUh the animal kingdom but I don't know I ran across that I thought that was interesting I've never really I hadn't lost sleep over wondering about how much a chicken can see her and I'm like that\nI hadn't counted the chickens before they were hatched or anything like that but it is a very interesting to think about that [noise] so next time you see a chicken and we do have some around here roaming around a in this building ... or wherever it could be I don't know [laughter] I don't think I've seen one lately\nUh now we did spot some dear\nThe other morning uh down here in the field next to the transmitters are three towers oh ... yeah I've seen those on an ... yeah there was some deer down and by the way a quick note about deer or we are in if we're not into it I think we're heading into reading seasons yeah\nAnd I saw one standing outside and it was a book manning up beside the road didn't have that many points I think it was a young buck mhm but ah it was developing its points and yeah\nAnd that was just standing there majestic Lee beside the road and you know I didn't see it till I was pretty close to it and not as quickly looked at it this was yesterday morning I think and I said please don't run across the road with music by yeah\nSo they're more active yeah as if they weren't active enough I seem to see 'em all the time but you're going to probably see more so just be careful\nDriving saw three yesterday three that I've known him this morning right on Mountain View road to err on the in the ditch on the right side the other one was next to a fence line and the left side or\nLet's say I think it's called alpine villages or something like that the apartment complex and behind the white fence ... and I saw the two in the ditch and so I slowed way down almost to a crawl in there looking at me like what are you looking at ... and then I just happen to see something move on the left side and there it was because there's about\nEight foot grass strip there and you know there was another one over there and yeah\nI'm like just crawling through there and they don't mind me I'm just kind of sneaking through and when you don't decide doubled him\nAnd got through there and drove on sometimes I look at you like what are you looking at ... past the vehicle going the other way a little bit up the road and they flash their lights at me so I figured that there was some deer sitting up there yeah because I Do the same thing when there's when I see deer especially yeah I'll out in the daylight when you don't expect them to be there\nYeah especially you know before a daylight if you're driving right now yeah\nIf you're out there about before it gets daylight now
