for pet owners good morning doctor dean good morning all and all all and all okay you sound like a carpenter\nMoving on [laughter] I'm Glad you rival move on yes indeed you were not able to join us last week in person so I found another of the uh\nReplays from the vault of treasured Bayard and it was for him about a year ago and it was indeed relating to what we were talking to the week before so that worked out very well what do you have for us this morning here\nWell since Bob started everything out on a real positive no [laughter] I didn't hear that okay I'm\nI'm going to follow suit or I don't talk about this very often but I think maybe I should say okay\nBecause it just happens with my family one of our pets and that's about\nEuthanasia um yes mhm maybe we intentionally don't talk about that now in in my in my situation where we have to do it on a regular\nBasis um you got to figure out a way to work with it or not\nWhen move onto the next one I guess is ... ... yeah I Know yeah all those pets that will you know we spent\nA lot of time with as a\nProfessional no not as a family member and all those pets owners we know very well and have a pretty close relationship with it's sometimes difficult votes I guess it's frequently difficult a whole lot more accurate mhm\nBut as a veterinarian you have to figure out a way to deal with it and move on now I'll take a brief break in turn will get Bob and say that might have something to do what you recover and\nWe I think it had the article said it was because a lot of times you face dilemma is that you have a pet owner that has brings a pet in and there's obviously there's something wrong with the pet it can be taken care of the owner says oh I don't want to do that I Can't pay for that I don't want to do it just go ahead and euthanized ...\nWell we didn't have that yeah no I wasn't really what I was referring to obviously when I began well yeah well I'm always say that too yeah but\nI was saying early on used to be that dentistry was considered one of the professions that was most prone suicides because of the stress involved and the you know facing people people always go to death three things are going to be hurt you know this type of thing\nBut now it's it's said veterinarians because of the stress\nOf there's so many animals in people owning animals and some people like their animals and some people are ready to get rid of their animals and it can be a very stressful thing especially when you've developed\nA professional relationship with seeing an animal year after year after year and then having something you see that animal age and so forth and it it can be a very stressful situation\nYes I agree and and uh before you even told me that there are there has been a lot of conversation within the veterinary profession about suicide actually mhm I'm On\nOffer these very reasons cited general those are some of the ... yeah yeah\nI'm there are a lot of reasons of ... um but that's that's part of it the situation with euthanasia is Israel complicated because Bob Said something that's very accurate which is sometimes you sleep pets that have serious problems that were euthanized just because the owner is unable or unwilling to\nGo into the financial responsibilities or do it and well that's a little bit stressful on everybody and\nI think it's more frequent that we're in a situation where we're using those animals because the animal has a a non survivable problem\nOr the more common situation is that the animal is able to survive but because of whatever problem or problems I have him because of their age there's a real serious problem with quality of life yeah that's the most common scenario ... um [noise] well\nThat's a little bit difficult because\nIn those cases it's not a situation where if you don't euthanize an animal of a certain time\nThen they're going to be dead within a few days or a week or something that's actually probably quite the opposite of what the situation and sometimes the stressful part for the people that are with that is that\nThey're going to continue to be in that kind of situation for an indefinite period of time yeah yeah and it's really difficult on on all the parties mhm including the pay of course but also the people that are sitting there taking care of it and living with it every day\nAnd the the job of the the task I see and I think most of us see the ... is\nI'm responsible for his helping the people that are staying with a pet and go through the decision process of deciding whether it's appropriate to even though I was an animal because of the problem with quality of off now that's very stressful on the on the family members um I don't know how the\n[noise] [noise]\nIt is eight thirty one good
