and just a few moments we will hear from\nMr dentist Willingham himself with precision to an auto care and uh of course you have ... tips as he always does in this time of year he's talking about fall driving\nYeah you know because they're ... as we learning this morning there's a light bit of rain on the road so they can make it kind of a slippery and need to be able to uh\nTake care of that and make sure your tires have the proper trade also make sure that the brakes are working well because even if you have good tires but the brakes locked up or something and you're going to be in a mess if you hit a punting area or of an area where you might be able to hydro plane\nSo you've got to take care of that among many other things too like so many things going on in your car Dennis Oh that is all about the ways to make sure that they're operating properly this fall and winter\nSeven Thirteen you know we give away these great blooms farmers in planters almanac\nDinner you wanted to sunshine yesterday than I did not I should have been made another do that yeah\nI'm and any rate uh they there's something here called strange but through facts mhm and on and I were discussing those this morning that's where we found out that sun sets on Mars or blue that's very interesting yeah and he made a or got a picture off the Internet\nThe inter Web and he said he's going to put it as a screen saver brought it in here is very beautiful uh-huh blue Sundays\nIs because the the the red dust you know the red and surface of Mars and it's sort of thing\nTo be a compliment with an alley [noise]\nYou know as you look at it through you know there's gotta be a lighting reason yeah overall I guess it's just a good man above who decides make it blew well I understand that absolutely but um\nYeah and you know it's got to be some kind of lighting thing it doesn't really say here but [laughter] that that's a good fact but it sure is strange yes indeed and we also found out that bull frogs do not sleep\nThey do not sleep did you know I mean the carousel night watching late night TV and [laughter] they're joining joining the mice and eating all that a ... yeah I guess joining the mice\nYeah but I didn't know that that ... do not sleep I I've seen a bull frog or two and I'm In fact I've\nI've seen him sitting still and they had their eyes closed so evidently they weren't sleeping they were just meditating he's supposed to bull fries just lied to the people who were researching this could be I don't know you know maybe one to give an impression of or something that's not there so it will be doing that\nYeah apparently do you know good to or can we say that do you know good will do no good to uh give a ... like ... or whatever yeah\nThe Tylenol PM I don't know whatever sure don't ... don't even give it to a little frog because he doesn't sleep anyway so uh interesting stuff\nWell you know it just a minute\nAre you going to debunk that well France skeptics stack exchange uh-huh\nOkay uh let's see is a shift shit\nI'll tell you this one too while you're looking at 'em and ...\nWhen you were a kid did you ever say you're going to dig a hole to China do you take it or who yeah sided Oh yes I'm going to dig in the dirt or to China will digging a hole to China is theoretically possible if you start in Argentina\nBut you've got to start in Argentina owe really yeah according to this\nBecause no other place on earth could do a straight through\nI guess yeah that's the that's the angle you have to do digging a hole to China theoretically possible if you start in Argentina so if you if we started hearing gray and dug a hole to thinking we're going to China I guess we'll go somewhere else ... so there you go\nOkay a little frogs often promoted it as an example of an animal that does not sleep there is however only one study on the topic and that was published in Nineteen sixty seven so that's kind of you know pick and choose factoids right\nThere at least the one years ago this study so fifty one years both frogs might have slipped a little bit\nThe report concluded that little frogs do not sleep because even during the wresting phase they never failed to show a change in respiratory responses even after painful stimuli in other words they shut the skin\nThe same reporting knowledge that arousal thresholds could not be measured during the sickly phases with the lowest respiratory activity nor could they be tested with the other stimuli ... so the underlying assumption in the study was that shocks delivered late at night presumably in the middle of sleep should illicit less respiratory blah blah blah blah\nUm the a deeper sleep in rodents and humans occurs early after sleep on set\nYou know somebody wakes you up an hour after you've gone to bed I mean your last year just stumbling\nYeah exactly okay so so yeah wrong as a kind of don't sleep then I guess so how would you like to be involved in a you talk about the sleep stuffy yeah somebody shots you away right right and the bull frog sleep study specialist he's got that on his business card\n[laughter] so yeah there you go a sleep study specialist I ...
