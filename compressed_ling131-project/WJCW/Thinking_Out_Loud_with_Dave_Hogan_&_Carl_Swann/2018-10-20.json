very very wary of this the Indians themselves the Cherokee tribe the leaders\nWill tell you they don't use DNA to determine who really injured they use junior logical trace\n\nYou know who has one of the best junior logical trace apparatus us in this country in the Mormon church out in Salt Lake City has one of the most advanced respected documented genial logical trace organizations that you'll find\nI have I've seen their work and it is [laughter] it's amazing and that\nStory I get is that many Native Americans have been very leery of granting DNA because they're leery of how it's going to be used\nThey already feel like they were discriminated bunch of people but I'm the same token\nOr some benefits that have been extended to them as a result of this and they just don't want to upset the apple cart so they don't even realize or utilize DNA in any of this but the\nThe media of course has a role here because everything they reported about this turns out to be an abject lie except for this inclusion by the Boston Globe that there wasn't any Native American\nDNA and by the way this is not what\nTrump that her anyway Trump that her that she would have to take a test from little kept wandering around you can you can do a very rudimentary DNA test\nAnd he wanted to present her ... hammer take the kids take the take the test of this kid using it in a debate\nThe future debate and that's what he meant that she wouldn't do and he that that she wouldn't show up and Indian if she did do it\nBut you talk about talk about a meltdown and its Trump that is causing this\nTrump is literally causing these people lose their cookies Trump is causing them to go insane and I think it's happening throughout the Democratic party and fill out the American left and I have I have developed\nAn even greater reason for it and it all in all relies on things that I have previously known and told you about\nAnd most of it is related to my curiosity here and my suspicion and my my dubious a nature when it comes to this blue wave business\n\nWe've been hearing for the past how many months that there's going to be\nA blue wave there's no question about it there has been no question about the Democratic party is poised to retake everything they can in this next election why\nWell the media tells us the American people are fed up\nAfter two years of Donald Trump they realize the mistake they made they wish they could do it and go do it over maybe take back their vote for Trump and this was going to be the first chance they've had to actually do that until the Democrats are going to retake the house in a massive landslide and at one point we're going to take the Senate but then if you look\nAt the reality\nOf voting patterns just in the past eight years let's say ten there's nothing in the world using common sense that orders for a Democrat sweep or blue wave\nThe trend in the past ten years is Democrats losing elections left and right\nAnd it all started with Iraq Hussein all in two thousand ten do you remember how many times I reminded you that during the first six years of Obama you go through the two thousand four team in terms\nThe Democrat Party lost over twelve hundred feet\nNationwide seats in the U.S house seats in the U.S Senate state houses\nA governor ships are you\nEven go to a local often like mayor or town councilman if you if you factor all of those races nationwide the Democrats after six years of Obama had lost well over\nA hundred seats they were losing everything after the two thousand sixteen election\nThey continue to lose even more in the end the dance that lock to women in a landslide Hillary Clinton got beat in uh near electoral landslide electoral college landslide\nAnother robot sure where they were going to sweep big never going to wipe out the Republican Party once and for all Hillary Clinton was going to be this winter they had it they couldn't they had it any better this guy Trump won the Republican nomination\nSomebody did know when he was doing a gigantic buffoon a walking set of gaps they thought this guy would be easily swept away they believed all our polling data\nAnd we know what happened they continue to lose to the point that after the two thousand sixty eight elections\nThe Democratic party had the least amount of power\nIn terms of elected office is held in Washington DC since the Nineteen twenties now the two thousand sixteen election was only two years ago so from two thousand\nTen the first chance people had to vote after having stomach two years of the Obama administration which you want to talk about people wanting to get their votes back you want to talk about people wishing they can do it over you want to talk about people wishing they haven't voted the way they had go take a look at the two thousand ten midterms\nRock Obama singlehandedly my friends has destroyed the electoral prowess of the Democratic party nobody knows it because of the things I just told you are never reported instead what people hear every day is this coming blow away this gigantic Democrat landslide on what\nEvidence is this going to happen what is it that has stopped the trend\nThe people in this country have been voting against Democrats in ways unprecedented I mean the having the fewest number of electoral seats since the Nineteen twenties is pretty astounding it means a lot of people had been voting against you so what is it that's happened\nThat is going to cause this gigantic one hundred eighty degree shift\nMake people stop voting against Democrats and vote for them why it's none other than Donald Trump sold says the media so says the Democratic party\nWell on the basis of what if you take a look at Trump's agenda and the economy and policies and so far there's no reason to vote against it\nIn common sense there is no return peasant done anything to worsen anybody's lives quite the contrary\nAnd in fact there's a story from CNBC today that you're not gonna see widely reported\nLet's see if the [noise] probably put yeah see and be ... survey soaring economic optimism points to no blue wave in two thousand Eighteen is this a CNBC polar survey\nAmerica is experiencing a record breaking era of good feelings economically speaking optimism about the ... do you know that there are seven\nMillion jobs open in America today actual number seven million one hundred thirty six thousand job openings in America\nFor context the U.S never had even six million vacant jobs open until April of two thousand Seventeen\nNow we have an historic seven point one million jobs open that means employers are looking to hire that many people\nThat equals a roaring economy that equals no problem getting a job if you want one with that many job openings it is and employ ease market if there's that much demand for employees the employees can\nSet the terms based on their level of expertise and experience or whatever it is they're applying\nFor none of this in the world of common sense suggests that people would be unhappy by it or about it and want to reject it and yet that's exactly what we're being told that the American people are sick and tired day hey Trump they despise Trump they're embarrassed by Trump they were barest by their vote\nAnd yet\nThere isn't a middle Lincoln bit of evidence that people have turned around and want to vote Democrat including the two thousand sixteen presidential election\nFor those of us shouting at me why but we're we're storing food so who won the popular vote were three buttons\nYeah but\nTwo things about that most of those votes came from California the second thing is that we had a story yesterday that there are three and a half\nMillion registered voters above\nThe number of bodies in America been about orders are three and a half million more registered voters then there are voters which means there's all kinds of fraud potential fraud taking but but even those two things throw them out it doesn't it\nDoesn't cancel a fact of the Democrats have been losing elections left and right now we have they couldn't stop Kavanaugh every October surprise

she's the one I couldn't think of it Elizabeth Warren\nAll four of them\nOrchestrated damaging October surprise backfires for the Democratic party Elizabeth Warren tweeted when the different times

persuade people\nFind the time so tempting to make your case it's considered to be a meltdown and again the big news about all of this is that the media is making fools of themselves right along the way by lying right along with her\nThe Stanford University researcher who studied focus how does this DNA did not actually use samples of Native American DNA\nThe Boston Globe quote to make up for the dearth of Native American DNA Dr Carlos ... samples from may go ... in Columbia to stand in for Native Americans now\nShe's out there touting that it's true is she's an empty you got one one thousand twenty fourth\nAnd there wasn't even any Indiana Native American DNA tested in which she could be said to have in common or compared to\nI mean it's laughable it is the panic\nAnd I think this is what Trump is doing to all these people Hillary Clinton's making a fool of herself each and every now they're saying that\nWhat Bill Clinton did with Monica ...\nNo no no no no no that was not abuse that doesn't qualify me too because she was an adult\n\nSo Hillary Clinton is making me and asked her self an absolute fool of herself in the midst of the meat to move but she's on you're cutting it\nAnd selling it out in order to save both herself and her husband or soon to be a barking on what a stadium chore Oh yes bill\nAnd Hillary are going to mark a nationwide stadium to or\nWhere they're going to go and hopefully draw crowds of twenty and twenty five thousand to do the bill and Hillary show on stage\nBecause of course they can't let Trump upstaged white is I mean if Trump can do what they can do it if Trump can do what anybody can do what they're going to try to\nGet it on it there's one thing missing one key ingredient missing nobody cares what they have to say\nNot like people care what Trump has to say there is no interest in what Bill or Hillary Clinton are going to say\nThere is ...\nKinds of interest in what Trump is going to say there's just the it factor\nThat Trump has the Hillary certainly doesn't haven't never has had you could argue that Bill Clinton to an extent had it\nAnd I'm Talking about this type of charisma back in the nineties when he was running for president in shortly you know for the first term maybe he had I've never really the aura was expanded a bit by the fact that he was president but neither of these two are anywhere near\nThe Lincoln Donald from you know what does it like it was it like the Democrats trying that come up with an answer to me in the first ten years in the spring and Gary Hart man's\nSome ... some of the state treasurer of Texas they gave a radio show Mario the pious they gave a radio show and the media highlighted every one of these Democrats radio talk show who had never done it before as the rush killer\nEvery one of them was anointed and inaugurated as the Democrat that\nWas going to steal the limelight away from this program an Air America came along and uh and they did the same thing and it never has happened\nEvery attempt to supplant take over\nRelegate this program ... security has failed abysmally and just like the bill and Hillary stadium tour is going to fail abysmally\nThey're going to end up having to pay people to show up\nTo get the kind of crowds and the one you may think Russia and enough rabbit Democrats out there that will show up just to create the image that there's all kinds of ...\nFolks you may think that what we're going to find out common sense will tell you\nHillary Clinton equipment draw ... book selling party she couldn't draw ... campaign appearance that's why she didn't do very many of them it would have been embarrassing how few people showed up the ones where we're big crowds they did in fact most people\nIn the country's not clamoring to hear from the Clintons countries not waiting\nWith bated breath for what they have to say but look I Want to I Want to return just for a brief moment to this this notion of the of the

thirty eight and then he went to vox and back to five or five thirty eight is his company any took into various places\nAnd the Democrats the rank and file Democrats live and die by what Nate Silver tells them for example Nate Silver on election night two thousand sixteen five PM\nGave Hillary Clinton and playing an eighty nine percent chance of being elected president so they were all thinking it was over in the same thing is happening now Democrats Seventy three percent chance of retaking the house of representatives\nDemocratic voters breathing a sigh of relief Nate Silver is continuing report that he was on um the five thirty eight dot com politics podcast\nAnd the host was Jody ... Oregon who is a guy and the question has the gender gap increased since Kevin ...\nThe heart of this battle our our donors most of us want to make some difference\nIn the lives of other St Jude does miraculous or\nThe fact that no one has to pay its place where everyone history does this mean\nEverybody has welcome here and it doesn't matter the religion or what part of the world you're from all that is taken away it just gives you some hope [noise]\nIt's just a nice feeling to put your energy into something that really does genuine we make a difference in a child's mind [noise]\nThere's just no ...\nIf we have the ability to help\nAnd when you have the responsibility now\nFinding cures saving children\nSee gene children's research off they don't find out how you can help at ... dot org [noise]\nOne of the reasons the Democrats are so angry so ... so in San aside from the fact that many of them are suffering psychological disorders is that they know what I told you is\nThrough they've been losing elections left and right everything has been going against them and now they've lost the Supreme Court seat\nAfter trying this late October surprise to destroy capital and folks it all makes it there's nothing about this in August for blue wave now you have to have some ...\nWhich all share with us from them unfolds I Want you to hear the standing ovation attorneys got this would never have happened I don't know how long it's been since Mitch McConnell was greeted with this kind of love and respect\nAnd excitement by a Republican audience anywhere but Donald Trump brought him on the stage\nAt a mega rally in Richmond, Kentucky on Saturday thanking the turtle for standing firm on Kavanaugh and listen to the reaction\nMajority leader Mitch McConnell\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nI can always proud of pressing problem [noise]\n\nIs Mitch McConnell got that kind of a reception\nAt a political event\nI don't think he has gotten a reception like that even on an election night victory party but he's had [noise] and I'm going to ... I I'm not I'm gonna I'm going to go out in the limousine Mitch might like\nThat everybody likes that especially people that are on accustomed to it and\nEverybody in the world knows that it was the Trump stir made by the white Trump tweeted you know after the news that the prostitute has to pay him\nImagine how that kicks off not even JFK was able to pull that off he still had to pay the price\nWould have to pay Trump so Trump tweeted that\nFederal judge throws out Stormy Daniels last showed Trump is entitled full legal fees right now I can go after more space in our third rate lawyer and a great state of Texas she'll confirmed the wider she's not she knows nothing about me a total con he called her horse race\n[noise] somebody has to have to say you have to rush probably by being met for [noise]\nMy friends I enjoy things that are well may take cigars for example the details are what matter a proper assembly properly rolling the cigar is essential for a good grow the feel and the look of the rapper has to be just right\nWell details also matter when it comes to home security and simply say ... security pays attention to the details it's evident in their use of tech and craftsmanship\nTheir focus on creating the most reliable security for your family shows in the details simply say sensors are small they don't destroy the look at your home the system is easy to set up and use\nThey made sure that it works even in the event of power outages are downed wires and unlike other home security companies simply say never asked you to sign a contract\nSee how good simply safe really is right now get ten percent off your system it's simply say usa dot com that simply safe usa dot com ten percent off simply safe usa dot com\nWho do I do find far\nThey're flying from Boston Public speaking you deserve the high\nPerforming for all of a stagehand\nMake sure I never missed a cue\nTheir farm for high school choir director who taught me to breathe and the guy friends tend to\nA speech debates theater using the performing arts teach valuable life lessons that typically aren't taught in the classroom\nThey help high school students learn leadership skills that prepare them to enjoy more satisfying productive lives\nDefined finishes having my high school debate kind of really how many more confident than I ever dreamed pounding\nThis message presented by the tendency secondary school athletic association and the high school in your commute [noise]\n\nAny given moment anyway I mean America a baby is taking a person that has done up mental milestone [noise] but for too many parents a baby ...

and this is happening in my high school debate kind of have become more confident than I ever dreamed of\nThis message presented by the tendencies secondary school athletic association and the high

journalist ... is a good first step you said he believes the Saudis explanation that ... was killed in a fist fight that but Saudi consulate in Istanbul earlier this month\nWe'll be talking to then we'll see what happens when they have some questions we do have said and as I tell you if you're working on this with Congress drivers is very interested in this one and you'll be working with Congress\nTurkish reports have said sure she was killed and dismembered like Saudi agents CNN is reporting this morning that cause shrimp she died in a chokehold\nIndependent Alaska Governor Bill Walker has ended his reelection campaign less than three weeks before the election\nJust a few days ago he was lieutenant governor Byron ... resigned over what Walker described as an inappropriate overture toward a woman thousands of Hondurans marching from their homeland to the United states\n\nThey're running out of weapons and then the process of running out of weapons they're losing their minds they're losing their rational sanity I Believe\nAnd this latest debacle over Kavanaugh\nDon't doubt for a minute that this thing was orchestrated unplanned from the get go as a late breaking\nUse only if necessary event they didn't lead with this because they knew it was flimsy they didn't lead with it because they knew they couldn't prove it they didn't lead with it it was it a central part of a Kavanaugh hearings because they knew there wasn't any evidence for it and they knew that balls before and could not pull this off\nA pressure\nI'm Still in shock the balls he showed up to testify I I think that took everything they had to persuade her to get there 'cause I don't think she ever intend to do and I don't think when they pitched her on this whole thing was every part of the plan that she would ever actually\nHave to testify and does anybody believe that uh fifty one every year old woman literally talks as she talks that way in her classroom teaching students if she does that mean that just\nAnd I guess it's possible I guess she does but I I don't believe that either\nI don't believe that's how you talk to the Baltimore and you're running around the beach Santa Cruz that's not how she's going to be talked she's not you're running around the beach out there are and she's not going to be talking to you like he's in perpetual fear of being hit or damaged or harmed her yelled out or whatever uh\nAnd it was the point is none of it has worked and by work I mean do two things the the\nReal objective from the get go from all of this the cleanest way for this to happen and would have been able to turn the American people particularly Trump voters against him if they have been able to do that get Trump's approval numbers ... to the thirties and into the twenties then they could get rid of him\nThey failed at that all they did with cement Trump's supporters to him even more firmly\nAnd then the process Kavanaugh saying they actually turn some people who are sympathetic to them and the Trump supporters because people in the same portion of this country simply do not feel comfortable with watching\nThe most powerful apparatus of government unified at a line and for the purpose of destroying a human being and a life when there isn't any evidence\nThat would warrant such a thing but the Democrats didn't care that there wasn't any evidence because they never have any they always relied on the seriousness of the charge working with the media\nTo create an daily image that whoever the Democrats are targeting is worse\nThan poison and

I'm not apologizing for anything you don't like it live with it\nIn the primary I didn't want to do the story in the first place I didn't want to pursue the pictures the editor says you did I mean
