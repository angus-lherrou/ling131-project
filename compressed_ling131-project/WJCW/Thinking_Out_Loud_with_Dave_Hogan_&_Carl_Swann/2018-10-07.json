over to the kids that so much in what we did when we left\nThat's fifty golf and she joins us on focus on the family along with your co worker and fellow author David Thomas and I'm John fuller your host is focused president and author Jim Daley\nAnd we are quick to push into that meant to say it's not that girls have more feelings she just has more a vocabulary she is a\nBetter ability to articulate those things so that's why we have to labor a little longer I Love your word of concentration concentrate on that space with boys that we've got a labor longer than that space so that he develops an emotional vocabulary and we talk about how these milestones build on each other\nParents are so quick to want to go to I Want my kids to figure out how not to melt down I Want them to figure out how to work through frustration better and that's an important objective but if they don't even know what they're feeling like that's the foundational building block that's why we start with vocabulary we've got to figure out what is it then I'm feeling so that I can then figure out what to do with it\nSo you have all these um obstacles in the culture in in the home\nAnd in your make up your personality or gender plays a role in that how do you begin to counteract those to um work with it I guess would be\nIt was said and provide building blocks or that the child like the emotional chart how are you feeling today let's move that up to five years old when they are a little more capable of expressing themselves a sissy with a little five year old girl what are we going to do\nWell and it's interesting 'cause boys have a hard time expressing which is our first milestone in perspective as a second one which would really be regulating and that's where girls struggle little bit more is in the regulating of their mission because there's so much more aware of it and\nAnd I've started one of our building blocks that we talk about but\nIt's really borne out of counseling with girls I started doing something called a scale where you know we think about emotions on the one to ten scale and you all know having children yourself some of them just lean toward ten on everything with sadness anger embarrassment worry that they live at ten and and because I work primarily with girls I call it a drawing I'm I'm at her\nAnd my mom monitor yeah I I could use one of those yet\nAnd so what I Will do with families is in a calmer moment for a child who lives at tend to have the parents say to them tell me what a ten would be on your scale you know what's the\nSaddest are the worst or the scariest thing you can imagine happening and so they name that early on just like we're talking about naming our feelings and then when the child gets in the car and says this is the worst thing I've ever had in my whole life you can say gosh that sounds really hard 'cause we always want to start with empathy\nThat sounds really hard to tell me what number you think it was on your scale and then that some automatic perspective that that child in particular doesn't have\nTo say I don't want to let go of this because again in your book the stumbling blocks that you identify a for girls in addition the one you just mentioned like the pressure to please yeah that's a big one of the pressure to perform and the need for control\nI mean I I most women listening right now are going yes I still struggle with struggle with those things 'cause that and again it's not to this merger demeaned this is just wiring issues you know and this happens\nAnd that's such a big part of it because I think as we talk about the net it components that from the earliest stages girls are kind of defined themselves against this backdrop of relationship and so that need to please comes out of that is born how do we\nEquip our daughters and at what age and again I Want to move kind of the age continue if you can carry it all the way through from a three or four year old up to sixteen Seventeen year old\nHow do we give our girls equip them to avoid the pressure to please that if you can achieve that as a parent in your girls that is a milestone in a city that is an incredible achievement how would you go about that just take us all the way through\nOne of the things I talk with parents of girls of all ages about is a combination of kindness and strength and how often we lean towards one or the other that we either just\nDon't have a voice at all and so we don't ever stand up for them ourselves themselves or were really strong and we have these strong boundaries and were unkind in the midst of that and so teaching girls from the earliest stages to say things like\nI Want to play with you but not when you treat me like that you know how different for a woman that my adult relationships would be if I learned that they were at ten or at fourteen what that looks like in a friendship I Want to be your friend\nBut I'm not going to continue to hang out with you when you're posting like that about me on social media are when you're relating to me and\nThat really is the strength to be able to say that they feel safe going on there and voice to adult express a\nHow give me a practical example of how you would do that at age eight are you taking your daughter's side if you observe something and say hunting here's a better way to handle that or if she comes to you in tears because she was overrun by a friend gave me an example of how the players\nAre magic formula we get you over and over our empathy and questions that sounds really hard what do you want to do about that what do you think would help where it's her voice starting to say this is what's going to make a difference and were empowering her rather than when we say I want you to go right back after and you tell her\nShe doesn't get to tell you then all of a sudden we're saying you can't figure it out I'm going to tell you what you need to say if you don't have it inside of you that's really critical we want her to feel like she's got it\nAnd that really is true all the way along that continue on my own age was interesting question let me uh let me ask you this\nDavid when it comes to the boy side of that you know these things that we just expressed the pressure to please the pressure to perform the need for control what's early and a boy's development that would be similar to those things but more boyish\nOne of the first and biggest obstacles for boys is going to be\nHis hardware and we're kind of back to those differences and I talk early on about how emotions for a boy have a lot of physicality to them so it's white toddler age boys are so prone to\nBiting kicking screaming teenage boys are so prone to punch in a hole through a wall yelling moving toward disrespect and so part of what I Love to do with boys and parents are boys is helping them understand that's a normal part of how God hardwired you like\nYou need an outlet to channel that intensity that physicality so with\nToddler age boys for example I have twin boys when my son's for three years of age we we purchased one of those Bozo Bopp it's like an inflatable something was saying in the bottom where you could punch ...\nInto the ground and springs ... yes and it would\nBounce right back up and and a part of what's happening and that is is that we're training boys to recognize when our bodies are sending a signal or sirens or alarms are going off inside of us that if I don't channel that physicality in a direction that's constructive or healthy\nIt'll come outside like\nThis focus on family broadcast will continue in just a moment\nAt Saint Jude children's research hospital we're fighting against childhood cancer every day at the heart of this battle\nOr our

[noise]\nSuzie I'm even as we're talking about that description of boys my mind is still wandering back here with the trauma that so many girls especially teen girls are facing today because uh that's not a part of their life\nI mean he may be still part of the family but emotionally not connected when you look at some of those statistics it's horrifying how few fathers are actually really engaged with their their kids in that regard when you look at the impact on the stumbling blocks the pressure to please the press\nPerform the need for control they seem to be rooted in that relationship with that or the lack there of speak to the impact of what can a father do for his daughter to help her be healthier than those three areas\nI think one of the best things I thought I can do for his daughter is just to have time with our where he is engaged with her and that's the only where he's asking her questions where he is communicating to her that he is interested in her there was

going to be senior and our other one's a sophomore we're not far away from the emptiness you've gone through that John you've had for it\nNot fancy part but I really hate using some of the kids yeah I mean that's a\nBig moment when they're like no adult peers you say goodbye and and you realize they're not going to be coming back\nAnd staying with Amy way released not the same way it's a pretty big deal I mean that's true\nAnd I hope if you didn't catch the program last time get to download a call us and get a C. D. or or maybe even uh get the smartphone apps and you can listen that way as well but there's lots of ways that you can listen\nAnd this is our purpose man we want to help you be the best mom and dad you can be and uh the resources that we cover on the program that's are so intent and today we're going to cover more of the great content from sissy and David uh their book or my kids on\nTrack yeah insists he is the director of child and adolescent counseling a David is the director of family counseling both work at day star counseling ministries\nIn Nashville, Tennessee and ah this book is available on with the CD the smartphone app another help including the feelings chart that we mentioned last time at focus on the family dot com slash radio\nJohn how are you feeling today a bad Andrea I'd rather not talk about a gym I have no answer the question is David and and Suzie welcome back pain and they were allowed to be that David Thomas you not the guy that invented the Wendy's hamburger I Wish I had that in here and I just want to get better connection\nUm we uh ended last time talking about uh you know the impact of data on the daughter we talked about boys and how they respond to mom and some of those basic things identifying the stumbling blocks as you called them\nUm and says you talked about a control of a little girl what she's developing their kind of the insecurities of that wanting to be perfect that idea of perfection\nAnd again if you miss that get it I Want to come back to that briefly on the anxiety side um and this can be both a mom or dad\nBut when you see an anxiety and the child what do you normally see in the parrot\nMhm well there's a lot of research that says that is a childhood epidemic in America today I think from our camping out as we would say anxiety is panning epidemic in America today\nIs the parenting epidemic his parents are the ones who were anxious and we're transferring it to our\nCat yes yes and some of it I think is really ever compensating that I think we all are kind of near the same age and we grew up in a generation where we weren't talking our feelings\nAnd our parents were often asking us about our feelings and so maybe we had anxiety and no one ever name and so we're seeing parents who are over talking with their kids and\nAnd really trying to step in and fix it like you said and basically what experts will say is with anxiety to work three jobs just has to be the scary thing and so when we don't ... them or in effect preventing them from working through it but they need to do it in a gradual way but they still got to do\nSure give me a handle I'm a mom or dad David you can jump in on the bad side here what does that handle for a quick self assessment that I'm dipping toward anxiety how do I see it in myself with my child yeah what would be some of those\nExperiences if you're doing this then you may be um in forming your child and an unhealthy way\nAre you doing it for them or are you stepping in and renew whatever it's causing the anxiety in the first place if it's track\nAre you letting her quit the track team immediately without pushing through and having to work through it a little harder doing homework do and how we're going to school I had a family recently have a lot of kids in school refusal where they're worried about going to school and\nAnd there are ways that you can help them work to do that without just pulling MFL family who completely pulled their daughter from school and\nBy the time I got with her it was obvious she was in complete control of our house\nAnd that's part of it is they've got to know that were bigger that makes them feel safe\nYeah David what about boys in that same way do they suffer from some insecurity\nOh absolutely they do and I was even thinking when you were asking that question my parents where I mentioned earlier with boys I'll do a lot of training around listening to your body and figuring out when\nSignaling an alarm and I have to do a lot of that with parents like we laugh about how often what parents in our office who will say things like he so worried\nAnd I don't know where that comes from [laughter] really challenge\nParents hopefully in a respectful way to just say like are you where even right now like your voices elevated your hands are clinched at this point you're yelling as we talk like not listening to the signals your own body is giving\nYou the reason for my questions that are self awareness can be really diminished in this area of parity because it's so close and we're going to be far more self aware in a social setting in a workplace but at home we're kind of just who we are that's where we're relaxing at least in\nTerms of facades when we talk a lot in the book about panning out alive and not out of fear and I kind of the bottom line is that is so true and I think the key thing there is what I'm trying to pull out of his had as a parent do a quick self assessment that I Am a fear based parent\nAnd I've got to change and I know there's no quick way to do that but I'm just thinking the poor mom or dad listening who's saying okay I think I'd do parents out of fear how do we confirmed that for them ... what would you say\nIn the chapter on awareness we do talk with parents about the importance of not only knowing your stuff checking your baggage but talking openly obviously age appropriately with our kids to to be able to say things to them like you know what I have a tendency to bend toward catastrophic thinking\n[laughter] kinda where I go I go quickly to worst\nCase scenarios and so being able to say those things telling ourselves in that way and understanding what do I need in response to that like we talked about empathy and questions and coffee and case though the third\nKind of magical question we talk a lot with parents about his time and space and to be able to say the kids we love you know what I'm amped up right now like I'm flooded with worry right now like in this moment\nI don't feel like I'm In my at with boys that caught your dinosaur brain or you're thinking brain you know your emotional brain you're thinking brain for us as parents to be able to say I'm not I'm not thinking brain right now I Love you too much to argue so I'm going to go take Fifteen minutes to walk the dog\nDo whatever I Need to do at this point and then we'll come back together and talk so that I'm not parenting out of fear so that I'm not parenting out of emotion when we're emotionally charge kids or adults in those moments it's like what happens when I go to the grocery store and an empty stomach I just I don't make an awful decision\nLet's move to empathy talk about the importance of empathy what empathy is in teaching your child how to express sympathy it's kind of a big question there but really the one who just kick it off\nMaybe a short definition would be a vocabulary the mountain of vocabulary reading emotions empathy is responding to emotions so it's the ability to kind of look at you and have some sense of what's going on inside of you climb and do your shoes and we know there's so much research out there that continues to come from that empathy is one of the most\nFoundational ingredients and healthy interpersonal relationships of all kinds\nMarriage relationships parent to child co worker relationship so we don't really need to have much of any conversation about whether we think it's important or useful it is no doubt about it and the research continues to confirm it so\nKind of where we go in the empathy chapter in every chapter is breaking down what are the stumbling blocks for boys with someone blocks for girls were the building blocks for boys building blocks for girls and then\nWell that's so good in the book for the parent of a seventh eighth ninth grader I mean again these are phases your kids are going to go through difficult moments some of it's going to be hormonal\nAnd to better understand it is critical so you're not freaking out the mom and dad saying\nOh my goodness we have an ax murder you know this is Laura narcissistic personality that would not be a good thing but it's being mindful of it and taking the long view and understanding where you're at a David let's go to the boy\nMaybe that little boy and they're expressing a blame or avoidance or deny all kind of stumbling blocks for that little boy when it comes to resourcefulness\nWhat is resourcefulness and what are the stumbling blocks look like\nResourcefulness is really taking the emotion to something constructive it's problem solving strategizing it's critical thinking and it's kind of part of that to part agenda we talked about earlier figuring out what do I feel and what to do with it it's the what to do with it part and\nAnd boys I Love helping boys developing this year because I think again it's males were kind of natural problem solver so this is flexing a little stronger muscle but the three someone bought she mentioned are kind of his biggest road blocks of blame avoidance and to not have that acronym of bad\nIn the book because I think boys do a lot of in the face of failure or in the face of you know difficulty swinging between blame and self hatred somewhere between\nIt's your fault and I'm an idiot and they have a hard time getting to that good healthy middle space like I had a conversation with an eleven year old boy just yesterday my office\nAnd he struck out three times in the same baseball game and he was talking his way through it and the things I heard from him where those two extremes like the pitcher couldn't even throw the ball there's lying\nAnd then he got to at some point in teary moment on the worst player on the team but nowhere in the middle was the sense of\nI had an off day Ramis practice one day this week and I was a little bit you know not as in my in my rhythm like they were all these different factors that I had to lead them to that he just couldn't get too easily on his own and so I think as long as the boys swinging between those two places it's really hard for him to develop\nHow how does a mom or dad minimize the pendulum effect how do you narrow that in what can you say that will help them cope better and equip them so I\nI Do think that empathy and questions formula is really useful in these moments of that sounds hard\nSometimes when when they're stuck in blame it tell me what you think your part was what was your contribution or we laugh I have a story at the beginning of that chapter about one of my sons were six and\nThis is an example of how early it starts with boys we had a soccer game or run around the house on a Saturday morning and my son walked up to my wife and said what did you do with my soccer cleats\nLike nothing thought to say did you see where I left and do you have any idea where I put them\nIn so in those moments rather than just again coddling like I'm going to go to finding them for him\nYou know my wife with him and said I didn't wear them I didn't wear those with my black skirts usual playful for a moment like where did you leave him last year like helping him move towards some problem solving on his own as opposed to doing it for him but not letting them stay stuck in blind\nAt that is really helpful I'm I'm saying is that just to my own parenting my father and those are good things to come back around on and when you notice them doing as well as those empathetic questions I like that I'm Suzie how about for the girls when it comes to resourcefulness what's their stumbling block and what's the building blocks for them\nGirls for any of us when we come up to read block resource than it is really working our way around it and I have more and more girls he just sit down by the red black cement plant flowers on\nThe air by getting around it and\nWhy is it important right wing\nYeah instead of motivation is one of the building blocks that we talk a lot about and I think sometimes were imposing our meditation on them rather than helping them find bears and so we keep going back to empathy and questions that I think even in those towns and when the questions I asked them as they might counseling offices what do you want\nWhat do you want to happen here what do you think again is what do you think's going to help\nI Want to end with this question in for each of you to answer this because I think um you know you're doing counseling you had the techniques of counseling\nA these are things that we believe is Christians are are rooted in biblical truth I think we can all agree to that\nWhy do you think God does it this way I mean when you look at the uh little years of trying to teach them and then those hormonal adolescent years and then\nPuberty hits and you've got the teen years when you're looking at the big picture what just got one from us as a parent as a father David and as a mother Cissy ...\nI Would say I think what he wants most\nFor me as a father is a to B transformed more into the image of his son and he was doing that using these beans to disrupt me take me to the end the myself and help me figure out I'm making more of a mess and I'm\nDoing it well in a lot of moments and that there's grace for that and we talk about this and spiritual milestones of just\nHow we cannot really understand the beauty of grace unless we understand the depths of our need and so\nI think that's what it's about more than anything\n... in that mob space the mom that's to her wits and she's so worried\nShe's not in control\nAll the things we talked about this last couple of days those um [noise] maybe you might call them the sensitive spots for eve [laughter] you know we're eve lives\nThose attributes that so many women so many mobs possess how does she wrestle herself away from that and actually trust God even met some really serious stuff and\nLet's say a lot of dependence and just like David talked about and and that one of the things asset with moms and talk about all the time as God gave you exactly what you need all ready for the life of each heavier cats even the one that's ... and that child really in effect will be the mess and for that\nAnd will teach you your knee for Jesus and his ... for you so that you in turn can spell it over to them against that so much of what we do when we left cats\nBoys so good and you have done a wonderful job in this book are my kids on track the twelve emotional social and spiritual milestones your child needs to reach I mean so many parents contacting us here focus on the family saying I Am I doing the right job this is one of those resources these tools\nThat can really in the light and you as to whether you are and I love what I've

me\nAt the offices of the club for growth in Washington DC Andrew Roth is keeping an eye on US Senate races and congressional races all across the country and we're going to take an update one month before election as to where things stand\nAndy good to have you here thanks ... let's talk first about the U.S Senate it's been it's been an interesting couple of weeks for the Senate\nRepublicans have a little bit of an advantage by virtue of the map you might want to just give us a bit of an overview on that and then we can talk about how things are going in the individual states\nYou're right the Republicans do have an advantage right off the bat thoroughly defending eight seats or nine seats rather and the Democrats are defending twenty six so just right off the bat there they're in good shape plus at least ten Democrat ... seats that are up for reelection\nTrump won and some of them Trump won big time like West Virginia\nAnd North Dakota so the Republicans are definitely in the driver's seat now there's a lot of money involved and there's a lot of spending involved and there's a lot of good candidates that were recruited involved\nSo it is making the situation a little bit more difficult for Republicans they have a fifty one forty nine advantage in the Senate which is very slim the best guess right now is that perhaps they'll pick up one or two seats\nBut I could easily see them picking up more than that or having the the election be a complete wash where nobody wins or loses net seats and I could even see a Democrats picking up a net one or two seats so it's getting hairy\nSo a month out nothing is settled and the situation's going to remain volatile right up until election day let's talk first of all Andy in terms of all these democratic seats that are up\nWhich states are finding that their incumbent democratic US Senators are the most vulnerable and perhaps subject to losing to a Republican challenger\nYeah I think first and foremost a you have to look at North Dakota Heidi Heitkamp is the Democrat there she's trying to portray herself as a moderate\nBut it's just not working and as I mentioned before the Trump won there by double digits I'd I don't even know what the number is but it's it's large it's north of uh twenty points maybe even thirty it's quickly becoming non competitive now with thirty days things could change\nBut that's looking tougher and tougher for Democrats to pick up there is that the prediction markets where you can bet on who's going to win that race and those numbers are very insightful just as much as a whole numbers are\nAnd uh right now the prediction markets are giving Heidi Heitkamp only twenty six percent chance of winning that district so I I think she's done barring any major changes after that\nI think you can see Claire McCaskill in Missouri losing I think you could see Joe Donnelly in Indiana losing and maybe a couple of others so right off the bat you're you're down about three seats if you're lucky\nBut then Republicans have to defend a few seats themselves namely Arizona where Jeff Flake is retiring Ted Cruz in Texas who is facing ... basically the the number one celebrity candidate the Democrats have this year\nAnd then Marsha Blackburn and Dean Heller in Tennessee in Nevada respect to respectfully each if the elections were held the day I think that Ted Cruz would when the Democrat has a lot of bad news coming out recently about a DUI about making some derogatory comments about women\nWhen a few other things so I think crews could most likely win plus it's taxes so I think he's got a bill to advantage in Tennessee I think a Marsha Blackburn should survive that re she's the Republican but in Arizona Nevada\nI think it's very possible that that the Republicans could lose so they lose those two seats but they pick up two or three seats with Heitkamp McCaskill maybe Donnelly and maybe one or two others then you're looking at what I mentioned before which is probably about a plus one plus to pick up four Republicans\nWhat about Joe mansion and also the race in Florida is getting quite competitive is it not\nYeah with mansion right after the GOP primary up Patrick Morsi was declared winner there the polls quickly tightened the mansion his proved himself to be a very squishy when it comes to defining his ideological Maureen so\nHe's portraying himself as an independent he says he's not necessarily friends with Trump but that that they talk and that he doesn't always agree with them but sometimes he does he get he gives all of this politician speak a rhetoric\nThat for now has passed the vide a lot of voters the prediction market that I mentioned earlier they have mansion winning was so he has a Seventy five percent chance of winning\nAnd the polls are kind of reflecting that as well so I I think he's right now if the election were held today I think he'd win but you do have thirty days left and let me mention also that Trump\nIs going to be spending a lot of time on the road going to these various states and campaigning for the Republican so things are things are definitely heating up they're ... they're not certainly cooling down\nLet's talk just very briefly about the United States House of representatives obviously we can't get into all the different races that are going on but just from the the mile high view of it Democrats need to pick up what about twenty three twenty four seats is one of the markets the production market saying about that\nYou're right I think it is twenty three seats and it's clearly going in the Democrats' direction I think that right now the the prediction markets show that the Democrats have about sixty five\nSixty eight percent chance of of controlling the house the question though is by what margin because just eyeball in all the different races it could be that they pick up like twenty five or twenty six seats so then you're only talking about it two or three seed advantage which is nothing\nIn the house because you're going to have uh\nOut of Democrats from very conservative districts who might not be inclined to follow polo see and the liberal San Francisco agenda that their spouse and so if they do have a majority with a that slum of a margin\nThey may not be able to get to do anything with their agenda which would be remarkable and let me also mentioned the Kavanaugh saying the Kavanaugh nomination has sparked some enthusiasm among Republican voters now it's unclear\nWhat happens after the confirmation vote if there's a large enough gap between that\nAnd the election does that enthusiasm dissipate or that anger dissipate to the point where it's no longer effective but if it sticks then there's still a chance that Republicans could keep the majority the I think without question that they're going to lose seats in the house it's just a question of how many\nIs completely understandable that victims would repress their memories of such incidents and be fearful of disclosing details\nHowever that new willingness to give the benefit of doubt to victims cannot extend to the point of ignoring relative facts and testimonies there are many cases of false accusations even if they constitute the minority of all like ... of sexual misconduct for instance\nThere are too many African American men convicted and jailed after having been accused of rape or attempted rape of white women where in fact\nThe accusation was ill founded one of the most well known of these is the case of high school football star Brian Banks who was falsely accused convicted and serving time in prison with his accuser finally admitted to fabricating the entire claim\nWe will probably never know what really happened in the summer of Nineteen eighty two between Brett Kavanaugh and Christine lousy or a ... a few years later\nBut we are looking at the judicial record of a lawyer and judge who's conduct has never wants to my knowledge been subject to question or a scandal in the many years that he is practice law or served on the bench\nYet his adolescence conduct\nMay have been reprehensible and should not be dismissed lightly\nBut it's not the student Brett Kavanaugh of over a quarter century ago who was nominated is the judge Brett Kavanaugh of the DC circuit court the ones in disregard of his judicial record by those who oppose him on ideological grounds but don't have the courage or intellect to challenge him on his record\nShows the world that we need to base our ideals by a bomb blast\nI voted for President Trump and I support his nomination of judge Kavanaugh\nBut I cringe when I hear him mocked Dr forward I think judge Kavanaugh has what it takes to be a good justice of our Supreme Court but I cringe when he allows himself to make snide remarks do as senator who is the daughter of an alcoholic or when he descends into partisan comments about his accusers\nDo you ... of American radio journals feel the same way do you feel the need for a shower after watching some of our senators\nAre you tired of political arguments that have little to do with the subject being discussed and are really all about acquiring are holding on to political power\nAfter the dust settles on judge Kavanaugh's confirmation vote joined me in writing to your two senators to elevate their advice and

you don't know the story it isn't only about the good stuff\nNo there is the part where death entered where God had created so much life\nGod's enemy the devil the great liar and deceive her chained to destroy that which God loves the most you see the devil cannot be God Newark take his place in fact when the devil tried God banished him and send him away from the heavenly places\nHating God as the devil does though knowing his powerless beating God one on one the devil targets God's crowning achievement seeking to hurt God by hurting those he loves\nJust as he did with the first man and woman in the garden the devil continues telling lies that we can be like God\nCreators of our own destiny is that we should focus on what we want and try to get it at any cost don't worry be happy for that is what you see you can trust me I can show you how to get it\nOnce created in the image of God\nOur lives got twisted and turned upside down and where once we walked with God now are natural inclination is to walk to the beat of our own drum\nWhere before we would have seen the value and everyone who was created in God's image we now see them as a means to our ends obstacles to our goals or simply inconveniences\nWars now exist among people's tribes and nations as we seek to get our own wants Matt\nWe made a lie and cheat or speak poorly of others to get the promotion we want or something else of value that we have placed the lives of others over we\nMay see those who are born with physical or mental challenges as of less value than those born typical maybe we think there must be a curse from God at play there the parents must have done something wrong in their lives to be given such a great burden\nYet to think this way we'd be wrong the disciples were so you'd be in good company\nIn the gospel of John we recall the accounts of where Jesus healed the boring beggar in their travel they Jesus and the disciples pass by and saw a man who had been blind from birth\nAnd his disciples asked him rabbi who send this man or his parents that he was born blind and Jesus answered it was not that this man's thin or his parents but that the works of God might be displayed in him\nThis account serves to show how wrong we may be in our thinking for this man had a God given purpose\nWhen a life is created when we are blessed with such a great gift we may see it as merely inconvenient not worthy of having right now as this new life is in the way of the plans we have made for ourselves\nThroughout the world about fifty five sixty million God given lives are taken by abortion each year\nThe arguments for abortion range from not wanting to raise children with birth defects to those conceived due to rape yet those cases are the absolute rarity among those who choose abortion\nTwisted in the devils lies as we are we may no longer see the value in lives created by God his children no less as worthy of protecting sin has caused us to become towel a sub seen life as having great value from the one who gives a\nDead as we are in our sinfulness we placed little value in lives that are no longer able to contribute to society or to us more rightly said it\nWould be good could bring a disabled child into this world possibly brain\nWhat purpose does grandma or grandpa in their frail bodies offer or one with a disease that will keep them requiring care for a long time stripping them of their ability to be active citizen\nEven though it was my actions that caused a life to be created my life isn't ready to share with another so I'll just make this problem go away it isn't really a life until it fully enters the world we hear today\nAnd until then we have a right to choose to do whatever we want with it\nOr we need not look hard at a mirror to see how broken we are our thoughts may even shock is a time\nLooking at strangers seeing how their dress or thinking of what little value they contribute judging their life as worth less than our own but what if we are wrong what if our sitting written and reason cannot be trusted and we were to give God the final say in our lives\nRemember how we were once created in his image\nOh that image has been shattered but it is helpful to see how our natural inclination to hold cell value above others in this world should be seen as a sign of sickness\nYou see all were and are created in his image I'll be at a shattered remnant of it and God loves us so much that he wants that all would be saved\nAnd if his value for all of us is so great even broken and simple as we are there must be something to each life that he grants to exist and therefore we have no business pronouncing a right to choose its existence or not\nAnd as Christians we cannot be complacent about this issue we cannot claim to see God by his word to be followers and to not speak out against the hatred towards his creation that exist today\nPro choice is sitting in God's throne and making decisions that only he should make euthanasia is also the same\nSure things are broken in this life and we can expect some tough stuff to enter our lives yet using evil for good as God does all lives have purpose\nWe may not see it as clouded as our eyes have become by swallowing the devils lies but there is much to be gained by knowing the one true God as he is\nYou see God is a servant king each action is one that is meant to draw us into a deeper understanding of who he is and how valued his creation is to be seen\nThinking we know better in seeking control we'd be left looking at an eternity of darkness death and torture in choosing the devil as whom we should follow\nYet wanting none of that God and knowing how we could never perfectly fulfill the laws that are best for us sent his only be gotten son to save us\nAnd with him living his most perfect life Jesus then traded his life for our dead ones ones that deserve nothing but God's wrath and separation from him\nJust see how loved you are you must see how enemies as we are God still loves us enough to provide the fix to show us that even our lives still hold precious value to him all lives do\nAnd when we begin to understand how we have a father who still loves us and wants us in spite of our own defects maybe then we can see how his love extends to everyone everywhere and that they too are valued and deserve to know of his love also\nThose who God creates are no accident regardless of how they arrive in this world the blessings that we may see and loving those lives that we may expect to be burdens are precious in the eyes of God those who need our compassion and\nYou know prenatal testing and eradicating Down syndrome in certain countries in the world and of course that's not what they're doing their job killing all of the baby that
