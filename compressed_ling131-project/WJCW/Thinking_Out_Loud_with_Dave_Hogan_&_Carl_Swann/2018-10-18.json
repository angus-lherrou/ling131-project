that group we're harried bunch let's just put them in ... and so I kind of took that and uh\nYeah when I was six seven eight years old I was in elementary school of course in the\nEye or of course I hadn't gotten to college in six seven eight years old I guess that makes sense I'm In elementary school but anyway\nI I Would have the little little you know just a little image of a mustache and people used to aggravate me a call at peach has yeah mine was actually dark ... if you want to say that okay\nSo I started getting that at a younger age unfortunately my voice didn't change too I was fourteen yeah and I think I was going on Fifteen where my voice finally changed and it was an overnight thing yeah it was just the freest thing you know I went to sleep a soprano\nAnd woke up a base okay while and it was literally overnight you know a lot of people is gradual their voice cracks maybe a member of the Peter Brady episode ... yes\nKnow where it's time to change you know where he would cry his voice would correct um mine didn't do that it was a sudden thing yeah it just kind of freaked me out I woke up and I was when I entered my first words that morning\nWhen I was up from the prime at fourteen and a half yeah good morning yeah and when we were like us at morning you know everybody said well what happened to your voice yeah so yeah I don't know\nIt changed the voice very much to nominate in and gave me a new voices anyway I don't know how I got off on that but um I've had a mustache since I was Seventeen a full fledged mustache and I never have really shaved all of it all you have creamed it back quite a bit but never have\nBeen without it so when I got the TV\n[noise] some of the consultants that came in and we had\nImage consultants believe it or not can you prove an image like mine I don't know probably not yeah but anyway we had image consultants and they would talk to him about shaping my moustache off you know that not many\nPeople in that particular corporation hand or other anchors had a mustache is right and I said\nYou will have to drag me kicking and screaming to get this must stay shop I mean 'cause I had it for so many years yeah excuse me so they let me keep the moustache after I\nHe protest it too much they say [laughter] and um but but they never would allow the beard it was kind of the Marge Schott rules okay yeah the facial hair so once I got out of a a television I said well you know what I'm going to let that go to either beard ride a little bit yeah\nBoy I got a frog here this morning but anyway\nUm so that's what I've done\nAnd I turned it back over the last couple of days just for my little a hospital stint that I'm going to have yeah and so ah anyway if it gets out too far really kind of bugs me it starts itching itching for now so I kind of have to curtail it back that's why I've never really tried to grow one because of the itch\nYeah if I go a couple of days without shaving which I have it in a long time but uh it just it's you know I think okay I'll ... elders you know I'll take the extra five minutes and shave yeah no big deal yeah\nYeah well ah I tell you having facial hair if you have a young child can be hazardous\nHaving a young child period [laughter] that is true and that yeah yes let's ah when I had the moustache when my kids were just very very young when they were toddlers they would reach up and pull it allows them young like an image so ah\nAnyway it is national ... day so you know if you're inclined to get rid of the beard today's the day to do it I guess\nToday anyway ah let's see I was going to tell you about something here trick or treating in Virginia I'm I detect a dateline let me see if there's a dateline on this after it finishes loading up here Chesapeake, Virginia\nDid it did it did it did it did did you get better than thank you not that you were bad to start with that you're just enhancing it have been several\nTowns in eastern Virginia take their trick or treating very seriously\nIn fact if you're over the age of twelve you could land in jail if you're out asking for candy on Halloween Night okay if you're over too well OK\nAccording to Chesapeake, Virginia city code any person over the age of twelve who engages in trick or treat is quote guilty of a misdemeanor\nAnd she'll be punished by a fine of not less than twenty five dollars\nNor more than a one hundred dollars or by confinement in jail for not more than six months or both wow that really are they going through a Thirteen year old in jail that it isn't just isolated to Chesapeake according to a twenty Seventeen article by age are seen dot com Hampton\nA rather a major are seen dot com Hampton Newport News Norfolk and other cities in the area have similar laws\nSo with Halloween around the corner of the question is just how old is too old for trick or treat yeah good question yeah\nSo probably at twenty five to one hundred dollar fine I Would imagine that would be all they do they wouldn't for somebody to slam or for that would that they were Thirteen fourteen years old you hope and unless they were doing something else yeah you know along with it but yeah so yeah if you are\nIf you're thinking about the spending Halloween in Chesapeake, Virginia or or some of these other cities Hampton Newport News Norfolk some other cities\nOr around that region um you'd better be twelve or under if you're going to trick or treat\nYeah and we should point out Hampton, Virginia not Hampton\nYes Hampton, Virginia is not Hampton, Tennessee is um do you remember when you stop trick or treating how old you\nAre probably twelve Thirteen movie yeah fourteen or that it was a middle school junior high yeah\nWell it's just a good thing young man you weren't in Chesapeake, Virginia yeah than you might have gotten tossed in the old can yeah in the flavor and that's it [laughter] someone wanted to say [laughter]\nUm\nSo you know it made it begs the question how old is too old um yeah\nWe uh we don't get any trick or treaters were out in such a rural area mhm [noise] but uh I remember where I was raised up there in a cart accounting Hampton\nAh lived in a subdivision and we had trick or treaters out the ... I mean they were all over the place yeah and sometimes a once I got up about you know\nThirteen fourteen years old I Would hand out candy and some of those people that can't be more like in high school last winter they were [laughter] you know sixteen Seventeen years old and I'm like what do you do and you know some of them I knew you know they were out trick or treating and what what do you do and you know it was just getting some candy yeah so uh I don't know\nI guess it's something we need to ponder Halloween is two weeks less than two weeks away yeah sure how old is too old to trick or treat ... uh in my estimation\nOnce you get a over twelve you're probably too old during the great ... I don't know Thirteen something around that yeah yeah but ah especially if you come to the door and your six foot five or something like that that I don't know about that or if you park your trucking get\nAround [laughter] and and and you don't have a small small child I mean [laughter]\nIf you're by yourself and your parking garage and you figure freely that's too old yeah that sounds like a Jeff Foxworthy yeah yeah it really does [laughter]\nMm [laughter] so anyway interesting stuff out of Virginia about the trick or treat laws in certain areas that's that's another one of those laws it's probably been on the books for a while I'm sure it has yeah we just sometimes can be kinda humorous mhm well we have a show today did they tell you that whose study\nWhoever the proverbial they ... yeah please elaborate we do have a show today and\nAnd uh actually Kevin ...\nWhat's up in ... one of our new segments unit ... county and\nThings are hopping over there yeah I mean they really are ... and Ashley will tell us all about it\nJerry story you'll be here always interesting information veterans' benefits ease the veterans service officers\nFor Washington County and Mason will join us talking about James Burrows a spot on the hill kind of a spooky ... when I was always I have a thing\nSo all that coming up on the old show on this Thursday morning and a boy she only this morning forty three yeah and it could get a little cooler here to ... yeah yeah down around forty made up yeah uh but they were talking upper thirties probably so I don't think we're going to get quite that Chile but ah I've been wrong before\nBut uh it could be and the higher elevations we've seen some scattered for us this morning yeah on the old pumpkin or whatever else is outside\nWell let's get to the forecast and find out more and we'll talk to you later Richard okay Tim\nMetro PCS is now metro buy T Mobile [noise]\nNow you get new plants with unlimited high speed data months long fall into the mobile network check out the new metro buy T Mobile today and discovered the smarter way to get unlimited metro buy T Mobile\nDuring congestion the fraction of customers even greater than thirty five six per month than it is reduced the metro customers ministry speeds versus on the mobile customers video stream to forty percent available in some areas the store for details in terms of conditions\nThere is everybody and I said chili start here but a beautiful sunny and cool Thursday fall weather about sixty to sixty two down to thirty seven tonight little ... and if you look at a friday little quick warm up upper sixties here before next cold front arrives on Saturday and rights\nWe likely Saturday morning quick touches cool we're on Sunday really the coolest stay the fall season with temperatures in the low fifties Sunday afternoon I'm structure whether it be the world is Jeremy ... well\nWe have mostly clear skies a few like clouds around and forty three degrees here the gyms motorcycle studios at twenty minutes past six o'clock [noise]\n...

is your notice of separation from the armed services\nThe most important piece of it and you will have if you're a veteran\nIf you don't have it you need to find it yeah uh because all of these benefits are based on that right\nAh and there is a cost to have that done a and they will put the veteran designation on your driver's license and the VA recognizes this as a legal as legal proof of your military service okay now the problem is especially in this area\nBecause this is fairly new to Tennessee they've been doing it I think about three years\nOr they don't know about it oh so if you show it a lot of times they'll say well that's your driver's license and you have to point out where that veteran designation isn't in usually there is no problem\nYeah it's better than carrying a
