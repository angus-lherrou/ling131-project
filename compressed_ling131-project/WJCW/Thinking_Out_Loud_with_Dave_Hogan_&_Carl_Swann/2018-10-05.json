his team's got an opportunity to sure to play with these guys you know they struggled to beat science to last week they did and uh\nYou know that's why you put the gear on and you ... up and kick it off for them instead of just saying well on paper looks like this team's going to win so ... we'll just give them all yeah you don't do that and then uh yeah so the Indians ah\nWhen you when you count him out that's that's when there's sometimes the most dangerous so yeah and there's the you know they're still in position at at one in one and that the conference and you are to still have a a good finish\nAnd possibly still in the running for a home playoff game so when did they would go a long way to help him out\nYeah this next week or two here very important in the conference races ... games left in the regular season you know can you believe\nAnd man I'm telling you getting closer\nWell before we get to this morning's Mount Rushmore which is very timely considering the baseball playoffs okay\nUm I did want to pass along very unusual roadkill round up this morning oh okay uh I feel like that\nYou know normally it's a kind of run of the mill roadkill round up now pass on some yeah ... well not\nRaccoons aren't really now here and I actually saw a raccoon go across the road in front of me did ya this morning live one yes so that was our on our critic it was a critter county which a scurrying across the road it was down here on the old gray station\n... oh I had was a cat [laughter]\nI had a cat too but the most unusual thing and the roadkill roundup Donnan you rarely see this but I that's that's got to be what it was\nBecause I took a good look at it it was right in the middle of the road a coyote really a dead coyote on the road kill round that can you believe that somebody a evidently had hit the coyote and\nI'm usually don't see that and I took a good look I actually slowed down and look 'cause I thought was that a great dear mhm which\nYou know there are some great ... but to know as I got closer and I looked the legs were very long and that's why I thought it was a deer at first but then it was gray and uh I slowed down enough just went I don't know five or ten miles per hour and ... saw that it was in fact the coyote\nI ah I actually before we started our our critic count I actually saw two of them ... crossing nor thrown street just as I was turning off mount castle rode on nor thrown street coming out to the station one morning and two of them were running across North Ron straight to ...\nWell yeah yeah I didn't see the road runner anywhere meet me and no I didn't know if the I guess it was a traffic mishap their ... that the cost of the coyote and he didn't fall off a cliff\nIn seeing the acme sciency acme signs or\nBoxes or anything like that [noise] but yeah I thought that was very unusual yeah very very modest roadkill round it any way or the mount Rushmore everybody on the edge of their seat waiting for that\nI Know I Am yeah you hurry up I'm going to fall off this thing sitting right on the edge\nMount Rushmore we do it every Friday morning done and I discuss who were what would you put on the mount Rushmore of whatever that's the top four in any category and this morning I thought major league ballparks still in use now we're not talking about ballparks that aren't used anymore and\nGoing back in history but I thought a major league ballparks that are still in use\nSo think about that the top four and I know you probably don't want to hear this but now there's ... let me let me go ahead okay go ahead there's three that come to mind right away and well I figure there's one that you probably wouldn't have just\nBecause I Know I I yeah I'm I'm I even though I don't like the ball club by you know you still get it needs to get a count at Wrigley Field okay yeah Wrigley Field and in Fenway Park are probably right in the middle I Do have those to rent\n'em now Dodger Stadium okay um but then it becomes very difficult because so many ... ballparks have have been have been or the new ones have been opened up\nYeah but there's also with those new ones kind of a taste of this down with it too it's they've they've started building well they started this I guess was Camden Yards ballparks a little more like the old bump yeah but\nSee I still that's dislike Yankee you still have Yankee Stadium but what is this like the the second or third Yankee Stadium\nAnd I don't even have ... stadium closed because the old Yankee Stadium yes um this one you know um\nMaybe maybe what's the name of the is it what's the name of the field that the Indians play on progressive field now is that in that's a new one though too isn't it\nFairly new I think it came out of being an after Camden Yards their reds have got a new ballpark right river ... river friends have been there for a while know the ... you write American ball agreement with you all all you know what I Know which one I'm going to go with uh-huh I'm probably going to go with a Bush Stadium okay\nBecause that's been there for a long long time to well they they did a Bush Stadium out on on the same grounds yeah you did they rebuild a new one on the same ground yet what they did have pretty much yeah\nI don't know that they kept very much at all give me your gave me a for cause I'm just having a I've got those three are are solidly entrenched and I don't I'm having a hard time really coming up with a fourth that I really like well my ... I might only be able to put three on my mom Russian more this week\nMy other two you can't have a three headed Mount Rushmore now come on [laughter] it's my Mount Rushmore I can do whatever I Want oh okay [laughter] it's still in the construction phase yeah uh you're still carving another hey go um\nYou know this can be very subjective my other two are very subjective just because of my\nLikes that I've been to both and I enjoyed both got Fenway in and ran regularly and I also got PNC in Pittsburgh I think that's just a great ball ... again that's an old that's not an old ballpark that's that's a new or will it it well that's what I said though still in use ballparks that are still in\nYeah I Know I guess I guess my criteria for this is your criteria are a little different\nWell you know ones that are being used today still yeah yeah a pie and see 'em if you ever get a chance to go it's just a great ballpark I mean the setting is great right there by the river and the just all kinds of things they've done it that ballpark I just really\nOnly been there once really enjoyed it a Pittsburgh PNC man I've also of course because I think it's just a great ball park and there's not a bad seed in it upsets\nSense of sit and saying anyone trying to conjugate my verb your um ... all over the ballpark never had a bad seed and that's great American in Cincinnati and yeah that's subjective but yeah those are the four and close I've got Dodger Stadium as you mentioned yeah AT and T. and San Francisco\nThat's another park I'd really like to visit yeah\n[noise] um I'd like to go to San Francisco for a couple of reasons Alcatraz ... see the Golden Gate bridge and go to a giants game at PNC far I was hoping\nReally really hard a few years ago when I was still doing each issue women's basketball [laughter] we were going to the NC double a tournament this year that we ended up in Cincinnati plane Xavier ... I was really hoping that we would get a draw in San Francisco yeah make as I was I was\nAlready planning on on going to Alcatraz and I thought that that would just be a really cool place to visit but a alas we went to a bus ride to Cincinnati [laughter]\nThere are worse places you can go yeah but uh AT and T. S. at PNC but AT and T. park in San Francisco I'm also have Camden Yards clothes and I think it's a\nYou know it was kind of the first park that got away from the cookie cutter ... you know mhm cylinder co parks that were just circles and a astro turf and all that um [noise] and let's see what else did I have close Busch Stadium you mentioned which I've been to Bush to St Louis very nice yeah very nice ballpark\nAnd so those are the ones I had close I really\nI really did like my one visit to Miller Park\nUm while it was a very modern ballpark it it it just mix is a lot of the old with the new ...\nUm you know the the fact that that they put a retractable roof on there was was just incredibly smart on their part because number one you can still have an open air stadium when the weather is nice but because they depend on so much of their attendance from people who drive\nI I used to have a three hour plus Dr when I went down to Milwaukee ... if you drove all that way and then you had bad weather\nYou know that's that's pretty inconvenient and there were people who came from further away than that yeah and so to be able to go to the ball game no you can watch a game in comfort ... and not have to worry about the weather I mean that that's a huge plus for them\nCongolese doctrine McGregor has treated victims of sexual violence ... who was a captive of the Islamic state group and who became a spokeswoman for Yazidi women abused by ISIS suck futures currently down slightly investors hoping for a good jobs report on Michael Toscano\nHe's\nGood morning news times six thirty one I'm done Helmand was W.

is in the market for a mortgage or may anticipate they may in the near future\nThis is the show that you need to listen to Rogers demand there too you said he wanted to talk today about some things that affect the actual interest rate that you may qualify for on your mortgage\nThat's a there's a there's a lot of factors obviously there are certainly impinge on that show a lead off what what are what are some of the things\nWill if if and I I Want to talk about this because when folks call at any lander any bank and say what's your interest rate which are thirty year fixed rate\nThese factors you're going to understand by the end of this segment or why you're not going to get a true right wow there's no way to determine that I'm One of the first things that uh that affects the interest rate that you actually gives the type of product\nThat your ah your going with that fit your needs that you qualify for um\nFor example if a J make may\nIs normally a or VA the government products are generally a little bit lower interest rate than conventional okay\nA conventional Fifteen year fixed is is better than a third lower than the thirty year fix so ... that loan products type definitely can affect the interest rate that you actually qualify for so that's important information so that's sort of the overall umbrella of the first step\nYeah exactly because each agency each product has their own set\nOf adjustments and things that they look at and whether they're backed are not as far as insured mortgage insurance from that agency so there's a lot of factors that that loan product
