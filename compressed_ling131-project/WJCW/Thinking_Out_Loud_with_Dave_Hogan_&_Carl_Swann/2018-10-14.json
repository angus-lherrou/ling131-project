I I Will do already knows I hear I I and\nIt's just amazing how because he was so centered in who got is that um he was trying to do so again the platform for influence is strength\nAnd that's what I I think husbands look at I don't\n... I hate to talk in stereotypes because every marriage is its own story but since I get together with guys a lot they love to brag about their what\nThey look they look up to that and and it might be different things you might be a great athlete you might be great with money she might be a great ... lawyer she might newer Bible backwards and forwards you just might be so social you know and if the husband particularly is a big ... that that can be a big thing\nBut ultimately I think that's what you're looking at\nAs you seek to influence your husband say what am I bring into the equation here because it's never you don't want to get to the point of our marriage will be better when you get your act together it's always got to be the both than all improve my marriage when I approve me\nBut let's highlight that because that's an easy way for our flushed to take us when you get your act together then will be a better couple 'cause my act has already together what about for that woman and I'm I'm sensitive to this for the woman who is trying hard she's the wife that has been doing some of these fundamentals that we've talked about in the first part of the program here\nBut there is that feeling like I'm the only one putting effort into this so to speak to that woman who says okay you're I hear what you're saying you know I got to be the best me I can be in Christ\nBut man I've been doing that and it's still in their excuse the grammar\nLet me make a distinction here gym because I think it's important I Do believe as painful as it is for me to say this\nThat they're rather than trying to save some marriages or some marriages that women need to be safe from\nIn the case of real abuse or dangerous situations or I don't want a woman to hear this and say okay I just need to focus on myself so let acknowledging that good I ... I interviewed a number of women one of them was a woman that I think a similar type of woman you're describing\nHer husband was so uninvolved at home it was so frustrated he was always fishing\nAnd then she kept talking I says well fishing season is almost over\nForgetting to tell her that hunting season comes right after fishing season and then he was so involved in war and she was so disappointed you said I I'm ashamed to admit this but I found myself praying lord I Hope you'll have an affair or die so there's a biblical way out she saw in a way for her marriage\nTo be improved or Satan and she was just miserable but as a committed believers she felt like well I don't have a reason to leave his not abusing me he hasn't been unfaithful\nAnd she prayed through it and this was seems severe to some so I just wanted knowledge that as we go in she came up with what she called the magic question and it was a shock she went he came home when she said what do you want me to do for you that I'm not doing\n... she hated asking that question she pushed back with the lord saying\nHe should be asking me that question there are doesn't things he should be doing that he's not\nAnd his answer made or even angrier he said I Want you to be in a better mood when you get home\n[laughter] and she's asking me to do more laundry asked me to paint the house as me to replace the route don't ask me to be in a better mood if you had my life you wouldn't be in a better mood either but she realized you know what I make him pay for my frustration every time he comes home I let them know how unhappy I Am how frustrated I Am with everybody\nAnd so she said okay I just got put this in my mind I'm just going to try to do it and she did it\nAnd then she asked him again and and he gave her something else that had to do with the kids and his first again she was you're the absent father and you're telling me how to be a better mother but what he said\nWas true and renewed or relationship with one of her daughters in particular she had a blind spot and that's just what we always have to remember just because their spouse is wrong doesn't make us right you can be wrong in a hundred different direction you can miss a target north south east or west but that doesn't mean because somebody sitting at north you're not missing itself\nAnd then what happened\nWhen she began to make those changes her husband came along and he began to change as well I actually just heard from her last week they're celebrating their forty fourth wedding anniversary she said it's never been better\nAnd so it's going back to this year the easiest\nPerson to change this focus on the family broadcast will continue in just a moment [noise]\nWho do I perform for [noise]\nEither find ...

get that right it's not what you can do to make me feel better [laughter] so that's important uh Gary women can get frustrated with their husbands because their husband has something you call functional six at this\nWhat is it and how does that typically play out in a marriage functional six at this\nI Want to give the credit here to Dr ... he wrote a she's the one that introduced me to the idea she seen it with a lot of couples but functional fix it and is in a sentence is this it describes a husband who isn't motivated by your pain\nHe's only motivated by his pain it's a spiritual maturity but here's where wives miss it if they don't understand what's going on they keep expressing their husband this hurts me this frustrates me this is confusing would you please stop doing it and then they're doubly hurt when he knows it hurts her\nAnd he keeps doing it he knows it frustrates Ernie keeps doing it and so she's like I got to find another way to express it how do I\nHelp them understand it the challenge isn't that he doesn't get it the challenge is he's not motivated by her bank\nHe's only motivated by his pain now let me say a mature godly man would be motivated by his wife's pain not every wife is married to mature godly man his disciples ship if he is a believer it hasn't reached to how he's treating his wife\nPrematurely or with or it's a crisis affecting more than half a million dollars each year you can help joining volunteers like\nToo much\nMay be overcome challenges\nI think strong and healthy\nIf women understand the power they have in God's the affirmation they haven't got the he's called them to rule\nAnd really we're called elsewhere in scripture first Peter in other places that we are kings and queens were royalty before God and so act like a queen in your home desserts respect who can have influence and God made to rule along with her husband\nThat scary Thomas with reminder that you have a significant role in the life of your husband Gary is our guest again today on focused on the family and your hosted focus president and author gym daily I'm John solar John last time we started great discussion reminding wives of\nThe tremendous influence they have on their husbands it was a good reminder for all of us that you can't change your spouse but you can influence them and there's a distinction that our guest Gary Thomas brought to that discussion if you missed it get to download because I think there is a lot of meat\nIn our talk about the wives and how they can better manage the environment of their marriage and I think have a different attitude\nThat is healthier more biblical and honoring of Christ and this isn't a pick on the wives day [laughter] I Know it's like a three guys talking about women no it's not like it better but our guest Gary Thomas has written a wonderful book loving him well and there's just some ... simply put great insight in there\nAnd uh I I Believe we really are excavated than information last time we are going to continue the excavation work today I don't know why I'm On an archaeological digs here but uh I think it was wonderful information here focus we want to help you

here if you'd like to call is eight hundred a family\nGary has been a one of our most popular guests over the past number of years and he's married to his wife Lisa so he really studies the scripture east study history he takes all of that into his own marriage and then he comes out with some great stories and\nSay hey look we did mention last time we went into some depth this idea of changing your husband versus influencing your husband give us just a quick recap so we can reset with new listeners today what the concepts about\n... I Believe the difference is that when you think about changing your husband you're only going to be happy based on something he does influence focuses on what you do partnering with God to be a positive influence\nTo be a nurturing influence and by example calling your husband to become the man that God created him to be as a husband as a father as a son is a friend as a worker and gone to can in fact\nYou're there's so much great content in your book loving them well I I didn't get to this last time I don't want it to its a quote I hate quoting back to the author of book but let me do it on\nPage thirty six you said this what if your husband's faults are God's tools to shape you what if the very thing that most bugs you about your spouse constitutes God's Plan to teach you something new oh seriously\nGear that is so\nStinking convicting [laughter] I mean you had to come up with that huh\nWell and it goes beyond marriage to how God can give you the perfect kid that knows exactly what button to push and in law or somebody at work and and the main thing is learning again I Can't change those around me\nBut I can be changed by interacting with those\nAround me now I Do think they're destructive relations I Need to walk away from that often the ones that most frustrate me point out one of my own weaknesses because I'm contributing to the problem and I I Want to be stronger I Want to be wiser I Want to be a redemptive influence\nBut I look at relationships sort of like practicing none of us have arrived\nNone of us are completely mature none of us are completely Christ like and so when we interacting with the typical person some of their spouse in okay\nI'll give myself a B minus there but here's what I did I think next time I can get a B plus and so you're just looking at that God is growing you as you learn to deal with your spouse and those ... and it's such a\nGreat a lens to view it through it takes you out of bitterness which is not healthy and it puts you in a different position is okay what is the Lord's teaching in this tough moment\nIn fact ... again you mentioned a scripture that you know we breeze through and you have captured it to say no focus the light on this is James three to where it says we all stumble in many ways and you mentioned book how that kind of revolutionized how you thought about this\nWhy how did it revolutionize you're thinking\nI have probably talked about that verse forty hours in my lifetime if I were to add up all the marriage seminars and the books I put that in it it's been in every marriage booking in blog posts and whatnot\nAnd it still I forget\nEveryone was stumble in many ways as all of us stumble in many ways there is no exception nobody gets to marry the fourth member of the trinity that person doesn't exist and we know that intellectually but sometimes in our hearts we resent it\nWas okay lord I Know my spouse has to stumble why does he have to stumble in that way or why can't she stumble in this way and so we think how much easier it would be and I just point out if you marry someone else they may not symbol and this way but they're going to find another way to stumble because the Bible says we are\nStumble in many ways one thing the Bible is so clear about we have to get it there's only one hero in scripture\nAnd that's Jesus I mean every major character David\nHe wouldn't qualify as an elder in any Baptist church that I Know when people read his history and that is true and Moses I mean every one of 'em Peter ... every one of them has these things that just make us cringe and God is bold enough to say\nHe's still a man after my own heart you know and I would say the wives can you look at a man who stumbles as David stumbled and have guts hard to say man he blew it here he blew it there he stumbles here\nHe's still a man has my heart you know that's the tough thing but that's the supernatural grace of God we need to realize that we need to receive that graze the more that I Know how God gives me grace I can give grades to others if I haven't got it\nThat I live by grace that I make myself the euro God loves me because I don't do that got accepts me because I've learned not to do that then I asked the same of other people but when I accept that Jesus is the only here on the Bible Jesus only hero today\nI've received grace I'm just so much more likely to give grace and Jim I Know people it was what people expect to pass or to say but for me\nI Can't love my wife and others well if I'm not spending time at the beginning of the day receiving affirmation from\nGod when that really does a point test toward the disciplines that allow us to do that in one of the things you encourage women to do is to form their heart towards their husbands through prayer\nThat can be hard to do when you're feeling this emotional separation when you're feeling antagonistic toward your husband\nReally how do I prefer a guy and I really don't like I Know I got to love them but I don't like him right now so to speak through that how that is so fundamentally important that you have a time of prayer for your husband just you\nDoesn't have to be with your husband um probably better if he's not there but they speak to that discipline and what has gained through prayer for your husband\nFirst will be talking about the danger of prayer\nIf you go into prayer with a list of your husband's weaknesses and spend twenty minutes or ringing God about how this has to change and he's making you miserably you're going to come out of that prayer sick in your heart toward your husband\nThat doesn't really help I'm always mindful when I'm Talking to got about my wife\nI'm Talking about his daughter I've never got I have\nTwo daughters so powerful the ... and it was like okay I got I'm I'm Talking about your daughter and I know you love her and I know you get it but ...\nIs it just changes my attitude and it takes chain on my approach now on the positive and ... and now they're from my wife when of her favorite things to be Saturday morning she goes is huge farmers' market and everything's locally sourced than are\nNormally does it or whatever it either [laughter] and six dollars for a dozen eggs um [laughter] but they're happy chickens right right\nAnd they have videos that show that they live happy lives [laughter] so every Friday night I have to go to the ATM machine and and get cash because [laughter] I Walk behind her carrying the food and and and showing up but\nCarrying let let me explain this in her brain\nShe expresses empathy by marrying a person's distress and concern because she click for what they call the M. and m's form of emotional processing what that is is that she shows concerned by marrying it back\nI hear you I understand even ... yes I mean everything within or that's how her brain is registered to express empathy\nA child with a Boo Boo oh you've got to go I can see genes base\nRight sanity [laughter] oh yeah that that all the male brain expresses empathy by process that scientists called cognitive empathy which means we're motivated to stop the problem we want to stop what's causing your pain\nAnd to stop what's causing the pain we don't have time to show empathy right okay you've given me the information I Know I'm going to hurt us you I'm going to stop it\nNow that's not what most wise want but I think that's where you go to your girlfriends and your sister and your mom or even your daughter to get that but your husband is expressing concern by trying to fix the problem now for the men listening here's what I found to deal with this divide\nI've learned because this is what expresses concern to my wife when she expresses something that's really bothering her\nThat's not the moment for me to fix it that's the moment for me to say now I'm Sorry and to draw her out and then that oh yeah I see that and and to be curious she\nFeels loved when I show empathy and more curiosity not stopped talking it's usually tell me more but then I come back later in the day at least two hours I've been thinking about this I've been praying about it what if we did this\nThen she just seems more willing to receive it because she felt heard but what I Want wise to here is is because I Know a lot of why sometimes you feel this with your son's\nYeah you have an adolescent son and he's hurting and you want a smothering him you want to hug him or kiss him and he pushes you away\nAnd you know how that hurts because you're thinking I Want to show you I care and he won't let you care why there's a new way yeah that's how she interpreted why doesn't he loved me [noise] that's exactly how your husband feels when he's trying to stop your pain and you resent him for it\nHe feels like he's given you a hug it's his neurological form of a hug and you're rejecting it you don't want your husband to feel bad\nFor wanting to show up the heat is showing embassy he's just showing it in a different way so for the men listening let's learn to show empathy and curiosity and for the women listening but\nDon't discount the male version of showing empathy if we would just understand the way our brains work instead of resenting each other we can work toward each other God made us complement I'm Glad the world has both forms of brain we want the people who say I really care that you're hurting\nBut I'm thankful for the people that says yeah but I can fix that [laughter] you know ...\nThe one where you've got going right now she's coaching me on this is my ability to finish her sentence on fixing the diversity because she'll say you know the other day with her and she'll go into a story and then she'll struggle for that word also to do this\nTo do that [laughter] she probably wouldn't read said let me finish my sentencing [laughter] it is a struggle for me\nIt's my fix that mentality let me just move faster let me move it along\nWe are so similar [laughter] I'm thinking what are the scripts I have\nRunning these days is just be quiet don't ask anything just let her process because Dina likes to just throw it all out there and talk and I get lost sometimes and it has been helpful for her to know\nThat if you'll just shorten things up or let me just pared back to what I think you're saying it's so much more beneficial to the both of us but it's hard work on both parties to understand that's how he's wired that's how she's wired\nYeah and to respect God's\nDesign that we just the natural human tendency is if somebody is different we think they're worse we looked down on the different because men are different than women women fault men for being different when you think about it put it in a medical procedure if you're going in for a medical procedure you want one person was great bedside manners\nBoy this must be painful yeah we're going to be there everything's going to be okay don't worry but when it comes to the surgeon\nI I don't care if he or she even talks to me\nMy son had surgery with just brilliant surgeon it was this Asian woman he had to have his hand worked on she goes here's my first thing if this works this is what I Want to do if that doesn't work I'm going to do this and here's the third thing but this is the first I thought man I'm so glad she's working on my son and she got a gun I just want competence I Want somebody to fix his hand\nAfter he's done he want somebody to say can I get your ice\nHow you're feeling patting them on the shoulder I'm Glad they're both kinds of people in the world and so marriage is about that men are different than women and that's by God's designed and\nGary said this but we sometimes it's a I don't mean this disrespect fully but it can be a bit of a throwaway comment that of course men need to learn to listen to their wise but what does that look like practically for us how do we how do we stop trying to fix it and how do we lean in and and really do that what's the teaching for us here\nLook I I feel like a bit of a hypocrite because we're on three decades over three decades into my marriage and I'm Still really trying to learn it I think I'm getting a little bit better but for me\nI have to learn not to go with my natural reaction when you get the urge the fact that yeah I says okay this isn't the time to solve it I'm going to try to if somebody is bothering her something's happening but it's first okay I what I found a gym that helps me is tell me more\nCuriosity expresses love\nTo my to my wife and I I'm Pam feral really helped me understand this how or why still loved when we're more curious and that that just that one word just say okay Gary ... curious ... isn't that what makes\nA woman feel so loved when she's dating\nReally tell me what happened or we don't even more to add on and so I just found from my wife to fill cherish I I Want to be curious I I Want to draw route instead of give me the Reader's Digest version I Want to make time for the amplified version or so I can really hear if I ask more questions\nOn it but even then I had to learn now why does that hurt you I think I'm being curious and she thinks that's a challenge so it's really learning to read your wife and just say lord helped me with my words to show that I really care about this and I really feel for\nYour you've said it and I hope the program the last couple of days has been helpful particularly for those wives who have struggled and who have felt they\nThey're in marriages that are isolated they they feel like they're ... they're not going anywhere maybe they've already um since that resentment that bitterness taking them over emotionally\nThis is for you and we're here for you to focus on the family and we have a great counseling department they can kinda get that discussion going confidentially don't need to worry about that we also have an intensive marriage program called hope restored if you're in

[noise]\n\n[noise] and handle search saying good bye I'm Christopher cruise search and rescue teams continue to comb through the devastation rocked by hurricane Michael on the Florida Panhandle this week\nAt least Eighteen people were killed a number that is certain to rise power lines and trees are still laying in roadways in areas hit the hardest by the hurricane\nRestoration rolling in Panama City with little if any access to food and water where everybody just worried about surviving you know some residents say they haven't seen or heard much from FEMA or any government official\nWe had heard anything about the rise in the ... anything about that you know\nI'm guessing that's going to take a little while female administrator Brock Long pleading for patients from any one affected by the storm stating that it was one of the most powerful since the Eighteen fifty he says recovery will take time Clinton leveled Panama City Florida\nA mental and there's a little bit of central planning and the new NAFTA but largely at the same as the one before and investors broadly like that\nLet's talk for a minute or two now about the Federal Reserve and John many Americans of course of her to the Federal Reserve a lot of folks maybe don't quite understand how it operates in what impact it has so just very briefly what impact does the Federal Reserve actually have on our economy and how does it tried to manage it\nI'm One of these people and I'm somewhat of an outlier here I've\nLong believed in I wrote a book about it called who needs the fed I I think the feds impact on the economy is vastly overstated the fed exist as a lender of last resort to solvent banks but it can't really do that but you know solve the bank would ever go to the fed for a loan it'd be an admission\nThe than also regulates banks but I Can't really do that very effectively as two thousand eight reminds us and then of course it aims to set the overnight rate which banks lend to one another button interest rates price like any other you don't need the fed for that and so I think the feds impact has vastly over and people say well you know they're going to\nReduce interest rates and that's going to use that credit that's the equivalent of ... saying in New York how apartment rents are too high I'm going to reduce how much landlords couldn't charge for apartments all he would do is just cause scarcity\nAnd the same way if markets actually responded the fed the fed can at best cause scarcity by trying to artificially lower rates below what they normally hit in the marketplace\nSo my point is is is we in the real economy we largely act as the fed doesn't exist that that sort of an ... that sort of an outlier position but I Believe it will be increasingly common place in the coming years\nThe fed has been on a rate increase I won't say binge because they've been doing it in smaller increments this past week it did seem to get her the markets a little bit will the fed raising the the rates will that caused the economy to cool off or given your previous comment cereal really don't think it's going to have much impact in the long run\nNo I don't think it will have much of an impact it all let's remember the fed kept rates low at about Syria or the rate at at him set for years and years for basically two thousand nine until what about twenty Fifteen or twenty sixteen there is no major economic boom during that time the fed can change reality when when we're when we go to the market\nTo borrow money we're borrowing access to real resources to trucks tractors computers desks chairs most of all human labor\nThat that can expand the amount of that available I Can't make these resources cheap and so I think the answer is is to always remind ourselves with\nThe fed is just another entity try and influence things not very well\nWe have been talking with John ... who is the director of the center for economic freedom at freedomworks drawn towns have been about freedomworks also where can bugs go on the Web to get more information from you\nFreedomworks is a wonderful organization based in Washington DC that makes the essential point that Washington is not going to change in less politicians realize that they're the voters are changing that they basically see what they're doing\nAnd your website is\nW. W. W. freedomworks dot org\nJohn Tammany freedomworks John thank you for being here thanks for having me Andy route that the club for growth keeping an eye on what's been a fascinating last few weeks in the nation's capital to say the least dandy good to have you here\nHi thanks for having me lemon\nBrett Kavanaugh's now and associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United states but the political ramifications likely are going to be felt for weeks as we head into the general election Andy is the Kavanaugh\nConfirmation process is this going to be an overall plus for Republicans\nWell it it is so far I mean obviously we get a a conservative justice that will help\nMake the court of conservative majority that could last for very long time and who knows Trump may even get another pick\nBefore the end of his first term but with regards to politics there's evidence that Republican voter enthusiasm has picked up you saw some recent polls that showed\nThat the percentage of voters who think this election is very important used to be D plus ten meaning the Democrats are ten percent more enthusiastic to vote Republicans\nAnd that has shrunk to D plus too since the Kavanaugh fight so if for Republicans show up at the polls was just as much enthusiasm as Democrats\nThan the Republicans will keep the house and they will likely add to the Senate majority so the cabinet thing as a big deal and let me point out that the Democrats want to politicize it to the Jerry ... a house Democrat\nHe said that if the Democrats are in charge he will be the chairman of the Judiciary Committee and he said his first thing will be to invest the cabin all and I assume the next thing they do is going to try and impeached jump so that they're going to certainly keep Republican\nVoters motivated to to make sure that doesn't happen\nSo it's it's an odd thing when both parties agree to fight over the same issue\nKevin ... of course as you mentioned here is going to be a major issue heading into the election seems to be really energizing Republicans of course the Democrats were if you follow the conventional wisdom Andy energized anyhow so that they need Kavanaugh is probably a ... a net plus for Republicans but Andy\nUsually as Jim Carville once famously said it's the economy stupid so let's talk for a second in our interview just prior to our discussion we talked about the fact that unemployment is at the lowest ever since the Nineteen sixties the economy is urging shouldn't this be a net loss for Republicans\nYes it should and I think it it is I think it is helping them like you said on Portman is at a fifty year low I mean I think that's absolutely remarkable for those of us who have lived\nDuring the Reagan boom years and the Clinton boom years and the first part of the George Bush boom years this is better than all of those the unemployment rates down at three point seven percent which is a remarkable statistic and Trump is getting very little credit for that\nNow granted Trump is getting in his own way\nUh with his tariffs they are holding the economy back a little bit and that's unfortunate if he were able to get rid of those I think the economy would soar even higher and then one thing that is in his fault is the Federal Reserve is\nRaising interest rates as they should because rates have been artificially low for a decade since the financial crisis so it's well past time that that the rate started joining up the good news though is that you want to raise rates\nDuring and in an economy so that it doesn't get overheated and so that you can just have a steady climb up words so my hope is that that's exactly what we're experiencing now\nIn a ... a few short weeks people are going to vote with their pocket I don't know if that will be the overwhelming thing that makes their decision but when they know that they're getting a steady paycheck and things are looking good voters tend to vote that way and and they support the the people who helped make that happen\nThe Democrat playbook since the economy is going so well for Republicans Andy seems to be to try and put the focus back on healthcare I personally live in a congressional district that's highly competitive there are a lot of scare ads being put out by Democrats and they seem to be wanting to focus on the whole issue of pre existing conditions\nAnd you explain exactly where we stand on preexisting conditions and why are the Democrats making this such an issue\nThis is a classic case it'd be a good political science to study for college students but\nThe Democrat Party has always been considered the mommy party or the the soft softer gentler party they want to protect people they want to make sure that from cradle to grave that the government takes care for them in some way\nAnd this includes people with pre existing conditions making sure that they get health insurance now of course the GOP as villain eyes saying oh they wanna keep sick people sick\nBut the truth is is that pre existing conditions does come with the cost when you ask voters if people should be covered for for pre existing conditions they overwhelmingly say yes but then when you complete that sentence and you say well do you support people\nBeing covered for pre existing conditions if you knew\nThat everybody else has to pay higher premiums to pay for that coverage\nThan support collapses now that's a difficult message for Republicans to communicate in thirty second TV ads versus Democrats who can easily create a message in thirty seconds saying that Republicans are evil for not wanting people with pre existing conditions to be covered by insurance\nNow Republican solutions to this there are several and\nAre very good ideas at getting people covered with insurance who have pre existing conditions but the ... the Democrat version is through just mere government force the federal government through Obamacare will mandate\nThat insurance cover insurance companies cover pre existing conditions\nThere is no other way for premiums to stay low if you if the government forces that mandate it forces premiums to go high which is why you see that happening with Obamacare\nAndy robbed at the club for growth and Andy a couple of words about the club\nYou bet the club for growth as a membership organization out of Washington DC but we have over a quarter of a million members from all across the country from all walks of life from all fifty states in the union if your listeners are interested they can go to our website uh WWW dot club for growth dot org and if they like what they see they can join for free\nThis battle was more than just the battle for Supreme Court nomination is about the very struggle for survival of the freedoms that we use cells in the bill of rights and for weeks sergeant major Kennedy and millions of others fought\nAll of us in the military and government take the same oath of office to support and defend the constitution of the United states of America the conduct of the senators attacking Kavanaugh on here saying in your window for political gain was disgraceful\nThose senators victimized justice Kevin ... Dr Ford and all of us for political gain\nIn a different type of battle equally as important to when justice Kevin know fought to protect\nThe very fabric of the constitution he has sworn to defend by not backing down he convinced me of his moral courage in the face of unwavering criticism\nWere the primary underpinnings in any civilized societies the presumption of innocence this nonsense that the presumption of innocence did not apply because it was a job interview is a travesty is a travesty inflicted by the opposing side a pundit very character\nOf a person and our nation it was a sad day for our entire nation and those of us who fought\nTo defend this nation and our constitution your bill of rights and common law the sheer ... of their arguments fell on deaf ears of those of us who had to defend while in the military the character of our nation and our people elected leaders of which I Am now one have a responsibility to be statesmen first\nAnd politicians second the travesty the conduct of those opposing Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court cast shame and dishonor on the institution which they were elected to serve\nFortunately others in the Senate stood firm\nAnd upheld the societal framework of the presumption of innocence those brave senators were stood tremendous pressure to conform to very precepts of the constitution\nThat they had been sworn to uphold when a nation centered citizens into combat and into the military as a moral responsibility to support and defend that same constitution\nThe military supported in harm's way where's elected leaders are obligated to support the constitution and the halls of Congress both arenas are critical if our nation is just survive only through our emphasis on self sacrifice moral courage\nAnd a personal accountability we're a nation survive our founding fathers left us a wonderful legacy what we do with that legacy is our decision an hour or so loan for the American radio journal this is Frank Ryan\nAmerican radio journal is hurt on public affairs minded radio stations all across the country they include W.

confidence in God crushed and God even closeness to guard which is more than ... piety because it is a deeply felt conviction on which you bank your life that's face when did his faith in God\nContrary to what some people say and think faith does not\nEliminate fear faith in God takes fear and channels it in the right direction fear destroys and face saves\nFace saves people by overcoming a frenzy of fear which is unhealthy and destructive turning the face of fear in the right direction which is called God\nFace turns people away from themselves toward God it may sound unrealistic and foolish to some people but actually it's the only real an intelligent way to live I Wish I could tell you how often I prayed with\nPeople who were scared to death as someone close to them was being carried into a hospital unconscious and placed into the intensive care unit hovering between life and death the whole family stood around in the horn way young and old not knowing which way to turn all kinds of fears were all over the place\nAnd we prayed to God quietly confidently altogether you have to experience something like this to feel the piece that settles on that scene fears may still be there but they are no longer in control something else has taken their place\nFace takes over and people put their fears into the hands of God\nThat is not just a religious feelings are pious talk when fear is so thick that you can cut it with a knife face cuts through and then there's light to again no matter what may happen there is gone where God is no fear\nGod is our refuge and strength of a president help trouble therefore we're not we fear though\nThe earth be removed and do the mountains we carried into the mix of the sea faith\nIn God punishes pier and pointed in the right direction the direction is toward God\nFear of God becomes a healthy thing when you have faith in God with faith in God and a godly fear that goes very well with face people begin to see things again with a clear I entered take things with a clear mind it's a good thing to fear the devil but you've got to know where he's at\nWith faith in God you know where he's at\nThe great thing about God is that he shows us where he's at where the devil is at and where we are at in relation to God and to all the forces which arise to deceive into trouble lost the great God sent his son Jesus Christ into the work\nHe really came the story is there for all they hear all to read all to see their mysteries about God that none of us understands\nAnd mysteries about Christ that nobody can explain but there's no mystery about who Christ is and what price did there's no mystery about who crashed isn't money's always doing he died for the sins of the whole world he did that for all of us\nThat's gone doing his thing in his son Jesus Christ\nFor the sake of his son the great guard for gave us the citizens of our humanity whatever they are ... give us some all he does this for the sake of his son who died for us\nAs a sure sign that God forgives\nThe great God raised his son from the dead and gave him a name above every name that at the name of Jesus every ... should ... it takes place about the need to Jesus\nIt takes face to ask God for forgiveness and it takes ... to except his forgiveness for the sake of Jesus Christ it takes faith in Christ\nWhich is not content just to say nice things about God and about Christ but actually powers the need before him it takes place to see yourself both as a saint and the center and the site of God said by faith in God's great height and moved into the right direction by a holy fear of\nGod which is cruel recognition of your own humanity along with love for God which has plenty of room for hold some all of his sovereign power and just overwhelming grace\nAll of which you see in his I'm Jesus Christ\nFaith in God that he is truly a father intended as a father on saving you rather than destroying you\nProduces a new kind of personality with love for God combined with fear of God and fear of God combined with love of God with that kind of personality you can draw close to God as he has grown close to you\nYou're perfectly content to go along with God with faith and fear and a lot of producing a new maturity without really healthy outlook on life that's what Martin Luther was talking about when he explained the ten commandments we should fear and love and trust in God above all things we should\nFear and love God that we may tame our cursing and swearing and crabbing and sharp and filthy times\nWe should fear and love God that we may offer him acceptable worship and praise we should fear and love God that we may honor respect love and obey every proper authority including parents\nWe should fear and love God that we may stop murdering people not simply with guns and knives but with a loving and hateful words and deeds\nWe should fear and love God that all of our thoughts words and actions may be sexually pure and clean which should fear and love God that we may not engage in the grand larceny or slander whereby we Rob people are very good names\nWhich should fear and love God that we may not craven covered what we can never own or possess we could live that way in fear of God and a lot for God we can do that by faith which is born at the foot of the cross of God son Jesus Christ\nThat's
