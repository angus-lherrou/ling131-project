[laughter] and I was\nTeaching Sunday school at Duke or Sunday and so I was up there with a broom having fun with that and yeah but anyway that's what I Would put up there and then another one that comes to mind to me is Nineteen sixty nine yeah the amazing mix\nYeah those are the two of the first one sixty nine minutes are over the ... and that was that was really\nA pretty impressive just the fact that the Mets were there but they beat the ... a very good oils team with a great pitching staff ... hundred nine when Orioles a beat him four games to one\nIn sixty nine and and like you say the uh Nineteen Ninety reds over the uh\nThe ace for nothing um another one I was thinking of was the uh eighty seven World Series with the twins over the cardinals yeah the ones that was an upset ... with just eighty five wins cardinals Ninety five game winners\nAre twins one that won four four games to three and that was probably one of the few times that you'll find me\nUm that you find me actually ah\nActually pulling for the and a team from Minnesota [laughter] um because I just disliked the cardinals that much um there were several other really good ones\nUm [noise] I I think um\nYou could go back and look at the sixty pirates over the Yankees in a four games to three uh that was a big one but I think I'm going to go with my fourth I think is gonna be the Florida Marlins over the Yankees games to two in two thousand three is my fourth\nYeah yeah I had that one in the in the top for um\nI was I was playing around with the idea that eighty seven twins as well um [noise] I don't know the sixty pirates I think the way it ended was certainly a dramatic with my ... home run down thing now um but uh you know four games to three I don't know is that enough senators and just\nWell it's still an obvious that because the cardinals you know the twins with eighty five wins nobody gave him any kind of a chance of winning that series ... and so despite the fact that was it was only four games to three\nNow if you want to say impressive upsets you know\nOr astonishing upsets you know for nothing for games won but just the fact that the twins one that series I think is at puts it in that the other one the other series that that I had just on the edge was in Nineteen eighty eight the Dodgers over the ... who can forget\nKirk Gibson coming in as a pinch hitter\nBarely able to to to run and hitting that home home run and which game was that was a game to them on a game one that's right\nIt's amazing what something like that can do to jumpstart a team in the world yeah yeah that really got the ... of course her ... her was pitching out of his mind yeah at that time and he just kind of picked him up on his shoulders after Kirk Gibson who never had another bad in that\nWorld no I if if I was going to place that series in my top for I Would remove the Marlins over the Yankees I Would still keep the twins over the cardinals in there\nYeah I uh I had Nineteen eighty eight and ... for his well\nOkay I just think that uh and it's interesting the days were such heavy favorites in eighty eight eighty nine and Ninety yeah and they only won one of 'em they asked the earthquake series in eighty nine when they beat the giants yeah\nSo I had a ... night and these are fairly recent you know if you if you go way back I'm sure there's\nProbably bigger ups and yeah I was looking at a list and and they you know of course the Nineteen sixties they had they had the Nineteen fourteen Braves over the ace in for\nUm I wasn't around back then Braves neither was I Braves were moss the Boston Braves or dead last in the national league on July Fourth before flipping the switch and going Seventy and Nineteen to finish the year\nAnd then uh Seventy in Nineteen Seventy Nineteen to finish the year and that's getting it done and then a Nineteen oh six the white socks over the cubs four games to two so when if you want to go way back um those those were listed in this\nThe list of top World Series upsets that I came across okay when I was doing a little bit of research on it\nI Will go a sixty nine minutes yeah Nineteen Ninety reds Nineteen eighty eight Dodgers and Nineteen eighty seven twins okay and I'm like I said closes the sixty and the two thousand three\nYeah you know I think I'm going to go ahead and replace a the two thousand three with the with the ADA Dodgers I'll I'll go with the same for you and then have two thousand three Marlins over\nThe Yankees just on the edge and other than the same thing sixty so we're we're in agreement this more now I don't know if it's just a if it's just because we both been off for a while and came back or if it's just a I don't know why don't you know ... you know it happens every night and you don't maybe it's just 'cause it's [laughter]\nOkay I'm not going to play the whole thing that I Love that one more time of it\nYou know in one more faucet Ninety seven Marlins uh went over the Indians was considered an ups yeah it was because the Indians were everybody thought will man they're just they're going to storm in and when the thing easily and the Marlon\nSo that was kind of the uh retool Marlins and they hadn't been around for but just for four years you know\nThe ah the list that I had pulled up um was listed in um was it was a list of the top ten World Series upset so um that that
