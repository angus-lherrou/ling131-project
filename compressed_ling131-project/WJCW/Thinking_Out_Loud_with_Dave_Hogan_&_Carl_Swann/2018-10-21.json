I put off having kids and how I get adjusted yeah\n... ... am I going to hurry up and have children or am I just can't let it go and be ...\nOf the time that is connected to our biology\nWent speak to the woman who is choosing career right now I'm you know her and her husband and made that decision you know gene and gene did biochemistry she loved learning and she was\nLabs at a local university and really enjoyed that\nAnd that was in her mid thirties and then you know it was like why are we going to have children the biological clock is going in and boom you know thankfully the lord blessed us with two boys rather quickly\nAnd uh but a lot of women are struggling with that that's a phenomena that is today and it's not just should I be at home it's work it's home it's balancing all of it is does that put pressure on for that midwifery or the\nWay it does put pressure on is what a woman is really asking she ... you know you might have this myth transition going on if you like walk into the living in like a cop out of place and you say I\nAm I on the one that sees this mess I mean more spiritual\nThan ... you know you go and take the cop to the kitchen in these loudly put away the dishes and some ... says or would you like some hope you don't want to put anybody out or anything yeah so like overstated emotions and that's a little bit of assigned that's overstated\n[laughter] no I mean like [laughter]\nYeah you find yourself being more emotional than you normally whatever your norm is you find yourself to a little bit more edgy\nAnd the reason why you have this question your heart and that is why am I on the face of this club and what am I supposed to do here now next that will make the best impact it's important because this is the number one time I'm In a woman's life when she's statistically most vulnerable to an affair\nAnd remember like what and fair like how am I supposed to work another sport person into my life I'm already busy enough\nBut women don't mean to\nThe reason they don't mean to spend much time with a co worker you know using him as a sounding board that don't mean to spend much time with their boss late hour centrist into an affair they don't mean to get a you know Facebook and drift into an affair I you know the Internet is limited number one ways now\nI'm for people to reconnect 'em and blow their life apart in a second\nAnd then I don't mean to 'em but the dissent guarding their heart and the reason why they're so longing for this connection with their spouse\nUm is that they had that question you know what is my value right now and why am I here\nAnd what's my unique contribution that's what's on the heartbeat of that woman in that midlife evaluation time wise woman instead of drifting off and making emotional connection that will undermine her whole life wise woman grabbed her busy has been by lapels and say I love us too much to drift apart\nHey let's set some date nights I Need you for sounding board she'll grab a mentor and she'll say have you ever felt this way at mentor can help walkers through finding her unique nest and\nShe'll get some girlfriends around like let's do Bible study together and figure out what's going on in the season of life and ... that we all\nNames and the big challenge during this time is that most people on earth their desires are bigger than their abilities\nSo you mentioned your wife she was affected her career but then she also wants to have a family and so she has these desires that all take up time and all take up focusing all require energy and it it comes down to I just don't have enough hours in the day of energy and my soul to do everything that's on my heart to do\nWell upset yeah and I said for women particularly the that the need to be two people yes it is a stressful for it's impossible to achieve but the demand for being to people or three people is always there let me ask you to respond to a listener who wrote into focus\nAnd I think as a very specific question that puts this into context or she wrote to us and said I feel like I made a mistake by marrying the man I did were not the same people we were when we got married we want different things have different morals and values\nAnd disagree on how to raise our kids are we ever do any more spite am I supposed to continue in this miserable\nRelationship um what would you say to her what is her hope\nWell first of all I Would say to her every relationship is one breakthrough away from being a great relationship ... and when things get out of kilter things get us out of sync\nPeople start to think oh it's a tragedy it's never going to turn we disagree on everything and it starts this downward spiral that begin starts to feed on itself ... and so now everything is evidence that this is a bad relationship\nAnd in reality all it takes in marriages one decision can turn everything because obviously this couple used to be in sync and they they loved each other and they had the agreements that they were moving forward on and now probably my guess is the stress of life has pushed them to a different place\nThis focus on family broadcast will continue in just a moment\n\nAt

what can she do right now to make a change in her heart and reconnect with her husband well if she were to start praying God show me how to get to the breakthrough\nWas like I Want to be on my husband's side fighting against life rather than fighting against each other\nGuy can start to orchestrate her heart to where she gets to a place where she's softer and her response to her husband and she starts to find boundary she can set up its start to change the system because once one person starts to do real change\nIt's amazing how often there's a big change in the relationship that takes place that takes the seemingly incompatible areas of life\nAnd suddenly starts to turn them back to where they were when they started this relationship\nKnow that's why it's important to have like rules of engagement how you're going to argue and for example bill and I have a conflict covenant and we ...\nA conflict covenant have things and I'm like whoa hold hands when we're in arguments

about how to handle transitions in your marriage and they're back today\nWith more hope and humor and wisdom I'm John\nFuller and you're hosted focus presidents and author Jim do John I always enjoy when the pharaohs come to visit they bring up such heart to relational matters and they're open and honest about their own struggles and challenges what they've learned and that's where we'll similar to when we hear about those experiences\nUh it just goes to show not every\nMarriage is perfect I don't think there is a perfect marriage or you may have a really good marriage but I don't know that it's perfect if it is ... what is your perfect marriage or many couples indeed I think all couples need a boost from time to time\nTo allow them to get back on a healthier path and that's why focus on the family is here it's why we do what we do a for instance we recently received a comment from a listener to show how your investment is taking root and the hearts of people\nAre this woman is from Virginia here's what she said about one year ago I heard your guest speak about the harmful nature of sexual relationships\nOutside of marriage I was actually having an affair at that very time and the lord use the words on your broadcast to convict me I immediately ended the affair and amazingly\nHuh the lord worked on my husband's separately we have now been fully restored in our marriage sank you focus and let me say thank you\nFor allowing that to happen and making it happened and she continued I listen to your program every day and continue to learn so much\nA John that's it that's putting it all together that's keeping it altogether and I want to say thank you are to those of you who contribute to this ministry and if you haven't in a in a while\nPlease consider doing that we are not touching lies in the name of Christ and it would be so wonderful if you join us in that mission\nAnd we can tell you how particularly through our friends of the family monthly getting program or when you call one eight hundred the letter a and the word family eight hundred to three to six four five nine\nA bill in ... been sitting patiently you are authors and speakers in fact we are going to be diving into one of your books today\nA title but ten best decisions that couple can make John how 'bout you do you think that's a I Need more than ten [laughter] maybe the next book is the twenty best decisions a couple of can make\nA the book itself guide you through first Corinthians Thirteen to love chapter it's full of personal stories bill and Pam I so appreciate that because that's where we learned so much is from the stories of others\nAnd there's also practical tips to help keep your marriage driving and healthy so welcome back to focus on the family\nSo it's good to be with you because we know every couple of has to make decisions because they are life changing\nOur great decision is being hit with yeah\nYou know we spoke last time about transitions ah in life and particularly midlife those crises that we hit in our marriage uh we did concentrate on the women's side of the equation ah what's it like for men what are they going through I Know they go through those changes as well or what are they experiencing\nBy for many usually happens late forties early fifties and I think it's a combination of factors I'm the first thing is ... ... men did experience a lot of change in their life\nLike women do have an option they're legit changing all the time because it's got designed them in my mind that has been life will stay pretty static you know the stresses and there's demands but our bodies kind of stay the same and our schedules often kind of stay the same and we we kind of get used to dealing with life as it is\nAnd then suddenly we hit our forties early fifties and things start to change and we're not used to it\nI'm often things will change physically\nYou know prior to that men men just rely on their strength like it's great having testosterone run through your body 'cause every cell your body feel strong you know you fucking pull males with your fingernails and you just have a strong approach to life\nAnd then suddenly somewhere in your forties or fifties you come to the realization that this isn't going to last forever ... the the big thing though I think that happens is that midlife for men to transition in life from being highly productive to being influential\nAnd because our bodies start to deteriorate we can't work at the level we got we were used to get our thirties and forties we can work we can just get after we get intense we get focused and now suddenly we can't rely on that like we used to but we have more wisdom to share\nAnd being influential is more responsible than being productive because now people rely on us people want to know what we have to say people want to hear advice and they're watching our example and so men have to decide do I really want to rise to that level\nAnd that decision do I want to rise to that level is traumatic for a lot of men that why so is it the fear that they will fail yes because they haven't been thinking of a role model I I Want other people to benefit from the way I live I Want people to watch my life and make decisions based on what they see in me\nThe most Mitt haven't prepared themselves for that moment and suddenly it starts to happen\nAnd now the grand kids start asking EPA what would you do and colleagues started asking how you've been at this for a while and what what would you do with the situation and suddenly now the stakes are higher and men who are prepared for it\nThere's a great opportunity and like that's the way for some and they talked about this midlife transitional I deal with the greatest times of their life because the harness the wisdom and to harness their influence and they're seeing their influence go forward and they love it\nLet me transition a little bit let me ask you this question a it's a more common question today\nAnd this went to from a listener who wrote us and set in my household\nMy husband is a stay at home parent and I work full time outside the home let me pause for a minute say that's great that they made that decision that when parents should be home with the kids I think that fundamentally is the right decision or who's going to go out and you know vocational only do it\nWe have traditional is which I Am on I tend to believe more in the male role the female role but I get the fact that they were more women are graduated from college and graduate programs today they are active\nI just plugged fact that there was to have one parent at home she goes on to say do you have any advice\nOn how we can make this successful in our family situation so reverse throws a little bit of moms out working dads and home how do they make that work in a godly way and honor the lord and do family well in that scenario\nWhere from the area of the country that they just kind of common ... live in California\nAnd so um many things in common [laughter] again in this case it's the same principle applies\nThose men band together that are a stay at home dads they get together encourage each other they look for mentor men who've gone through transitions even in our own church when there was a senior pastor\nI'm his assistant had a health crisis\nAnd that put him on disability at a very young age and I'm at his wife was the primary bread earner that he chose to get retrained so he could shepherd\nI'm In the church but yet be the debt at home and I'm so we had both role models in our church we had there and being that typical traditional is and then the other pastor\nUm who just because of his health had to make other choices but both families the kid's flourished that's the main point and that's the goal and that's the goal and every situation we only mentors and even more so when it's something unusual night need somebody else who has gone through this\nAnd I'm One of the things that we talk about a mentoring is you know sit down together and say who had the kind of marriage we want to have who has a kind of family we want to have\nWho has a kind of influencing ministry or and business that we want to have let's go talk to those people be pro active\nVillain I approached and Jill Briscoe and um when I was a young pastor's life because at the time Stewart and Jill where like the only people we knew who were posturing writing\nAn out speaking and they spoke together and separately and that is likely bill and I did and when I approached Phil and I said you know\nIt's kind of unusual inching ever play back as yet we've always been the example of the unusual and ... that's okay that's okay go find somebody who has the kind of life that you're trying to build now\nI'm right after that little window of time our son got hit in the football game um was um he was in ICU for eight days blood transfusion and all that and we brought Caleb out of the hospital and\nUm our two boys that what the bill and I said okay you're not feeling well cabs not feeling well you need to take care of each other because we need groceries on the table all go do are speaking engagement the first night\nUm I got a phone call that our son was hit in a football game and um had a concussion and knee injury might and his opportunities for scholarships second night\nI'm a guy a phone call that our college son was pulled from the football game with a shoulder injury my end as opportunities for a division one scholarship they it was going for or worse for those with the third day I got a phone call that my four year old brother had just had a heart attack and I can take care of his kids\nOther than that Mrs Lincoln how'd you like the theater yeah a lot of pressure and who do I say first\nAnd something must have been on my face to show the stress and my friends would say Pam how you doing and they didn't know how to answer it for just that question to God God how do I answer these people and he simply asked a question about what kind of person do you want to be I said that I Want to be the kind of person that can choose joy no matter what life since my way\n'cause your words says in me and my eight and that the joy of the lord has our strength and this family need strength right now so I chose you Jesus I Choose joy and some of my friends would say Pam how you doing and I decided to answer them we\nChoose enjoy and um it was amazing\nThat it caught on and my friendship circle we start to enjoy the Jews enjoy just enjoy I began to pray jump forty two bills life that God will give bill more life second happen even in the first ... sometimes about three years for when the Titanic it's hit for the ship to ride itself and during those three years we just kept\nPraying and we've printed out all the rest of the gods favor guts joy doesn't Nineteen and we just began to pray those over our family and over our future\nAnd it's amazing when you start to choose joy and choose Jesus and look for the blessing every day went on a God hunt who got posted noticed God's goodness who got a postcard about goodness\nThe family started to see the goodness of God returned to our life and all the kids got scholarships bills health returned we got a double the opportunity have and focus on the family called this during that time to have it can be on there\nAnd do I need to ask the question because that is a great outcome some people listening or still traveling the road and praying that have been trying to choose your but they haven't had that kind of outcome what do you sort of a person\nGive got time to be good\nAh my son ... during that season said this assessment seems fair this isn't seem right there is some decisions that were made towards died and his health issues and it just seemed like he he was living job's life and my son said just doesn't seem fair\nAnd I said let's skip that time to be good because God is good even when people are outdated God is good even when circumstances are not good God is that even when I Am not good ... good\nLet's focus on the goodness of God and let's give got time to be good\nAnd that's what I Would encourage couples that feel like they're right in the middle of the storm hold each other tonight and say I believe that God longs to be good to us\nThat is scripture um God longs to be good at sin is very nature and we just sometimes getting impatient in this\nMedia driven instant gratification world um we want the instant and take away the pain and God wants to give us character and carry us through the pain so we will be better and closer\nMore intimate at the end\nAnd you let me ask a I think both question is it ever too late for a couple I mean someone listening today is upset they're angry or they just can't see another day with her husband is it too late I\nI Would say to you sometimes it feels like it's too late in reality it never is because marriage is a reflection of the gospel of Jesus Christ and the way the gospel works in a moment of time somebody can go for being lost to being found somebody can go from being the enemy of God to being adopted child of God and it can happen in a moment\nWhat does it take in the human heart and I know God can work those miracles but what's my role and responsibility\nSometimes they can only do on our side of the ... we can't control the other person we can only control our attitude toward that person and our character and who are going to become\nLike we don't want to get that our spouses making decisions that are unhealthy bill increases that get off the crazy train like don't let their bad choices pull you down is\nBecause there is a special intimacy for people who are in pain that Jesus was rejected by the people who cared about and in most Jesus had to stand alone at the most important time in his life and when everybody was against him he bought salvation for us\nAnd so when people are struggling and pain when they feel like they're rejected by the people that love and the most there's this special intimacy with Jesus that he gives at that moment if we're willing to receive and that softens our hearts and win our hearts are soft\nGot turns his attention on the people were praying for rather than putting the attention that I was trying to correct us\nAnd so if people will say God I don't know how this is going to work out I don't know how you're going to turn this but I'm going to cling to you and I'm asking you to give me that special place of intimacy that you give to those that are hurting because I'm hurting right now and would you somehow some way turn the heart of my spouse that this thing can be recovered\nAnd let me be at that sort of live like no matter what the people around me are keeping me reflect your character because there's no downside to becoming more loving person then\nHe loves the expression effect toward him yes ... ... it's like ... for that when he leaves\nThat he moves and the Bible tells the eyes of the lord rent to and fro throughout the year that he may strongly support those who are just completely is thinking of that yeah it's it's not a passive thing it's not like oh and I got to help that person it's a good looking for the longest for that long to do\nIt show me that you have to face and I am there for you yeah and we think it's up to us if I say the right thing do the right thing be the right person that suddenly magically it's all going to turn in reality the kind of problems that\nWe see people get into sometimes the only answer is turning our\nAnd there's no substitute for the Holy Spirit doing it and one of the most common commands and the Bible is wait on them or\nWith none of us like to do [laughter] not good at any moment like this and we said jeeze I'm going to cling to you and I'm going to wait for you to do [noise]\nIt's a hard place for us to go but it's the place the Jesus like you said longs for us to be because then he goes\nAnd does he can do and that's why some families have a tragic story of what didn't work out and other families have the story of a mere ... place\nBecause God got involved and the people who were trusting God to do something just clung to him and said I don't know how to fix this but I'm trusting unions\nAnd we'll bring this conversation to a close that's bill and Pam Farrell on focus on the family and they are so encouraging they have such a solid insights about navigating the challenges that come up in marriage and that's one\nReason we keep bringing them back to focus on the family it's been great these last couple of days to talk about how to weather midlife transitions with your spouse\nI Love the pharaohs main message put God at the center of your marriage than stick together and help each other that's why it's all about and I got an that sometimes I struggle with that with gene I Do and uh this is a real encouragement to me\nTo keep moving forward let me also reminded that we're here for you through the joys and the struggles\nFocus on the family or wants to help you have a thriving marriage so if you're facing some difficulties call us we have

Christopher cruise President Trump is canceling an arms control agreement with Russia you said Saturday to Russia is violating the agreement and furthermore it's keeping the U.S from developing new weapons correspondent Frederick like good news in Moscow this morning\nThis treaty in itself eliminates send missiles with a range of five hundred to five thousand five hundred kilometers it was struck between the U.S or are you in the U.S and Russia destroyed some twenty seven hundred missiles actor that deal was put into place and it was signed in Nineteen eighty seven obviously in between the hill Gorbachev and Ronald Reagan\nDespite efforts by Mexican police to stop them at the border with Guatemala about two thousand Central American migrants have swam or rested across the river that separates the two countries and reform their caravan in Mexico they say they will resume their journey to the United states\nThe founders provided the protection which was it takes three quarters of all states are thirty eight states to ratify anything you can do the math I run the math on every single women ever been proposed to me you can't find an amendment that would limit our liberties that could be ratified and even close to thirty eight states\nLet's talk a little bit more about process you touched upon it earlier and the number of states that is needed and tell us how many we have you've mentioned how many we need and where do we stand in the process of getting to\nThe critical mass that would allow this convention of states to occur\nAre so it takes thirty four states are two thirds of the states\nInvention so far twelve states have done that so we're just over one third of the way there which is extraordinary people said it was impossible to get that far we've gotten that far already\nAnd so it takes thirty four to get into convention\nIn convention it takes twenty six days to pass a proposed amendment out of convention important to remember when you're in a convention the only thing I can mention can do is propose amendments that people get all scared about getting into convention\nIt's merely a place where people alternately make suggestions and then it takes thirty eight states to ratify anything that comes out of convention\nI think we're well on our way I think that one third mark as a pretty extraordinary landmark we have passed and another Nineteen states in one house or the other you have to get both houses in a concurrent session so I think we're well on her way and I think we should expect to see some pretty extraordinary progress in twenty Nineteen\nMark if you go back in history and I realize and unfortunately it's not being taught at least to the degree of showed in many schools these days but tell us a little bit about the founding of the republic didn't the state's create the federal government and the other way around\nYeah look I think that's the history that's really important in the power pyramid was the state's created the federal government the state's essentially were to retain sovereignty they ... they were to have brought on ... powers the federal government was had to have a limited any new Murray empowers it's now been reverse\nBecause of the rulings of the Supreme Court and really importantly in regard to the commerce clause federal government can pretty much do anything it wants to do constitutionally and this is a big problem and\nAnd so we need to reverse that power pyramid take the power away from DC make it so DC isn't so important I Would add one more thing there's so much conflict and strife in this country right now politically I don't like it I don't think anybody likes it\nWith the way you reduce that strife is you quit making centralized decisions you take the power away from the federal government give it back to the people in the states let them make the decisions at home we won't see these huge national fights anymore\nWe have been talking with mark Meckler who is the president and founder of convention of states and conventional states action somewhere else just a little bit about convention stage organization where can folks also go on the Web if they want to learn more and get involved in the fight\nSure the project was founded just about five years ago and it was founded to take power away from DC give it back to the people people can read about it get involved at convention estates dot com it's supported by literally virtually every major conservative figure in the United states that's commented on Sean Hannity\nMarco then Senator Tom Coburn Senator Jim demand lots of senators are fast and Rubio they understand that Washington DC isn't working and the way to fix that is take the power away from DC and give it back to the people the folks want to be involved in that they can do that a convention of states dot com\nMark Meckler from convention of states mark thank you for being here\nGood to be with you thanks for having me\nAndy route that the club for growth are keeping an eye on all these congressional races we have going on around the country as well as US Senate races Andy good to have you here\nI think family alum\nAndy as we've talked about many times Republicans currently control both the U.S Senate and the U.S house of representatives the Senate seems to be headed more in the Republican direction but let's talk today about the house\nRight now can you give us an overview as to how many seats Democrats would have to gain and where do they stand in achieving that goal\nThe Republicans are in charge of the house it appears that they are going to lose seats President Trump claims that there will be a red wave that will counteract that\nAnd to to be honest with you we are kind of seen some something of a red wave but the damn wave was so big\nLeading into the Kavanaugh hearings for the Supreme Court\nThat if a red wave does crop up it'll only reduce the damn wave\nJust to confuse the the analogy so right now Republicans are in the majority Democrats have to pick up twenty three seats I think that right now you can count about fourteen seeds that will likely go down\nSo that means the Democrats only have to pick up nine more and when you look at the\nPopulation of seats from which says nine could come from you're looking at about twenty nine or thirty seats\nSo basically nine out of twenty nine or nine out of thirty you're looking at about a third so to me it seems likely\nBar and everything else or all else being equal the Democrats are going to pick up the majority but they will have a very slender slim majority perhaps single digits\nIf we look at that Andy and whether it be Democrats by single digits or Republicans by single digits what does that do for how the house becomes organized and its ability to actually function when you are that closely divided\nTruth is we don't know or at least I haven't experienced this in my working career or when this has happened\nWhen an election occurs of the majority in the house is either decisively Democrat or decisively Republican if we got that close to just a single digit majority\nThen we're kind of in uncharted territory at least for the past couple of decades knowing house procedure and and how the rules are structured I suspect what would happen\nIn this would be fascinating just from a political science perspective is that the majority party presumably the Democrats here would have to make some deal with the Republicans to share some level of power if Democrats get\nControl the house a lot of the Democrats that will be coming in have made a several promises to the electorate that they would uh worked across a child that they would be somewhat conservative and that they wouldn't vote for Nancy Pelosi as speaker\nSo I suspect the first thing that would happen after November the Democrats would probably elect somebody\nOther than anti plos is speaker and that person could be a more moderating voice or it could be more liberal voice it's it's really hard to tell then once they're done with that then they're going to have to vote on a rules package and they do this every two years in this package of rules\nDictates how the house proceeds with his business like there's committee ratios and then the rules committee and how that process so I could see a scenario\nWhere the committee ratios are very slender\nI could see a scenario where the rules will require\nA returning to regular order which I think both parties would\nAbsolutely love or at least both electorate both voters would love you would see more debate\nYou would see more controlled by the committee's rather than by leadership\nYou would see more amendments being offered you would see more discussion and debate about those amendments you would\nI'd dare I say you would actually see a functioning house where the outcome is not preordained would they would have to go through the work\nOf legislating before they can figure out whether a bills gonna pass or not now this is all speculation on my part I can be completely wrong but when you're dealing with a single digit majority in the people's house you can't rule with an iron fist anymore like we've seen in the past Twenty years\nIn terms of that single digit majority whichever way it happens to break we're presuming it's going to break democratic at this particular point but\nEither way you have and the scene within the Democratic party a rise of the ultra left wing democratic socialist movement we're obviously going to have a couple of members of the Democratic conference who we're going to be a ...\nOn the Republican side of course we have the Freedom Caucus the more conservative element of the Republican Party is is really going to be a situation where Congress has effectively broken into really more like for factions rather than to\nIt's going to be the the question is is how strong is the appetite gonna be for these various factions to grind things to a halt and for the past\nYears these factions have been adamant about advancing their gender because they promise to and leadership ends up screwing all them because they don't want the government shutdown or they have to about two there to St masters they have to do all these things\nAre again this is all speculation on my part but I can envision it maybe this was naive on my part I can envision a scenario where these factions tampered down their desires as long as it means that they can voice their opinion\nAnd that they're given for time\nAnd space to offer up their ideas have them the liberated in in the public\n... was a marine a boxer the son of Italian immigrants he went on to Harvard the GI Bill Georgetown Law\nAs a lawyer Nicholas ... represented the great Mohammed Ali for Thirty years Conor Lamb similar profile a marine and Irish Catholic central Catholic high school goes on the University of Pennsylvania law\nI watched it Nicolas ads on local cable TV the

segments first my colleague Don Hillman chats with very Ricky varies the public education officer with the kings for fire department and October is fire prevention mode\nDawn and Barry will be talking about various aspects of home buyers today's home fires to burn faster than ever and in a typical home buyer you may have as little as one or two minutes to escape safely from the time the smoke alarm cell and\nKnowing how to use that time takes planning in practice known and burial talk about that also chat with Doreen Lancaster from ballot health issues with the health resources center at the Johnson City medical center will be talking about the health resources center new location in Johnson City and also the subject of belly fat\nA first though Don Hillman and Barry brick you talk fire\nPrevention\nYeah the kings are departments marking fire prevention month with the campaign\nCalled looks listening learn be aware fire can happen anywhere and one of the folks to do is to look for places around their home or fires can start a they need to listen for the sound of the smoke alarm make sure that smoke alarm as working\nAnd everyone in the home needs to learn to ways out of every room that way if you do have a fire you can get out really quickly\nI understand that um that fires in homes today are actually burning faster than in the past why is that\nWell the materials that furniture and things like that are made of inside the home and all I'm not over no longer have to go back at it right there will start over\n[noise] the furniture's and other furnishings that we have in our homes are now more since addicts and so they actually get to high temperatures a whole lot faster than natural fibers do\nOr we used to see flash over that means everything inside of a room of the or the fire started would catch fire used to be about twelve to Fifteen minutes now are seeing that and less than three sometimes or even less than that\nSo it's actually giving people less time to get out of the house of fire does occur doesn't it\nYeah people have a whole lot less time and by the time firefighters arrive you already have flash over\nUm statistics are showing that the number of house fires are declining but debts are up is that again kind of a correlation to what we've just been talking about\nHad had a lot to do with those hot temperatures and anytime you have those hot temperatures you have lots of smoke which is just a mixture of fuel from lots of burning hot gases which can overcome someone really quick like\nThree planning a a family in particular can really help save people's lives if a fire does occur doesn't it\nYeah if you get together with your family and you do at home escape plan you can kind of let the kids help you work it out they get really enthused about it and then when the smoke alarms go off they're ready to go\nIf the fire occurs in your home what's the best advice that you can give someone\nIf you do have a fire first of all get out as quickly as possible don't stop to take anything shut the door behind you shut door can help slow that fire down\nUm you talked a little bit about ah looking for things in the home again or just kind of talk a little bit again about a so people can prevent fires in their home some of the things that they can do\nWhen you're in your home some of the big fire safety uh things to look at first of all cooking that's one of the number one cause of the home fires make sure that when you're cooking\nYou leave an area around your stove\nTo make sure there's nothing combustible and never leave your stove wild things are cooking because sometimes you might forget and you can have fire really quickly also look around if you've got any shooting sources but if it's a portable heater a kerosene heater fireplace or anything like that and make sure those are all in good working order\nAnother big cause a fire says smoking and smoking materials make sure that if you are going to smoke that you use get heavy ashtrays or smoke outside and then leave smoking materials up in high places for kids can't get hold of them\nI knew a lot of people it is especially in this area have got electric stoves versus a versus natural gas and they may think to themselves especially with some of the where the uh that that\nI guess the cover of the electric so like we've got a a stove that doesn't really have the all electric coils it's just the the surf ... yeah um and so people are thinking well I've got this versus an open flame\n... it's not as to step the biggest fire is ... is still up a a danger like a natural gas are the ones with the old well\nA lot of people don't realize when you're cooking if you have something on high or even between medium and high you are probably pass the combustion point of most oils and so if you're cooking and you have some oil and it's starting to smoke a little bit that means it it's very close to his combustion point you need to turn the heat down\nLet's talk a little bit about uh about a smoke detectors smoke alarms things like that what's the best advice that you can get people on those\nOn the case for the fire department like remind everybody to check the smoke alarms make sure they're working\nYou need to check on the back of the smoke alarm and make sure that it's not over ten years old and if it is over ten years old you need to replace it with a new one preferably one that is a photo electric alarm with a long life batteries in it that way it'll last you a long time you don't have to worry about changing those batteries out\nWell the most accurate way would be to have a CAT scan are full body MRI those are the most precise um we know that they're very expensive and if you walk into your doctor's office today and say concerned about my belly fat do you mind to order a city or an MRI um they'll look at you like you're crazy so um\nAnd most likely they will not order ed and ed or insurance companies won't pay for it either so I'm according to the national Institute of health waist circumference actually provides an end it's inexpensive prediction\nOf risk over and above that of your BMI we also offer BMI measurements in our office\nBody mass index for ... and the\nBody mass index is calculated from your height and weight and estimates body fat but there are limitations to that so in our class so we actually go into accurate ways to measure ways and you might be surprised as to how you measure your waist accurately\nOkay a little ... strangers to convert belly photos\nWill um basically visceral fat really response to the same diet and exercise strategies that can help you shed pounds overall I'm so in class we kinda delve into I'm focusing in on those plant based foods along with fruits and vegetables whole grains\nWe talk about lean sources of protein and low fat dairy um but then we get into the models and Polly an saturated fats will will get into specifics there and then we talk about\nThe role that subgroup of essential fatty acids the role that that plays in belly fat\nBut even more interesting than that um we get into portion control and we teach you how to use what's called the hunger scale to modify your eating and how we can be mindful in our eating to combat belly fat\nStores ... with control most portions absolutely absolutely what were those exercise ploy ...\nYes it will actually um interestingly and I'm just going to a briefly quote this study that was done it a six month study was done at Johns Hopkins um\nAnd it was people who took part we're approximately a hundred and forty or excuse me a hundred and four men and women are they walked on a treadmill and they did some strength training\nAnd they had lost on average five pounds of weight on this scale but they last about a team per cent of their belly fat\nSo that's quite astounding so those who also lost the belly fat\nReverse a set of high risk factors called metabolic syndrome which includes a increase blood pressure obesity an insulin resistance so they not only got rid of that belly fat but then they lessen the risk for heart disease and stroke and type two diabetes\nSo in the class will go over a moderate aerobic exercise and spring training and we'll also answer the question\nDoes doing a hundred to two hundred abdominal crunches a day will that get rid of belly fat and I'll leave that question for for um individuals to come get the answer\nTo close moderate exercise I'm most vulnerable to grow and try to run five miles in the morning\nWell look correct to correct it and then we'll go through specific um moderate aerobic activities and and again these are all attainable for all of us and and we do encourage a before anybody starts an exercise program obviously to consult their position\nWas going to return during wind Castro joins registered nurse with about health and the resources center in Johnson City the rotation of which is a co located with the wellness center at ... and we're talking about belly fat and do your class coming up on November thirteenth um\nYou've preview a little bit we don't want to give everything away a wash it folks come to this class though oh stood up for November thirteenth\nWell actually I'm through all the studies and research that has been done on the message on the belly fat is really clear\nThat is that that that builds up around the middle puts you more at risk you're more likely to get heart disease and serious health problems that we haven't discussed here but we go on to in more detail in class\nBut the good news is that we now have Proven Ways to reduce or to avoid these risk\nSo in the upcoming class we put you in the driver's seat will actually empower individuals with simple strategy so that they can get their life back on track and in a sense avoid being a casualty of belly fat\nAnd we would do tell folks that if they're unable to attend class at that time on November thirteenth from one to two and if they're interested in attending that class they need to pre registering the number to call is one eight for for\nFor a seven eight she's seven\nNow if you're unable to attend the class that you want to obtain the information then you can sit down with a registered nurse free of charge and have a concept of one on one belly fat consul and you can schedule that um they calling for two three nine one five fifty two hundred\nOkay we should point out that classes a Tuesday so folks who between wanting to maybe they'll have to work so you know working that option available\n... afterward I guess we want to get the message out for sure\nJoins we close anything else you want to add about the health resources sooner or the ... class that's coming up\nNow just that we we enjoy serving the community we want people to have optimal health that were there for you a free of charge there aren't too many a free healthcare services today but we want to empower individuals with making good health care choices\nAnd for those who have chronic disease management issues such as high blood pressure cholesterol\nAh high cholesterol diabetes we want to help you to

continuing I'm Christopher cruise\nPresident Trump says he will pull the United states out of an arms control agreement with Russia because Russia is violating it the president also complained to the agreement is keeping the U.S from developing new weapons correspondent Frederick like in his in Moscow this morning\nA lot of very senior Russian politicians\nThat have come out very early on a Sunday Morning and express their dismay at all of this I Want to review part of what the head of the federation councils foreign affairs committee Constantine called the chess a nuclear power one of the two participants in one of the fundamental agreements in the field of strategic stability unilaterally destroys it\nDespite efforts to stop them at the border of Guatemala and Mexico about two thousand Central American migrants have crossed the river separating the two countries and have reformed their mascara than in Mexico correspondent Patrick ... traveling with the caravan says the migrants are planning to resume their journey toward the United states\nIt takes a good case and maybe a bouquet of flowers the next day to get things straightened out all too often being in the doghouse is not only a matter of our having encourage the anger if somebody else\nBut it's a matter of two of our setting up a wall between them and us through our own feeling is\nWe don't want to give we don't want to admit that we were wrong it only makes things worse to know that we were wrong and that's the situation in which every man finds himself with God\nThe meaning of Christ cross is that God took the initiative to break that wall down to get us out of their spiritual dog house and this was known me or tactical maneuver around his pot\nHe loved us he did he dies he determined that nothing should be allowed to stand in a way of that love is\nEven if it meant taking all our guilt upon himself God so love of the world that he sent his only be gotten son all we like she had gone astray we turned everyone to his own way but the lord laid on him the inequity of us all\nHe was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our inequities\nUpon him was laid the ... that made us hole and with his stripes we are here we preach Christ crucified St Paul said that as if there is a connection between the cross and now we're seeing and there is at St Paul said to the collections\nGod has forgiven you fall your sins price tests utterly wiped out that damning evidence of broken laws and commandments which always hung over our heads and it's completely a noted by nailing it over his own head to the cross\nAnd then having drawn this thing of all the powers ranged against us you expose them shattered empty and defeated\nIn his final glorious triumphant act and that of course was the resurrection you have a sense of personal inadequacy is there the knowing feeling at your soul that you on to everything that you should be are you constantly irritated by your business associates\nYour friends members have your family or you bothered by temptations of one kind or another that keep coming back no matter how hard you try to dispel them I Can't promise you that acceptance of Christ crucified will solve all of your personality problems all will solve any of them immediately\nBut this I say with complete confidence making the cross of Christ your own will change your whole outlook on life it will bring you into a relationship a friendship with God the kind that God wants to have with you\nIt will give got his chance to make you more and more the kind of person that he intended to be\nAnd that's pretty wonderful considering what God has got to work with and the case of most of us\nIt's pretty wonderful all around a godsend his son and that he died to bring us back to God\nBecause the glory and the wonder of it which causes St Paul to say to all of us Christ did not send me to see how many I could baptize\nBut to proclaim that gospel and I have not done this by the persuasive ness of clever words for I have no desire to Rob the cross is power the preaching of the cross is I Know nonsense to those who are involved in this dying world\nBut to wash who are being safe from that debt it is nothing less than the power of God\nIt is written I Will destroy the wisdom of the wise and the ... the prudent will I reject what consider what have the philosopher the writer and a critic of this world to show for all of their wisdom has not gone made the wisdom of this world look foolish\nFor it was after the world in its wisdom had failed to no God that he and his wisdom chose to save all who wouldn't believe by the simple mindedness of the gospel message\nFor the Jews ask former Iraqi oil is proof and the Greeks and intellectual panacea but all we preach is Christ crucified a stumbling block to the Jews and share nonsense to the ...\nBut for those who are cold weather Jews are gentile Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God amen [noise] [noise]\nYou're listening to the loo through an hour and we just heard the message from Dr Oswald Hoffman first preached in Nineteen fifty five talking about the rapid pace of technology I'm joined here in the studio by Dr Tony cook director of us ministry singer Lutheran our ministries\nThe rapid pace of technology is not slowed it all has it\nI I remember when I was a kid I Lived out on a farm on the middle of a cornfield we didn't have air conditioning we didn't have cable TV we didn't have a cell phone we didn't have an answering machine at one point we didn't have computers you know anything like that\nAnd to think of where we are today it was like I was living you know like life on the prairie [laughter] something like that and then then all of a sudden those technological advances started they started to you know can multiply ... speed I'm starting to get to that age that I'm thinking\nWell I'll just let the next generation deal with that I can remember when the Internet came out\nI had this thought that will I'm sure that's just kind of for kids I really don't need\nAnd mom about it now in the day you know\nHow it's going to permeated everything so yeah a technology I think is an amazing amazing gift but it it does make your head spin and it also brings questions of of morality and in usage and in how we're using things appropriately or ... or inappropriate as well\nDr Hoffman speaking back in Nineteen fifty five said things are happening so fast it's impossible to get a grip on them before they slip away replaced by something new and better and that's the same thing we could say today what does that mean for Christianity for the church\nBut it's interesting er here at the losing our we use technology a lot to um to get the gospel of Jesus Christ out into the world\nBut I'm not someone once said that the Internet is where religions go to die really yeah and I it's kind of an odd what do they mean by that well I I think that the the point is that\nWhen you have a faith of any kind um that's talked about on the Internet you're exposed to all the other ones ... and you're exposed to people from all these different belief systems that they know this is the right point no this is the right point or my way as and here's the proof for this or whatever it might be\nI think it's partially because of the fact of um exposure and as I go back to the beginning of this when I grew up in the middle of a cornfield I wasn't exposed to anybody other than the six hundred people who lived in my town you know but now every religion every bought every philosophy that exists in the world comes to you\nAnd I think for many people that is a challenge and they don't know how to necessarily think through those things so I I think it's important on the one hand that as Christians that we use technology in a way that gains a hearing for the gospel of Jesus Christ\nAnd that proclaims that gospel in a way that um is clear maybe even more than it has been in the past because\nWe can assume that people understand the message of the church anymore I'm with all these competing messages that are there still on the one hand technology is this great tool\nFor us to use to communicate the gospel but also it presents challenges with other ways of looking at things sometimes that can be a challenge\nOr just for people who might not be as as strong in their faith or thought about their faith that might challenge them as well I'm not that we should pull out of technology\nBut I'm understanding of who we are in whose we are and being able to articulate our faith clearly as we confront these diverse messages I think is extremely important with all of this technological change\nAnd as much as technology continues to change what
