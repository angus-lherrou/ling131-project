off the coast of Virginia so very fast moving\nAs it is if it's way back out to the Atlantic it through the southeast\nYou know I ah I followed the projected track of it and you know the strength of listings and in most to you know ... go back out into the Atlantic dropped down into just a low pressure system yeah and followed it all the way across the north did like kind of a past the coast of\nNorth America and curbing out and going across the Atlantic and find the projected path finally ends just off the coast south of Ireland\nAnd that some yeah so it just how they paid I I was curious how far they would reject it out mhm it was kinda interesting have you ever been on a flight where there is an emotional support animal I have not I think\nI was on one one time when there was a a dog or if I'm not mistaken the flight that we took the a a lady was a blind and she had a dog and and is listed as emotional support um you've heard about this I guess the squirrel\nOr on the plane I have not I owe squarely flight will call in [laughter] okay um dateline Orlando, Florida who do do do do you release escorted a woman off a plane\nTuesday after she brought an unexpected furry friend on a frontier airlines flight from Orlando to Cleveland mhm the furry friend a squirrel\nThe woman in foreign frontier airlines she was taking quote an emotional support animal on the flight from Florida when she made her reservation but according to the uh\nUh folks in charge she did not say the animal was a squirrel beforehand [noise] which you know if she had they probably said well don't even bother to show up yeah so she showed up the airlines said they called Orlando police after they asked the woman to leave the plane with the animal and she refused\nSo see there's where she got in trouble she refuse mhm uh rodents including squirrels are not allowed on frontier flights\nAccording to the rules the passenger was advised with the policy was asked to deep plane\nAccording to Jonathan free director of corporate communications at frontier airlines\nWhen she refused to the plane the plane bomb lane anyway and yet when she refused uh Orlando police were called and everyone was the plane see that's the thing everybody else everybody else get on yeah so police could deal with the passenger police eventually escorted the passenger on the aircraft return her to the main terminal\nThe incident delayed the flight my two hours all\nAccording to the a P I bet there was some bad people can you imagine the looks she was getting\nYeah now I have I have mixed feelings on this number one squirrels will not be categorized as emotional support animals service animals anything like that so that you ... what is legally considered that type of an animal is is it's not going to qualify yeah\nAnd she should understand that but on the other hand\nI can see we're having a small pet like that ... that you have a closest emotional attachment to who the indeed suits someone's concerns and fears yeah because\nFlying some people have a fear of flying and they need something to calm them down and yeah I can see we're having a pet squirrel something that's you know cute and cuddly and\nShe ... very close to ... could help keep calm so I can see both sides of this but you got to understand that that's just never going to be something that can be considered yeah a support animal\nGood and you see like a guinea pig or something like that instead of a squirrel will share but that probably wouldn't qualify either wouldn't but what I'm saying is squirrels\nBut there I I Do know people who have pet squirrels and they're very close to him and and even though they're technically wild animals they can become quite domesticated I've I've entered a room and yeah I didn't know yeah back I seen it in here I'm thinking well they're just wild period no no no no I I Know people out there was a woman who used to work here\nThat I'm Facebook friends with and she\nDoes uh you know she has rescued baby squirrels and raise them oh in the past and and had them as pets and and yeah I mean it's just like so they probably like crawling around on her shoulder yeah yeah uh yeah I was like that yeah yeah you know I that's like as crazy as it sounds if you get them de fumigate it\n... from what I've heard skunks can make interesting pets\n[laughter] um it's like having a pet cat\nYou'd have to have their stink glands yeah yeah and you can and that was something I always thought would be cool thing to do is have the ...\nAnd have a pet skunk and have people freak out when they come into your house and there's a skunk wondering oh that's a nice cat you away now wait a minute [laughter] yeah and that cat has whites dry reminds me of ... yeah the cat with the white stripe on it because of the paint\nA little darling Mm you know [laughter] ... [noise] yes\nUm I don't know about a ... I mean even if you have it ... them again I don't know\nYou'd have to get it from little and raise it yeah you know and and so that it's it's docile domesticated from the get go\nWell see I Would think a skunk would be calmer than a squirrel but I I guess I can see what you're saying if you raise any things yeah young yeah they'll probably be calm I Would imagine you know\nBut ah that you'd have to be fumigate it this is my wife says ah sometimes we'll go by where a skunk has been in the road and it smells really bad and I said boy he really had his stinks ...\n[laughter] ... or something like that funny stuff\nAnyway so don't take a squirrel on a plane no don't even try is the see if she said that ahead of time and I'm sure she thought well you know what I'm just kind of sneaking yeah it'll be All right\nAnd uh it's hard to sneak something on the plane these days that's yeah I'm going to try to sneak my mom on next week not on a plane\nIn a snake or your flying to was yes okay you leave out of ... and you had to lay over someone try cities Charlotte Chicago most any central Wisconsin to layovers they won't be long Charlotte in Chicago yeah it's going to\nBe yeah O'Hare it's going to be all in all about an eight hour day\nNow how long will it take to fly from Chicago to uh where are you\nLosses on Wall street following yesterday's major losses Dow futures down two hundred and forty eight points right now\n[noise]\nGood morning news time six thirty one I'm done Helmand with W.
