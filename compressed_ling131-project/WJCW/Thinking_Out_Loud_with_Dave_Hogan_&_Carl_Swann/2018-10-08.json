to develop a reputation\n[laughter] [noise] uh\nThe most shocking part is perhaps that amateurs left her fiance for ghost wow yes she had a fiance and ah her fiance found out that she was quote cheating when the ghost apparently showed it's physical form to him so he says he saw the ghost\nAnd or maybe they kind of had a little conversation about am assistance and you know\nThe ghost probably said I Want and if there's more than you do and so there you go\nWow and I've heard some crazy stories before but that that that that's\nYes that came across my side over the weekend and I thought\nMan I've got to talk about that especially being Halloween time ... ... so twenty goes she has claimed to have made out with [noise]\nI guess I'm trying to think think of\nA a\nSomething a name for her but I Can't think of putting words together that will just kind of describe what I'm thinking mhm\nYou suppose if if a let's say she finds this go she wants to settle down with and then things don't work out she'll boo hoo over it quite a bit\n[laughter] [noise]\nUh that's the best I could come up with on short notice to um let's just say she's very spirited\nYoung lady Mm yes leave if they accidentally but they they have pictures ever here she's smiling all big and she's all happy and everything so\nUm I guess do you have to worry about uh buying the engagement ring or the I I Would if you're the ghost I mean it would you ... how could you could you put a ring on a ghost finger\nYou know what I mean yeah yeah and let's say they do get married would the ghost have a best ghost instead of a best man or a I don't know who you could get to a I don't know who you could get to officiate the ceremony\nYeah well sometimes they say love is gone in the vapor so she'll just have to watch out for that\nTwenty goes about that story hey today is Columbus Day it is Columbus Day means banks are closed are they close to the ... yeah okay I didn't ... yeah I Am so I'm assuming there'll be no mail delivery\nUh schools are believer in session or lives are in session okay um\nWell now I take that back some are on on fall break well that's true yeah yeah so um\nYeah some of the

they used to they didn't they make peanut butter that had marshmallow and that you could buy off the shelf I Believe yeah I think so I never bought that but I Believe that's the case\nThat is what a fluff or another is have you seen this commercial I think it's for one of the major phone companies where the little girl rides into the phone or office on a a a little scooter or whatever and she says she celebrating her birthday they're talking about all the different things you can get with that particular phone\nA plan or whatever and then she says and we're holding our my birthday party

they was else that was not that game and touched you then you could run again yes\nI Would say I don't know but I Would say some young kids if you mentioned playing tag to them they look at you funny like what are you talking about huh well I don't do they have a tank video game I'm not sure [laughter]\n[laughter] but I Do\nThen they probably know what you're talking I wouldn't be violent enough you know like red rover and that yeah you're right read rover and things like that I mean I don't know did they ... the kids still play that I don't in school I don't\nI don't know I I you know I I'm guessing the only way kids would play that is if they had a teacher or their parents you know\nKind of taught him the game ... otherwise they wouldn't who would who would no I mean a lot of kids don't even know what what they\nBut those things would be yeah what'd you get in trouble for playing red robe are these days maybe you know because\nI don't know you know\nUm national kick butt day today
