had I have never been to Mexico I've never been to Mexico periods so I've been to cause a male okay that's good which is technically Mexico and it is in a very nice island are\nThere some neighborhoods that you want to stay out of but uh\nOverall I thought it was very beautiful and it wasn't bad at all yeah anyway this is Mexico City fancy a tarantula taco okay\nAnd I wonder if we have a national tarantula taco day there's a national day for everything else today's Carmel custard day okay and a pumpkin seed day but I'm not run across a national taco tarantula\nA rental taco day rather a and this is a dish costs twenty seven dollars but as Lee Corso would say not so fast that hope I'm Mexican authorities say not so fast they Mexico City markets restaurant recently put the Iraq needs\nOn its menu and posted a video on Facebook showing a chef torching one and two black and ... [laughter] well I think they're normally brown eye for the most okay how are you there are a black and ... the only problem is the Mexican red rump tarantula and that's the name of it okay and\nSo you thought the ... were the only ones yes with red rump 'cause the Mexican red rump tarantula turns out as a protected species\nThe federal environmental protection agency said it was alerted to the situation via social media you know what else would alert them yes yeah social media and seized for ... corpses that we're ready to be served up on tortillas\nLead to ranch tacos were apparently on the offer for five hundred pesos or fifty times the price of a basic street taco\nYour basic street taco yeah gotcha the restaurants menu also features ... features other creepy crawly such as grasshoppers and worms and aunt eggs\nAnd aunt eggs which you have a long tradition and Mexican cuisine and scorpions which are less common apologies to those eating raisin bran well that's true but you know we we just report it yeah ... yes we don't create it here but [laughter]\n[noise] I've heard of people eating a tarantula as on these ah survivor shows and then and ... and or at least you know they say they do I don't know whether that what we do what yeah you're right but uh\nAnyway so uh yeah ... tacos I don't think we'll find those showing up here locally anywhere on some of the ah we just have your basic street talk yeah yeah\nIt's just that street grid that it doesn't go any farther than that I guess terrain she lives on a taco well at least ... still alive you know that's a that's a plus it's a protected species in Mexico in that part of Mexico wow\nAnd so don't do it as Jackie Gleason said and smoke in the band you think about it but don't do it and I'm getting\nAs we said national Carmel custard day that's a little better thought for breakfast is yeah and a national pumpkins see day by the way here pretty soon and I don't know if you will be here to\nTo uh take

parents back then didn't think anything about it you know it was it was it was All right then I made it fine and yeah you know I think they probably followed me the first couple of days to make sure and then after that it was okay\nSo uh yeah that was [noise] I tell my age here that was Nineteen sixty six\nFifty fifty two years two years ago you know and at times were different than mhm yeah do you ever walk to school I did and walk to junior high okay but uh I didn't have far to go well sure yeah we've had a da da da da da da and others there okay um got permission\nHow's it going to say

sidewalks in Hampton no no no no just roads yeah I walked up\nNineteen eighty and then get over to return town yeah yeah [laughter] and uh that wasn't a very popular decision [noise]\nWith my folks went over like a lead\nBelow it certainly does ... because I didn't say anything about it and you're probably got a red room for tags [laughter] like the tarantula yes yes and that was a\nMan that was probably I don't know a mile and a half walk so yeah maybe pretty good a little clip yeah yeah\nAs I recall I was walking down the reader town wrote in my dad came pulling up and\nThat didn't end well
