morning that means it's time to welcome in Roger Hutchins from fairly independent\nMortgage corporation good morning Roger good morning Carl good morning by good morning sorry I misspoke your name a little early the company name I Do it I answer the phone sometimes that last ten years is a longtime car [laughter]\nUh the uh of course Roger joins us here to talk about the many different kinds of mortgage products available for folks who are in the market for mortgages last week a one to ... year end talk quite a bit about uh the reverse mortgage and it was very informative she's always great to have on there\nA weird share as much as possible to come on over and just sort of boot you out of the way she says that's up to him or you can do that I can sleep longer [laughter]\nOkay Roger you said you wanted to talk today he always used a little bit of a tease on what you want to do a sort of talking about a white\nToday and makes more sense to purchase instead of renting when he got for us well the first thing I Want to talk about is the negatives of renting a so if you're a listener out there you have a family member Frank co worker that still ranting\n... they really need to think it through and and uh and reconsider rants right now are all time highs I don't know if you fellows know anybody's been out there looking\nBut you can't rent anything that's worth living in for less than six seven hundred dollars a month and then small well ... houses are way up there three bedrooms are usually over a thousand dollars a month\nThis is the absolute worst time to ever be renting it's a great time to be a landlord ... but the worst time to be renting in in regards to the the demand pushing the price of monthly rent or what do you think is that push what's behind that push what do you think\nOf the housing market being a a a lack of housing inventory of credit requirements being a little little little more difficult I mean it's not very are we talking about every week but some think that it that it is and people struggling and they can't get approved for a home loan so they're having to rent or folks that can\nThey uh they can't find a house or they're having to read so that's pushing the demand which pushes the price\nOf okay there you go that explains that than to um home ownership of course you you say here you make a note that it can help your monthly budget sometimes\nYeah absolutely we see that more often than not where they end up getting pre approved and buying a house or their monthly payments less than Iran now and I'm telling you in today's society it's sad but it is true\nA hundred dollars a hundred and fifty two hundred dollars a month makes a huge difference in a family budget I mean that can pay a car payment or insurance and things like that\nAnd when you're reading your whatever you're given to that landlord is they're building of their financial wealth it's money thrown away you've heard that it is it's it's a it's a fact you're giving money away and you think about how much you're paying and rent times twelve each year that's what you're throwing away\nSo it it can really help your budget that surprises a lot of folks\nYeah very much so I think out loud right now with Roger Hutchins with a fair way independent mortgage homeownership of course I'm is you you're just saying some of the positives that come out of that or it can you say it can create financial wealth in the future what do you mean by that\nOh absolutely I I think it's as important as a four one K. now I mean 'cause you're you're ... you're not going to the balance down the value slowly going up at some point the rubber meets the road Nokia you either sell that property with a huge chunk of money you make or maybe you pay it off and you have a two hundred thousand dollar house\nThat uh that you sell or it it's a retirement you're on your financial wealth it is a big part of most folks um retirement strategy sure I mean you think about what am I
