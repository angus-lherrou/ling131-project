Talking about\nFenway Park must have been busting at this you know they will show that he was absolutely full but you speak a court case we actually went to court may as well we were up there with Carl is I'm a son and his family and\nThe granddaughter of fact I if it wasn't for you know the granddaughter I probably still be the corn based\nOn my way out she was really good head a little child ... yes yes she was really good at getting out of there because I was starting to have a panic attack it was it was just all the corn looks the same if you ever been to one of the aisle yeah it's not like you say ... every year looking at ... and yeah yeah which is different from\nHumans because everybody's different right exactly anyway let's talk real estate he was there was a report that came out in the least on our station this morning from Freddie Mac yet that ah that people are kind of are starting to rent a little bit more because of the price of homes your comment\nAbout well my comment is that we've we've always we we've for many years now seen ...\nIncrease in rental people out there and for a couple of different reasons number one normally there are new home sales which is a new household formation run about forty percent on in a good environment but they've it in the thirty percent top bracket of in the last five or six years now\nAnd it's it's for a couple of different reasons number one the millennials obviously we've talked about that before I don't want to commit they don't want that commitment of homeownership they haven't made that decision\nAnd they think that you know we don't know if we really want to buy a home right now or wait we don't know if we're gonna stay here and this location or move\nSo that that's a big aspect of the other thing is that people\nOlder people have now downsized their kids have moved out of their houses they delivered those yeah they've they've sold their houses and they want to simplify life\nBut finding that perfect downsize home may have not been available to them so they've decided to go into the rental there'd be renters now I don't I I say that I I don't really promote renting is obviously I'm a real jerk and I promote homeownership\nBut for some people rental works ... you know so I mean depending on your individual circumstances is that it could possibly work\nIs this a newer development looking over the decades is something that is relatively new or to the American um housing industry\nYes yes and the answer to that is yes of course because what what's happened is over the years we've progressed\nWell I can almost hear those thumbs whizzing as people are going through there a Google Search activities right there which state leads the nation and potato chip which one is number one that's got to the phones right now and see if we have a winner dry cities talk radio what state is it\nMarilyn\nNot not Marilyn good yes that was one of the original Thirteen yeah yeah so we have twelve more to go there you go right your odds of gotten just a little bit better so what's the number one potato chip producing state in the country one of the original Thirteen states okay that's our question today and uh\nI don't think this was a surprise anyone when you stop and think about it you know Andrew after the actual state is revealed there but you can imagine that uh they might be a contender for that so give us a call for seven seven ten Ninety One if you just want to take a guess you know there's twelve ... twelve other of the original Thirteen states less for you to guess\nWhich one is number one and potato chip production\nOkay and it made sense to me after you told me well I guess I guess several of them yeah\nMhm somebody's is going to have to take a dip in their gifts pool and see if they can come up with the right answer I guess ... or maybe they're Googling it or we should say appropriately doing a Web search for it\nYes but I think Google is sort of entered that eh okay they've gotten their answers back now suddenly the as we used to say the switchboard lit up like Christmas let's go and see we have winter tries to these talk radio which state do you think it is\nFrank Gehry ago absolutely right it is Pennsylvania the the Keystone State and did you have to look that went up\nNo I I'm\nFrom Maryland and I knew that\nOkay uh well very good
