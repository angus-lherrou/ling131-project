their life in Christ so often we hear about absent fathers or know fathers at all and the detrimental impact that has on girls particularly I think both boys and girls obviously the girls seem to struggle with a healthy identity then and we so often here\nWhen they grow up to be teens they will look for love and all the wrong places looking for that father affection\nDescribe how that can really\nCommunicate a heavenly fathers image to his girls yeah well first I Would say\nAnd this really what what I Try to practice is just presidents I think president is more important than anything else literally being there being there in the moments when they're happy being there in the moments when they're sad being there just as many moments as you can be there you'd be there and when I say be there it's not just be there like you were in the room but it's intentionally\nLetting them know that you hear them that you see them that you value them and it's difficult for all of us I mean I talk about if it can the book a little bit on this reality like for me I Love listening to radio talk radio can sort of talk radio liberal talker I just love listening and just hearing people's perspectives and\nSo it's easy for me to put my ear buds in isn't cleaning the house from moving around and just literally to ignore everything that's going on around me and I had to make an intentional an effort to take the ... out and just be there in my home you know what I'm doing dishes or when I'm sleeping the floor just\nThey're just being around so I can hear what's going on in their lives and aside from presidents and just being intentional I think it's tailor made depending on because all of our girls are different having four daughters I Know that\nEvery girl is different because my four are absolutely different from each other every one of them\nAnd they all received of different ways so just being aware enough about what sparked them or what makes them tick\nUm you know from my oldest daughter she really doesn't need a lot of conversation she likes to be in the room she likes to sit in my lap she likes to you know it's really just being there but for my second daughter it's a lot of interaction she's very talkative she wants to tell me about her next gymnastics moves ensure that genetics move them at me help run an extra ... so\nThere's just this reality that there are different so like if you have more than one daughter it's really you know tell we're making what you're doing with each of them based on their personalities and based on what you learned because you are there\nAnd you are aware of what's going on again the point being that critical love connection so they see a father's love and they can understand it and uh we hear so many of the negative stories where it didn't happen and it causes a young girl to go off the rails and that's a good thing for dads to be responsible for an eye on it\nAnd I'm not done it perfect by any stretch and one of the things I really love is having not been a perfect dead for fourteen years are just recently just this week I was looking at 'em an article that somebody did on my twins at their school and they said who is your hero and they said my dad something like All right I'm not doing it perfectly but I'm Still they're heroes\n[laughter] that is\nNow once you're on the mom's side you were a little girl so you can share the struggles with them how do you approach in cultivating kind of a spiritual attitude with your daughter's as the mom\nYou know it's interesting 'cause even just going back a little bit to what a giant and was just saying about\nGrowing up as a little girl without a dad that was my story I grew up as a little girl without a dad in the home and so even as um\nMothering my girls I'm seeing guys do child like I owe and over again and so that has been on a neat experience and so when it causes me it's just it's the same thing just being president\nI'm a little more understanding what the emotions and things 'cause I remember being fourteen ... just you know being ten and eleven and in all those things on\nBut really being president listening to them knowing it that like letting them know that they are hurt\nBut then also just even in the emotion bringing them back to the truth so letting them know that they're feeling emotions whatever's going on like\nWe can be there and I can understand but let's go back to what God has to say about what we're dealing with in what we're doing and so just my presence and being there and pulling back to ...\nWhich is so good spending time with your kids yeah [noise]\n... let me move to the idea of obedience um I think you know again being a parent a boy's this can be an area that's tough you know this is what we said to do you didn't do it except for how how is that obedience with girls sometimes challenged what does that look like\nTrying to get girls in line because my impression again is that it's much easier 'cause girl listen far better how sure\nAre [laughter]\nOh why's why's girls tell me how I'm wrong or I'm right\nYeah I Would say if you are at all no I you know I think about children and their ... and like some of our daughters have stronger Wilson others\nSo there's a couple of things that when you think about why we think about obedience and the first is and which are always says is like choose your battles wisely like their ... with girls especially there are some things\nThat can just be an emotional it can just go down and down and down and we're battling we find out we're battling over something that's really not even it's not a biblical issue it's not even really a household standard issue it's just something we haven't had that we want so I just\nTend to think that we choose your battles wisely but then also that we when we see them doing things that would please the harder to God that we tell them that and make sure you to ... so you're just an affirmation\nOf the stories in the book dealt with I think getting the girls to bed if they were struggling with that so I was just really relieved to hear that but go ahead what was it was a struggle like thinking about it\nIs actually a story that I just remember very vividly about your girls were just struggling to get to bed every night were yelling we're trying all these different methods and winter hurt a method from a friend of hers I Can't quite remember the methodology sure that\nWe really haven't either I just you know a friend of mine it read this book and she said it really worked where when the kids won't go to bed what you say to them is mommy and daddy state when we say up to get work done so if you're not going to bed you need to stay out and work\nYou already know the why we're so you think\nSure you know the wife or a swim all worked out even a game of hoop with it you know we're more than that we're a cause\nWhen you take your jumps on and so why someone else is getting job training [noise] take the cardio but [noise] once kids are in an after school enrichment program\nPractice down basing dogs as it to practice is her leadership skills\nWe work with people no matter their age income or background and give them the opportunity to learn grow and thrive on at all with one simple goal in mind to strengthen our communities and we got so much more that does

their journey tore price\nThat's least reliable and he'll encourage us today to show the good news of Jesus Christ with our friends in our family members in easy natural way\nThanks for listening today to the broadcast I'm John fuller and your host is focused president and author gym daily John ... is well known as the former atheist who wrote the book the case for Christ I've read that I've\nGiven so many of them a classic um where it was also the title of a film about his life that came out just last year and in today's message at least going to share some ideas\nOn how to open up a conversation about face with people in our sphere of influence and this is so helpful or let me tell you it's easier than you think you can do it and\nWith more here's ... speaking to focus on the families that\nAre going to pick up right after his opening remarks\nWe moved to Texas to be near our two oldest grandchildren that live right around the corner we're helping to home school them\nAnd uh and they become total Texas I'm telling you might oh yeah oh I'm telling you my twelve year old granddaughter Abigail she's got the cowboy hat she's got the cowboy boots she's taking horseback riding lessons but the reason we know she's a total sex and\nThe other night at dinner she said can I pray for dinner we said sure so this is what she prayed God is good God is great thank you for the Lone Star state [laughter]\nThat's a true Texan that that that is a true Texan well you know when I moved to Texas being from Chicago\nUm I thought how am I going to connect with this Texas culture they have a book on how to talk Texan so I bought it and I read it and I learned how to talk Texan but here's the thing I learned that I like the most\nIf you're in Texas and you want to say thank you to someone you can say thank you or you can say\nAppreciate you isn't that nice not I appreciate it appreciates you and that's what I Want to say to you appreciate you appreciate all y'all [laughter]\nThank you for your service thank you for the mission that you're fulfilling with great zeal and enthusiasm and a strategic planning and so uh we're in a crisis as you know in this nation their families\nAnd you're on the front lines so I thought well what can I talk about today and and uh a passage came to mind\nA cause I thought you can't go wrong quoting Jesus right now so I I was thinking of the sermon on them out\nAnd I was thinking when when Jesus got up two thousand years ago and he's speaking to a crowd on a hillside but really I Believe by extension he was looking down through history and he was looking at you\nToday and this is what he said you are the salt of the year\nYou were the light of the world\nA city on a hill cannot be hidden neither do people light away up and put it under a ball instead they put it on a standard against like to everyone in the house in the same way let your light shining among others that they may see your good deeds and praise your father and heaven\nWhat did Jesus mean by those metaphors of salt why I think he meant you know if you're going to be a follower of mine I I I Want you to live life like salt that that make people thirst for God\nI watch a live like the like the shy my message of hope and grace in love and redemption an eternal life that that shine that message into dark areas of despair\nAnd the question I Want to address these next few minutes is what does that look light\nIn the twenty first century so and as I think in this or I thought well what if Jesus physically lived in my house well what I learned from the master in terms of how he would relate to people he would encounter along the way of life the neighbors and so\nAs soon as I studied this life there's so many things I learned and and uh you know we could talk about serving other people that you're talking about authenticity is a lot of things I'm just going to hit on two of them today the first one is this I Believe that if Jesus physically lived in my house\nThat before he talked to his neighbor about their heavenly father he would talk to his heavenly father about his neighbor\nYou would pray\nRight of course he was before Jesus embark on anything of significance he brought it to the father in prayer\nThat you ever thought about the fact that Jesus prayers for spiritually lost people continued right up until his final gas son the cross then when you read the New Testament the original Greek which has written one of the things you notice is that the imperfect tends to the Greek suggests\nThat Jesus did not just say at once but he kept repeating it all through the torture the crucifixion while the nails are being driven through his wrists while the nails are being driven through his feet\nHe kept praying he kept repeating father forgive them bother forgive them father forgive them for they know not what they do\nPrayers for people so spiritually depraved they were torturing the death the son of God they continued until his final gas Sunday across in his British pastor John ... said in light of that\nHow can we justify not praying consistently and fervently and expect ... for spiritual\nThe people in our lives\nNow I Know the uh logically that you know we can't buy our prayers for somewhat against their will to bend the needed Jesus I get that but I also believe James when he says the prayers of right just people make a\nDifference because I Believe they do I've seen it I've seen in\nA member when I was a pastor at a church outside Chicago we were doing a baptism service\nAnd uh by God's Grace we're baptized ... seven hundred new believers that day and we told people as they came up to be baptized if you want to bring a friend or someone to lead you to the lord or a spouse feel free to do that which is playing the gospel and what baptism is all about and then people started to come up through baptized\nSo this woman comes up for me to be baptized since she was about sixty five years old um and there was a man with her and he was a tough looking bird you know what I mean just a tough wiring kinda straight away she's here and I say you're here to be baptized she said yes I Am I so that's great if you receive Jesus as your lord and savior she said with all my heart\nSuch great and then let's go to baptize er\nAnd I are you shouldn't do this but I felt a prompting from the Holy Spirit I turned to the man and I said I'm excuse me or you were husband\nHe said well yes I Am I said have you given your life to Jesus any clear to me in his face kinda screwed up I thought it was going to hit me or something and then he burst into tears\nFront of thousands of people have we been shopping all I could say was no I haven't but I Want to right now during the time out can we do this okay great so this guy in front of thousands of people repent service in receives tries forgiveness and baptized him and his wife together\nSo after the service I'm walking down off the platform this other woman I didn't know comes running up to me she rolls around her arms just weeping and sobbing well she can say it's eight years eight years and I said you know what do you mean ... years so that's my brother who use just led to the lord and baptized\nI have been praying for that man for nine or a eight long years\nAnd that whole time I've not seen one glimmer of interest in God\nLook what God did today\nAnd you're my first thought was there was a woman who was glad she didn't stop praying in year\nSeven who've we stopped praying for whoever you stop praying for\nWho is who you love you maybe you went to school with or an old neighbor or family member whoever and you used to live up to God but over time it's almost as if we make the decision for them it's almost like we decide and is it ever going to happen and we kind of style and I think that women would say don't give up\nKeep praying lifting them up\nI was an atheist for much of my life\nAnd I I was a hard headed hard hearted legal editor of the Chicago Tribune and when my wife became a Christian she met some women at church and she said I don't have any hope for my husband is a hard headed hard hearted illegal letter to trim he's never going to bend is needed Jesus\nAnd this one elderly saying put her arm around her shoulder kind of pulled her to the side said oh Leslie\nNo one is beyond hope and she gave reverse in the Old Testament is equal thirty six twenty six officers moreover I Will give you a new heart and I will put a new spirit within you I Will remove from you your heart of stone and give you a harder flash\nBut we didn't tell them one thing not that it would appear\nBut we didn't let them know that right where he was standing underneath the platform was a room in that room was filled for the entire two and a half hours of the debate with Christians who are praying that the case for Christ would go out with all those convicting power in the case for atheism would be recognized for the bankrupt philosophy that it is\nIf you've seen the video this debate is on YouTube you can watch it you know got answered that prayer\nBecause we have people vote what's your spiritual conditioned when you come in who won the debate what's your spiritual tradition as you walk out initially we just took the balance of people who walked in and skeptics agnostic atheist just among those non believers having heard the case for Christ\nAnd the case for atheism over eighty two percent said the case for Christ was by far the most compelling and forty seven people walked in has confirmed atheist heard both sides and walked out of his followers of Jesus Christ\nAnd you know what else [noise]\nNot one person became an atheist\nAnd just say friends we have an unfair advantage in the marketplace of ideas we have truth on our side\nPenn is a huge advantage to what am I saying we all go out the beating people no no I think God as gifted very few people who have the right academic credentials and experience to do debates that's great\nBut I'm not a debate or you're probably not a debater I think for us the key word is not debate it's dialogue it's conversations it's friendships it's sitting down with someone who who are skeptical about the fate and giving them the space to ask questions\nTo express doubts where we'd validate them as someone made in the image of God who is valuable to God where we respect the fact or on a journey\nNot as far as long as we are that's okay we do more listening the talking\nAnd we help them get resolution of whatever sticking point is holding them up\nFriends I think a vandalism and the twenty first century is spelled apologetic because so many people have the sticking points but we can help them we can help them get past those so they can make progress in their journey toward Christ\nAnd friends we got to create in our homes or in our Christian schools in our churches safe places especially for young people where it's OK\nTo ask any questions okay to express any doubt because if we don't give him the freedom to doubts begin to well up inside and they will road there so if we get into a discussion we can help them\nGet past whatever sticking point is holding a lot you know this is the unexpected adventure of the Christian life\nYou never know how God might use you to be a Lincoln the chain the spiritual chain leading someone to faith in Christ\nAnd I'll just end with my favorite story about an unexpected venture to happen to me and I was a pretty new Christian I was I'm Still at the newspaper in Chicago and uh it was the end of a long day\nPacking my stuff up and um I felt\nMoved by the Holy Spirit and a very specific way I just felt compelled\nThen I needed to go into the business office of the newspaper and invite my atheist friend to Easter services at our church 'cause Easter was coming up I just felt very specifically the guy was leading me to do this and I'm thinking this is great because of God is really leading me to do this something wonderful is going to happen he's probably going to repent right there right now\nYeah so I have full confidence right so I walked over to the business office I looked in all I see is my friend behind his desk said thank the lord\nSo I went up to him and said hey how ya doing I'm doing good I said hey you know Easter is coming up he says trouble you know I'm an atheist I said yeah yeah I Know but Easter is when we remembered the resurrection of Jesus he said he wasn't resurrected that's where I actually you know there is good historical evidence that he was\nGoing to give them some of this evidence that the I think is compelling the shows that Jesus no explained to be the son of God he backed it up by returning from the dead I start and and I taught for a few minutes on that but didn't look like there was helping\nSaddam scramble I'm trying to think of another approach so I said oh wait a minute I said we've got raped music at our church why don't you and your wife joined Leslie me\nCome to our church at Easter you love the music he's looked at me he said I don't want to go to your stupid church\nHey okay hey listen no problem free shaded I'll I'll talk to you later you know if you have a question you know where my officers I'll see ya I walked out and what was that all about why did I feel so specifically compelled to go into the business office\nTo get into a spiritual conversation to invite him to services the church that given the evidence for the resurrection and it just shut me down and I'm telling you this bothered me\nFor years 'cause to this day he's still an atheist let me tell you the rest of the story several years after\nThat by then it was a pastor at a church outside Chicago and a guy comes up to me ... ... after a service and he says can I shake your hand and thank you for the spiritual if once you've had in my life\nI said what's really nice but who are you somebody tell you my story\nA few years ago I lost my job and I didn't have any money in the bank I thought it was my car I thought was my house I was in a panic I needed a paycheck for a while to get by\nSo he said I call the friend of mine that ran a newspaper I said you have any odd jobs I can do to earn a buck for a while and the guy said well can you tile floors\nI said yeah I can tile floors that Tyler bathroom I think I can do that the guy so we need some title installed and replaced at the newspaper if you can do that we can pay for a while so I said great he said so I went to work at the newspaper\nHe said one day not long before Easter I was in the business office of the newspaper and I was on my hands and knees weren't going to have some time on the floor behind a big desk\nAnd you walked in I don't think you knew I was there and you start talking this guy about God and you start invite him to your church you start getting the evidence for the resurrection and this guy was shut you down\nBut I'm On my hands and knees I'm listening to all this stuff and my heart speeding fast I'm\nThinking I Need God I Need to go to church source as soon as you left I called my wife I said we're going to church is Easter she said why I said yeah he said we came to your church that Easter I came to feed my wife came to faith in our teenage son came to face and I just wanted to thank you

podcasts and so magazines all these opportunities to share your message of hope and grace\nWe thank you for those and we pray that you would use each person here to make a difference for youth through this great organization but we also pray that in our families\nAnd in our communities and in our neighborhoods you would use us\nTo be stronger salt and brighter light\nThat we might be taken by you

episode of the broadcast\nA John I got to tell you I'm very excited about the ideally mentioned in the first half of his message there to pray for one spiritually lost friends for one minute at one o'clock every day between now and Christmas and that's exactly ten weeks from today\nAnd as you're praying for that friend or family member pray for an opportunity to invite them to Christmas services

the past year over two hundred thousand people said they made decisions for Christ because of\nFocus right cities talk radio station am nine to Eugene cw Johnson City for Brazil [noise]\nSpecial report deadly Pittsburgh synagogue shooting I'm Christopher groups it's the worst attack on worshipping Jews in American history\nPolice say forty six year old Robert Bowers entered the tree of life synagogue in east Pittsburgh yesterday morning armed with a semi automatic rifle and three handguns a shot and killed eleven people Congressman Mike Doyle\nOur hearts are broken for the Jewish community here this was a senseless hate crime people were\nYou know in a house of worship and were killed by a person who hated them because of their religion governor\nTom Wolfe anti Semitism has absolutely no place in our commonwealth any attack on one community of faith in Pennsylvania is an attack against every community in pills faith in Pennsylvania\nSix people were wounded among them for police officers police quickly swarmed the building on word it'll be attacking traded gunfire with the government who was shot multiple times but survived you now faces at least twenty nine pounds I'm Christopher cruise\nThe effort to start new businesses came to not a screeching halt under the Obama administration but it dropped to record lows and that has all turned around\nA a very common response of the business person\nFive years ago to the burdens that government was placing on them was if I had to start my business today I wouldn't do it or I couldn't do it well that attitude is changing and you see it reflected in the optimism of small business owners and their organizations that measure that optimism it's the highest it's been in decades\nAnd a lot of that is not because of the ... just the tax bill which is what a lot of people focus on it\nLower taxes it's because government is making an effort on affirmative effort to get out of the way to expand freedom and opportunity\nIn the form of getting rid of unnecessary regulations that has real big affects\nAll across our economy even if you don't own that business that business can now higher one more person it can invest in R and D It can buy a new machine or expand to a new plant it can do all those things because it's not spending that money just to comply with regulatory oversight\nInteresting those surveys that you just referenced can often show that\nRegulation is a bigger problem a bigger roadblock for many businesses then even taxes are yeah as a matter of fact some of the recent surveys with the economy doing so well showing finding qualified workers has risen to the top of the list as a problem followed by regulatory relief\nAnd taxes now in third place so when we look at this regulatory relieved that is occurring and now regulatory relief is not the number one problem because of it can you drill down a little bit and tell us what specific areas has the Trump Administration been successful in terms of cutting regulations and where might we see them go in the future\nIn the last year you've seen a primary driver is health and Human Services and you'll see that over the course of the next year as well\nWhere because of the massive cost of health care as the federal government has stripped away regulations blocking what businesses can do and creating more options\nMany of those options costs less money\nAnd so give them those businesses the opportunity to get health care at a lower cost them to do those kinds of things and those have been major major cost drivers I'm using very rough numbers here but ha chess has been responsible for about half of the regulatory savings and most of that is in the health care area\nAnd I think you can expect to continue to see that going forward as we see new announcements out of the Trump Administration about how they're stripping away requirements off Obamacare\nTo make it easier to comply with to make it costs to last for businesses to comply with and thereby allow them to extend health care\nOpportunities to their workers that don't otherwise exist\nWe have been talking with Ken Cuccinelli who is director of the regulatory action center at the freedomworks male nation and can tell us just a little bit about freedomworks and where can folks go to learn more\nFreedomworks is on the Web at freedomworks dot org\nFreedomworks says for organizations two of them are political packs and then one is a five oh one C. four which works on legislation to cut taxes and welfare reform is a top priority for us and then in the foundation where I work the five oh one C. three we fight regulations and we do education of Americans\nWe have been again talking with Ken Cuccinelli up freedomworks skin thank you for being with us\nGreat to be with you again\nAndy Ross is at the offices of the club for growth in Washington DC but of course he is keeping a very close eye on the number of very hotly contested US Senate races around the country also party control of Congress is up in the air Andy good to have you here\nHi thanks for having me\nThere appears to be better and better news for Republicans when it comes to retain control of the U.S Senate perhaps even an opportunity for Republicans to expand their majority there\nFirst of all and the are there any of these key races that have been hotly contested that you think now we're sort of moving heavily into one camp or the other\nLet me start with the seats the Republicans are defending their defending a total and immediately wants to cycle started six of those were completely safe and only two are in jeopardy but because of retirements in a few other things that number has expanded to four\nAnd so you have Ted Cruz and Texas Marsha Blackburn in Tennessee Martha makes Sally in Arizona and Dean Heller\nIn Nevada and at one point in time all of those look like they could get lost I think Ted Cruz's now safely going to get reelected barring some unforeseen disaster I think the same thing can be said about Marsha Blackburn and then in Arizona\nAnd Nevada I think that the Republican candidates there are slowly pull in a way of a Democrat in Arizona here since cinema had just a disastrous last couple of weeks she was a recorded on tape calling or Arizona a meth lab\nAnd a few other things so that is looking better and better for Republicans and so's Nevada so if you assume all of those are are safe then that means that Republicans are playing offense going into election day\nAnd so the number one pick up I think is North Dakota that one is getting almost to the point of ridiculous of how safe that is for Republicans and then after that you've got a couple of races like Missouri\nIndiana and Florida that are very very close I Would say Missouri is probably the next likely to go for Republicans\nIn Indiana and Florida so right there that four seats\nAnd then you've got Montana in West Virginia that are tightening that the Republicans could pick up as well so then you've got six now I think it would be an extreme long shot if Republicans picked up all six seats but if they did the majority would go from fifty one to fifty seven\nAnd boy that would be a huge ... defeat of the Democrats\nAnd their agenda it might incite a lot of introspection on the Democrats part that they were able to lose all the seats when Trump became such a polarizing figure and yet he was still able to help pick up all those seats\nSo it'll be a remarkable thing to watch on ... on election day but I Do think that things are definitely going in the Republicans' favor\nOne state we haven't really talked about is Mississippi unusual circumstance there to US Senate seats up but both of you think are safely Republican\nRoger Wicker is up for reelection and he he's kind of been saved the entire cycle\nThe other one Thad Cochran was the incumbent but he resigned due to poor health the governor appointed a Cindy Hyde Smith I think she was the ag commissioner for the state\nShe's the first woman senator from Mississippi ever she has been surveying for several months now she's obviously running for reelection and she's got the support of the party of course and big establishment money like the chamber of commerce ah Chris McDaniel\nWho almost defeated Thad Cochran back in twenty fourteen\nHas attempted to challenge Cindy Hyde Smith\nFor that seat but his campaign has been plagued by incompetence ...\nAnd a lack of fund raising and other things so he's just not going to be competitive so yes both of those Mississippi seats are safe and they're safe in Republican hands\nLet's talk also a little bit more about Florida there you have the governor of the Republican governor of Florida Rick Scott running against the Democrat incumbent how has\nThe recent hurricane they're impacted that raised ... governors have to deal with the aftermath of hurricanes\nYeah it's it's a in a in an interesting dynamic when Rick Scott first got into the race he immediately went on a on a media blitz\nAnd spent millions and millions of dollars in fact I think Florida is the most expensive Senate race right now and that's due in large part because of his own spending the Rick Scott spending and he was able to create a fairly sizeable lead in the polling\nBut Bill Nelson has fought back in his tightened the race to where it's now basically a coin flip what's interesting here though is that uh because of the hurricanes Rick Scott has had to somewhat suspend his campaign in order to provide the leadership that\nHe needs to provide as governor of of the state to get the state through that hurricane and and the aftermath by that role of being governor in the aftermath of that hurricane\nHas provided him with a lot of our media and it has revealed itself\nHe is a good leader and he he he has handled things well so far so it's not like he has this has harmed his ability in the Senate race but as I said before the race his neck and neck it's fifty fifty and I don't think we're going to truly know over the winter has until election day\nLet's talk now for a minute or two about the house of representatives everything that you've talked about very rosy for Republicans in the Senate could be a little bit odd this year though one chamber might go one way and the other the other way are Democrats still favored to take control of the house of representatives\nThey are and I think right now the question is is how big is that the margin of control going to be for the Democrats I think if Republicans have their way\nMobile industry is on the cusp of the next big technology and mobile communications called five gee the five gee mobile technology will carry more than twenty times the data loaded the courage for G. technology this means faster download times for bandwidth hungry applications like HD video\nAnd it's even more than twenty times faster for certain other types of data five gee technology will be very expensive to implement however\nIt will cost literally billions upon billions of dollars and that's where this merger makes sense\nFor rising and Eighteen T both have capital and access to capital in the order of magnitude required to roll out five gee sprint and T Mobile our capital constrained by comparison\nBecause of this it will take them longer to update their networks and in the meantime\nThey will be operating at a competitive disadvantage\nIn a marketplace that values the latest technology and we're customer loyalty is at best a secondary consideration the result in likelihood is that for rising and AT and T\nWould pick off millions of technology obsessed customers from sprint and T Mobile further enlarging the too big players and shrinking the two smaller MSN owes\nIt wouldn't be long before they're easy pickings for mergers with the big two leading to only to long term him into survivors but if the two smaller Amman owes proposed merger is approved there would be three surviving him into sort of comparable size\nSo the question before the FCC and the department of justice is not whether it is in the public interest to go from for him in those two or three\nBut whether it is better in the long run to have three ... than two three and my nose will also compete more vigorously for the business of dozens of envy and those\nIf there are only two and Mentos then there's a good chance that they'll ease into a kind of ... of two players\nWho don't really compete head to head but rather decided to carve up the envy in a marketplace between them probably geographically that would further reduce competition in the mobile communications space\nI Would urge faithful listeners of American radio journal to contact their senators and members of Congress and tell them to support the sprint and T Mobile proposed merger it's one of those rare cases where a merger would promote rather than reduce competition and dust is

Washington County mayor job granted by several issues of topics including\nThe recent historic joint meeting between the Washington so I'm In Cali commissions also my colleague Don Hillman chats with Barry brick in public education off some of the ... fire department there'll be talking about October being a fire prevention month\nAnd I'll chat with Dr Steven ... from the Solomon county regional health department about the flu season and the importance of getting vaccinated with a flu shot up first though Pearl ... and Joe brandy\nCounty and\nMeet several times a year and we have several of our Mr that are going to go down there and\nThere's a lot of they got there [noise]\nOkay so this is an opportunity them for I guess you're a you know the the new commissioners perhaps coming on board to learn more about it who's who's involved with this\nWell we have several measures that are going down one of 'em are earning that\nI'm watching it now I Know a ... ... down there and a lot of people in our state county [noise]\nOkay so uh this is obviously being attended by a lot of different county mayors Israel that transition to the historic get together that the Washington County ... county commissions had recently where the two missions got a commissions got together\nAnd just sort of got acquainted and talked over things give us if you will uh Joe a thumbnail description of how you felt the meeting when and what his purpose was maybe where it's headed\nWas the first time um that the Solomon county Washington missions and ever to gather a joint\nFor the most part was to express our\nFire or regional cooperation with war and gave our mission is not easy to spend a little time together break bread together you get to know each other better or as we've been working on various products\nRight we are there any particular initiatives or perhaps resolutions not binding but just ideas for the combined commissions that came out of that\nThat are part of the nation that uh we put together express desire to support you know a cooperation effort and I'm In Washington they have Irish rose stopped by pretty busy schedule obviously and\nRight now but the rest of our nation for us\nWe had a bunch of a book missions they are always there and a number of other guests on all of US cities the our chamber of commerce leadership at me and I'm\nNot no one was there ... years versus the and I'm now in the valley you know there are a lot of uh interest is folks that are getting the part of that again\nAnd looking at that and the outcome of it in an inch historic nature to do you anticipate that there might be more similar sorts of meetings of the euro county Washington or other counties reaching out to different counties or in the future do do similar sorts of things or or what do you envision\nWell a couple of things there a first initiative and read them on our priorities that are actually twice already this week working on\nA liaison a pass or or\nMaybe a few\nA made up of measures\nLeader dean\nRepresentative talks area to look into next year\nSo we do and then I'm that good I mean together really very\nOdd make them out of the mountains and the next few days\nAnd they'll get together and work on the next step and our mission you get back to the other part of the moderate wasting bark a\n... a year should just from that meeting orders\nTo invite our neighboring counting representative government together as part of the ADA county New York the dinner scene a burden development as Britain\nYou know we just feel like we're going to be stronger or ... gathering in Lawrence they buy them all the way\nYou know regional is and we're thinking out loud to Joe Grande Washington County mayor on the road to Chattanooga for a a visual business\nYou know regional lives him has been counted for decades if not centuries\nFor northeast Tennessee and yet or in many ways it seems like we have been up to recently sort of a disparate bag if you would have a little smaller local entities that are really sort of failed to get together on any kind of meaningful regional ... approach\nAnother big cause of fires to smoking and smoking materials make sure that if you are going to smoke that you use good heavy ashtrays or smoke outside and then leave smoking materials up in high places where kids can't get hold of them\nI knew a lot of people live in a specially in this area have got electric stoves versus a versus natural gas ... and they may think to themselves especially with some of the where the uh that that\nI guess the cover of the electric so like we've got a a still that doesn't really have the old electric coils it's just that the surface ... yeah um and so people are thinking well I've got this versus an open flame\n... it's not as to step the biggest fire is it is it's up to both as a still a a danger like a natural gas are the ones with the old ...\nWhat a lot of people don't realize when you're cooking if you have something on high or even between medium and high you are probably pass the combustion point of most oils and so if you're cooking and you have some oil and it's starting to smoke a little bit that means it's very close to his combustion point you need to turn the heat down\nLet's talk a little bit about uh about a smoke detectors smoke alarms things like that what's the best advice that you can get people on those\nOnly Kingsport fire department like to remind everybody to check the smoke alarms make sure they're working\nYou need to check on the back of the smoke alarm and make sure that it's not over ten years old and if it is over ten years old you need to replace it with a new one preferably one that has a photo electric alarm with a long life batteries in it that way it'll last you a long time you don't have to worry about changing those batteries out\nYou know it was going to ask you about the the newer ones that are coming out um that's that's actually prefer will because the battery does last is there anything that people need to check on those or how long are those usually good\nFor a lot of the new smoke alarms with a long life battery we still suggest that you test them every month and that way your family is really familiar with what they sound like and they will know what the sound is if there is a real fire and that way you can also practice every once in a while and that way the kids know and everybody in your home well now\nI think most new homes are constructed with our uh alarmed or smoke detectors and um if ... how many rooms in a home and do you suggest that you actually have a smoke alarm should there be one in every room minimum\nWith the modern code there are smoke alarms inside every bedroom there is also in the hallway outside the bedrooms and all of your living areas and a lot of people think I Need one in my kitchen well you might have false alarms if there's one in your kitchen and it's usually suggested that there is one within about Fifteen feet of your kitchen in case there is a fire\nAnd our final guests on dateline tri city says Dr Steven ... he's medical director with the solar mentality regional health department we talk about the flu season and the importance of getting a flu shot\nWell of course were started in the season the kids are back into school and uh uh I Do like to spread viruses among each other and we're seeing a lots of types of virus\nThat are circulating so uh it's not just flew\nBut it's a multiple other viruses that are particularly circulating ah we're we're actually seeing sporadic cases but it's not at our widespread re yet or through our weekly survey once we get to the state health department\n[noise] this only emphasizes though that this is the time now's the time to get your flu vaccine and protect the ones you love\nA flu vaccine uh is uh\nThe best preventive measure that we have\nTo keep you from getting the flu and spreading it to other people or the vaccine or has been reformulated from last year but not with a major change but some minor changes um most of the vaccine has either three or four strains and in\nThe new thing is they share the nose spray is back a particularly for children\nUh and and so we're encouraging everybody over the age of six months or should be able to go ahead and received their flu vaccine there's a couple of very minor a Contra indications but those are very very rare\nIs urban gun shoot about what type of flu season we might be this year whether it'll be severe maybe not so much so\nWell we know last year the age three into strain a particularly was a more virulent last year and we lost more people to flew last year than we've lost in a number of years [noise]\nAh we still don't have any indication yet as to what we're going to get into this year uh but uh it is still doesn't negate the fact that the flu vaccine or\nEven if you do get the flu with the flu vaccine it keeps it from being a severe a of the people who died and particularly we get really upset when we lose our children are pregnant ladies\nUh all those who died from a boat that type of flu last year had not received the vaccine or so that encourages you that that is providing at least some level of protection even though you may get in you know the vaccine's not one hundred percent effective or\nThe other thing is it's very important that we vaccinate those around those who may not respond well to the vaccine so those who are at higher risk immuno compromised\nUm have chronic disease conditions because we already know in that population the vaccine doesn't work quite as well so you want to vaccinate a ring around them to protect them even though they may have even had the vaccine\nSo uh we we use this same ring approach when we were advocating smallpox and we're on the verge of eradicating polio\nUh but you want a vaccinator ring around those who are at greatest risk to protect them or should they not get adequate protection from the flu shot or not able to receive the flu vaccine the other thing is this is the season for appropriate respiratory hygiene\nSo keep your hands washed don't touch your eyes a cover a cough or sneeze and for goodness sake if you're sick stay home don't spread it to your friends and neighbors who then by carry it to their loved ones who are are at great risk\nUm there are a lot of viruses circulating right now that look similar to flu\nAnd so this this makes this concept of\nA what I call a hygienic manners to share with each other a\nYou know keeping your hands clean and I'm not touching your face particularly your eyes\nAre covered a cough or sneeze or doing these conservative measures this just courteous\nTo your to your fellow human beings and so a practice good respiratory uh hygiene and Hettick advocate and then you need to get your flu vaccine once again protect the ones that you look for\nA little bit of prevention now and hopefully save something bad from happening down to one and a little bit\nOh absolutely and uh if you talk to these people that lost cherished loved ones last year to the flu they all universally say I wish we had gotten the flu shot\nAnd one thing that Dr Steven ... medical director with the sole them and county regional health department thanks again for listening to date wine try cities so

treated like a password of code or magical formula and we've repeated to prove that we're real\nLutherans well what does it mean\nHere's what it means I'm\nNot God you're not God God is God God\nIs God with us or without us but God became God for us when he became the man Jesus of Nazareth\nBack to the first part I'm not God you're not in God God is God\nJust a couple of months before he posted his famous Ninety five feces on October thirty first Fifteen Seventeen Martin Luther wrote the following man is by nature and able to want God to be God indeed he himself wants to be gone and does not one God to be God\nI think the possibility of\nBeing in something like Harold Crick situation is very disturbing for us smartphone toting self defining early twenty first century individuals'\nSee we've been told to write our own stories and so it's strange to imagine that we might have an author it's a strange thing letting God be God it's a strange thing being justified by grace alone\nGrace alone was the phrase the first Lutheran Protestant Reformers used to describe the one way relationship between God and God's creatures\nGod gives creatures receive passively like characters in a story\nThe Bible describes God is the author of the story of the world so we can think of the world the universe and everything that happens in it as one great long story with all of us his characters and then we must think of God as the author of this story\nThis means that God is the creator but not merely like a designer and author does more than design for\nExample my smartphone had a designer but that person hasn't touched\nThis machine and a long long time if ever the majority of of this creations lifespan is spent far removed\nFrom its design or not so with an author as long as the stories being told the author never leaves the authors continuously present in with and under all the characters settings and turns of plot and author is a creator but not in the same way that a mother and father are\nCreators of father begets and a mother gives birth to their child right away the parents begin to interact with the child is a fellow person who's like them in every way\nOnly smaller mom\nAnd dad smile baby smiles back they ask questions soon she answers there's give and take a two way relationship\nIn contrast the author character relationship only goes one way the author exist on an entirely different level for example Harry\nPotter Ronald ... her money Granger they don't have access to JK Rowling\nThey're not even real in the same way that JK Rowling Israel author makes them what they are characters can't give anything to the author that their author hasn't already given them first it's a one way relationship\nHere's how the Bible says it who has known the mind of the lord or who has been his counselor\nOr was given a gift to God that God should repay him for from him and threw him into him are all things to him be the glory into the age of the ages\nRomans eleven thirty four thirty six years old job set it in God's hands is the life of every living thing in the breath of all mankind\nIf God tears down ... can rebuild God's shuts demand in non can open\nIf God she gathered to himself his spirit and his breath all flesh would perish together in men would return to dust\nJob twelve and thirty four job's belief\nThat God is the author of all things is the thorn at the throbbing source of his anguish we continue reading the perplexing book that bears his name we hear him go on to say God has torn me in his wrath\nGod gives me up to the ungodly cast me into the hands of the wicked\nWhy do the which it live and prosper why are not times of justice\n... by the almighty job sixteen Twenty one twenty four imagined being trapped in a story like that at a turning point in the story of Harold Crick\nAgain he hears his author alluding to his past interpreting his present foreshadowing his future Tyne is tied here's the voice

hears that voice in his head\nHarold suddenly found himself beleaguered end exasperated outside the bakery\nShut up cursing the heavens and utility\nNo I'm not a person you you stupid voice or shut up and leave me alone\nEven if you want it out you couldn't escape\nYou can't stop being a character in your author's story\nThat doesn't stop you from trying you rebel against your author\nNow that you realize he's here that he's in with under everything messing with you you try to fight him resisting the movement of the story trends pressing the boundaries of you're setting but the more you struggled the more you only hurting yourself the more you fight him the more you find yourself fighting everyone around you\nSo you begin to resent your author you hate him one day you try something new to protect yourself you start to tell a different tail it goes like this there is no author\nUnit versus a an accident on guided evolution and\nThe idea of an omnipotent author is a infant tile illusion from an age without smartphones\nI must make my own meaning I must create my own the happy ending\nI Am the author of my story it's up to me to justify my life as a life worth living\nAnd so it goes\nYou know that when we reject God\nThe problem of justifying life in the face of evil and suffering doesn't go away\nIt gets worse you\nKnow you and I have to bear the God awful burden of justifying ourselves justifying our actions justifying our world or else we pass the buck onto a government and that will become our author and master\nQuestion of justification is on avoidable you
