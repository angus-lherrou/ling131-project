materials that gives off heat and energy as for\nAnd here's what I found today CNN is spending almost eighty percent of their time on the show ...\n\nEighty percent may have even if it's just sixty percent of their time on your shoulder you they're not focusing on the care of him that tells me that if the caravan wore a Democrat idea designed to embarrass Trump that they would be covering it\nAnd building it up and with people down there interviewing these people creating sob stories there'd be there'd be man on the street interviews with a mean guy Trump is are they just want to come to America to and that may yet happen down the road but the un is is not wall to wall but they are predominantly\nFocusing on the show Gabe and of course whatever CNN does just to try to damage Trump let's look at sea wife CNN is so ticked off because Trump's approval numbers are higher than they've ever been now and there are higher than Obama's war at this stage\nIn the ah in his mid terms of the same point in his presidency after two years\nThere just resigned themselves none of this is happening the way it was supposed to happen now there's more and more stories about how the blue wave may not happen hint hint it never was going to happen I don't think anybody has ever known whether it's going to be a blue wave they've been relying on polling data but nobody knows for sure that was that the media narrative\nIt was a meeting it was not born of any evidence there couldn't be any evidence for a blue wave or a red wave the electorate hasn't happened yet nobody wants to rely on polling data to suggest that it's going to happen but the polling data hasn't been accurate either starting in two thousand six dean of the presidential race\n\nSo we've got this caravan chugging north and I think you know put some things in perspective on this again the way to look at it is is as a a microcosm\nOf what's happening every day and our border every day this is what's happening\nNot seven thousand a day but but but every day this is what's been going on for decades and it needs\nTo stop\nAnd Donald Trump is the only person that's ever talked about working to make it stop now the Democrats\nIf there are behind this one of the strategic ... besides getting somebody hurt\nAnd blaming that on Trump maybe what they're hoping is a Trump actually won't do anything about it maybe they're hoping that Trump will be all Huffington puff\nTalk about sending the military down they're talking about setting a National Guard down but not actually doing anything they might be rolling the dice that Trump isn't going to do anything because they think they've rattled prompt\nWith their stories earlier this year about how he\nSeparated families the border and how Trump didn't like the network infant didn't want to last and so he did what he could change it I\nI Do know this despite\nEverything that you think you would know but common sense there are still Republicans elected Republicans look at this caravan and their solution is to let them in\n\nAs elected still there so you about peace yesterday they are so scared of this issue they are so scared\nThat when ever the subject to legal immigration comes up Democrats automatically when Republicans think they've got their show they're not cold hearted mean spirited and all that let them in their not publicly saying this but I Know that there there\nMay be the Democratic gambling is too is is is a wild guess at Trump's actually not going to do anything after huffing and puffing and I'll tell ya\nIf Trump doesn't do anything if this caravans allowed to get to the border and come into the country what do you think that would do the Trump there's one the issue that could separate Trump from his voters or at least make his do voters began to\nI don't doubt is the right where would they would be mightily disappointed particularly after Trump has said over and over again that this\nCaravan is not going to get it\nIf if if if some Republicans are behind this than that it's obvious uh but I just somebody has to be\n\nSomebody has to be making this cap and folks we're talking with we we've got how many two thousand miles\nStop and think of this from Honduras to the southern\nBorder of the United states assistance and Arizona is around two thousand miles\nSeven thousand people one day I just decided\nTo start walking to the United states\nTo thousands of miles\nI also think if you're looking for people behind this you have to look at the drug cartels and if you want to start trying to analyze will what could their politics in this be that opens up a whole new can of worms but I don't doubt that they are playing a major role in transportation\nBut there has to be political involvement here too because money has to be available there has to be money being spent on this so you've got seven thousand people who all of a sudden into side all of a sudden\n'cause nobody saw this coming and there was no advance word\nSeven thousand people decided to start walking to a thousand miles\nWe don't see pictures of of of where they're using the bathroom\nWe don't see pictures of them gathering or getting food and eating it\nI mean look at random video you might you might see some people truly think money we don't see how this is being handled we don't see the port a potties we don't see in our day just urinating and rivers and streams and what would the environmental wackos think about that if that's happening\n\nWell it [noise] I guess you you may have a point welcome to San Francisco they could already be accustomed to it especially the deaf occasions in the street and they got maps in San Francisco for the tourists can blame the piles of human the fate [noise]\n\nSo how long would it take to walk two thousand miles along with a tech\nRemember they're vowing altogether I just hit the southern border of Mexico they're vowing to get here by mid term election day\nSo I don't walk enough to know how many miles a\nDay you could walk if you just start walking and you take a periodic break and after twelve or Eighteen or whatever you stop or slow down and rest\nFor the next day that people tell me that they would have to be walking something like twenty miles a day\nFor one hundred days I mean if it makes sense to a thousand miles twenty miles a day for a hundred days without any rest\n\nA hundred days for those are real Linda that's over three months\nAnd the objective is to show up right\nAs the polls open on mid term election day so if they had been walking for what two and a half months have we seen video of the walk and it's beginning\nRemember the caravan was originally thirty five hundred or four thousand people now it's swollen

we're concerned that these migrants may be victimized by human smugglers are others who what exploit them are also deeply conservative violence\nProvoked by some members of the group as well as the apparent political motivation of some organizers of the care of and by the way they the details on that story are from the uh\nOh here's one from NBC and they are literally outraged over what ... saying secretary of state Pompeo raised the stakes last night as thousands of Central American migrants\nInvaders\nHeaded for the United states as they marched into Michael claiming they were inciting violence palm pay also they're inciting violence under the influence of politically motivated the leaders\nHow was it raising the stakes\nTo point out what is happening what is the secretary of state Pompeo raised the stakes Sunday night how is it raising mistakes to point out what's happening\nEspecially when\nWe have a party a political party that believes in open borders a media and the party that believes in open borders they will never report anything negative about these invaders\nWho right mind would want this who when their right\nMind wouldn't want any of this illegal immigration who in their right mind would promote this wants this who would want a mob an invasion of seven thousand now eight thousand people in the store on the border in the world would want that and why\n\nIt makes no commonsense under the umbrella of what's good for America\n\nWhat ever the motivation for the people who want this to happen it's not for the good of America it's got to be for something else so Pompeo goes down and promptly identifies what's happening here NBC says raising mistake what's cakes\n[noise]\nWe have somebody finally pushing back on this because remember the Republican Party up until Trump never didn't push back on this they they came up with their own reasons for wanting\nAmnesty for illegals and for you know having a fall push on securing the border on Sunday night pomp pale who met with the Mexican president went on the offensive alleging at a statement that many of the migrants were criminals themselves\nBy definition they are if they intend to cross the border illegally they're all criminals\nOne of the world is so damn hard to understand about this\nI think it's a classic illustration of how soft this country is getting in one of the reasons this country is getting soft just because the elderly or senior generations are turning over everything to the young\nWho haven't lived long enough to know what's best are being driven stole my by a motion governs solely by a motion not any ... any kind of common sense and because of some odd Kirk that's happened\nIn our sociology adults today seem unwilling to teach young people right and wrong or to help them benefits from the wisdom that comes from having lived a bunch of life and having amassed a bunch of experiences\nThere is no way under the sun this makes any sense what so ever\nWe may as well not have any border if this is something that people want to advocate for permitting and allowing me as well just to raise the border and said to the world come\nOn in because that's in essence the impact of this if it's not stopped if it's not dealt with\nThe people of the world do not have an entitlement to the United states taxpayers back pocket but the Democrat Party assumes or seems to think that they do\n\nThe Democratic party is calculating that there are more people who want to get in to the American taxpayers back pocket then there are American taxpayers\nAnd saw the Democrat Party is siding with the people around the world who have nothing who thinks it because the United states has a lot they should just be able to come in and get whatever they want\nAlmost as an entitlement we had a political party pushing this we have a political party promoting this this political party ought to be no where near winning any thing\nIn the next elections there is not a single reason to vote for these people under any real breakup commonsense I take a look\nAt the things they advocate take a look at the people they try to destroy take a look at the things they are promoting\nIt defies common sense to support this\nAnd frankly I don't think they have as much support as the media narratives would indicate I don't want somebody to tell you right now I don't believe\nAnd I haven't believe for a long time that there has been a slam dunk blue wave what we're being told right now is that six months ago nine months ago all the way back to December when the first generic ballots were taking a generic polls\nThat the Democrats had a twelve to ... gene point advantage that the American people will realize never mistake electing trumpet of Republicans I couldn't wait\nTo put Democrats back in power now that argue against real life real life since two thousand ten is the Democrats have been losing elections left and right but for some reason\nThe two thousands actually in midterms the American people were all of a sudden going to admit all these mistakes they made and put Democrats back in power I don't\nBelieve it but we got maybe a narrative is that a gigantic blue way of what's going to happen and we had that media narrative\nWorked up about that here on the other side of the glass I'm going to get through it uh in due course same thing on this transgender business the Trump Administration is attempting to eliminate the whole classification\nAnd I'm going to tell you why I agree with that but all of that coming up here's the final Louie Gohmert bite again bill hammer out we're concerned these migrants may be victimized by human smugglers are others who would exploit them were also concerned\nOr is this ... saying this we're concerned about violence promote by some members of this group\nAll of these people trying to force their way and it's called an invasion\nAnd thank God we have a president that will stand up to an invasion of like\nThis but I don't know our constitution that Governor thing call out military troops to stop an invasion and I've heard people on TV so called experts say well you can use the military because a positive comments out of ... that normally prevents a military from being used against its own citizens\nIt has nothing to do with using the military to stop an invasion from another country so there's nothing unconstitutional illegal about the president doing what we do our Wilson did put tens of thousands of people on the border and make sure nobody forces their way and you know\nIt's a no brainer folks get is a number of the president can do that and has committed to it ... ... ... ...\nHe may not send the military and I may call as a as a congressman government says there but there is no law says he can't\nThis is what is one of seven thousand Russians\nWere about to force their way into the okay\nWhat uh seven thousand Russians are about to force their wife or the southern border\nTo try to affect the mid term elections what if we can make that case what do you think the people will be demanding Trump do stand aside after seven thousand Russians in so they can hack our computers and make sure the Republicans win them in terms of it's a joke folks at the junk and never know who's listening\nI'm just asking what if it's seven thousand Russian communists thank God I was trying to get in\n\nAn invasion either way you look at here is Mike in Youngstown, Ohio getting a call in here in the first hour welcome sir how are you\nGood good Russian I Hope you and your family's all of it on good listen I I think this has all the makings of a bad set up for Trump because of the optics are I don't care if you're militarized as the border that if they\nBomb rushed the border like the ... down in the southern side of Mexico where they tried to stop what's our military is supposed to break out the times or water hoses or\nTear gas that's just going to look so bad that Trump is going to take the brunt of it but he needs to do is call a\nA house and the Senate back into the emergency session and do a national address and put everybody on the line not just try to deal with this himself\nSo bring them back in for a special session or their wife passed legislation specifically saying that this mob is seven thousand can't come in\nSomething though that sort\nI mean do you think Trump needs to share the burden of providing the obstacles that if Trump sends a military down and they started cracking heads and it looks bad for Trump exactly so you think that's what the actual intention here is whether people are planned this thing\nExactly and that's where he can't try to deal with this on his own he leads to put everybody else or but on the line and get them on tape on film or whatever what should we do what what do you like to do if they come across\nActually like that in a way I like making Schumer\nAnd Pelosi stand up for letting these people in\nAnyway it's a good point it's a it's it's it's a hell of a dangerous situation but it is in a\nWhole lot\nOf different ways will be back my friends that we will continue as we always\nHave to get

elections interesting but the coming midterms are fascinating for a reason most commentators forget to mention the Democrats have no issues the economy is booming\nAmerica's international position is strong in foreign affairs the U.S has remembered in the Nick of time what Machiavellian biased\nPrince says five centuries ago don't seem to be loved to seek to be feared in contrast with the Obama years it must be painful for any honest leftist\nFor future generations the capital of fight will stand as a marker of the Democratic party's intellectual bankruptcy the flashing red light on the dashboard that says empty\nThe left is beaten\nAnd this is so right on the money they're not have to resort to the shore rains and and and really devastating tricks like this caravan the whole cabinet episode was was intellectually bankrupt it was morally bankrupt it was politically bankrupt and yet they persistent with it\nEven to the point of carrying not that they were destroying an American life and American family in American career ended American future they couldn't have cared less\nThis is the bankruptcy of decency and the Democrat Party has non left\nAs this ... says this has happened before in the eighties in the nineties in the early to thousands but then the financial crisis arrive to save liberalism from certain destruction\nToday leftists pray that Robert Mueller will put on his Superman outfit and save them again for now though the less the only issue is we hate Trump\nThis is an instructive hatred because what the left hates about Donald Trump is precisely what hates about America the implications here are important and they're painful\nThis is instructive hatred because what the left hates about Donald Trump is precisely what it hates about America and hate America does folks\nNot that every leftist hates America but the leftists I Know right to alert or at ...\nThey do hate Trump they hate Trump's vulgarity they have his unwillingness to walk away from a fight they hate his blood as they hate his certainty that America is exceptional they hate his mistrust of intellectuals\nThey hate his love of simple ideas that work they have\nHis refusal to believe that men and women are inter changeable\nAnd worst of all he doesn't have any the olive tree except getting the job done his goals are to do the task before him not be pushed around it otherwise enjoying life in short Donald Trump is a typical American except exaggerated\nBecause he has no constraints to cramp his style except the ones he himself in vans and uses I'll tell you folks this is a heck of a paragraph in his instructive itself they hate Trump's vulgarity and yet they are the kings of vulgarity\nDemocrat Party the American laughter synonymous with vulgarity a day but they sit there and hypocritical he claimed to despise Trump's\nThey hate that he won't walk away from a fight they hate that he is blind they hate he\nIs certainty that America is decent than exceptional they hate certainty that's what I have found over the years that people that have had some serious problems with me I was able to boil it down they hated the fact I was so\nCertain that I didn't have any doubts about what I Believe I've had so many people it's just not right and everybody else that you you just don't\nWait too you know nobody can be that kind of an open I Am I Know your full of it I Know you're wrong and I know you haven't even thought halfway about this or you'd be doing the right thing\nThey can't stand that they love it quid vacation they love people see the both sides of the things they he reaching\nOut with the heart they hate certain movie especially when the conflicts with their own\nNow back to Trump he lacks constraints that the left hates him for because he is filthy rich always has been\nAnd unlike other rich man he rebels and well he doesn't feel any need to apologize for it ever he never learned to keep Israel opinions to himself because he's never had to he never learned to be embarrassed that he's male with ordinary mail proclivities guy like swimming\nDoesn't see the need to apologize for it sometimes he's treated women disgraceful you for which Americans left in writer shamed of him as they are I'm JFK and Bill Clinton but\nThe workers as my job as a voter is choose the candidate who will do best for America I'm Sorry about the ... of ... constrained average American that Mr Trump conveys that question is is unprecedented makes us look band other nations but on the other hand\nMany of Trump's opponents\nWorry too much about what other people think I Would love the steam of France and Germany and Japan but I don't find myself losing sleep over it\n[noise] the difference between citizens who hate Mr Trump and those who can live with him\nThey love are merely tolerating comes down to their views of the typical American the farmer the factory ham the auto mechanic machinist teamster shop owner clerk software engineer infantry men truck driver housewife leftist intellectuals I Know say they dislike us\nSuch people in so far as they tend to be conservative Republicans that's true and that's a large group of people to hate that's a large group of people to dislike\nBut by the way the Senate ... this candidate running for the Senate and Arizona against mark on the salary but she is running around we dredged up sound of her back some years ago claiming that housewives\nOr just leach is the women who are housewives and stay home and a racist lynching off her husband's this is the kind of thing go Lerner is

some damn of violence occurs to them or if I'm a they're able to show that\nTrump and his supporters are so mean spirited and cold hearted that they don't care about the suffering of deny the entry in this kind of thing but but for the media to act like this is a a normal\nNews event like any other normal news event it just happened to we're going to cover it and we're going to report it but there's no political objective attached to this is absurd\nI mean I saw a um I saw a video tape of what's this guy's Jorge ...\nRamos or whatever is it is what does it tell among do ... what what what

states Trump carried in two thousand sixteen even the most direct Kony in the Republican policies like family separation and deporting dreamers persuaded relatively few of those polls to vote Democrat\nOn Monday Trump unleashed an explosion of immigration focused statements warning on Twitter that he made the point the military to the border and\nThreatening to cut off aid to Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador which she has doubled down on by the way so this is a story trying to tell brain dead people read political why Trump is talking nonstop about the care of him because it's

or disengaged from it\nWhen when you get down to brass tacks most people in the media would be supportive of the people is caravan and being allowed the lead in the country because they are everyday anyway whether people show up in a group detour five or ten or in a Bob up seven thousand the left as in favor of letting them in\nAnother worried that this was going to be a boon to Trump right before the midterm elections which it is [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nBut when you stop and think the Democrats are behind this has to be a Democrat donor money behind those and the

Tom Bevan sat in all the polling data that they have a real clear politics and analyzing\nIt's not there is no crafting there is no blue wave if a wave was coming it would be building he says and it isn't but on the other hand the generic ballot is holding meaning the\nDemocrats are not running away with it they still have a ... depending on three to five point lead in the generic ballot but they're not expanding it there's no growth there is no Democrats pulling away as what happened with a blue wave Trump's job approval is rising\nDemocrats are in the advantage ... says but they're not building on anything there's no way and that's gonna wash everything away and leave only Democrats standing\nHe says the house races are really tight they are race by race real battles hand to hand combat is how he described it he forecast that Democrats might win the house that they do have an advantage right now\nBecause they have a range of seven day competitive races and the range of pick up as they look at polling data now\nIs anywhere from Democrats picking up tend to forty one seats\nThey're projecting a democratic pickup of twenty five and a half seats which give them a slight a bed Democrats need to pick up twenty three that's the magic number anything above that Democrats have an advantage in the house\nThe range of the pickup according to the polling data real clear politics

dangerous dreams right we're out there putting these bombs in the mail\nYou know if that really were the case where it is a redneck right wing hillbilly which I'm sure that's how this will be run by the media where do they go about getting a mailing address is I mean George Soros Hillary Clinton Iraq saying oh\nYou know that that information is just not out there for the masses to obtain you know quite being there was never any attempt for these devices to make their way to their intended target whoever put them in the mail\nAnd I don't know if it's right or a to point fingers at certainty but my gut is telling me this is a left wing smokescreen\nWanted for them to be discovered\nThe Democrats they've proven time and time again there's simply no load that they won't do everything for they've tried to do to derail Trump or the hot and muggy video that came out during his presidential campaign to Russia to even gone so far as to try to ruin the wife of judge Kavanaugh nothing has worked\nWhat makes you think that they wouldn't stoop to something that's well it it\nDoesn't along along those lines if you want to look at it that way\n\nIt doesn't make any sense for a Republican or conservative to do this if they really care about winning these elections just makes no sense to do\nThis was going to be\nInstant fodder for the Democrats in the media to blame it on Trump and his supporters and or his uh there's there's ... it doesn't make any sense for a Republican or conservative to do this if they care about the elections none whatsoever but flip that\nFlip that around\nWhat does it make a lot of sense for a democratic operative or a Democrat in cocaine and the lunatic to do it because things are not working out the way\nThey thought do not forget this\nIs why I've spent so much time dwelling on this today and the psychology that's that that's attached to this this is not going the way they have a short us but the last nine months it was going to go more importantly it's not going the way they believed it was going to go they believe they're allies remember they believe their pollsters\nIf the polls are telling there's a big way based on the generic ballot they believe that they get it in their hands and they believe it then they start reporting it and they just compounds itself and it becomes even more intensely believed it becomes gospel\nAnd then it doesn't\nAnd then the things that are supposed to cement it like the Kavanaugh trek backfires and these mobs are backfiring they are not achieving their objectives\nSo if you flipped this around you've got this you've got this this\nThis mob of people flooding the border by intention\nThere's no way that helps the Democrats don't and the Democrats as I said let me grab the let me grab the uh the Swedes here it's really strange ah ladies and gentlemen I'm going to quote the creepy porn star a lawyer but Here's Michael ...\nThere is too much at stake in the mid term shut the Democrats do allow Republicans to use this caravan which is so obviously is set up\nAs a wedge issue it is time for the Democrats the step up and be strong on border security we cannot once again be painted as a week and then lose\nThere's a translation for this in addition to what he's saying here you Democrats have got to stop opposing Trump just do opposed Trump\nSo here's a caravan here's a mob of people\nThat are illegal immigrants that have all kinds of bad actors in them and now we know this to be true and now we've we know from a couple of sources", "show_name": "Thinking Out Loud
