would exploit them were also concerned\nOr is this palm pales saying this we're concerned about violence provoked by some members of this group\nAll of these people trying to force their way and it's called\nAn invasion and thank God we have a president that will stand up to an invasion of like\nThis but under our constitution that Governor thing call out military troops to stop an invasion and

nothing to do with using the military to stopping invasion from another country so there was nothing unconstitutional illegal about the president doing what we do a Wilson did put tens of thousands of people on the border and make sure nobody forces their way and you know\nIt's a no brainer folks get is a number of the president can do that and has committed to it [noise] you dare you you you\nHe may not send the military and I may call as a as a Congress and the government says there but there's no law says he can't\nThis incident what is one of seven thousand Russians\nWere about to force their way into the okay\nWhat uh seven thousand Russians are about to force their way through the southern border\nTo try to affect the mid term elections [laughter]\nWhat if we can make that case

is Mike in Youngstown, Ohio getting a call in here in the first hour welcome sir how are you\nGood good Russian I Hope you and your family's all doing good listen I I think this has all the makings of a bad set up for Trump\nBecause of the optics are I don't care if you're a militarized as the border that if they bomb rushed the border like it down in the southern side of Mexico where they tried to stop 'em what's our military is supposed to break out the times or water hoses or\nTear gas that's just going to look so bad that Trump is going to take the brunt of it but he needs to do is call a\nA house and the Senate back into the emergency session and doing national address and put everybody on the line not just try to deal with this self\nSo bring him back in for a special session or their wife passed legislation specifically saying that this mob is seven thousand can't come in\nSomething though that sort\nI mean do you think Trump needs to share the burden of providing the optical that if Trump since a military down and they started cracking the heads and it looks bad for Trump\nExactly so you think that's what the actual intention here is whether people playing this thing\nExactly and that's where it can't try to deal with this on his own she needs to put everybody else's but on the line get them on tape on film or whatever what should we do what what do you like to do if they come across\nActually like that in a way I like making Schumer and Pelosi stand up for letting these people in any way it's a good point it's a it's it's it's a it's a dangerous situation but it is in
