the same point in their first terms he is currently tied with Obama at forty four percent he's above Clinton at forty one percent Reagan at forty two percent at\nThis time in his presidency\nBut there's a broader point here Democrats in the media keep describing Trump as a hugely divisive figure but the polls show that his approval is starting to line up with previous presidents and what's more ... low numbers are almost entirely because Democrats are universally opposed to one\nAnother for quote at this point in Obama's presidency ten percent of Republicans approved for the job he was doing and that was after the failed pork yeah was\nIt was after the signing of Obamacare in after the signing of Dodd Frank another policy is highly antagonistic to Republicans Trump on the other hand\nGets approval from only five percent of Republicans and that's where it's been throughout his presidency so Republicans in other words were far more forgiving of Obama the Democrats have been a Trump\nSo who actually is being devices\nA GOP or the Democrats who will hate Trump no matter what he does I have to think that the drive visor fully aware of this may not want to admit it that Trump's approval numbers really much stronger than it's being reported and is a much higher here's that story certainly you didn't believe it daily\nObese Democrats fear Obama going soft for the

been confirmed that ... was murdered by the Fifteen hit men from Saudi Arabia has it been confirmed\nOr not confirmed so they'll likely or thought to end the story is that\nIt took him seven minutes to die that they dismembered him alive at some point gave him drugs to knock him out and then they listen to music while they did all of this and of course\nUntil I blew up the theory and at the apple watch contain the evidence they ever going to try to make it look like\nProof existed\nIn the form of audio recordings show ... knew what was in store for him I did when they go is apple watch to record this stuff and ah somehow is I found\nThat very very unlikely because of it being technologically impossible barring a ... just only two exceptions that I Would have a tough time believing shaggy even knew to do or how to do but\nAll of this concern\nAnd remember Hillary Clinton when repeated questions were asked about how in the world for Americans were allowed to be murdered in bend gossipy with no assistance and Hillary Clinton's reaction what difference does it make now [noise]\nShe said in frustration is is anybody see\nA a disparity here in proportion\nOf course we all understand why the Democrats seriously believe they have a way\nBlaming Donald Trump for this\nCNN all afternoon has tried to make it look like the Trump knows the Saudis did it and is trying to provide them cover\nThat's it's despicable the graphics that they are using to try to make that case\n\nBut I think there's a lot of a proportionality missing here and again I don't think the media realizes how obvious\nThere's subterfuge is the people now anyway you know every uh every home has a a front door with a lock on it Dr balls the Fords home had to hold two doors unit that\n\nDr balls the Ford had two doors that something to do with a claustrophobia and fear [noise]\n[noise]\nAnd handed over to Google employees renting this [noise]\n\nWait a minute was a five hundred square foot
