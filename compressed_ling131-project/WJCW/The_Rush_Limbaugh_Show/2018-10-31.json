midterms you have all kinds of people who want to impress you and how smart they are and how analytical they are but it's like anything else in the future nobody knows and that's because there are so many races according to the polling data can break either way\nThere are so many that are so close but then when you say that OK we trust the polling data the polling data versus two thousand sixteen not all that hot and dry nobody knows bottom line\n\nNate Silver or given exam Nate Silver is considered a good where do you know why\nI think it was was it two thousand fourteen two thousand twelve\nWas one of those two elections were Nate Silver lucked into calling every state on the money\nAnd that seat\nWon the election to go in the past whenever it was gave him this reputation that he is intolerable\nSince that won election where he was infallible he hasn't come close doesn't matter because he came closer was dead on the money when Democrats were victorious he's become a guru\nHe's become a shrink he's become a psychiatrist or psychologist Democrats tuned to Nate Silver just stay Santa when the information they're hearing doesn't go the way they want it to go\nHeard Patrick said pets get onto the silver guy nice guy but he's never run a campaign he's never taken a single poll all he does his analyze them\nHe's never participated in a ... either the polling company he's never run a campaign and it's a ... point was you need to temper all these so called experts with some reality to guy hits it on one election that happened to be exactly what the Democrats wanted to hear turned out to be\nTrue and so it becomes a girl wrote and the media continues to cite this is like Nate Silver is out there saying eighty six percent now chances Democrats when the house nobody knows\nSo you can't you can't succumb to the temptation here to go blob play\nAnd become flat line\nAnd it's hard I I look I\nWill admit it's hard as I say the human emotional reservoir can only hold so much\nAnd at some point it's gonna get depleted and maintaining fever pitch energy becomes a challenging thing to do precisely when the news every day is Ninety eight percent slanted Ninety two percent slanted against you in what you believe in and what you want to happen\n\nThe Trump threat to end the or the birthright citizenship\nToday the Dems are still mad about it\nAll kinds of experts being trotted out it's unconstitutional no it certainly constitution no it is and then you've got Republican leaders that we don't want to go down this road is a silly we're all in favor of his many people getting into countries again Democrats saying the same thing but it's out there it's a conversation starter\nNothing is going to happen anytime soon the leftist saying yeah conversation started as all of this drug doesn't really mean it is trying to rile up the base that's where you're wrong Trump does made it\n\nAnd it is about time this was changed we have a crisis really we have a crisis\nGrowing in terms of what kind of country we're going to be what kind of culture is going to dominate in this country and we are under assault by people who don't like the United states of

how will you stop texting and driving tell us and stopped ... brought you by the national Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the ad council [noise]\n[noise]\nOkay listen to it again this is Monday Night on CNN taken a couple of days for this to reach the mainstream [noise]\n[laughter] ... lemon says it on Monday Night on CNN\nAnd its noticed today and again he's talking the freight Cuomo\nAbout all the recent shootings in mailed pipe bombs and ... says there was another hate filled criminal just last week in Kentucky and other white man in custody for shooting and killing two African Americans in a grocery store we barely had time to cover\nWe have to stop demonizing people and realize the biggest terror threat in this country is white men most of them radicalized to the right and we have to start doing something about them there is no travel ban on them you know they have a Muslim ban there is no white guy ban\nNow Don Lemon ah what what is your reaction to this I mean this punks I'm telling you this is not a one off this is I\nMean the specifics of a white guy ban and that that may be something that he individually holes with the idea that the opposition\nAs far as the leftist concerned is white men predominantly white Christian man that's that's not on the money that's right exactly where they are aimed in the perverted view the American left it as white men who created this racist and bigoted\nUnfair unjust immoral country do not consider me to be exaggerating here\nThat is what we are up against and this all of this from the from the uh Lenski days all the way up through the Obama administration and a real objective has been\nTo transform America away from the traditions in institutions of the founding based on the fact that it's all racist and it's all bigoted and it's all unjust an unfair they continue to point to slavery as the primary and\nEvidence the primary example are exhibit\nOf their claim that America is unjust or unfair of course pay no attention to the steps America took to end racism that gets no credit gets no mention whatsoever as far as they're concerned racism and slavery still exist in prisons on the caravan immigration policy you name it\nAnd so this is what's animated and this is certainly one has energized and field of women all over this country with rage leftist women it's being utilized\nTo ah to great effect but that's the single organizing purpose is racial or I was gonna say racist but it's racial in uh in its origins now it covers much more ground than that in terms of its objective but that's their target that's what they're using and had been for a while to energize\nEverybody who is not a white man they're using victim allergy and victimhood to a tea\nThey are making people think that they have no chance in America as long as white men continue to run it and be a white men or continue to be the majority\nAnd they just continually enraged people they ratchet up the anger there has to be an outlet for it I think they are if you if you want to start attaching if you want to start attaching needy\nResponsibility to the actions of people you notice how quickly they want to do that notice how quickly on the left at people who commit crimes are not really responsible for them they're always\nThe result of environmental things\nAnd so it's a left telling us that these guys are being motivated by Trump they either love Trump or they hate Trump but whatever Trump is making them do these things\nI think it's day if you're going to if we're going to go down that road never going to start attaching blame the people who don't really have any responsibility for making the bombs or pulling the trigger on the guns who is it the raging them like I say you cannot turn on the news today and find a single thing positive about anything\nYou can you you cannot find any reinforcement anywhere in public media for the goodness in decency of America it's quite the exact opposite\nAnd since these people are the vast majority immediate you know they exempt themselves from having any role in all of\nThis while they are eager to try to find anybody else in media who might be to blame for this\n\nDon Lemon said let's say a Monday Night also that he doesn't see Democrats killing people over politics\n\nYou mean Don like the followers of black lives matter are the Republicans in that group looking number of police officers have been murdered Mr lemon by black lives matter supporters and look at how many of those cops murders have been defended\nAnd explained away by people like you in the sense\nWell they're cops and they missed reading their racist they deserve it\nBut don't try to tell me the Democrats are killing people yeah how about the guy that shut up the Republican baseball practice I think he was intending to wound to people Steve ... is almost did die it's amazing these people the way they talk in the things they conveniently forget\nOr don't even register maybe in the first place\nFive cops in Dallas two thousand sixteen\nOr the Muslims in this country who have committed murder or are they Republicans nope many of them are very loyal Democrats voting bloc\nMuslim Americans in fact maybe and even more reliable Democrat vote than black voters\n\nAccording to Forbes magazine of the three thousand three hundred and forty two people killed by terrorists in the U.S between Nineteen Ninety two in two thousand Seventeen Islamic terrorists are responsible for Ninety two percent of those murders and yeah Don Lemon on CNN says the problem\nTwo days ago and I recall the last plane went down in Malaysia and then was all over for about a month and a half a non stop the and we haven't seen anything about this this brand new plane that went on\nYeah where do they go down\nIn leaders Taiwan there but a hundred and eighty nine people died it was a brand new I Believe is following I'm\nNot exactly sure well there's no way to link it to prompt a good point\nThere is no way to link it to the mid term elections there is no way to use that crash to gin up anti Republican anti Trump no I'm not joking day how I'm not sure I'm not joking and all they don't care about it because it has no impact it has no usage they can see in\nAffecting the outcome they want in the mid term elections don't worry they'll get to it when the other side of the time to attack a\nCorporation like bowling or whoever made the plane they'll get to it after they've done what they can do on the midterms\nMuch appreciate it you do you do you do you do doubt me on this\nPersonally no but uh just uh remember CNN go when wall to wall on that last plane that went down\nWell of course because that's CNN CNN neighbors there were there was there was sucking hot or they were in last place out there and uh this was that was pre Trump and the\nBelief in media is the airline airplane crashes airliner crashed as a lot of passengers is white glow eyeballs are glued to TV so they believe and then they had a mystery where is the damn thing\nWhere is it Don Lemon even asked a former director of National Transportation Safety Board caught it had been swallowed by a black hole\nRemember that you remember that\n... certainly remember that not going to produce\n... ... what did they they had a mystery on their hands and and they you're right they went wall to wall with it and it became\nA standing joke you know that the the best way to make anything or do any success is to lose it and and have CNN try to find it for you\nI just haven't seen it on any media outlet whether it's Yahoo Google CNN NBC none of the nightly news show one picture from what\nYou want to wait a minute how do you know about it then\nWell I saw on the headline\nNews may do you wear Monday morning in boarding the headline news\nHeadline news they just announced they're getting out of the news headline news just announced they're going to go eighty percent uh uh uh advertising or something like what do you ever uh forget what you call it programming but\nNo I just found that the kill your that that was not one little usually anytime the plane goes on killing that many people especially it was a brand new planning that\nI don't know whether you such a brand new playing what kind of play it was he says about what will you remember the model number\nNo but since it's brand new it's got to be the one of the um you know somewhat but uh and that's what made me think even more that we would see news is still a brand new plan going down is unusual and ah we went out to the

program\nSo over Thirty years in one white thank you very much a Ella for the call I really I'm I'm Glad you got through to remind us about Alice Alice I not only by the way we are they checking people's health\nThey were determining whether or not people actually wanted to be Americans it was a restrictive process\nWe were much newer and younger country then and we had an entirely different attitude about immigration and growth and it was required that immigrants assimilate and it was required that they be healthy we we're not going to open the borders to illness\nWe we're not going to

polls he tweets so called birthright citizenship which costs our country billions of dollars and it's very unfair to our citizens will be ended one way or the other it is not covered by the fourteenth amendment because of the words\nThan the prince of darkness in himself Robert Novak back in Nineteen Ninety four predicted I think to within two seats the Republican takeover of a house in those elections I think we one fifty four seats are forty some Adam he predicted was off by two\nBut nobody predicted the Republicans are going to pick up sixty three seats in two thousand ten\nI mean the media didn't want to think anything was even possible because there's so much love and devotion respect for Obama and then when that happened you should've seen if you remember the bottom fell out the wind is just totally came out of their sales\nIn two thousand two everybody thought\nEverybody that Democrats were going to walk away with the house of representatives 'cause everybody hated Bush Bush was not duly elected Bush stole the election in the Florida recount with the help of a twisted Supreme Court\nDemocrats did the Wellstone memorial and that was going to galvanize Democrats all over the country to show up and vote and there was no way\nAnd what happened Republicans gained ... seats\nThe left was done to the drive by media couldn't believe it so they're examples even when people are damn certain what's gonna happen they end up being surprised the brightest minds the greatest go rose the most heralded analysts\n\nAnd it's all about presenting an image of making it look like you know what you're talking about more than anybody else does\nI have here is from a ... a real clear politics by one of the written down the\nWhole analysts and data and all is there is Sean ... day and I got to read the whole thing in print out the four pages bought the headline here on certain days in the womb as mitten terms and her final\nStretch and I'm going to tell you what this long piece says I can do this long piece in three words we know nothing\nOn certain days alone as many germs that her final stretch\nThe twenty eight ten midterms are working their way toward a conclusion in a week we should find Leno who will control the house although at the outcomes close it could take weeks to finish counting ballots in California\nThe consensus view is that the Democrats are favored to take the house of representatives analyst disagree on just how large the majority they're going to win is\nAnd how likely that majority is if you are split the real clear politics toss ups in half\nThat's much polls it results in Democrats gaining about twenty five seats\nFor a narrow two hundred and twenty to two hundred and fifty majority\nI tens of things as Mr trend day that the toss ups will break disproportionally toward Democrats and see something more on the order of a two twenty five to two hundred and ten Democrat majority\nBut this is here splitting to a certain degree okay so here he says in the second paragraph it's all over and it's a Democrat's two hundred and twenty five seats the Republicans with two hundred and ten\nNext paragraph at the same time\nThis isn't the only way to read that thing the Democrats pick ups could be larger but they could also be smaller here are some things that\nShouldn't bother any sober minded elections analyst in the final week of the electorate why we just concluded here and as the Democrats are gonna end up with two hundred and twenty five seats the Republicans two hundred and ten so why do we analyze any bird because the truth is we don't know those are my words on this trend days [noise]\nHis words resume here will there be a late break\nAs we learned in two thousand sixteen and in a less dramatic fashion in two thousand fourteen a late breaking the races can alter the landscape substantially this year there are a lot of undecided voters remaining\nLook at the most recent house polling from the New York times Sienna in some races and get the job or a ship numbers\nThis adds up to a situation where a slight break in the undecideds toward one party or the other could be the difference between a healthy Democratic majority in a slim Republican but wait he's already predicted to twenty five to ... I'm not harping on Mr trend day here\nIs we don't know he's given you here's Beth gas but now he's giving you every reason in the world is ... ... do you can think of where it might not turn out that way\nGiven the closeness of many races and the president's improving overall job approval it is also unclear\nHow about your weight all of this in the current cycle well then how did you get to two twenty five to ten if it's really unclear how to evaluate all this [laughter] but\nThat's just me you know being smart alec\nUh in New York's twenty second congressional district Sienna college places the president's job approval at fifty three percent so Republican representative Claudia Tenney as possibly in better shape than her polling numbers suggest\nBut what about the Nineteen representative John Faso is up by appointment the president's job approval is at a forty six forty nine split that suggested very close race and there are likely a lot so Trump's on the ballot or he isn't\nIsn't going to matter what Trump's approval number is in somebody's house races or is it not\nAnybody who thinks Trump's not on the ballot here needs to reexamine things\nAnd then the next burgers how many votes are Democrats wasting one of the biggest news stories this cycle has been the massive influx of money\nIn to Democrats campaigns this initially showed up and marquee races like Beto O'Rourke challenging Ted Cruz but it has since filtered down into more marginal races like Indiana's nines\nOr California's first or a outer Mongolia of seven\nAnd all of this is relevant because Democrats right now have a roughly seven and a half point lead in the generic ballot\nWhich asks which party would you prefer to have control of Congress now normally this will be enough to flip the majority but if Democrats run up the score in districts that are unlikely to win suddenly that seven point margin translates into a closer than expected seat but then there's another consideration and that's how correlated army errors\nMeaning how about one apple aren't them as they are and then the next ...\nAre we're relying too much on one poster oh that's a pretty straightforward concern\nAnd then the next ... what is it early voting telling us well the pet response is nothing but that's too simple early voting returns usually tell us something but unfortunately they can only be deciphered in retrospect meaning we don't know the early voting is still it's over\nWe're not counting votes yet so all we know is party turnout but we don't know how these people that voted nobody does the only way you can determine early voting is after the election is over\nBut yet we're still going to talk about it\nSo the final paragraph what else is lurking out there and this is probably the biggest concern and the what else is lurking what yet\nTo happen that hasn't happened that could swing a bunch of boats [noise] which renders every poll prior to this day largely irrelevant which is why I continue to\nRail against polls about congressional midterm races in November the year before or in August of the summer before because the stuff that's going to determine the way people vote hadn't even happens what going to the polls but here at the end of this four page story\nWhat else is working out very well that's probably the biggest concern we've we've gotten good polling on the candidate go\nCompetitive districts but take argument to and then realized that in some of these districts Republicans might be caught napping we've seen some examples of this such as the open seat in Florida Fifteen or the incumbent Rob all in Georgia seventh or\nWe don't however no how big a problem this is right now or even if it is a problem\nI suspect we'll have a surprise or two on election night but what if there are tens of surprises regardless of whether that happens we are well set up for such an adventure out on the bottom line I happen to live with that idea what's going to happen with my job is to tell you how it all looks to me\nAnd this guy is one of the best and I do not anybody misunderstand what I'm doing here this guy is one of the best recognize is one of the best one

thing I have to deal with is that if people see it written it could be getting a rag tabloid it can be in an obscure website it could be the New York ... if they see it written they automatically think it's true it's just it's it's I don't know if it's it's a\nLifetime generational conditioning out of a psychological but if you see it it's true if you see it on TV you tend to believe that if there's a picture a company in the words and you really believe it\nHoping fair foul why don't they don't they are only part\nUh find out how many people now wait a second now wait a second now how many people\nWhat is your average you have time to do that every day do you have time you hear something on your immediately skeptical view that run down everything you hear and confirm it yourself\nI can appreciate that now nobody has that kind of right nobody has that kind of time\nMost people's lives are are chaos the chaos and some days crisis to crisis\nAnd many many days people don't even care what's on the news they have things going on in their lives at take much more important and to them have much more relevant so they're a lot of people are casual observers and they\nBelieve pretty much everything they see or hear [noise] but I'm telling you it's a good question it's just it's it to me it has been frustrating and no end as a practitioner of the spoken word how people believe if they read it no matter where it's published if it's on paper it's on a computer screen they believe it\nI Would say it in my op ed on college how why did I\nWish you who would say it more often and call it for what it is\n[noise] any anyone hill any reporting and ended up like a half hour to that ladder and if they don't call their call it what is it fair to call it\nThat will look
