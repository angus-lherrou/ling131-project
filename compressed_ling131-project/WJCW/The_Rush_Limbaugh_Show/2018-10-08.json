do you think that kind of behavior which was widely\nPublicized and Democrats loved it the media loved it they tried to make heros out of these people they didn't try to hold them back\nWhere they want to disrupt the Senate vote they disrupted the Senate vote when they wanted to get in the halls of the Senate Russell office building they did so they got an elevators they shouted these people now the Democrats have not once called out that activity they've never once told that's either side to stand down do you think\nThe American public watching that\nIs going to be turned off by it and want to vote against it or do you think the American public\nDoesn't care one way or the other and doesn't even really notice it\nI think it's largely going to be turned off but like you said they've they've completely changed their base now they've given up on the working\nBlue collar class and they're now they're now trying their hand and see if they can somehow um increase the numbers with women on these type of issues but I think largely to the American people are going to be turned off and\nI I think it's all going to come down to a who who is able to get out and get out the vote in a month but that had\nWell my point like twenty twenty let me okay this is my I don't think given what we've seen the last two weeks among people in the public who watched it I don't think the Republicans need to do when he got out the vote this was that\nIn my scene and just world the Democrats just exceeded and getting Republican turnout larger than it's ever been for a mid term I Know I'm probably wrong about that but that's how I look at it that's how it ought to be and I'm the king of books title the way things ought to be an automated people were outraged by this\nIt ought to be that people can't wait to go punish this month just common for the way they have treated in this country the past two weeks alone the Republicans ought not have to spend the time getting out the vote based on this but I Know that's not the reality kind of frustrating to me but that's the case\nDemocrats thinking they're going to have turned out here that works anything the Republicans have to show up on election Democrats think the whole country is because if they really\nDon't they know they don't have enough Americans to win legislative battles but they think that they're going to be able to put together enough people to dwarf whatever Republican turnout\nThere is and they've got new stories predicting that very thing so people are going to be reading it people can be reading Republicans don't have a chance\n\nYou may replied\nNo I I agree and um I think they energy I think they energize the base and they did exactly what needed to be done and I think they have the issue that you were speaking of a month or so ago\nThat the that hadn't happened and with twenty nine days but it it happened a\nTrue yeah I when I when I said the events that were going to shape the midterms hadn't
