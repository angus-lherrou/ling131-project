bringing them into the proximity of God let me ask you this question\nBecause again in John jump in here with three girls have your own uh for me Jean and I will often have this discussion about raising boys and you know instilling in them a spiritual lesson in a moment usually means you're actively doing something with them you're on a hike you're driving\nSomewhere and you just start

of four girls\nUm how do you express the heavenly father loved to them\nTo help them identify with their life in Christ so often we hear about absent fathers or know fathers at all and the detrimental impact that has on girls particularly I think both boys and girls obviously but girls seem to struggle with a healthy identity then and we so often here\nWhen they grow up to be teens they will look for love and all the wrong places looking for that father affection\nDescribe how that can really\nCommunicate a heavenly father image to his girls yeah well first I Would say this really what what I Try to\nPractice is just presidents I think president is more important than anything else literally being there being there in the moments when they're happy being there in the moments when they're sad being there just as many moments as you can be there you'd be there and what I said be there it's not just be there like you're in the room but it's intentionally\nLetting them know that you hear them that you see them that you value them and it's that's difficult for all of us to talk about I think in the book a little bit on this reality like for me I Love listening to radio talk radio conservative talk radio liberal talker I just love listening and just hearing people's perspectives and\nSo it's easy for me to put my ear buds in his own cleaning the house from moving around and just literally to ignore everything that's going on around me and I had to make an intentional or effort to take the bugs out and just be there in my home you know what I'm doing dishes or when I'm sleeping a floor just\nThey're just being around so I can hear what's going on their lives and aside from presents and just being intentional I think it's tailor made a depending on because all of our girls are different having four daughters I Know that every girl is different 'cause my four are absolutely different from each other every one of them\nAnd they all received of different ways so just being aware enough about what sparked them what makes them tick\nUm you know from my oldest daughter she really doesn't need a lot of conversation she likes to be in the room she likes to sit in my lap she likes to you know it's really just being there for my second daughter it's a lot of interaction she's very talkative she went to tell me about her next gymnastics moves and she'll be the gymnastics move them at me help run an extra ... so\nThere's just this reality that there are different so like if you have more than one daughter it's really you know telling making what you're doing with each of them based on their personalities and based on what you learned because you are there\nAnd you are aware of what's going on again the point being that critical love connection so they see a father's love and they can understand it and we hear so many of the negative stories where it didn't happen and it causes a young girl to go off the rails you know and that's a good thing for dads to be responsible for\nAn eye on it and I'm not done it perfect by any stretch and one of the things I really love is having not been a perfect dead for fourteen years uh just recently just this week I was looking at um article that somebody did on my twins at their school and they said who is your hero and they said my dad something like All right I'm not doing it perfectly but I'm Still they're heroes\nThat is\nNow once you're on the mom's side you were a little girl so you can share the struggles with them how do you approach in cultivating kind of a spiritual attitude with your daughter's as the mom\nYou know it's interesting because even just going back a little bit to what a giants and was just saying about\nGrowing up as a little girl without a dad that was my story I grew up as a little girl without a dad in the home and so even as on\nMothering my girls I'm seeing guys do child like I owe all over again and so that has been on a neat experience and so when it causes me\nIt's just it's the same thing just being president\nI'm a little more understanding what the emotions and some things because I remember being fourteen number just you know being ten and eleven and and all those things but really being president listening to them knowing it that like letting them know that they're hurt\nBut then also just even in the emotion bringing them back to truth so letting them know that their feelings and emotions whatever's going on like\nWe can be there and I can understand but let's go back to what God has to say about what we're dealing with in what we're doing and so just not presidents and being there and pointing back to ...\nWhich is so good spending time with your kids yeah [noise]\n... let me move to the idea of obedience um I think you know again being a parent a boy's this can be an area that's tough you know this is what we said to do you didn't do it except for how how is that obedience with girls sometimes challenged what does that look like\nTrying to get girls in line because my impression again is that it's much easier 'cause girls listened far better how sure\nAre [laughter] oh why is one of the girls tell me how\nI'm wrong or I'm right yeah I Would you say it's easier at all you know I you know\nDuring congestion the fraction of customers even greater than thirty bucks for a month later this reduced immature customers may

family members in easy natural way\nThanks for listening today to the broadcast I'm John fuller and your host is focused president and author gym daily John ... is well known as the former atheist who wrote the book the case for Christ I've read that I've\nGiven so many of them a classic um where it was also the title of a film about his life that came out just last year and in today's message ... going to share some ideas\nOn how to open up a conversation about face with people in our sphere of influence and this is so helpful or let me tell you it's easier than you think you can do it and\nWith more here's ... speaking to focus on the families that\nAre going to pick up right after his opening remarks\nWe moved to Texas to be near our two oldest grandchildren that live right around the corner we're helping to home school them\nAnd uh and they become total Texas I'm telling you might oh yeah oh I'm telling you my twelve year old granddaughter Abigail she's got the cowboy hat she's got the cowboy boots she's taken horseback riding lessons but the reason we know she's a total sex and\nThe other night at dinner she said can I pray for dinner we said sure so this is what you pray God is good God is great thank you for the Lone Star state [laughter]\nThat's a true Texan that that that is a true Texan well you know when I moved to Texas being from Chicago um I thought how am I going to connect with this Texas culture they have a book on how to talk ... so I bought it and I read it and I learned how to talk Texan\nBut here's the thing I learned that I like the most if you're in Texas and you want to say thank you to someone you could say thank you or you can say\nAppreciate you isn't that nice not I appreciate it appreciates you and that's what I Want to say to you appreciate you appreciate all y'all [laughter]\nThank you for your service thank you for the mission that you're fulfilling with great zeal and enthusiasm and a strategic planning and so uh we're in a crisis says you know in this nation their families\nAnd you're on the front lines so I thought well what can I talk about today and and uh a passage came to mind\nA cause I thought you can't go wrong quoting cheeses right [laughter] so I I was thinking of the sermon on them out\nAnd I was thinking when when Jesus got up two thousand years ago and he's speaking to a crowd on a hillside but really I Believe by extension he was looking down through history and he was looking at you\nToday and this is what he said you are the salt of the year you were the light of the world\nA city on a hill cannot be hidden neither do people lighting a lamp and put it under a ball instead they put it on a standard it gives like to everyone in the house in the same way let your light shining among others that they may see your good deeds and praised your father in heaven\nWhat did Jesus means by those metaphors assault why I think he meant you know if you're gonna be a follower of mine I I I Want you to live life who like salt that doesn't make people thirst for God\nI Want you to live like like the shy my message of hope and grace in love and redemption any turn the lights that shine that message into dark areas of despair and the question I Want to address in these next few minutes is what does that look light in the twenty first century\nSo it's I'm thinking this or I thought well what if Jesus physically lived in my house board I learn from the master in terms of how he would relate to people he would encounter along the way of life the neighbors and so\nAnd so as I studied this life there's so many things I learned and and uh you know we could talk about serving other people you talk about authenticity is a lot of things I was going to hit on two of them today the first one is this I Believe that if Jesus physically lived in my house\nBut before he talked to his neighbor about their heavenly father he would talk to his heavenly father about his neighbor\nYou would pray\nRight of course he was before Jesus embark on anything of significance he brought it to the father in prayer\nBack to ever thought about the fact that Jesus prayers for spiritually lost people continued right up until his final gas some across then when you read the New Testament the original Greek which has written one of the things you notice is that the imperfect tends to the Greek suggests\nThat Jesus did not just say at once but he kept repeating it all through the torture the crucifixion while their nails are being driven through his wrists while the nails are being driven through his feet he kept praying he kept repeating father forgive them bother forgive them father forgive them for they know what they do\n\nJesus prayers for people so spiritually depraved they were torturing the death the son of God they continued until a spinal gas Sunday across in his British faster John ... said in light of that\nHow can we justify not praying consistently and fervently and expect ... for spiritually lost people in our lives\nNow I Know theological you that you know we can't buy our prayers for somewhat against their will to bend the needed Jesus I get that but I also believe Jane's when he says the prayers of righteous people make a difference\nBecause I Believe they do I've seen it I've seen it\nRemember when I was a pastor a church outside Chicago we were doing a baptism service\nAnd by God's Grace we're baptized ... seven hundred new believers that day and we told people as they came up to be baptized if you want to bring a friend or someone to legislate lord or spouse feel free to do that which playing the gospel and what baptism is all about and then people started to come up to be baptized so this woman comes\nMe to be baptized and she was about sixty five years old um and there was a man with her and he was a tough looking bird you know what I mean just a tough wiring kinda\nStraight away she's here and I say you're here to be baptized she said yes I Am I so that's great if you receive Jesus as your lord and savior she said with all my heart\nSuch great and then it's got to baptize er and I are you shouldn't do this by felt a prompt things in the Holy Spirit I turned to the man and I said I'm excuse me or you were husband he said well yes I Am I said have you given your life DeJesus\nAny clear to me and his face kinda screwed up I I thought it was going to hit me or something and then he burst into tears\nFront of thousands of people have we been shopping all I could say was no I haven't but I Want to right now during the time out and we do this okay great so this guy in front of thousands of people repent service in receives Christ forgiveness and baptized him and his wife together\nSo after the service I'm walking down off the platform this other woman I didn't know comes running up to me she rolls around through obviously sweeping and sobbing well she can say it's eight years eight years and\nI said who are you what do you mean eight years so that's my brother who uses led to the lord and baptized\nI have been praying for that man for nine or eight long years\nAnd that whole time I'm not seeing one glimmer of interest in God\nLook what God did today\nAnd you're my first thought was there was a woman who was glad she didn't stop praying in year\nSeven who've we stopped praying for whoever you stop praying for\nWho is who you love you maybe you went to school with or an old neighbor or family member whoever and you used to lift him up the guy but over time it's almost as if we make the decision for them it's almost like we decide ad is never going to happen\nAnd we kind of style and I think that women would say don't give up\nKeep praying keep the lifting of all\nI was an atheist for much of my life\nAnd I I was a hard headed hired her to legal editor of the Chicago Tribune and when my wife became a Christian she met some women at church and she said I don't have any hope for my husband is a hard headed hard hearted illegal letter to trim he's never going to bend is needed Jesus\nAnd this one elderly saying put her arm around her shoulder kind of pulled her to the side said oh Leslie\nNo one is beyond hope\nAnd she gave reverse in the Old Testament is equal thirty six twenty six but says moreover I Will give you a new heart and I will put a new spirit within you I Will remove from you your heart of stone and give you a hard a flash\nAnd just say friends we have an unfair advantage in the marketplace of ideas we have truth on our side\nPet is a huge advantage to what am I saying we ought to all go out debating people no no I think God as gifted very few people who have the right academic credentials and experience to do debates that's great but I'm not a debate or you're probably not a debater I think for us the key word is not debate it's dialogue\nIt's conversations\nIt's friendships it sitting down with someone who who was skeptical about the fate and giving them the space\nTo ask questions to express doubts where we'd validate them as someone made in the image of God who is valuable to God where we respect the fact or on a journey not as far along as we are that's okay\nWe do more listening the talking\nAnd we help them get resolution of whatever sticking point is holding them up friends I think a ... I'm In the twenty first century is spelled apologetic se\nSo many people have the sticking points but we can help them we can help them get past those so they can make progress in their journey toward Christ\nAnd friends we got to create in our homes or in our Christian schools in our churches safe places especially for young people where it's OK to ask any questions okay to express any doubt because if we don't give him that freedom the doubts begin to well up inside and they will road there so\nIf we get into a discussion we can help them get past whatever sticking point is holding them up you know this is the unexpected adventure of the Christian life\nYou never know how God might use you to be a link in the chain spiritual chain leading someone to faith in Christ\nAnd I'll just end with my favorite story about an unexpected venture to happen to me and I was a pretty new Christian I was I'm Still at the newspaper in Chicago and uh it was the end of a long\nDay packing my stuff up and um I felt\nMoved by the Holy Spirit and a very specific way I just felt compelled\nThen I needed to go into the business office of the newspaper and invite my atheist friend\nTo Easter services at our church 'cause Easter was coming up I just felt very specifically the guy was leading me to do this and I'm thinking this is great because of God is really leading me to do this something wonderful is going to happen he's probably going to repent right there right now this is going to be satisfied confidence\nRight so I walked over to the business office I looked in all I see is my friend behind his desk said thank the lord\nSo I went up to him and said hey how you doing I'm doing good\nI said hey you know Easter is coming up it's a struggle you know I'm an atheist I said yeah yeah yeah I Know but Easter is when we remember the resurrection of Jesus he said he wasn't resurrected I so I actually you know there is good historical evidence that he was\nGoing to give them some of this evidence that the I think is compelling the shows that Jesus not only claimed to be the son of God he backed it up by returning from the dead I start and and I taught for a few minutes on that but\nIt didn't look like it was helping\nSaddam scramble I'm trying to think of another approach so I said oh wait a minute I said we are writing music at our church why don't you and your wife joined Leslie me\nCome to our church at Easter you love the music you looked at me he said I don't want to go to your stupid church hey okay\nHey listen no problem ... I'll I'll talk to you later you know if you ever questioned you know where my officers I'll see ya I walked out and what was that all about why did I feel so specifically compelled to go into the business office to get into a spiritual conversation to invite him to services the urge to give the evidence for the resurrection\nAnd it just shut me down and I'm telling you this bothered me for years 'cause to this day he's still an atheist let me tell you the rest of the story\nYears after that by then it was a pastor at a church outside Chicago and a guy comes up to me ... after a service and he says can I shake your hand and thank you for the spiritual influence you've had in my life\nI said what's really nice but who are you somebody tell you my story a few years ago I lost my job\nI didn't have any money in the bank I thought it was my car I thought was my house I was in a panic I needed a paycheck for a while to get by so we called a friend of mine that ran a newspaper I said you have any odd jobs I can do to earn a buck for a while and the guy said well can you tile floors\nI said yeah I can title force Tyler bathroom I think I can do that because we need some title installed and replaced at the newspaper if you can do that we can pay for a while so I said great he said so I went to work at the newspaper\nHe said one day not long before Easter I was in the business office of the newspaper and I was on my hands and knees working as a title on the floor behind a big desk\nAnd you walked in I don't know if if you knew I was there and you start talking this guy about God and you start by him to your church you start getting the evidence for the resurrection and this guy was shutting you down\nBut I'm On my hands and knees I'm listening to all this stuff and my heart beating fast\nI'm thinking I Need God I Need to go to church source as soon as you left I call my wife I said we're going to church is Easter she said what I said yeah he said we came to your church that Easter I came to faith my wife came to faith in our teenage son came to face and I just wanted to thank you and I think [noise]\n[noise]\nThis is a new form of of angel some rich

Wimbledon train failure when people want to walk in and he bought it over today he wins it Kansas Speedway now back to ... to\nNot as sweet Virginia breeze and the call from chase Eliot victory last weekend in Kansas and what are you going to have the ... he had in last round starting today for the renovate he's got a lot of work too because he qualified as Chevrolet in the twenty first ... first position now\nOf course in the back so that starts in the nineteenth now but still when I talked to him after qualifying he was very concerned that they were getting lap early\nBy car as being that they have such an a far starting position\nOn easy to do here at a short drug you caught up with them or earlier in the weekend and one of the interesting things I think about chased lately is how he has changed a little bit in terms of his confidence level since he got that first victory\nThis time we've been wondering what had happened it's going to happen tonight Watkins Glen is not a nice start selling it is going to rely on that\nVery wins this season but to the last three races you end up in ... another thing you know you win wine once you get your first one another easily but from your perspective is that how it felt\nNo I think that's a myth personally I don't I mean you know to me the only difference is we've been in better physicians I think the last couple of months versus what we were at the beginning of the year or whatever so I think that's been the biggest difference is just having been in better position closing a race which all that kind of gotten just comes out to be a little faster and envy\nAnd erases out of the top five if you're doing that\nAnd then different strategies and things can be relevant to you otherwise you're on different game plans and and what not for the back of the deal doesn't really matter so I think that's the biggest differences is running better\nYeah Martin trucks junior will start thirty third today so a racist like to pass race cars you have that opportunity today how confident are you in the set up for the race card to get this thing going today though we were pretty\nGood yesterday I mean it's a you know this is definitely not our best track but I feel like we've been getting better here in in order to take the race good so hopefully uh hopefully will hit it right we've got a lot of cars fast like you said but should be fun and uh you know five hundred last as long time to get it down so hopefully we'll have a good part of you know good enough to get up there in a battle for the\nMarch tricks junior starts today and position number thirty three after failing inspection earlier this morning before the race\nYou know a long way to go and certainly a short time to get their promoting trucks junior and can you mentioned chase Eli being concerned about getting laughed early that's going to be job one for a lot of these guys who have to move toward the back of the field\nAbsolutely 'cause you think about it and the leaders are basically on the tail of the field within a lap or two\nSo that all of those drivers that are at the back of the field the ones we mentioned Martin checked senior Jimmy Johnson Tom and our David Reagan bubble Wallace those that had to start from the back because of different issues they're going to be looking out for drivers in the lead coming up and then just a few lasting\nObjects and your mirror closer than they appear\nAbsolutely that's had back on the ground in the ... the FDA has caught up with\nWell we're talking about well ... what a guy that's awfully good you're Martinsville, Virginia and I'm really doesn't have all that drama going around the house was brought up as long as he qualified in the southern part was the ... most of the sport how good is your race car is pretty good um [noise]\nA team was really going to wherever they go to fourteenth really good I think yeah\nI think we can get some transition keep her car one piece will be racing for the win at the end\nI Know the goal is to be in the playoffs not being you know how does that all through the way you can approach this race and and and doesn't allow you to be a little bit more aggressive on things\nYes and now I mean you know you're given dang factor kind of goes down which is good 'cause you don't not worried about here in the garbage is worried about when\nWell there we go see what happens is going to be fun to watch the last ... going to rule from the southern spot once the deli\nOr let's catch up ... he's got a wind just a couple of weeks ago said to roll off it just ... points outside the cut off spot a this track is kind of been hit or miss for you've had some really good runs more of late or how good is this race car and how you feel about your chances today\nI got about it I think our cars pretty good and and then you know five hundred laughs and Martin is a long time to attract changes a lot\nUm and you just have to keep up with so I feel like we've got a good starting spot if you're like are you know ... decent um and then we just got to go to work we've got to execute on that road I've got to do my part\nUm and then we just got to keep up with a track as the robbers up and changes so just are looking for today it's a great a great place for us and and and opportunity\nFrom a driver feels standpoint you're talking about this race track changing how does it feel from the driver standpoint\nWell it's just it's tough it's a really challenging racetrack um you know where there's forty cars on this little tight half mile race track that were beaten in banging and fighting for every inch and um you know you\nI Know down forces not really important here but you still want to keep your fingers on the car you don't want to get any damage you don't want to have to come back to that road for an unscheduled pets out for any reason and lose track physician so uh yeah you just it's it's about being smart and um you know aggressive but you've got to be patiently aggressive if there is such a thing\nAnd we should see some of that and hopefully a patient is going to be one of the keys to the right I'm sure we will hear that from rusty Wallace back to Alex\nWith a driver who will start today in position number twelve talk to him yesterday right after he got a qualifying That's Kevin Harvey we are talking about and\nWhen the when we talk yesterday after qualify you were happy that at the time you were Thirteen why are some technical problems with some of the other teams you starts well today it's about the race do today the balance of your Ford how pleased to argue with after practice yesterday\nThat was good yesterday so hopefully it stays that way today this this race in particular always seems to have a big violence which at the end of the race as it starts to get dark\nOut attracted river up so\nThey have to try to keep up with a racetrack and and be brave enough to make the right adjustments to the car when it's not doing anything wrong\nWhen it's sunny like it is today is first time we've seen this on all weekend well that change things much as far as putting rubber down on the track\nWell even with no sign yesterday you know I thought the trucks but a fair amount of rubber down compared to what I'm used to seeing so I I Would say that I Will definitely\nHelp ... perfect day right\nI think so too That's Kevin harvest he'll go for position number twelve is Stuart horseracing teammate is lucky enough to catch up with see both\nWell Stordahl racing certainly been stalled

different the sun out a little bit warmer today I'm Still a cool fall day and you know nonetheless a a good opportunity this is a huge opportunity to have a car as good as we had a yesterday I'm going into to ah you know such an important race within the play offs I mean literally you win this race\nHere in the name you know a year one of four guys with a chance to win a championship um that can often be put to bad here today but you don't have to do that that's not the only way to get to the home and said you know we have to capitalize on a ... a good weekend for us we got a cap that often\nTake care of business any stages accumulate as many points as possible um we can't when they're saying we all by all means we've got to finish the best we can to um to have a little bit of blanket going in the next year\nWe'll see what happens with the yesterday huge opportunity may be a great day here today for when you start sucking strolling along the federal because she's alongside Winston telling\nTop Bush picking up where he left off when we were here before he's been up front the last five times here a couple of wins a couple of seconds and then a fence so a very strong here the track should be a little bit different with the warmer weather than we had back in March how do you feel like it's going to be different\nBut I always like it when it's a little bit warmer here I feel like we run better when it's warmer and when it gets too cold it just doesn't feel like you can I that I can also the car enough in order to make up time so I'm looking forward to today though we've got a awesome Halloween eminent Camry and uh it's been up front\nHere at Martin's the last few times as you mentioned and I would love to keep that trend going here today\nDid you like to package it your head yesterday\nYeah we um you know I felt like we were pretty good in the long run we made a few long runs and um\nYou know yeah I can make speed on the front side of the round which I thought would be okay for qualifying and obviously that kind of showed but also I think we're pretty good on the long run so we'll see what happens there today and um\nYou know it's it's that time of year where you you better be good and um you know I think we're I think we're there\nForty points to the good looking for when number right this year and we're number fifty one in the NASCAR
