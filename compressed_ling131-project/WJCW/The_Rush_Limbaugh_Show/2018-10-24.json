all of the so called response civil polls out there into something called a real clear politics average of polls\nAnd political experts from across the aisle site real clear politics and trusted as an

building ... we'd be seeing the\nTop of it here and Tom Devon sat in all of polling data that they have it real clear politics are analyzing\nIt's not there is no crafting there is no blue wave if a wave was coming it would be building he says and it isn't but on the other hand the generic ballot is holding meaning the\nDemocrats are not running away with it they still have a ... depending on three to five point lead in the generic ballot but they're not expanding it there's no growth there is no Democrats pulling away as what happened with a blue wave Trump's job approval is rising\nDemocrats are in the advantage ... but they're not building on anything there's no way that's got to wash everything away and leave only Democrats standing\nHe says the house races are really tight they are race by race real battles hand to hand combat is how he described it\nHe forecast that Democrats might win the house that they do have an advantage right now because they have a range of Seventy competitive races\nAnd the range of pick up as they look at polling data now\nIs anywhere from Democrats picking up tend to forty one seats\nThey're projecting a democratic pickup of twenty five and a half seats which give him a slight a bed Democrats need to pick up twenty three that's the magic number anything above that Democrats have an advantage in the house\nThe range of the pickup according to polling data real clear politics takes it looks at it anywhere from ten to forty one seats they project I pick up a twenty five seats twenty five an absolute two and a half seats more

announced yet this Clinton's announced this nationwide stadium chore third team locations stadium chore they're gonna charge admission for people that come in and spend some time listening to bill and Hillary reminisce and talk about\nPolitics what\nWhat if there isn't a whole lot of interest in that [noise] what if a lot of people aren't yet\nBuying tickets\nI don't know that they're on sale at every event here yet but\nI mean the Clintons aren't on anybody's radar right now\nI mean the closest that happens is you know when Trump goes to a rally and they start talking about the deep state in the Hillary and her ... and the FBI trend the shaft Trump on his phony collusion story the lock her up lock her up but I mean the Clintons are not considered political opponents right now and Obama certainly is and\nI don't know I ... and and now with so many leftist tweeting this is typical this is Donald Trump has engendered so much hatred in so much anger the wife and a mirror here's not say that this is just to pet\nIt it's just it's it it it's too obvious it is becoming what in form\n... and a educated suspicion about this would tell you that it is uh we'll see we'll let time on fall\nHere in the meantime we go back to the phones Andrew in Cleveland it's great to have you with us or hello\nHey Russia I've been with if you if there was a kid or riding around in the car with my father it's a pleasure speaking\nWell thank you I appreciate thank you very much\nRush you know it's a you're talking about this passing the smell test I'm I'm sure the drive by spin on this will be that uh we have a dangerous\nRight we're out there putting these bombs in the mail\nYou know if that really were the case where it is a redneck right wing hillbilly which I'm sure that's how this will be run by the media where do they go about getting a mailing address is I mean George Soros Hillary Clinton Iraq saying oh you know that that information out there for the masses\nA pain you know quite being there were never any attempt for these devices to make their way to their intended target whoever put them in the mail and I don't know if it's right away to point fingers at certain D. but my gut is telling me this is a left wing smokescreen\nWanted for them to be discovered\nThe Democrats the proven crime and time again there's simply no load that they won't do everything for they've tried to do to derail Trump or the hot and muggy video that came out during his presidential campaign to Russia to even gone so far as to try to ruin the wife of judge Kavanaugh nothing has worked\nWhat makes you think that they wouldn't do something that's whoa it tell\nAlong all along those lines if you want to look at it that way\n\nIt doesn't make any sense for a Republican or conservative to do this if they really care about winning these elections just makes no sense to do\nThis was going to be instant fodder for the Democrats in the media to blame it on Trump and his supporters and or his uh there's there's ... it doesn't make any sense for a Republican or conservative to do this if they care about the elections none whatsoever but flip that\nFlip that around what does it make\nA lot of sense for a democratic operative or a Democrat in cocaine and the lunatic to do it because things are not working out the way\nThey thought do not forget this is why I'm spent so much time dwelling on this today and the psychology that's that that's attached to this this is not going the way they have a short us\nFor the last nine months it was going to go more importantly it's not going the way they believed it was going to go they believe they're allies remember they believe their pollsters\nIf the polls are selling there's a big way based on the generic ballot they believe that they get it in their hands and they believe it then they start reporting it and they just compounds itself and it becomes even more intensely believed it becomes gospel\nAnd then it doesn't\nAnd then the things that are supposed to cement it like the Kavanaugh trek backfires and these mobs are back firing they are not achieving their objectives\n[noise] so if you flipped this around you've got this you've got this this this mob of people flooding the border by intention\nThere's no way that helps the Democrats and the Democrats as I said let me grab the let me grab the uh the sweet here it's really strange ladies and gentlemen I'm going to quote the creepy porn star a lawyer but Here's Michael ...\nThere is too much at stake in the mid term shut the Democrats do allow the Republicans to use this caravan which is so obviously a set up\nMega did U.S Russia a truly an honor to speak with you so well I was holding for you a couple of things popped in my head and I'll get to the point two seconds these are all deep state leaders that these quote unquote bombs are going to Hillary and and you know and and Cuomo and all of these guys and then Brennan\nThat it's all deep state and this is right out of the play the Clinton playbook if you ah go back in time to I Believe it was two thousand eight when Hillary was going against uh Hussein Obama\nThe uh iron my shirts folk started coming out I don't know if you recall that or not I'm sure you do with your memory\nTired out and I think I'm responsible for that because of a joke I used ...\nYeah and so Michele milk and you know put that to bed as far as it was you know it was a plant\nWill tell people what it was ... tell me because I stepped on it tell people what it is\nOh sure sure so back in two thousand and eight or in order to garner sympathy and empathy for the ... um there was a gentleman or series of gentleman that were walking around the Hillary camp for president campaign that two thousand and eight\nWith signs saying iron my shirts iron my shirts of course because of you know can't have a woman for president those you know those sexist Republicans\nRight and you're what you're going to do Hillary and be a domestic beer housewife an iron my shirts didn't fix dinner and got my slippers that kind of thing right\nIt was a point it was a plant it ... it was all it was all nonsense to garner empathy and\nSeparate it was already planning to go to waste it was Hillary's plant there was nobody legitimately anti Hillary doing that\nRight correct that's another time telling you I gave them the idea but anyway I don't want to step on it keep going with the story\nSo so anyway Michelle milk and came up with a good teeth and basically could it's a bad from a follow up that this was a plan and it was all a facade like everything is with the Clintons a great professor called the ... rush he taught me one time with the Clintons there are no coincidence is\nAnd there are no ah are you there is nothing that set in stone with these people ... everything is manufactured everything is made off\nAnd so I don't trust them look at Nancy Pelosi down in Miami for someone who is quote unquote running for her life millionaire Nancy was taking her time walking down the stairs or somebody was open the door for her while she's being shouted that I Believe that's a set up I don't want to sound like in conspiracy theorist here but take a look at it it's a bunch of nonsense\nAnd I don't trust the Democrats never have you never let a good conspiracy theory go to ... I could never let a good crisis\nGo exactly rush no you're you're you're right about the Clintons there are no coincidence is with them this is a this is a philosophy\nThat I have a stone for four years on this program asking people to\nNever forget there are no coincidence and ... and the fact you know you say that these are all deep state players a Soros bill and Hillary a Obama and so forth\nUm it's\nIt is curious they're they're they're not even on the radar in in the midterms when you get down to it other than trying to get themselves on the radar but see\nThat's I think they're trying to get noticed the Clintons desperately need to be noticed all the time and Obama is trying to recapture some glory trying to show everybody thinks he can still move the needle in working now the reason I think I'm responsible for the\nWhat was it iron my shirt I used to the rush to excellent store open up you know with some funny jokes line stories and so forth and I would tell people that I just met Mrs Clinton a week before\nAnd that it was the strangest strangest thing and we ended up in an elevator together and just the two of us she said you know I could never say this outside this elevator but I\nI have everything you've done to my family me I Can't help but I find you the most compelling most interesting guy that I haven't run across I wanted to\nYou for I don't know how long 'cause you're the kind of guy you know I I've ever met Mr Limbaugh it's been so I I Need to feel like a woman I haven't been made to feel like on you know why I'm not I'm Sorry I understand [noise] could you make me feel like a woman was here in the elevator\nAnd I said I can give it a shot take off your clothes\nSo she began to just robe and not quite on the way where she got I said okay now falls them\nWas what ... what you do hear rush some guy being met for\nIf you suffer from E.
