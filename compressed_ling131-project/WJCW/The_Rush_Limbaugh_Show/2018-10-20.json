thousand square feet now and a ... in it\nWhich as I mentioned we added on to to an older concrete block house and uh it the bedroom and and we're the bathroom and shower are actually behind to different concrete walls covered in plastered I walked around into that area\nUm and it's so it's a long ways away from from the satellite and and and of course through several walls to get to that

in in the two thousand square foot house\nIt was it worked perfectly it at work perfectly and ... and ... for streaming video so that's pretty impressive and it's\nI I couldn't imagine the need for

to works perfectly for that size\nRight and um most of these ... systems come with an app that gives you tons of control over it um was there any uh features of the app that stood out to you are you able to um look at who's connected to your wife by and possibly control how much a band with they're getting or things like that\nIt's a slick app um I haven't used that functionality but but just a

really really seamlessly\nAnd the and the APA super helpful um I had a couple of of from where updates and that took I don't know maybe Ninety seconds on top of\nThe regular installations so uh the

Mike at church and I met ... he's the product management leader for or be connected home you can see more about what we're talking about a ... year dot com slash or me or vi\nAnd where we left off was Mike was just asking a minute what makes old homes such a challenge for regular why and how mash why if I can help\nWhat is it about the construction of homes and specifically older homes that makes me the the old ... wife by it and in ... and using the wife by extender or what what what makes why fight in general challenging an old oh\nRight um it it has to do with a couple of things I'm I'm a first it's the construction material and what they use inside it right now I'm In\nYou know I think more modern homes use more um our rest friendly material you know thinner walls and things like that\nUm whereas you know breaking construction and you know that kind of stuff makes it a little bit harder for cellular signals wipe icy knows whatever have huge cuts through the other thing that makes it a little bit more difficult in an older homes tend to have\nUm more additions to it so maybe what you're actually walk you know kind of punch through with a ... a previous exterior wall which is you know usually you know tougher it has more inflation\nThose kinds of things to it and what you decided to do with you decided to add another bedroom on the other side of it so now you're trying to do an exterior wall which makes it a little bit more difficult to so a lot more changes there but there's also metal you know you've got\nWires and pipes and a seed ducks and you know things like that that also or make 'em make life a little bit more um\nChallenging for a typical are ethic not um and that's actually also created an opportunity because I'm the or be has this capability called up a dedicated back which is you know what channel that's really just dedicated to having to or be talk to each other\nAnd that we don't use that for any iPhones are laptops and for that type of communication and what that does is it allows us to to get to your iPhone from multiple directions and let the iPhone pick which signal is really the most suitable for it\nWhereas and at the same time maintaining really strong vast signal between the or be\nIt shows I'm One of the things that you kind of alluded to earlier and I actually have a debt gear or as I mentioned a range extender which I've been super happy with\nYou know but it but it's still little things that you realize just like like you said when you go to the back of the house and you switch between the extender ... or ... you switch from the main signal to the extent or signal and you know just those little\nWhich didn't seem like inconveniences before suddenly you're like oh yeah I just like having the one signal that really doesn't make sense it's a it's a couple of these\nThings are sort of a ha moments where you just got a ticket for granted it is the way it is when you have an extended and you've got to bounce around to an extent or the non extender and that's what a treat about your be as well just in his at one signal and then I tested in my house from the absolute corners standing in the shower surrounded by concrete tile\nAnd around the house and it seemed was just absolutely see what\nWe think that we we put a lot of work into into making those types of things work is they just weren't the right is it just works and and I absolutely and and that that there's a lot of challenge and that and we spend a lot of time in that and it it it it feels good to hear that it it works for most people\n\nHave so little and and can you again sort of what you know what's the cocktail party explanation of what mash it what what a what a wife I ... network or networking system is what's what's this something that my parents\nCan understand that I Do I think a couple of characteristics one is I'm I'm a single network\nName and the ability for you not to have to mess around with it um when you move around from one place in to the other it it's also multiple systems two or more\nThat work together in concert in order to to deal with um any any obstacles or things like that and and at the end of the day it it's a new way of dealing with white eye at home and we went back to the drawing board and um and kind of\nTwo things right from the very basics when we come designed and you know yes we have a twenty year history in in designing whole\nNetworking we took all of that into account when we went out and designed the family or be a but we also kind of took a step back and said okay what works what doesn't in any kind of approach things with a little bit of a blank\nSlate [noise]\nWow well we'll do it as as as I've mentioned\nThey said uh you know my my house happens elements in

with plaster on the inside walls\nAnd like you said it's and we've also added onto it ... a ... and and so it is about as bad as you can get in terms of in the walls are super thick and you know it's just it's a nightmare and I gotta say again that next year I'm the dual band\nRange extent that are really it stepped into the\nTwenty first century which was fantastic but boy when you have that when

thoughts at radio I'm Jason masters with my co hosts Mike ... is our final segment with related product management leader for or be connected home from next year and now let's talk about\nHow or be always ends up near or at the top of every reviewers\nList when it comes to the best mash why systems if anybody out there goes on line and looks up reviews for the or be or even if you just type in like what's the best why fine mesh route or that I can get\nMany times if not every time you'll see that the or be tends to be the top of the list is like the best most recommended one right um what do you think it is about the or be\nThat that makes it so consistently the top reviewed unit I'm even over some of the other units where they they might come with more\nNodes took place in more places it seems like a lot of the reviews tend to say even though some of these come with three to four units that you can place around your house the ... does just as good if not better with only the two uh that you start off with\nRight so that there's two bits of two decision that we made really early on words and and a lot of this I can get credited to the fact that you know we've been in this industry for Twenty years um we have what what's called the pride that which means three sets of radios on each device um which is far more than a lot of our competition\nThe second decision that we made is that um you know you you get a certain paper a certain amount of bandwidth from your um Internet provider um\nAnd and that for that amount of band was comes to wear your modem is well what we do with it with a dedicated back all and the tribe and we say you know what this this Senate radios is only ... you know for the ...\nAnd and what that does is get get your really fast Internet from the ah and we went to your house with the cable modem all the way to your further satellite without any interference or contention or anything along those lines and\nReally allows us to um scale as a number of devices in your house increase it you know if you only have a handful of devices in your house yeah you know ... or whatever but then you start counting TV than set top boxes and the laptops and phone service that light and\nPersonal assistance now you know it's not uncommon these days for people to have you know thirty forty ... each of these devices in your house and back when you really start and um noticed amplification of a wide or abused when\nSmall complaints aside about um you know connecting to the extender um depending on what room you're in um I I've read that the extender can be as much as fifty percent slower than just being on a national network because instead of having the tribe and\nYou're on a a dual band and then one of those bans becomes just\nFor connecting and talking between the different a wife I units so so even though you can get Internet further into your house within extender um that you may be bought on Craig's list super cheap or whatever you're going to be getting fifty percent slower Internet\nThe exactly is exactly that is that because of dual band and because of some other matched us was basically are saying in order for you to get from hopped hopped hopped as always on the same channel and that causes your speeds to go down to ... percent\nUm and that gets worse and worse with more and more devices I'm In the decision that we made very early on as it were the first come out with something like this probably been dedicated that all that in in that situation you don't suffer the fifty percent and all you by\nGoing through multiple choice or by having an environment that has a ton of 'em uh devices in it right I'm ... and that really is part of where what causes um all of a performance when or if you

[laughter] [noise] wow\nWe're back to just pop took radio I'm Jason masters and we're still talking you know took over money PHD she'd surprise lead and senior director of climate an environment that X prize\nAnd we're talking about the show ocean discovery X prize so now that we know what X prize is we'll talk more in depth about what the ocean discovery ex prices\nTo the ocean the shallow discovery X prize\nAnd we've just enough to finance we have nine final team the goal so all of them is to develop a unable to robot that is completely autonomous uh it can be controlled from the show but not\nBy any humidity in the competition area and this is the robot that will go down to the deep sea says around to the final round they'll have to map the full thousand ...\nKilometers and it has to map a very high resolution advise me to Ohio or something for my situation and we're asking them to bring back images from the deep sea as well so that we can all see\nWhat is out that you can see the amazing one does have a little bit least currently waiting to have access to\nYou know and um when I was reading up about are doing this interview I a lot of what I'm seeing is that we don't know much about the ocean as we do about the moon and other celestial bodies and I think a lot about it because it's so hard to see that deep down below the water and and it's hard for\nA self signals and other type of wireless communications to to help that process under water 'em and so we've got some bits of satellite imaging that we can make work\nBut this was really the ... you know the next step is is getting like lasers and different types of things down there to really map out our oceans right\nYeah we we kind of vehicles have I said my in laws and we have a car and got it um the maps that you see oh say can so that when you look at Google Maps\nThose are around a one kilometer always on the resolution and as you mentioned that from satellites and differences at that you can see from from space but the robot will go down\nA interesting if you like tend to DC and they will actually make measurements down there as reading rapid pace the current estimate if we use station the technology of today a ... a very high resolution it around the country he is\nWell we're pushing forward this competition and the technology that comes out the competition is a high resolution ... my twenty fifth T Y no it's a very very uh ... uh projects that that we made me think that we can achieve it\nDefinitely will so can you tell us about some of these finals teams and the different technologies that they have brought to the table\nYeah yeah we have a nine final teen a we have student teen is actually from the United states a Texas saying in Virginia Tech and ...\nAnd so if you can ask you for example has a heavy lift aerial drone which will take these so no pods out to the deep sea and then to deploy them when they get to the competition area and this is the approach that is really tapping into the\nFast evolving field ... technology and try and technology\nAnd one of the market said is that we had identified with this competition um and why the ocean floor has not yet been mapped and thinking that hugely expensive\nAnd it can cost up to a hundred and twenty thousand dollars a day for a ship and if you have to say on for ten days you've already lost ... million dollars before you start working\nAnd say we'd removed the need for ships at sea so all of these technologies are deployed from the coastline and so something like an aerial trend is really effective way of getting the mapping technology out to the site that you want to Matt\nAnd and then looking at some of the other teams and we have um a team from Japan and they using a a ... unable to I'm trying to listen to what to say a cool to do nothing\nAnd I we have a team from Switzerland that is using the technology to do the math thanks so\nCurrently most my opinion is done using sound into not techniques and this is using light based technique which is very interesting as well\nAnd we have a team from the United kingdom that has\nA vertical row boats if you like so most of the swimming ... but this team has a swarm\nOf ethical a policy that will just go up and down into more to call in and it can take measurements as you go to the will to call them and then it will bounce alone with the fool and then we used to fish and transmit the data back then we have a large range of approaches to this\nAnd I'm I'm really thrilled with the huge range that when you have coming out this competition and the amount of innovation that will beginning to see [laughter]\nRight and I imagine that was you know so much of the open sea there's just straight sunlight so are are we seeing a lot of these teams start to incorporate a lot of a solar recharging and things like that to to make sure that they don't have to bother\nDealing with other types of electricity or or returning to shore to recharge\nYour yeah we're seeing some of those that are beginning to emerge so a number of the teen and have a ... which is also autonomous and which they carry you know that sales on these essays and then the underwater component get deployed from that and then in some cases\nThe unable to technology will we ... we to say\n... charge and then go for its next round so that I really help in terms of a controlling the pile a drain that need a little something like that\nWow and so again told me when when does this and and um is is there any way that um people who are interested can vote on this or is this\nI'm going to be decided by a experts\nSay yes to this competition and we we intend to home around to the final round in a October November yeah and we actually have an independent judging panel of experts\nWho are going to be judging all the data that comes back from the ... we actually have with with with partners you have to go to one of a price on it and they are looking to get a a very high resolution baseline Matt\nAnd in in the competition area that the teams will then have to go with that technology and try and reproduce and the judging panel will\nThen look at that are using actually software that than to and they could buy one of our other prize partners entry and to see how well the two men can pass and it's really it's a very technical challenge and we really

partnering with parlay for the oceans and they're helping at a A N machine learning\nTools to collect biological samples from Wales using something called projects not bought you're going to want to hear about this it's pretty amazing so Dr ... what is it into doing with whales and why\nIntel labs is on a mission to\nPush the frontier of discovery forward and computing and um we also want to play our part in making this the best climate it can be and that starts by you know looking after humankind\nOr be go system that we depend on the animals within it that a lot about how we're doing which we care about them fundamentally as well a diversity of the planet all the resources that are on it\nUm so ... has been pursuing a a camp and related to the work that we are doing pretty good trying to show that artificial intelligence\nAnd do good it not just something to fear and a new technology that um you know reminds of a a a bunch of bad science fiction films but also something that actually can planet server selves quite well um if it's done in the right way and that this work we've been doing\nWith a pilot or the ocean ocean alliance to eight partners that are put a lot of uh bought into ocean conservation a recycling um concerns for the welfare of the planet the animal people um\nHave shown us that we can apply AI rape and so in that space and so first idea was let's see what we can do for exactly what they're up to right now and we went after that prize\nThis is really interesting because you know I think so many people think about like I said into as a computer brand but I mean some of the stuff that's going on here with the er the wonderfully named it's not bought is is really interesting and has nothing to do with um\nConsumer level products but it really is affecting a I mean everybody in the end if we're going to be a keeping some of these animals alive longer than they would live otherwise uh without our um without our help\nWell like I mentioned that ocean help that is directly tied to human health human health everything that we put in the ocean or you know affects the food that we have the play that we do in the ocean and things that we that we otherwise take out of it\nI'm obviously the ocean also reflects everything we do to land in the environment around it\nUm and so um it happens to be that uh you know the wells that will do have been studying a in the work with pilot for the oceans notion alliance\nAnd with these\nHe's not by are at the at the top of their food chains and they concentrate all of the problems that are in the ocean so when the system is is not doing well they they reflected a reflected in a big way um so uh not bought our\nDrone created to study them in a very non invasive effective way or the idea being that you would take a this drone and why or a belt water you know the whale comes up from a dive in it exhaled blows beautiful\nUm cloud is a myth that comes out of its lungs and um we can go through that capture it and take samples from those samples we can get all kinds of really rich information about how well\nI'm that animals doing you know from uh the hormone levels of threat\nSex hormones Fox and cabinet\nAnd the water and that the ... fluid so we've got a huge picture we can do DNA Analysis I'm\nAnd I'm so that the stock bought bring a new degree of information that the problem and they do it in a way that that leads the animals planning and their natural environment with very little disruption which is really important because these animals are already stressed out enough\nRight in previous on them you know probably have to like you'd have to fully catch one right\nNow so previously are you know our partners have told all the stories that people will go out on boats and they get really close to these animals and then\nBasically harpoon them to get samples examples out of their blubber 'em and get the kind of information that we're able to get out of this excellent kind of that now\nA and so that the problem with that it's like you you know you have to get close to chase them down they're aware of that you can hear the motors coming in the boat\nUm and then you a hole in them basically and and hope that that doesn't create problems and it it takes an intense amount of work by a very skilled teens do that um and so now we can do it at a greater distance with these drones and we can go to places and literally get into\nPositions we couldn't before I'm with an object no larger than a burden doesn't have a more of an effect on the animals in

our show for this weekend were finishing up our conversation with Dr Ted Wilkie he's the senior principal engineer for intel labs\nAnd so Dr Wilkie I Know it's it's kinda hard for layman to understand but can you tell us what these algorithms are doing when they've collected all this data from these whales\nSo identifying well just talk you know they're they blend in with their background there are always under water water filters out color\nOr it's often murky are always dealing with a really noisy environment terms of like waves were flashing light and ending light that goes through and so it was one of the reasons we're really attracted to this and thought we would learn something more about artificial intelligence helped by taking on the challenge not a lot of\nResearchers are studying the problem of identifying subtle objects in the wild or being able to determine the shape of something that's partially it scared like that um it's not a common problem in other places today I being aggressively applied like a ton of Mr riding\nUm so it's a really cool problem for researchers with respect to identification and\nUm what's cool about that as we had to figure out what the fingerprint is what's the thing\nBit of a well when the ticket died in their tail comes up we get a shot at a distinct marking weren't sure how they would matter you know would they be able to to determine individuals accurately what we noticed was that uh the trailing edge of the tales jagged like key\nWe figured that if we can figure out the unique geometry of that and and and that turned out it might have part of a mystery solved the second thing is is they're often on these whales there's there's there's patterns and coloring on the surface of the tail it can vary from white black and it can vary by region the animal\nWas born in and and well then I'm\nIn the ... that gives us a clue by using machine learning to combine the right aspects of it but trailing edge geometry and the patchwork we did indeed find it very unique fingerprint for these whales and were able to\nDemonstrate on the fly in real time as we go out an image off the drone to make a positive identification one surprising story that goes to mediate value being able to do this in the field as we were out there on the water in Alaska dropped to ... phone the device to listen to the sounds that will make underwater\nAnd we heard a caller we had a we had a whale researcher with it that had\nMany years of these recordings and you heard the call and he said you know I think I recognize that well but it it's probably very unlikely because it's been Twenty one years since I heard that call a generally route they're seeing a bunch of animals in the descended we would never be able to answer the mystery of whether that was the same animal or not\nOr luckily we got a shot and we'll go we've got a shot at the tail were able to apply fingerprint technology to it and say I technology and what we discovered was it was a perfect match for an animal that was named in a database trumpeter trumpeter had a very distinct all over the phone\nAnd when we all behind her own record they mastered it sounded like they didn't ask but over Twenty one years I mean that's a lot of change\nBut the identification what exact\nAnd so were you able to go back and take a picture of the uh maybe there somewhere there existed an old photo of that whales yeah it'll\nDrop it or someone that's all our camera you know two decades the trumpeter\nRelated with the Dodgers do did at that point in general you know just put away in a database never knowing whether they're ever going to be able to match that using an algorithm so it's time we were able to play to automatically ... we had in the database brought up trumpeter\nMatch what the whale researcher thought we were going to see it was amazing it was amazing to see that play out real time\nIt seems like what you're saying is before you guys were involved in this process people weren't really sure that you could identify a whale by its tail and that that's that's a pretty giant leap ... enough itself you know\nIt was sort of an it was an art and there were rules and uh you would try to find like as you say key points that you know like there's a notch out of here and there's a jacket edge there about sort of but it didn't become an AK ... nothing becomes an exact\nScience until you start taking measurement and and the problem with that it never ... so during the measurement and then trying to compare exact measurements is is a very tedious thinker human to do an algorithm is going to try to\nFind the best magic and by looking exhaustively through the database and taking into account the number of measurements I hate is like and so yeah this is just this is this that Ford\nOr the community you know it makes washing answering possible that wasn't possible um and it wouldn't have been even considered would have been ruled

Tom and Tom Murray dot\nCom M. U. R. R. Y. Tom Murray dot com I sell you a interestingly enough by the way I'm the old days when I was in high school I played water polo similar thing happened to me I was a sophomore and all of a sudden you know here we are in the showers a bunch of\nCrazy guys and you know something happened and one of the guys shoved and then they they started laughing and and I thought to myself this is going nowhere fast\nAnd guess what my basically was prepared to kill all righty bye touches me your diet today and and you know but at what happened is they respected me now I you know they're not going to mess with me same in the pool I realized if I'm going to ... it's a really intense sport by the way\nI Need to be tough but I also know that wasn't really my nature I wasn't I wasn't nice guy\nAnd so I think at some point at that moment in time I realized if you don't defend yourself in this world you're going to go down and so that's kind of where you are you made that choice to defend yourself you've got the respect to the other men take it from there\nYeah so that was a big turning point obviously recovered from being totally unacceptable to being accepted and being new one of them so I Want them over and that was a big deal and then then I went to work\nAnd it was by far the hardest work I've ever done had ever done and never ever physical work I've done since it was just it was just unbelievable\nSo I was a rough about working on the gender which is a old navy ship attached to the rig and we're all about the best that worked on the red and so they gave me a job of of sand blasting the tender and it was about a hundred and ten degrees out there and the goal and so I stood for probably twelve hours a day\nWith my arms up in the air wearing the deep sea divers outfit or a suit to\nProtect me from the San oh man I Would be a nice and blasting\nTender and that would go on as I said for about twelve hours it was just unbelievable and then I Would go you know be off work and go to bed and saw it a metaphor both came in didn't matter what time it was could have been two or three o'clock in the morning\nWe're asked about would be up to unload that worked out but we would do is we would get the casing that was on the work boat into storage on the tender and Casey or those iron long poles to write whatever\nThey go into the ground that are ... how the the drill bit so it was just unbelievable in terms of physical labor in terms of lack of sleep but I ended up making good friends out there I learned a lot of that team work and because it was so dangerous you know you were part of the team and you had to kind of watch out for each other\nSo that went on for a summer and you know summer from college and I'll never forget it and then I went back to to college\nYeah\nWell I mean but it's funny if you think about it now you were like what they call you a a habit Asher right and you go for that to being what you call the ... about on an oil rig and but in that one summer you took something with you that probably lasted for the rest of your life right\nThere are no question about it and to your point earlier that my dad was a method to the

is Nineteen and he is working for a I'm a very similar thing well drilling outfit they drill wells water\nYeah and it's it's dangerous it's a lot of hard work it doesn't matter what the weather is the

championship lives on the line the first challenge of the next three races happens\nToday and for for drivers there already behind the eight ball coming into this right\nNo question about those for drivers being Eliot ... tests and Austin centric however being behind the eight ball that's a little bit cloudy because positions three through eight in the championship point standings separated by only twelve points Mike in with one point for a position on the racetrack that can be wiped out immediately\nJust to give you the uh the lay of the land so to speak Christopher Bell is your points leader coming in thirty three points to the good Justin all guy or twenty eight to the good but Alex references from third on back that's where things get really tight Daniel Henrik is only two\nPoints above the cut line coal Custer and Eliot Sandler tied for fourth Sadler is the first below that cut line as he comes into this race here this afternoon on a race track that was repaid Alex five years ago but this track has aged and seems like that tires may be a factor today no question\nAbout at the surface going through all kinds of weather changes here in Kansas City from extreme heat in the summer too bitter cold in the winter and everything in between this asphalt has aged in age well if you're a race car driver that means you can go to the bottom of the track all the way to the top in all parts in between and find the speed that your cars looking for\nIs going to be a great afternoon for race and we're so glad you're spending your Saturday afternoon with us here on the motor racy network drivers right now are being introduced track side so let's get some thoughts of these championship drivers first we had downstairs to sweetness get South Carolina's wants to Kelly\nSouth Dakota Custer real quickly is going to roll up they're tired of the line but looking at the last ten mile and a half price says you've got eight of those in the top ten a win seven of those in the top five how good is a race car today qualifying too\nYeah I mean when we show up to ... you know we're going to be fast it's just a matter of doing everything right and uh we haven't had the shore on feet on the bottom like some of the guys weekend but you might want to wants to move up to the top we had some pretty good speed so a lot of people will be moving forward but it's going to be with your your\nGoing to start back into but he's been very strong on these models and a half over the last ten times dating back to Texas of last year\nAlso other drivers being introduced down there a lot of them have already taken their lap around the or the trial here in Kansas Speedway will go back downstairs to Kim Kim from Orlando, Florida\nYou know get a quick word with not typical site this race in the Knight position than considerably different conditions those sons right out yesterday that wasn't the case in practice heavier guys just in the car appropriately for the sunshine out here today\nYeah we're just a little bit this morning I started off way too loose with some of the sunshine so\nUh we tighten up a little bit just to try to get ready for today um the good thing as the temperature is not too different so it's mainly just a sense I was on time which I think it's just gonna rubber on the track so things tend to put us to the top of this\nPlace quicker than we probably would have had we had cloud cover like yesterday and how comfortable are you on the top line close to the wall yeah I mean yesterday I was trying to push and see how much I could get up there and got a little too much actually started so I'm I'm really comfortable up there it's just a you got to carry momentum there's places so fast\nSo much time so it's more about how much throughout all you can carry rather than how comfortable they are\nElected I I think that's not typical one of those plants drivers that's currently below the cut off mindlessly every once and Kelly who's with another play up driver\nEliot Sadler talking to his teammate just and I'll go right on that taught off line but we look at the last eight or nine races here in Kansas all on top twelve except one that's a long time ago how good is a race car today Elia and what is the game plan because it's all about getting to Miami\nYeah it's all about getting in Miami and we got to be aggressive today I mean all the guys I'm racing or in front of me so we we got to find some cars and we got to try to get up there before the end a phase one which is only forty five last definitely a lot field to this round the what we had the last\nRound we know who's fasten it somebody guys originally got some really good speed and hopefully we'll habits we went to Cal did you have the speed you're looking for yesterday uh we we struggle a little bit yesterday um we made some changes last night we ... we usually pretty good here as a race goes and especially when the grid gets right up against the wall hoping they'll come in and quicken won't be able to make a way to the front\nAnd its adult roles off all of a place of names are made is has been made a long time ago that's the only aside or let's go back to him\nYeah I went to LA a teammate ... areas that are hyper on his shoulder getting ready for a player or a\nLayoff introduction this place is so hard to pass it you have to find a spot on the fact that the easiest to get in front of other card that whereas I bought I think\nThe easiest places on research and science you know but uh we got a really good restaurant called to come out of this weekend the guys it on a fantastic job obviously starting up towards the front is always a good thing\nOr one of the things that we noticed this this particular uh go round here in Kansas isn't why now insanely or a wide compared to what we normally would the hurricanes be myself I'm excited for that you could just run entire they're really of fits\nThe racetrack well and I think you know from the standpoint of living can move around a lot of the race goes on and put ourselves in a position to uh to win the race today\nThat's an hour and a lot of line up because again the playoff driver's going to be introduced here quickly hit a crowd let's go back over to one thing Kelly\nLet's talk to a crisp prevail looking at the last ten mile and a half you have one that's outside of the top twelve nine of them in the top well most of them top finishers how good is the race card today Christopher\nI think it's a pretty standard DRP so that means that I think I've got a shot at it\nAre ... Camry is pretty good you know the Twenty one and sexually fast so I Will just have to see where every second once we get some on the tires places a lot of on as one of my you know more is probably my favorite actually you can raise all over the place and it seems like if your cars better than you should be able to find a way around a\nTypical J. G. R. that's generally find your way to victory late if memory serves me correctly last five times we've been hearing a series it's been a JAG our car go back to him\nWhen he was just interviewing Christopher about the defending when you're in the face and he said he's got his sights set on you that you guys had the credit card that can get here this afternoon\nA guard definitely is a fear the drivers of that but it's been a lot of fun to have this feeding us outweigh hotel casino several a sense I got here\nSo people live and a lot of effort in this race car and this stretch of races um what's going to the ... all all day and they're going to change a lot for the best racetrack something like that because there's a living doing justice and aggressive right we'll see what happened\nWhen here lock yourself into the championship for Halloween time for that cross your mind here today throughout the race or\nNot a whole lot honestly we know the task at hand is and we do our jobs and are you will have to think about what's going to go to\nThat Daniel him like he's going to lead the field to green here today at Kansas the way\nHe has had a fast car all weekend long we expect him to be up front and the contention for wind this afternoon which leads us to our\nFirst MRI's fan vote of the day the question is who is Christopher bells biggest competition for the championship is it the gentleman you just heard from Daniel Henrik or is it just an old guy or Eliot Sadler or coal Custer share your opinion with us right now with M.
