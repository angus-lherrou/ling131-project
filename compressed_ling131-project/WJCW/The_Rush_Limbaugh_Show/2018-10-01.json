rid of it brand new trade deal the drive by eyes were under orders not to ask questions about Kavanaugh which meant they ask questions about capital and Trump after making sure enough time was spent on NAFTA\nStarted entertaining the are the questions and what we had one through four of them here\nAnd\nHere is a Trump ... this is this is not actually in response to a question he's just riffing here during the ceremony talking about the uh mid term election fake news Kevin on things\nWe have Senate races that weren't even in play six months ago as you know there are a lot of repression polls polls that are aren't very accurate we had areas and we had congressional seats to\nWhere I Know it's going to be a positive outcome\nBut you look at what's going on and it doesn't seem to be broadcast that way but I certainly had that with my election they were telling me I was you know in trouble in certain states so they end up winning like in a landslide and I knew I was going to win them in a landslide but they wouldn't reported that way you know why fake news\nNow during the Cuban a Cecilia vague go\nABC News the White House correspondent said in a tweet this weekend you said it's incorrect to say that you're limiting the scope of the FBI investigation into Kevin ... what's your own statement on friday made it very clear you said this investigation must be limited in scope so which is it\nThis is our seventh investigation of a man who has really you know you look at his life until this happened what a change he's gone through what his family's gone through the trauma\nFor a man that never had any accusation any he's not a bad statement about him he's led I think he was number one in this class it yeah he was number one in this law school and yeah and then when he's gone through over the last three weeks his incredible so\nI Want the FBI this is now the sevens investigation so it's not like the you know just starting I Want them to do a very comprehensive investigation\nLet me explain that answer let me let me these soundbites have got to be yeah number thirty coming okay\nWhen this whole FBI investigation started everybody knows we we heard flake\nDemand a week for his vote one week [noise]\nSo that's how the committee vote ended eleven to pen and paper Kavanaugh with the provides though that flake was not going to vote [noise]

to limit the scope of the FBI it was a set up it was a it was a trap\n[noise] they lay in a trap NBC News which is complicit with the Democratic party in most things later trapped accusing Trump and the White House of trying to limit the FBI\nSkull because you see there are things to find and Trump wants to cover it up Donald Trump has had so much control over the FBI the last three years same FBI that's been doing is level best to get Donald Trump thrown out of office somehow Donald Trump has been able to walk in there and tell those guys to limit the scope of their investigation\n[noise]\nSo Trump ... I'm not limiting the scope of anything I've told the FBI the look at whatever they need to look at\nOh OK thank\nYou Mr herself and needs to go two weeks ago two weeks so the White House is not claim there aren't any limit to see how this works\nIt was a trap it was a setup and Trump tweeted out\nHe's not limiting the scope NBC is why course they're lying it was a set up\n\nAnd so now it's out there but we may not be enough now Fox News is reporting along with Fox Business news\nAt the FBI is saying they might have this wrapped up tomorrow\nBut then the question becomes what to do with that if the FBI has finished talking to everybody these talk to\n\nThat one of the Republicans do with that so they hold on to it till friday and art art art or do they move on it\nWill just tell ya if this ends tomorrow if this was all accurate [noise]\nAnd the Democrats here but the Democrats are going to be fit to be tied to the thing didn't go on friday and they're going to demand they're going to start saying that this thing is rigged and they knew what was going to be rigged and they're going to demand even more\nTime to fix the fact that it was read ... ... ... they're going to\nDo that anyway they're not going to let this thing and on friday if we let them have their way this investigation isn't going to end on friday\nIt won't be long enough besides Trump said he's not going to limit on the FBI so why are they stopping now it isn't possible they could have found everything there is to find on those labels I\nWent to the response as well they found nothing you know a hundred thousand or more Hillary emails and a couple of days\n\nUh let's see let's let's skip forward here to um\nAudio soundbite number thirty reporter about judge Kavanaugh there are concerns\nThat might have lied or mischaracterized as drinking while he was testifying if they find that Kavanaugh lied about his drinking or if he lied about other things do you think that that\nBars him from being your nominee to the Supreme Court\nI was surprised at how vocally was about the fact that he likes beer\nAnd he's had a little bit of difficulty I mean he talked about things that happened when he drank and this is not a man that said that alcohol was ... that he was perfect with respect to alcohol look at some of these people asking the questions okay look at Blumenthal he lied about Vietnam he didn't just say hey I went to Vietnam no no\nHe'll speak around seven twenty and finished about an hour later then it's back to the airport and flying back to Washington just after nine o'clock that much is public what we don't know though and walk the world is the exact route the motorcade takes from the airport to Johnson City that will remain a secret\nHowever be prepared for some road closures and delays on any route between the two after about five thirty this afternoon local law enforcement also be on hand and helping secure that route\nAnd we're from try cities' airport that commercial flights into and out of the airport will be a while this evening\nAirport officials say there should be minimal impact it's possible that bought scheduled close to the president's arrival the departure times five twenty five and about nine o'clock experience nothing but a short the wood\nAnd again the public will not be a while that tries to these to watch air force one land a bit later today\nJackie Wall Street stocks are up on word of a new trade deal involving the U.S Canada and Mexico the Dow Jones up two hundred points to the U.S and the five hundreds of twelve ... for it is to thirty to Richard limits W.
