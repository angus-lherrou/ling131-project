with ... and ... year from biome let's get back to the conversation where we are talking about new studies are doing\nSo you're you're learning so much for all these people and you're seeing how it affects them in different ways and some of it is from\nYou testing their samples and give them giving them their results back but then um the last time that I went to you to your website it looks like there are studies that people can partake in and it looks like there's like seven or eight different ones yes can you tell us um some of the studies you're working on now and what you're hoping to find from the\n... I mean clearly we want to continually grow our understanding of the microbiology we have a very robust understanding already but of course there's always more to learn and so one of the things are a big study that we're recruiting at volunteer or right now\nIs one where we look at their\nUh glucose responsible their their blood sugar response to different foods that they eat\nNow I can give an example we you know I was wearing a continuous glucose monitor and we had a whole bunch of people here at bio wearing them and it's interesting that people had a very different blood sugar response to the same food so for example for all men\nWhich you know in generally we tell people are going to knock on something you should snack on all that because they're not going to increase your blood sugar too much when my case my blood sugar went way up when I eat on it but in another person or they didn't go up at all\nAnd it's not because your body is better and making 'em sugar from the ... that are in almonds or\nYeah actually that really is dependent on our microbiomes does he think about it the first thing that six you know that gets exposed to everything that we eat right anything that we take in our mouth our microbes are going to be the first ones that the ... and they're going to be the first ones to metabolize it so how quickly\nThey metabolize and turn those those into sugar that we that absorb is a big determinant of how fast are blood sugar goes up with whatever different foods that we eat\nSo that's the key and so this particular study is looking at people's microbiomes will be touching it with my own proprietary technology will be having them where continuous glucose monitor\nAnd we'll be giving them a whole bunch of different foods to eat and we'll be then able to predict ... basically what they're sugar response will be to\nA whole bunch of different foods based on their microbiology\nThat one study that will be and then of course the result of those studies will be incorporating a always incorporating those into the recommendation that people will always get the benefit of the latest research\nWhen other study that we're doing which is which is kind of interesting is\nMeeting people very specific diet so for example we we just finished this one and we're analyzing the data now is a key the Jenike that it that she didn't Jenike diet is a very popular diet there and a lot of people are on it it's not equally good for everybody and again the determinants of that is your microbiomes\nWe took a whole bunch of people and we fed them a very strict either Jenike diet and we took sample every day\nTo see exactly what microbes did with that either Jenike diet and so we're we're doing that as well with a paleo with the McDonalds and a high processed food diet that we'll be following all those different ones is about\n... I'm looking at your recommendations if you don't mind sharing them and\nThey actually get shows that you need eight\nServings of vegetables grown above ground every day and only five servings of the protein and um and the fat so a little yeah five of the protein and three of the fat so basically you also have noticed I think hopefully you'll see in the ear recommended a digestive enzymes\nSo one of the things is your bacteria were having a little bit of difficulty you need the protein that your factory we're having a little bit of difficulty\nUm handling the protein so that's the purpose of the digestive enzyme is to help you handle that extra protein that your body neat okay what\nDoes and you're picking the digestive enzymes separately when they'd be rendered because what was that one of them won't dial up and that's the only the land that up with the things that you need and unlike any other companies that are basically selling stuff in the local by it and using it that that is

for people who don't have time to charge a fitness device every time they want to use it or like the apple watch charges every day [noise]\n[noise] yeah I think that happens a lot a you know and there's a lot of people that are very busy schedules and sometimes it's not an option to wait an hour for it to charge right so I think you know we tried to make something that was a that had a decent battery life and you know one of the challenges with the ring as a it's\nIt's something that ah it's so small it's it's really a challenge to actually get a battery life that significant such a small foreign factor so we spent a lot of time\nOn the on the battery technology that goes into this you're basically we had to make cuts themselves and I put a lot of effort to engineering that France that took us over a year to get the battery just write\nA and then the other side of it is like on the on the you know the board side for the the components that are inside and the circuit board how old is constructed and you know making a very low power system that actually has all the functionality that you need\nBut also has the battery life and and packing that onto a space that's about a tenth of what our competition has you know so it's it's certainly you know we're we're very cognizant of what a what is frustrating with a lot of a lot of devices out there and we tried to really address it as best as possible and not in a foreign factor that I think\nI think there's a lot of a has a lot of runway there's a lot of exciting things ah that that can be done with it\nRight it's really impressive that you're able to fit all of us in there I mean you're you've got a uh I don't know what the word for it is but it looks similar to the flashing green light on the bottom of an apple watch what does the word for that type of heartbeat censor\nAh it's called a P P.

security for broke Obama welcome to the show Dr coal\nI talk to you a few months ago and you've since released a new book online danger how to protect yourself and your loved ones from the evil side of the Internet\nAnd the the evil side of the Internet is always changing right what is new about the evil side of the Internet because I I Know there's all kinds of weird stuff going on these days that is not what we've seen before\nAnd you're spot on the evil has always been there\nBut what's happening is the evil is readying very rapid\nShe was actually anybody with the computing device that's connected to the Internet is now being targeted we saw the Olympics sites being targeted we now see eroding systems being targeted we're seeing cell phones being targeted people have to recognize that it doesn't matter how much money you have\nIt doesn't matter if you're famous or not if you have a computer if you have a cell phone and you're connected to the Internet you are going to be targeted and you are going to be compromised and that's the big problem is most people don't think they're going to be the victim it's always going to happen to somebody else until it happens to that\nSome of the new things that I've been seeing a lot lately is um people using the Web browsers of unsuspecting victims to get any gain access to their sleep you use to harvest crypto currency use and then I've also seen um there was an article recently saying that there was an actual ah\nLike a news site that this was just going to be their new model or like people don't want to pay\nFor their the news on their site so they just said well fine we'll just use your computer while you're reading our news to to mind crypto currency is this the wave of the future or do you think that as a misstep for this company doing that\nAnd I answer to that I think it's a big step but I also think it's the wave of the future because they easier you can make money\nThe better it is and think about this most people are naive to the fact that you go to a site and instead of spending twenty dollars you're just let him use your CPU and you can get access to twenty dollars worth of merchandise\nThat sounds like a good deal what they don't realize is you're getting them total control of your computer when you're going in and letting them use your seat to use you have to install software that's monitoring you'll be there if you're\nLooking for low CPU cycles and then utilizing that\nA computer when you are not accessing it which means they have full disability into what you're doing in what's happening and to me that's really the weight should aids hackers on not about stealing your credit card\nThey're not about stealing your identity there about gaining total control of your computer gaining total control of your cell phone and gaining total control of your life and that's really the trend that is not about a one time infection or a virus it's about total access to your electronic information\nYeah a boy this is so is there any way\nTo\nTo to know if somebody is doing this if your computer is starting to run slow um do you have a certain programs you recommend to scan if people are doing this I don't imagine that all\nAll anti virus software as are equipped to to notice this kind of behavior\nThat no and that's the problem today is do you think the definition for what is the ...\nWhat does a malicious piece of code because you have your end point security that if you don't have definitely should it's not going to catch everything but it provides a base level of protection but the question now is what we categorize as malicious software or viruses yes\nWannaCry that's ransomware it's absolutely militia something that's the only way I got that he is absolutely delicious but let me ask you a question\nI authorized a vendor you installed software in my system and I was reading them use my CPU cycle and I'm fully aware is that really malicious\nMost people would say no now the question is where is the line water by installing software that uses your CPU but you didn't approve and you're not fully aware is ... is that still malicious and the issue we have\nIs this software has gotten so sensitive that anything you install on your computer it's going to fly gets militias so what most\nPeople do it normally or turn it off and that's the dilemma we have today is most people are ignoring the security software because it generates way too many false positive for legitimate things that you're using on your system\nSo or on your home computer is there a brand that you you like to use that that doesn't get in your way embargo on your computer but still is able to catch these things or or do you have your own special concoction that that is not easy for the layman to follow\nWhat what I actually do and it's very very easy and simple and it's what I Do for a lot of my million air high worth clients that hire me to secure and protect their families and their individual residents and it's multiple computers\nI have two computers I have one computer that is connected to the Internet and I only use it\nFor research Web surfing an email that's it nothing else was on it there's no sensitive information or data and then my banking my finance my company all of that is on a separate computer that doesn't have direct access to the Internet\nSo now if I Do something stupid which even security professionals stupid things right you are now going to have your system infected but there's minimal impact because no sensitive date or is there so we really need to get to the point where we're separating and reducing the risk\nJust like we do on our house most people have locks on that front door but they also have a safe\nWhy 'cause there's information whether you have gold or jewelry or money that you want to have an extra level of protection so you have a safe in your house so even if somebody breaks into your house they can't get access to your valuables that's the same thing we need to do in cyberspace\nSet up a cyber stay safe which is done by having a second computer to reduce and minimize the exposure\nOkay so\nWould you recommend maybe doing all of your um Web browsing and stuff on saying I pad and then have if you have just the budget for one computer are you already have one computer do your banking and stuff on one computer and then um instead of buying a separate computer do it on an eye powder Android device\nAbsolutely and it is changing where Android is becoming more and more secure\nI

I built two hundred Raj is kids call me he's the order they got that no I mean the harder you know I'm I'm order I Know I got a cell phone I Know [laughter] but\nIt's even worse than the fact that people are buying things that are not quality you know manufactures are wanting to step out and bring something out whether a camera gear with her card whether it's whatever it is\nThey're wanting to six months of use it and then all you got to get the neck you think just like cell phones\nSo this is not allow as long as it may be used to in the forties or fifties so we're getting this stuff we're sticking it in storage units were sticking it in the garage is becoming crap and that wouldn't do that I looked at each other and we started riding along with\nYou know if you live in New York City you can access just like you said your car your\nWardrobe and order a bike you can have your snowed directly delivered to you you can have so many things at your fingertips so we're talking about not just ownership we're talking about a lifestyle that people want they want to experience they want they don't want just stuff they want\nMaybe things that help them experience life\nSo that's where consumerism and it's going and I think that you know your audience that at least I think we really have to on that end and understand that that's what millennials and the generation of forward thinkers want now own\nOr let me ask so my son I remember when he he was going to Iceland and he wanted you know the next cool drone and he didn't have the money\nThat from Paris you got it from you guys and now here's my complaint you ready for this\nGuy he's got to go on\nI'm going to complain but not to you guys I bought a drone and then as soon as I bought my drone that came out with a better drunk and then as soon as my buddy bought his better drone they came out with a better ... like every thirty six hours they come out with a new crowd\nSo exact mice you know I have a drone sitting on the shelf in our gear room because I own a production company too\nAnd they're it's it now I haven't even looked at it in a year and it might as well as Todd webs on it from Eighteen fifty six as far as my kids concerned right but it's a perfectly good DJ I drop perfectly good\nDo I put that on the list do you guys in case somebody wants to yeah because it's part of the budget you know right\nExactly so there's so many people that need the latest and greatest but there's also people whether the hobby is executive\nBusiness and they just need access to you know we started with cameras there because that that was in our back pocket that with our he's at the time so we wanted to test out this model at least out of a camera gear you talk about that drone that had the brand new models coming out now you're just sitting there collecting dust\nBut there are thousands and thousands of others that are on our weightlifting Perry here or a part of our club that was left to access that\nSo why not make money out and it's something that you've already park is that the opportunity that are giving to contributors that want to contribute to the economy\nSo I can then Cole through all my gear that is perfectly good a good example is I was trying to explain my next guest right to one of my matter of fact a guy in the office next door he comes over he goes what do you do and I go I'm going to be interviewed some people they got this thing it's likely that I don't even ... and he's like what what what is that\nI'm OK here's a good example I bought thirty thousand bucks worth a camera gear on a three year lease and I pay twelve hundred dollars a month\nI've used it a total of six times okay okay now I don't mean to laugh I don't know I Know I could pay Ninety nine dollars a month or whatever your fears let's just call it Ninety nine dollars a month\nAnd I could have used it six times what it costs me you know and look let's just say it would have cost me twelve hundred dollars for that entire year instead of\nWhat is it twelve twenty four I lots of money 'cause I'm paying twelve hundred dollars a month so I Am much smarter to join the parachute access marketplace\nAnd only get it when I Need it instead of being Mr hoard mice or like I Am 'cause oh by the way exactly three years before that I bought the same exact year only the three year older version or newer version and so I have two sets of the same crap sitting there that I use like you know four times a year\nWhat an idiot I hear your Silvio out\nThere are two things that are happening but from the consumer side the consumers that are younger they're saying I don't want to own all the crap that I see my parents and grandparents being bound abide by can't leave town without having to worry about work store the boat or whatever it is right so they they want to experience like right and\nWe're not talking about lazy kids but I'm not a kid who actually have real jobs make good money
