there are a lot of kids by the way and the magic of the Taliban is the children as it always is there are children in the caravan and that it's kind of like the baby on board science I always hated

is Phil Mudd former intelligence official US government now CNN commentator\nBut who who is it that would think if you're on the left to think this massive caravan arriving in the United states at our border close to the election who thinks this is going to help Democrats how what helped Democrats [noise]\n\nIt's not just Trump separating him as Trump not letting them in [noise]\nI go there has to be what it is these people actually are figuring that a massive ... they don't understand that this kind of thing is why Donald Trump was elected\nDonald Trump was elected to stop this kind of thing to stop this invasion and that's what this is this is an organized bought and paid for invasion\nAnd into growing so obviously the plan is for this group of people including the children to arrive here\nAre very close to the election and for Trump to thick ice on them and the border patrol on them and to deny them an entry or\n... separate the children from the adult so that's a drive\nBy media can then kick into gear with stories that are already written that are all ready taped interviews with people on the caravan already in the can wherever these people will say they're shocked they came

end up making the United states look bad\n[noise]\nUh I'm not ... that's the way these people are figuring it going to play out now we have the Mueller report\nThat I\nWill not be released before the election but we're being told that\nIt is nearing completion and then it is ready to go\nI went through yesterday what the what the hope here is uh the hope here is to revive the Trump colluded with Russia narrative and to make people think that we're just days or weeks away from proof being released\nWhether we can't do it before the election because of regulations and this is something we're not going to influence the outcome\nOf elections but Muller is ready to go at once in a while I've been doing well Mueller has been looking for evidence of Trump colluded with Russia so mothers ready to go Mahler must have found the but this is what they want everybody to think [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nAbout the fact of the matter is it's probably the exact opposite I'll let me find the statistically find these sounds I hear that puts this in perspective hang on one look at is it won't take long hair folks I as I say I'm having a compressed everything here it is not pretend audio soundbite number tens\nAnd this is this is deep state ranking member Phil Mudd he is a former intelligence official now works as a commentator on CNN last night Wolf Blitzer show the situation room\n[noise] he's a counterterrorism center specials what he is and Bush said do you think that Muller is preparing new indictments\nThe really interesting part of this is a potential report a draft report a narrative if you will from other going over Rosenstein let me play this out and watch him Rosenstein gets the narrative that says not only\nThis is what we found that my violate the law this is my picture of what happened during the investigation there's going to be some dirt in there so in addition to the indictment I really want to see what's in that narrative report\nPay so this\nIs where this is going to Mullen report is going to be full of supposedly horrible stuff\nTrump is none none of which is probably going to be indicted all none of which is going to be impeachable although if the Democrats win the house they're gonna make moves in that direction anyway um but he says the important point of the smaller report will be the\nDirt dirt not indict which [noise]\nThere's nothing left they make it up there never has been any Trump collusion and they're never has been the evidence or less they make it up\nSo the smart money is that it's going to be filled with things that are accusatory that\nBlamed Trump's incompetence ineptitude essentially blame Trump for being so in over his head that it looked like the Russians have worked with him to steal the election despite the fact that there is any hard evidence\nIt's hard to refute the idea of going to make it look like Trump is in over his head doesn't know what he's doing threatens the country with his presidency because of his incompetence\nThat's what it's going to be but let's take a look at an alternative view from Sydney Powell\nWho is work we have referenced many times\nOn this
