know for a bunch of people that are brimming with confidence over the fact they're going to be running the world in three weeks\nI'm finding a lot of evidence of insecurity for example I have a story here what is this is in the hill dot com and it's a column by somebody named Brent Butowsky\nWho sounds like the captain of a bowling team\n... says he thinks this guy was a legislative aide who who do\nYou think this guy worked for the lord benefit a former senator in Texas I knew Jack Kennedy Kennedy was a friend of mine and you quail you're no Jack Kennedy that lord Benson right okay

charge for all hands on deck at a critical moment for America and democracy\nIn my view writes Butowsky there is a twenty five percent chance are Democrats and the mid term as well the nightmare scenario what twenty five percent chance of a nightmare wife what you guys had it all locked up [laughter] I thought you're\nPretty much have the house already done although she's already talking about being speaker you guys are already planning to impeach investigate cabin on and then Trump or verse myself\n[laughter] now there is a twenty five percent chance [noise] that\nAnd the midterms in a nightmare\nIn their private selves when they talk to each other in private and not even they\nReally believe it [noise]\nThey want you to think they do they want you to be this theory of hand or depressed [noise]\nThey are very alarmed in fact that the latest polls that show that Kavanaugh effect on the Republican side is ...\nNing up turnout ... up interests [noise] and they're really ... [noise] and ticked off\nAt a bunch of polling data there is an NPR poll out there there's a Fox News poll a couple of others but show some bourbon Republican women are saying in polling data that\nThey have ... new interest and increased energy and intense desire to go vote this is not what we're supposed\nTo happen that's why all these attacks lately in leftist media ripping in two white\nConservative suburban women and do we need them or not and we don't they say\nSo this is not as we sit here today this is not developing as they want you to think it is\n\nBack in two thousand sixteens you remember any pieces\nBefore the presidential race anywhere in democratic media warning people hey hey you know what there is a nightmare scenario here were trumped up when you got to dial it back we got to be very careful you remember any of that\nThere was none they were ... they were definitely of of uh convinced that they weren't going to win every Hillary was going to win and the biggest landslide\n\nI mean they had Trump's chances at three percent seven percent ten percent but nobody gave Trump a chance in fact some of the news even said Trump never thought he was going to win Trump never even wanted to win Trump was the most surprised guy in a lecture in the world when he won he didn't want to win and they were all depressed Trump quarters that's what they wanted you to believe\n\nNow they've started out saying the same thing has no power is a birthright that every American realizes that Democrats have to be put back in power\nEvery American realizes the mistake of voted for Trump every Trump voter can't wait to apologize every Trump voter realizes embarrassed wants to fix the mistake can't wait to vote for the next democratic on their ballot\n[noise] now all of a sudden it's not just Butowsky by the way either there are others\nWho are raising red flags out there that this might not be developing as they wish\nAlso from Fox News the homeland security secretary Kirstjen Nielsen\nSaid yesterday that the ... are engaged in an unprecedented influence campaign leading up to them in terms this is the Trump administration's latest warning that the ... or attempting to sway American opinion I handled the elections\nOf ... wants to win [noise]\nTry comes want the Democrats to win ... why do you think that is why why would a bunch of international communist dictators want the Democrat Party to win and they're trying to come to not our friends have tried calms want American leadership they can easily manipulate\nAnd triumph over the ... I don't want any part of the Trump Donald Trump\nThis this new trade deal getting rid of NAFTA you know what this was done [noise] this has\nPut China back on its heels like nobody fought Donald Trump the United states now controls access to Mexico and uh all of North America United States and Canada\nYou've got to go through us you gotta make deals with us if you want to export you're going into Mexico Canada United States because Trump put together this new deal getting rid of NAFTA made the new deal the ... never thought this was going to happen\n[noise] they don't want Trump they don't want any more if Trump they would be eager for whoever the Democrats split up\nLast night President Trump had a sort of ceremony for justice cabin on the White House he apologized somebody happy American people from the immense amount of pain and harm that he said the judge had been put through\nWhat do you make about Hillary and what message including the president's mocking of Christie ... Ford for her at like ... what message does that send to women\nAnd remember women went for President Trump in two thousand sixteen Hillary said white women did I'm In port yes that's right white women I forgot white women we don't like white women right Hillary that's right we don't even though I Am one\nWhite women all white women or women went for me\nWhite women went for Trump and look white women have been voting against democratic presidential candidates for decades now\nThe white vote has only then won twice that of last sixty years my husband being one of the two Lyndon Johnson being this was not a surprise it's a disappointment that white women vote Republican and not for me but it is what it is [noise]\nAnd they're in Hillary Clinton stumbled and the swerved in to a truth\n[laughter] except\nA very exceptional election Europe Nineteen sixty four which was following the JFK assassination\nThe Democrats have not gotten more than fifty percent of the white vote in the presidential election since Nineteen thirty two\nNow when you look at it that way you couldn't understand why in the Democratic party circle there's hatred for white people white people white women had been rejecting them white married suburban women have been rejecting them this is why the kind of Nazi movement sprang up this is why [noise]\n[noise] ... the left as as it started contacting all different categories for non white suburban women to be plugged\nInto so that they can then be said to be democratic constituents [noise] [noise]\nThis and by the way this is again why in Nineteen sixty five Ted Kennedy and the Democrats re opened the floodgates to immigration I Need to remind everybody again from about Nineteen Twenty one of the Nineteen twenty three if you're Nineteen sixty five we shut down immigration I not to zero\n[noise] but we put very strict limits on it and the reason\nWas to be able to assimilate all of the immigrants that come into the country the late Eighteen hundreds through the Nineteen early twenties\nAssimilation was key to American immigration policy [noise]\nArriving immigrants all wanted to be citizens by the way and there were things they had to do to become citizens they had to learn a language and they had to learn the history of America they had to be able to pass questions about the history of America\nOn a test and they had to swear and plan their loyalty and devotion to the United states and they were eager to do it and they were happy to do it now they they maintain their ethnicity [noise]\n... the Irish the Italians unit but they wanted to become Americans [noise] [noise] and they did and it took a number of years to assimilate them all\nWell [noise]\nNineteen sixty five is when Ted Kennedy who led the charge to reopen the immigration floodgates which then of course went to once that happened illegal immigration ramped up in an uncontrollable way\nAnd that wave of immigrants starting in Nineteen sixty five came from third world socialist countries the Democrats\nRealized they could only when the White House if they changed the population of America they were losing\nPresidential elections with the Native American population because they were losing [noise]\nWhite women and Mrs Clinton just admitted in here to Christian I'm On four of CNN [noise] it never occurred to them to change their policies what they had to do in order to attract white voters what they had to do\nWas change America so back to Hillary she said what was done last night and the White House meeting Trump apologizing for the nation to Kavanaugh [noise]\nWhat was done in the White House last night she said was a political rally it further undermine the image and integrity of the court and that troubles me greatly Christiana an for it saddens me because our judicial system has been viewed as one of the main pillars of our constitution looking\nAt the judicial system has been viewed by you as he lectured insurance the judicial system has been viewed by you and Mrs Clinton the rest of the Democrats as your private refuge\n[noise] you have looked at the court as a place you can stock like minded the leftist activists [noise]\nTo make sure things that you believe in which never could pass legislation somehow become law in America that's why they want the courts\n[noise] if you want to really get frustrated you heard me say this and you probably heard a lot of other people\nBut stop and think about this [noise] outside of Obamacare practically every liberal the steak\nEvery liberal idea and belief that now is the law in this country would not have become law in Congress because it never would have passed a liberalism and the Democratic party's ideas have never been mass popular the only way\nThat we have bastard ice pop culture of the laws of the reality today is because Democrats activists judges have been essentially writing law when they take cases and interpret them and then pronounce\nDecisions roe versus Wade is the most early example of this [noise]\nBut there are countless others the simple fact of the matter is the Democratic party has never been capable of winning\nLegislation to implement the ideas they believe in because most of the American people when they know what's at stake don't want them\nThat's the value of judges and that's the value of courts to the Democrats when Mrs Clinton says [noise] ... what happened in the White House the other night saddens her [noise]\nBecause our judicial system has been viewed as one of the main pillars of our constitutional ...\n... ... s not by you [noise]\nIn fact to Hillary Clinton and people like are the Constitution's an obstacle is well it's certainly not something to revere\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n... did you see any way even a conservative Steve college so I was speaking to yesterday said the only way to repair America is to try to get back to some civility to try to make it that even if we had political disagreements we're not going to go to war with each other we're not going to destroy each other\nHillary Clinton well certainly I Would love to see us returned disability crusty on um an for listening to one another working on our differences but\nThat is not the Republican Party that exist today that is certainly not the administration that we haven't power right now when the Republican Senate denied the right of President Obama to have his nominee for the Supreme Court merit guard and here we go off to the races again missed characterizing that\nBlue in the face\nThat's a Joe Biden rule the Democrats invented that rule that presidents don't get the name Supreme Court justices\nDuring vacancies that happened in the last year of their term that's a Democrat inspired instituted rule and she knows it [noise]\nBut the Republicans didn't destroy Merrick Garland the Democrats didn't have to fight battles defending his character and his life because the Republicans were not trying to destroy them as they did Kavanaugh\nAnyway the upshot of this is [noise] that Hillary Clinton says it's if it's a time for instability it is it time for this kind of extremism because that's what we're up against Steve skill lease [noise] who was shot by one of the believers of Hillary Clinton at that Republican baseball practice\n\nCannot believe that Bill Cassidy [noise] senator from Louisiana responded to Hillary at a time when the Republicans are being shot stabbed docks beaten\n[noise] run out of restaurants and sent death threats Hillary Clinton or just Democrats to be even more uncivil [noise]\nWhat an irresponsible statement every Democrats should announce they're not going to denounce or they privately publicly encourage or they applauded they supported that is who they are\n[noise]\nThis is the party by the way that has been railing against all this instability\n[noise] I don't know how long this is why I [noise]\nI look at average American voters paying attention to this and I don't understand how any of them can want to side with what the Democratic Party is doing or how they're doing it\n[noise] I Know what happens but it's it's uh\nMystery to me my hope is my faith is that this incivility this insanity this on the ... democratic behavior is negatively impacting the Democrats that the Kavanaugh effect [noise]\nIt was the most powerful storm on record diminished the roughly two hundred mile stretch of fishing towns military bases and spring break beaches in the Florida Panhandle\nMost of western North Carolina as it or
