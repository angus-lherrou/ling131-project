overstated\n[laughter] no I mean like [laughter] yeah you find yourself\nBeing more emotional than you normally whatever your norm is you find yourself to a little bit more edgy\nAnd the reason why you have this question your heart and that is why am I on the face of this club and what am I supposed to do here now next that will make the best impact it's important because this is the number one time I'm In a woman's life when she's statistically most vulnerable to an affair\nAnd I'm like what and the fair like how am I supposed to work another sport person into my life I'm already busy

know what is my value right now and why am I here\nAnd what's my unique contribution that's what's on the heartbeat of that woman in that midlife evaluation time wise woman instead of drifting off and making emotional connection that will undermine her whole life wise woman grabbed her busy has been by the house and say I love us too much to drift apart\nHey let set some date nights I Need you for

the need to be two people yeah it's a stressful for it is it's impossible to achieve but the demand for being to people or three people is always there let me ask you to respond to a listener who wrote into focus\nAnd I think as a very specific question that puts this into context\nOr she wrote to us and said I feel like I made a mistake by marrying the man I did were not the same people we were when we got married we want different things have different morals and values\nAnd disagree on how to raise our kids are we ever do any more is fight am I supposed to continue in this miserable relationship\nUm what would you say to her what is her hope\nBut first of all I Would say to her\nEvery relationship is one breakthrough away from being a great relationship ... and when things get out of kilter things get us out of sync\nPeople start to think oh it's a tragedy it's never going to turn we disagree on everything and it starts this downward spiral that begin starts to feed on itself ... and so now everything is evidence that this is a bad relationship\nAnd in reality all it takes in marriages one decision can turn everything because obviously this couple used to be in sync and they they loved each other and they had the agreements that they were moving forward on and now probably my guess is the stress of life has pushed them to a different place\nThis focus on the

experiences\nOr it just goes to shows not every\nMarriage is perfect I don't think there is a perfect marriage or you may have a really good marriage but I don't know that it's perfect if it is called us let us know perfect marriage or many couples indeed I think all couples need a boost from time to time\nTo allow them to get back on a healthier path and that's why I focused on the family is here it's why we do what we do a for instance we recently received a comment from a listener to show how your investment is taking root and the hearts of people\nAre this woman is from Virginia here's what she said about one year ago I heard your guest speak about the harmful nature of sexual relationships outside of marriage\nI was actually having an affair at that very time and the lord use the words on your broadcast to convict me high immediately end of the affair and amazingly\nHuh the lord worked on my husband's separately we have now been fully restored in our marriage sank you focus and let me say thank you\nFor allowing that to happen and making it happened and she continued I listen to your program every day and continue to learn so much\nA John that's it that's putting it all together that's keeping it all together and I want to say thank you are to those of you who contribute to this ministry and if you haven't in a in a while\nPlease consider doing that we are not touching lies

eight hundred the letter a and the word family eight hundred to three to six four five nine\nA bill in ... been sitting patiently you are authors and speakers in fact we're going to be diving into one

so much is from the stories of others\nAnd there's also practical tips to help keep your marriage driving unhealthy so welcome back to focus on the family\nSo it's good to be with you because we know every couple of has to make decisions because their life's changing\nOur great decision is being ...\nYou know we spoke last time about transitions ah in life and particularly midlife those crises that we hit in our marriage uh we did concentrate on the women's side of the equation ah what's it like for men what are they going through I Know they go through those changes as well or what are they experiencing\nBy for many usually happens late forties early fifties and I think it's a combination of factors I'm the first thing is ... men did experience a lot of change in their life\nLike women don't have an option they're legit changing all the time because it's got designed them among some in life will stay pretty static you know ... stresses and their demands but our bodies kind of stay the same and our schedules often kind of stay the same and we we kind of get used to dealing with life as it is\nAnd then suddenly we hit our forties early fifties and things start to change and we're not used to it\nI'm often things will change physically\nYou know prior to that men men just rely on their strength\nLike it's great having testosterone run through your body 'cause every cell your body feel strong and you know you fucking pull males your fingernails and you you you just have a strong approach to life and then suddenly somewhere in your forties or fifties you come to the realization that this isn't going to last forever ... the\nThe big thing though I think that happens is that ... mid life for many it's a transition in life from being highly productive to being influential\nAnd because our bodies start to deteriorate we can't work at the level we got we were used to get our thirties and forties we can work we can just get after we get intense we get focused and now suddenly we can't rely on that like we used to but we have more wisdom to share\nAnd being influential is more responsible than being productive because now people rely on us people want to know what we have to say people want to hear advice and they're watching our example and so men have to decide do I really want to rise to that level\nAnd that decision do I want to rise to that level is traumatic for a lot of men that why so is it the fear that they will fail yes because they haven't been thinking of a role model I I Want other people to benefit from the way I live I Want people to watch my life and make decisions based on what they see in me\nThe most Mitt haven't prepared themselves for that moment and suddenly it starts to happen\nAnd now the grand kids start asking grandpa what would you do in ... start asking if you've been at this for a while and what what would you do with this situation and suddenly now the stakes are higher\nAnd men who are prepared for it to see it as a great opportunity and like that's why for some and they talked about his midlife transition to lead people to the greatest times of their life because the harness the wisdom and the hardest their influence and they're seeing their influence go forward and they love it\nLet me transition a little bit let me ask you this question a it's a more common question today and this went to from a listener who wrote us and set in my household my husband is a stay at home parent\nAnd I work full time outside the home let me pause there for ... say that's great that they made that decision that when parents should be home with the kids I think that fundamentally\nIs the right decision or who's going to go out and you know vocational only do it we have traditionalist which I Am on I tend to believe more in the mail or all the female role but I get the fact that they were more women are graduated from college and graduate programs today they are active I just ...\nFact that there was to have one parent at home she goes on to say do you have any advice on how we can make this successful in our family situation so reverse throws a little bit of moms out working dads at home\nOr how do they make that work in a godly way and honor the lord and do family well in that scenario\nWhere we're from the area of the country that they just kind of calm and uh we live in California and so um many things are common\n[laughter] again in this case it's the same principle that applies\nThose men band together that are a stay at home dads they get together encourage each other they look for mentor men who've gone through transitions even in our own church windows is senior pastor I'm his assistant had a health crisis\nAnd that put him on disability at a very young age and I'm at his wife was the primary bread earner but he chose to get retrained so he could shepherd\nI'm In the church but yet be the dad at home and I'm so we had\nBoth role models in our church we had bill and being the typical traditional laws and then the other pastor um who just because of his health had to make other choices but both families the kid's flourished that's the main point and that's the goal and that's the goal and\nEvery situation we only mentors and even more so when it's something unusual might need somebody else who has gone through this and I'm One of the things that we talk about a mentoring is you know sit down together and say who\nHas the kind of marriage we want to have who has the kind of family we want to have\nWho has a kind of influence and ministry or in business that we want to have let's go talk to those people be pro active\nVillain I approached and Jill Briscoe and um when I was a young passers light because at the time Stewart and Jill where like the only people we knew who were posturing writing\nAn out speaking and they spoke together and separately and that is likely villain I did and when I approached Phil and I said you know\nIt's kind of unusual inching ever play back as yet we've always been the example of the unusual and that's okay that's okay go find somebody who has the kind of life that you're trying to build now\nSpeaking of we've got mothers of preschoolers mobs of course in lots of young moms know that the unfortunate thing if somebody starts dad's a preschool wrestler do [laughter]\n'cause your words says in near my eight ten that the joy of the lord has our strength and this family needs strength right now so I chose you Jesus I Choose joy and some of my friends would say Pam how you doing and I decided to answer them what\nShe's enjoy and um it was amazing\nThat it caught on and my friendship circuits are Jews enjoyed Jews enjoy I enjoy I began to pray jump forty two bills life that God will give bill more life second happen even in the first ... sometimes about three years for when the Titanic it's hit for the ship to ride itself\nAnd during those three years we just kept\nPraying and we've printed out all the risks about God's Favorite ... and we just began to pray those over our family and over our future\nAnd it's amazing when you start to choose joy and choose Jesus and look for the blessing every day went on a God hunt who got posted notice God's goodness who got a postcard of God's goodness\nThe family started to see the goodness of God return to our life and all the kids got scholarships bills health returned we get a double the opportunity have and focus on the family called this during that time to have a heavy on the\n... to ask the question because that is a great outcome some people listening or still traveling the road and praying that have been trying to choose your but they haven't had that kind of outcome what do you sort of a person\nGive got time to be good [noise] um my son ... during that season said this assessment seems fair this isn't seem right there is some decisions that were made towards dad and his health issues and it just seemed like he he was living in job's life and my son said just doesn't seem fair\nAnd I said let's skip that time to be good because God is good even when people are outdated God is good even when circumstances are not good God is that even when I Am not good God is good\nIt's let's focus on the goodness of God and let's give got time to be good\nAnd that's what I Would encourage couples that feel like they're right in the middle of the storm hold each other tonight and say I believe that God longs to be good to us\nThat is scripture um guide longs to be good at sin is very nature and we just sometimes getting impatient in this media driven instant gratification world\nUm we want the instant and take away the Spain and God wants to give us character and carry us through the pain so we will be better and closer and more intimate at the end of the tunnel\n... you let me ask a or drink a bold question is it ever too late for a couple I mean someone ... is upset they're angry or they just can't see another day with her husband is it too late\nI I Would say to sometimes it feels like it's too late and rarely you'd never use because marriage is a reflection of the gospel of Jesus Christ and the way the gospel works is in a moment of time so we can go for being lost to being from somebody can go from being the enemy to being adopted\nChild of God and it can happen in a moment what does it hurt in the human heart ... or no God can work those miracles but what's more rural responsibilities sometimes\nWe can only do on our side of the equation we can't control the other person we can only control our attitude toward that person and our character and who we're going to become\nLike we don't want to live there are spouses making decisions that are unhealthy built it encourages them to get off the crazy train like don't let their bad choices pull you dance reside\n'cause there is a special intimacy for people who are in pain for Jesus was rejected by the people who cared about and the most Jesus had to stand alone at the most important time in his life and when everybody was against him he bought salvation for us\nAnd so when people are struggling and pain when they feel like they're rejected by the people that love him the most there's a special intimacy with Jesus that he gives that that moment if we're willing to receive and that softens our hearts and went our hurts your soft\nGot turns his attention on the people were praying for rather than putting the attention of I was trying to correct the U.S [noise]\nAnd so if people will say that I don't know how this is going to work out I don't know how you're going to turn this but I'm going to cling to you and I'm asking you to give me that special place\nTo see that you give to those that are hurting because I'm hurting right now and would you somehow some way turn the heart of my spouse that this thing can be recovered\nAnd let me be that's love live like no matter what the people around me are cheating me reflect your character because there's no downside to becoming more loving person\nHe loves the expression effects toward him yes\nIt doesn't it it it's like he longs for that when he sees that\nHe moves yeah any every by what does the eyes of the lord rent to and fro throughout the year that he may strongly support those who are just completely is thinking of that yeah it's it's not a passive thing it's not like oh no I got to help that person\nIt's a good looking for the longest for that long to do it show me that type of faith and I am there for you yeah and we think it's up to\nThat I say the right thing to do the right thing be the right person that suddenly magically it's all going to turn in reality the kind of problems that we\nSee people get into sometimes the only answer is turning our\nAnd there's no substitute for the Holy Spirit doing it and what are the most common commands in the Bible is wait on them or\nWith none of us like to do that good at moments like this we said jeeze I'm going to cling to you and I'm going to wait for you to do so [noise]\nIt's a hard place for us to go\nBut it's the place that Jesus like you said longs for us to be because if he\nDoesn't know you can do and that's why some families have a tragic story of what didn't work out and other families have the story of a mere ... place\nBecause God got involved and the people who were trusting God to do something\nJust clung to him and said I don't know how to fix this but I'm trusting you\nAnd we'll bring this conversation to a close that's bill and Pam feral a focus on the family and they are so encouraging\nThey have such a solid insights about navigating the challenges that come up in marriage and that's one reason we keep bringing them back to focus on the family
