this morning made an arrest of a man at a Florida business\nOr this is an investigation that is that is not yet over there is a lot you have to learn they want to make sure that this person doesn't have any co conspirators is or perhaps someone else who might have been involved in this so you know this is the arrest is sort of like the new beginning of the next phase of this investigation it doesn't really ended\nThe suspects with a ... Dennis ... is a Florida Man sees her say aren't junior\nThe eleventh and twelfth suspicious packages were discovered late last night in this morning once at the former intelligence director Clapper at CNN the other set a New Jersey senator Booker was intercepted at a postal facilities in Florida\nUh income information pending what is this site [noise] can't tell what this site is ... ... it's um [noise]\nIdentifies it as a member of the Green Party a yeah he's got pictures of Trump and he's a GOP stickers all over the uh the window so law enforcement has a press conference slated for two thirty\nThis afternoon they don't know if any more pipe bombs out there or if he has sent everything that he had the latest to recipients by the way our Cory Booker\nThe New Jersey senator and the former director of national intelligence James Clapper\nWorthy recipients that I also saw Fox News is reporting that law enforcement is telling them\nThat some of these bombs none of them have gone off but some of them have been detonated because they were judged to be so unstable that they couldn't even transport them to a Quantico, Virginia FBI lab\nTo study them they had to go ahead and detonate of a blow 'em up because they might have blown up in transit although none of them have gone off none of them if they were ever intended to then there's still a lot that\nIsn't known here and a lot of people are rushing in trying to fill in blanks and this is typical during events like this ... everybody becomes a journalist and everybody wants to have the first\nNews on every everybody wants to be the first to learn something the first to pass it on\nAnd on to law enforcement says what they're going to say about this at all is a speculation our law enforcement's undoubtedly going to be leaking between now and two thirty to various members of the media that they light trust or what have you\nSo there's going to be a daily use of information of what happens during these periods is that the first thing people here is what they ended up tending to\nBelieve the first thing they hear the first thing they see is that it makes the first impression\nAnd that is why during this whole week some of the some people have been concerned that the media without waiting just went ahead and signed this guy as a pro Trump anti democratic guy\nIdentifying the people as Trump targets they make America Again a great again bomber the mad go bomber\nBecause it creates first impressions it it created this worldwide presumption that the bomber was an angry Trump supporter set up at the people Trump is that this is this is the uh\nThe narrative if you will drive buys attempted to establish before anybody knew anything because everybody knows first impressions are\nWhat matters\nThat same thing is happening today with the economic news we ever GDP report today the growth was three and a half percent but that's below what was expected\nAnd so the drive by reporting that economic activity has slowed down it's not nearly what people thought it would be trying to create that first impression\nAmong the people in their audiences that there's something wrong with the economy\nThere's nothing wrong with three point five percent growth the reason why the economic growth\nIs it didn't come into the into predicting three point eight to four percent is guess what the tech stock sector is taking a bath specifically Google also notice alphabet and Amazon have reported earnings and every and they're they're stunningly\nDisappointing and it's causing sell\nOff it's causing a big problem on the NASDAQ which is where many of the tech stocks report where they listed in and saw the same thing is happening now and with intensity because we are now at a period of time or less than two weeks before the midterm elections and\nWhat better time for the drive by us to report that the economy is slowing down [noise]\nEven though it's trying to get a ride along jobs are still being created everything's my three and a half percent growth nobody ever saw that in the last eight years of Iraq Obama we didn't see that much before Obama wins and very often this economy still chugging right along with the Dr wiser reporting today\nThat it has a slowing down there could be trouble on the horizon and then there is this\nFrom the media right the headline\nTrump unfortunate the bombs stuff is slowing Republican momentum going into the midterms\n... nobody talks about this yesterday this was a I bought a left wing media narrative that had been created\nBut apparently Trump has signed onto what President Trump today complained about the pipe bombs being sent a prominent Democrats lamenting the scare has distracted\nFrom news about the midterms and even Sloan Republican momentum had\nRepublicans are doing so well in early voting ended the polls and now there's bombs stuff happens in the momentum\nGreatly slows news is not talking politics very unfortunate what's going on Republicans to go out and vote that's his tweet\nI did my own little informal survey and I asked people if they've seen any signs of slow down or loss of momentum or all that and then nobody nobody has\nYou make this is I sadly I Wish you weren't the case I think Trump is half right here I think it is a reflection of what's in the news\nAnd what is it\nAnd if there isn't any news about the Republican early voting dwarfing Democrats than the perception is that it isn't happening or none of this stopped\nOr it's not\nNewsworthy enough anymore so the bomb thing has come along I mean it dwarfs the caravan that news stopped being reported but more and more importantly all of the news about the\nHeavy Republican turnout dwarfing the Democrats late Republicans pulling ... I've got a pool here today from strategic good strategic strategic\nIn the poll Ron ... than the U.S has pulled ahead of Andrew Gillum by a point it's a respectable poll it's a big deal [noise]\nAnd so the ... this is the kind of news that is not being widely reported and therefore people in Florida are not being told\nThis and it's one of these I'm sad reality is that the daily reporting the news does affect what people think their perceptions\nOf ah of what's going on and I think that's what Trump is ah is talking about here complains that bombs have slowed Republican momentum\nUm\nIn fact here's another as I say it's a media story I don't know who wrote this but listen to the next paragraph Trump's tweet while somewhat nonsensical\nSuggests the president might be falling from a false flag theory being pushed on Fox News this week that the bombs or a Democrat operation to get out the vote for the midterms\nHis tweet comes moments after police intercepted two more devices sent to Cory Booker and James Clapper would Trump's tweet well someone nonsensical\nReally help to know who wrote this suggests the president might be falling for the false flag theory being pushed on Fox News the bombs or a Democrat operation to get out the vote\n\nIf the bombs or a false flag operation they're designed to to to to cover up any news or anything good maybe have favorable the Republicans at Trump for being reported\n\nIt's a false flag operation it'd be designed to to um it'll make it make it appear like the Democrats are\nBehind it it will just have to let time unfold on this is a little frustrating to try to get all this information coming in and not be able to share it with you because I Can't confirm it myself\nAnd I don't want to be out on a limb so we're just
