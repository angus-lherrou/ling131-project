your over the edge with this stuff to make sure you go vote it's again a class\nThe expression or illustration of how they haven't the slightest idea who the people are voting for Donald Trump who

you every day and I'm telling you it's going to be a red white but I said I Hope you're right but\nLet me let me tell you what we're up against forty five Republicans have announced their resignations forty five I mean that is a huge number many of them are\nCommittee chairmen not all but many other committee chairman and they are resigning are retiring because they don't want to go back to being chunks you know just regular house members it's a it's a big come down so they want to try to parlay their years in\nThe house into private sector success I spent forty five seats incumbency has has incredible power\nReelection power certainly old back me up on those these are students the incumbent in house races windows Ninety eight percent of the time well we've got forty five Republicans who are not incumbents we've got forty five Republicans will never run before\nNobody knows\nI mean their districts they're known but they're not as known as incumbents\nAre known as well known so that that makes some of this somewhat iffy I and and then there is the traditional statistical aspect which says that the party\nThat holds the White House in the first midterms after a presidential election all ways loses seats\nSo forty five seats they caved and tough to defend\nAs opposed to if those forty five had not resign and we're still in the house you can count on a lot of those is reelect that you can't count now Israel legs and this is what the left in the dry buys are counting on\nIs that many of those forty five of flip\nAnd then\nYou've got a contest of all races are in in other parts Senate of course another thing now\nI mentioned this to all of these people they didn't care and they said they're aware of this they knew about the resigned resigning members of Congress retiring they ... they didn't know the number of them did\nBut their attitude was that it doesn't matter it doesn't matter uh\nThe American people are fed up and they are sophisticated and the people who are elected Trump and know exactly what's at stake they're not gonna sit home they're not going to do with all their thumbs they're not confident they're not sitting there thinking the job was done when they went and voted in two thousand sixty and it was kind of pleasant to um\nTo what the here although there was a lot of emotion that I'm like I Can't deny that night interestingly I ran across a piece today at a website called America dot com and it's by Dr Gerard Francisco slum arrow expert on the forecast models\nI'm I'm not familiar with his work by his headline is ran wave coming in the house and the Senate\n\nMy forecast for the twenty H in congressional elections he says there will be a conservative red wave in the house with two hundred and twenty five a two hundred and twenty eight Republicans elected\nTo office and in the Senate with fifty eight to sixty Republicans elected to office let's look at some of the reasons that went into my forecast Dr Lynn Merrill rights\n\nAs you remember from my book great news for [laughter]\nWhen my mother my great book grading the presidential election of two thousand sixteen was both an historic and critical election that ushered in a new American constitutional era that I called the conservative there a long range trans as well as short range trends came together to cause a fundamental shift\nIn ah in each of our two major political parties in addition the other major changes took places well those were predicted unexplained uh in addition to lower Democrat voter intensity\nAmong democratic voters Democrats have another major problem there are movements of democratic voters that are abandoning their party and voting for conservatives\n\nAnd it's all being ignored he says by the drive by immediate these free movements of democratic voters abandoning their party are the walk away movement the red pill movement\nAnd the great awakening movement\nAnd he goes on to describe what these what these are I've I'm no I'm unfamiliar with the red peel\nA movement but\nHe says he's got eight productions here that'll happen in the near future and they appear to be happening as we approach the mid term elections\nWe've witnessed a series of fall surprises including the capital hearings October surprises caravan of crisis mail bombs to some Democrats synagogue mass shooting we've seen outstanding economy tempered by considerable volatility a Wall Street\nWe have seen extreme by it but that's another thing you know what the consumer confidence numbers are over the top\n\nConference board consumer confidence numbers over the top these numbers are not the kind of numbers you see in the ... electorate thats unhappy and angry and looking for radical change\nAt least that has been the case or in\nIn the past question comes down to just how important a factor is\n\nThe economy in elections of um candidates in this in this climate or the drive buys would like you to believe the economy doesn't matter hill of beans but they always say that when the economy is going great with Republican\nAdministrations\nThe effort to give credit to Obama the attempt by Obama to take credit for the economy however would argue that Democrats in the media think it is a problem\nThere's talk all over Twitter that Hollywood leftist are promising blood in the streets if Democrats do not win the house\n\nAnyway back to our production here from this doctor Dr Gerard Francisco alum arrow what has been the impact of these falls surprises and the other events this is his personal thinking and again these these events these falls surprises\nHe calls them we call them October surprises that Kavanaugh hearings that was that we know what that was the I mean that was totally trumped up made up charges to derail Trump's Supreme Court nominee along the way it toward the railing Trump\nOr we have the October surprises the usually the caravan of crisis mail bombs or some Democrats synagogue mass shooting what's what's been the impact of these balls and prizes and other events\nWhile intended to hurt President Trump and keep Republicans were holding the house\nAll of the above surprises and events have worked to enhance the conservative\nRed wave according to this guy instead of creating a building and blue wave with a red wave continues Republican voter intensity exceeds the much heralded\nBlue wave you by the way this is your what a blue wave would be what we need to properly defined blue wave would mean the Democrats win everything they take back the Senate they take back the house by a large number if the Democrats win the house by two or three seats for and it's not that's not a blue wave\nA blue wave means a massive massive realignment and it doesn't look possible they're gonna they're going to win the Senate they don't win the Senate there isn't any blue wave I'm Talking about unreality not in terms of media lingo they'll call it whatever they want\nEven

having the exact opposite impact on people I think the left and the drive by media continue to understand misunderstand who Democrats are Trump voters are why they are Trump voters and why they aren't\nGoing anywhere [noise] uh let's see if we were also here being being told that we need a new kinds of civility that the Trump\nPresidency and all of his supporters are promoting all this in ... and violence and so forth\nWhen it could be said that it's the exact opposite I ... I I think reasonable am harping on the fact people refused to accept election results it's profoundly indicative of who they are and it's\nA large explanation of why they're behaving as they as they do\nAnd it's ... refusal to accept is not just because Trump one it's not just because they hate Trump it's more than that it's because they lost they were fully expecting to win and they didn't until they simply refuse it because\nIt's not a matter of thinking it's a matter of feeling they don't feel happy don't feel good at when they feel bad then something's not right\nAnd that's also been part of the education system\n\nSo we'll get some headlines Tom ...

national ... society at room and he said that\n[noise]\n\nAnd back to the phones with all of this is Dan and Manchester, Connecticut welcome sir great to have you here\nThat get Russia I wanted to thank you for telling people about the truth intent of sexual on an amendment fourteen because I've been trying to do the same thing for years and people aren't in the midst impression that it simply means if a child born to illegal aliens in this country automatically becomes an American citizen\nYou can't blame them it's been the case since the sixties and it's it's it's um\nYeah ... ... it it it it's ... we're we're dealing with mass ill education that's taken place on a lot of things in this country and that's why it's so important that we've got a president willing to push back on it yet because what's cause this is causing any discussion of it this is how it happens\nI've told everybody that this is what pushing back is going to look like so\nWhile you were talking about Dred Scott as a reason why the fourteenth amendment was ratified which was actually on July night they deem sixty eight but\nAnother reason why it was ratified is because it goes back to the thirteenth amendment that abolish slavery well the southern states weren't going to accept that so they passed laws are codes that were so restrictive the blacks\nThat essentially made them slaves once again and they were called the black codes so then Congress said okay you want to play that game then we're going to formally recognized former slaves as citizens which will make them subject to all the privileges or immunities to the citizens in several states for article for section two claws one\nSo after that the ... were abolished and that's why we have a ... you know the fourteenth amendment\nAnd matter of fact you know the one of the ... the the guy is considered the founding father to the fourteenth amendment was represented by the name of John Bingham from Ohio and he made some remarks about the fourteenth amendment if you're a few years later and you can find that in a house report number twenty two dated Eighteen Seventy one January thirtieth\nSo it all explains how this joint committee passed the fourteenth amendment so President Trump with all due respect to him he wouldn't be not be ending birthright citizenship because it never happened he would be appalled in the U.S constitution\nWell that's the point that is exactly the point that I made is why he should\nDo this and that's his point people have looked into this\nMay have found different rationale than you did but the point is if you look at the original intent of people who are involved in writing the fourteenth amendment all Trump is doing is enforcing the constitution and taking it back to its original intent the fourteenth amendment was never intended\nTo confer citizenship on people here illegally or the sons and daughters of ambassadors are foreign agents\nIt was expressly\nWritten spoken first citizenship on slams and now it has been expanded and again that you can trace it back\nTo the Nineteen sixties when this began which coincides with the Democratic party wanting to re open immigration you know I still run into people who do not believe me when I tell them that as a nation we suspended for the most part I may never there's always been\nA people being granted citizenship but we suspended mass immigration\nFrom the mid Nineteen twenties to the mid sixties pretty express reason of allowing all of those who would emigrated starting in the late Eighteen hundreds all the way through the Nineteen twenties to assimilate\nThat's what immigration was\nBut we're coming here to become Americans and they wanted to be Americans\nThey didn't have to give up their birthright they didn't have to they they settled in uh in in neighborhoods\nIrish have their neighborhoods in New York and Philadelphia the Italians ... ditto but they wanted to become Americans they learned English uh and they became part of American culture of which there is a distinct and unique American culture which is rooted in western civilization\nThat's what's different now there is no interest in that we don't\nEven make a serious effort at assimilating we're Balkan icing if they use this term tribal but we're Balkan icing our population\nBecause modern arrivals don't all seek to become Americans people trying to get them on the on the legal immigration side of course are\nBut this this mass illegal immigration has an entirely different purpose behind it and political support is entirely different for it then for standard uh immigration so what Trump is doing is simply with his executive order if he does this\nWill be re establishing the constitution to re asserting it so yeah no you're exactly right about that so two calls to great points that the guy who from Pittsburgh who asked a question he lives there and he watches the news and he's been blamed\nFor the synagogue surely [noise]\nWe've got to tone it down and we are going to come together and we got to do this we've got to do that\nAnd if it's being set up that's being said in the media you know it's all aimed at Trump and his supporters appreciate the call again Southampton in New York build your next great to have you with us or Hi\nThank you Russian thanks for all that you do for us yesterday about ... with the ... um with regard to the fourteenth amendment why not take it to the Supreme Court or is that where this is going to end up eventually so that they can decide oh it'll be their language says it'll get there and we'll get there okay yeah\nIt'll it'll have to get there that no Senator Graham\nIs going to offer legislation that in the Senate ah look we're\nWay way far away from this we're just getting the conversation started here\nWhich has to happen there there there needs to be a pretty big re education\nOf the American population in general on the whole subject of immigration\nAnd so Trump and his roots of an executive order is good but there's the you know there's going to be a judge\nThat's going to bring it to a screeching halt everybody knows that I mean that'll happen within hours of Trump signing the executive order everybody involved you know is that is going to happen\nThat then begins the process and it probably will end up at the Supreme Court unless Congress does right legislation in dealing with a constitutional amendment\nThis is an immediate problem that's going to have to be dealt because if it's not they're just going to keep coming and it's ... we're not going to stop these caravans if we start implementing a tax free enterprise\nZones down in these nations where American companies going to relocate and hire them as they're instead of hiring them here\nIs that these people aren't capable hired anywhere yet\nBut I understand that if you want to talk of political theory and economic theory it makes\nSense in the world and otherwise you know quote unquote normal circumstances but this is a pure political movement here this caravan I look no wise or George Soros I think George Soros his name has become a like a bogeyman\nFor everything people mean far left wing radicals when they mentioned George Soros I don't know who's behind but somebody is and their purpose is to destabilize the United states\nThe purpose is not to improve life from these people\nThis caravan whoever's behind this is not really trying to do something for these people to make their lives\nBetter this is being done to invoke damage on the United states particularly Trump and to advance the political advantages and notions of a particular political party which wants to welcome these people in as dependent voters a\nJam in Madison, Virginia and great to have you with us You're next on the E R B network hide\n[noise] Ah yes fresh uh two years ago my husband and I adopted for Hispanics sisters\nWho were in foster care and we had had him for a couple

they had to and then they come back to Mexico left on my grandparents\nCame back I had two more went back and got him a long story short is that even today I had you know they were\nCame to as thanking Trump pushed the horrible and that is whether he would send them all back home and and you know now they love Trump and they think this has got to stop and he even said because I saw this in prison for twenty eight years\nWith his mother fled but Mexico not a person\nI'm for these people come here come the awful crimes against their own children\nAnd you know I just think everything Trump can do to stop that he's got to stop it because they come up and they have these babies and I have another situation I can tell you that way I Know our country has caught\nWhere they had a Fifteen year old girl at the border seven months pregnant and teen they let her across they sent the other sixteen teams with our back\nOn my stomach so I Can't say we don't have heart they do see a situation\nThey know need help but you know even Hispanic girls that thought Trump was horrible that he was don't send all these people that they realize now that he is doing what the country\nWell we'll take them you know whenever they realize it is a is is is fine with me of course it's it's um [noise] once you understand what's going on it's impossible to support\n[noise] it's it's just it's

think I'm telling you what to do I'm telling you how to vote I'm telling you want to go\nThat has been the criticism and what does that rooted in rooted in\nThe presumption ups superior intellect to people on the left and the belief that you are literal idiots\nWho cannot make up your mind on anything what they never understood and they made no effort to understand that and the fact that they make no effort to understand it or understand Trump and his voters is what's largely doing them in\nThey never understood that you already believe what you believed you already thought what you thought when I came along\nAll I did was repeat what all of us had been saying to each other\nBut you you were not hearing it anywhere in national media what you believed\nWas always laughed at or

friends and that's why you're glom onto what\nNot because you were sitting out there in your relative ignorance stay in and out all of a sudden started learning things so the presumption is that you're so stupid and your soul mindless\nThat's been golly can tell you how to think or tell you when they go start blowing things up or window started shooting people\nAnd now we've even got never Trump conservatives are out saying this kind of thing\nAnd it all boils down you know what I keep the essence of things that he's\nWorries they're real anger at directed at you think it's Trump and it is but the real anger is for you who voted for him that is where they are fed up beyond their ability to express and the fact that they can't talk you out of supporting Trump\nThere seems to be

I Know exactly what the caller ... Democrats get to decide well let me tell you something folks\nNot true anymore that may be the way they report it and they met that may be what they try to create but people rebelled\nAgainst this call Donald Trump people rebelled against that the Democrats since Obama has been losing elections don't lose sight of this\nStarting in two thousand ten the Democrats have lost over a thousand maybe it's closer to twelve hundred electoral seats at federal state local level and there's a reason for this they are being rejected\nAnd the media is being rejected as as well and so gas if if if what the media did to the state of Indiana is gas lighting as if that's what the definition is now heartily endorse it\nAnd uh and accepted and it's this arrogance and this supremacy their superiority that goes along with that kind of coverage and it's it's everywhere it's you have a the synagogue shooting ... the obvious the obvious explanation\nIs that Donald Trump and his conservative media posse are radicalizing and this becomes the narrative this becomes just the way it is and everybody thinks\nThis is crucial for the media the weather report these things to make it look like they are the majority and they are what's normal went increasingly they aren't\nAnd what really is happening here is that people who know they're not by definition\nSpent numbers normal are trying to turn everything upside down so that what they are is normal and what everybody else is is the one that's odd ball abnormal the media is right in their facilitating this or that I'm telling you it isn't it used to work like a charm\nAnd on many people still does we still have a lot of people in our side still want to ... to the media still wanted to find whether or not conservatives or Republicans are succeeding\nBy virtue of whether the media as being nice to them or not it's frustrating to know when when I run into people like that and they're out there but the\nElectoral results just in the past two years ah indicate that people are more and more aware of this in pushing back\nAgainst that uh to see what [noise]\nI didn't see this I didn't watch Fox News Sunday Sunday but apparently Chris ...
