DNA because they're leery of how it's going to be used [noise]\nThey already feel like they were discriminated bunch of people but I'm the same token there are some benefits that had been extended to them as a result of this and they just don't want to upset the apple cart so they don't even realize or utilize\nDNA in any of this but\n... the media of course has a role here because everything

[noise]\n[noise]\n... we've been hearing for the past how many months that there's going to be a blue wave there's no question about it there hasn't been no question about it the Democratic party is poised to retake everything they can in this next election why well the media tells us the American people are fed up\nAfter two years of Donald Trump they realize the mistake they made they wish they could do it and go do it over maybe take back their vote for Trump and this is going to be the first chance they've had to actually do that until the Democrats are going to retake the house and a massive\nLandslide and at one point we're going to take the Senate but if you look\nAt [noise] the reality [noise]\nOf voting patterns just in the past eight years let's say ten there's nothing in the world [noise] using common sense that orders for a Democrat sweep or blue wave [noise]\nThe trend in the past ten years is Democrats losing elections left and right [noise] and it all started with Iraq who's saying all in two thousand ten [noise] do you remember how many times I reminded you that during the\nFirst six years of Obama you go through the two thousand four team in terms of\n... the Democrat Party lost over twelve hundred seat [noise] nationwide seats in the U.S house seats in the U.S Senate state houses governorship [noise]\nUh you even go to a local often like mayor ... town

they had it any better this guy Trump won the Republican nomination\nSomebody did know when he was doing a gigantic buffoon a walking set a gaffe they thought this guy would be easily swept away they believed dollar polling data\nAnd we know what happened they continue to lose to the point that after the two thousand sixteenth elections [noise]\nThe Democratic party had the least\nAmount of power in terms of elected office is held in Washington DC since the Nineteen twenties [noise] now the two thousand sixteen election was only two years ago [noise]\nSo from two thousand ten the first chance people had to vote after having stomach two years of the Obama administration which you want to talk about people wanting to get their votes back you want us talking about people wishing they could do it over you want to talk about people wishing they haven't voted the way they had go take a look at the two thousand ten midterms\nIraq Obama singlehandedly my friends has destroyed the electoral prowess of the Democratic party nobody knows it because of the things I just told you are never reported instead what people hear every day is this coming blow away this gigantic Democrat landslide on what\nEvidence is this going to happen what is it that has stopped the trend [noise]\nThe people in this country have been voting against Democrats [noise]\nIn ways unprecedented I mean to having the fewest number of electoral seats since the Nineteen twenties is pretty astounding it means a lot of people had been voting against you so what is it that's happened [noise] that is going to cause this

Democratic\nParty [noise] well on the basis of what [noise]\nIf you take a look at Trump's agenda and the economy and policies and so forth there is no reason to vote against it [noise]\n\nIn common sense there is no return peasant done anything to worsen anybody's lives [noise]\nQuite the contrary [noise]\nAnd in fact there's a story from CNBC today that you're not going to see widely reported

[noise] the iPhone that it's paired June knows that why fight network ... for example when I'm at home uh [noise]\nI leave my phone in the library when I go walk the dogs the state has a massive yard so I'm Out of range so my phone\nIs not with me but my watch connects the wife [laughter]\nBecause my phone is connected to wipe by on the watch learns it but I still I have to manually enter\n... y fi password on my watch for it to work it did not automatically translate transmit the ah the password from the phone to watch [noise]\nIt took me a while to figure that I'm Out there walking the dogs and the watches connecting them out to eat at a wife ... said what the hell's going on so I checked and I found out that I have not entered the password for my wife I find that work on my watch well I doubt [laughter]\nThat your mouth to show these phone had why fi connection to the Saudi consulate [laughter]\nIf it's password required and his wife is sitting outside with the phone [noise] she might be able to see the wife fi network in there but if she doesn't know the password that phone is not going to connect to the Saudi wife I end up the phone doesn't connect to watch will not\n[laughter] now if he had a history of going into that conflict with his phone and if one of previous visit he had logged into their wife I network with a password\nThen his watch would connect to be a wife fight if he had also entered [laughter] the wife I network password on his watch that's just the phone is not nearby [noise]\nI just don't think any of that happened\nI don't know how proficient this guy was with tech [noise] ... it is possible that his watch could have recorded everything [noise]\nOn why fight if he had actually entered the consulates why fi network password independently on his watch just because the the phone has has been long gone with the password does not mean to watch as\n[noise] ... ... ... ...\nEvery device connecting to a wife I'm at work half to go through the password\nNothing is automatic now Apple's got really simplified here you know you'll people may not notice ... and may have happened to you to know what I'm saying let's say that you are going over to uncle leaks house [noise]\nAnd uncles IQ as a wife I network and you're going over there and when you get the uncles weeks house you ask ... for the password to his wife or you don't have to do that anymore all you have to do is make sure uncles IQ is in the room with you in whatever room you are in the house\n[noise] and then on your phone you go and turn on the wife I network find a wife I network at the minute you do that uncle leaks phone will get it alerts saying do you want to share your wife I network with others in your house and my uncles equal click yes [noise]\nAnd that will send the password for his wife I network to your phone ... you are the gas didn't say it will do this automatically that way hosts do not have to remember their passwords and do not have to give them the gas that happens automatically as an Iowa eleven [noise]\nYou should try to see if you don't notice\nIt's fascinating it's it's it's amazing how apple has continued to idiot proof and simplify all this [noise]\n[noise] but I'm just telling you that ... would have had to have entered the wife I network password to the Saudi consulates isn't ... on his watch [noise] even if it was already done on his phone even if needed to do it on his watch in order to activate the wife I network or access it\nIf he done that if his watch worked on why fight in that consulate then he wanted to have been able to record everything that happened on the watch if he had done it on the map\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nOne of the car had wife I Know it it is it is because he's the pardon me out of range for it but it would still need the password [noise]\nThey'll need [noise]\nUh [laughter] [noise] well I don't know if they would say no we're not I mean he's a he's a journalist up until this visit was probably will find empty okay who knows\nBut [noise]\nI doubt that his car had a wife or that would require you to have a hot spot\nOr from whatever cell carry over their offers them but even even if that were the case I'm\nA book [noise]\nOther example to try to explain this you're going to a city [noise] and you get in a car picks you up at the airport or whatever in the car service has wife ... it's just a hot spot\nThe driver ... gives you the password if you're not sort of your log into it you're watching is not logging on to the network you're on your watch is connecting to the phone on the phone controls your watch as long as the Turin range\nThe phone determines everything that watch those when they are separated [noise]\nWhen the watches out a range of the phone that's when you have to know how the watch can independently connected networks and I've just got through telling you how difficult it is [noise]\nWhen there's no way out to eat an apple has not activated LTV service for watches in Turkey yet\nSo it would have had to have been wife I would've had it been the wife find that we're going to concerts and it would have had to have a password
