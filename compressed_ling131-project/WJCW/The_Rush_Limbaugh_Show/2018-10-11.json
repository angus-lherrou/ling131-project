some of the the Saudi economy and to take it away from being strictly petrol and oil [noise] focused\nBecause the world is expanding in ways that the Saudis are not involved in one of the things that

wealth some of them even among the royal family and took over\nThe Ritz Carlton hotel in Riyadh and that became a giant jail and he put all these guys in jail demanding a certain percentage of their wealth ... on the basis they had stolen it [noise] do the corruption and connections and soon as he made a lot of enemies\nWell Jamal ...\nHas as a journalist doesn't buy any of this and has been running around openly criticizing Mohammed bin Salman\n[noise]\nEven running stories suggesting that Mohammed bin ... father the king has grown so upset with his son the crown prince that he's taking

make Trump suffer\n[noise] [noise]\nYou think that's the majority of people you think that's the kind of stuff that creates a blue wave I don't\n[noise] I don't believe that the country is that [noise] it ranged\nBut the Democrats are counting on the fact they think it is okay to the phones ban in Fresno Europe first today great to have you with us or high\nThey rash thanks for having me on Yes sir I\nSo I was there I was in the for the three days of the nonsense last week I saw the the them screaming and yelling and attacking us and and the folks and and so what I felt was\nThis is all they have the reason that they continue the reason that John Lennon saying the nonsense he's saying on CNN the reason that they just continue with this game plan is it the only game plan they have\nAnd they're hoping that the American people are dumb enough to still buy it but I Believe that the American people even in California where I'm at the American people are seeing this crap and they're like this this is an old game we don't find any more\nAnd and and they have nothing else to play there's nothing else for them to but they just keep doing the same doctor and the book in our eyes it was like they know they're losing they know that we're not buying it anymore but they've got nothing else to say\nNow that hold on here that's an interesting point because if they do have the maturity of the presence of mind\nThey do have to realize they're losing Trump one Trump is getting elements have been John into his agenda a pastor implemented Kavanaugh was confirmed everything they've done just stop Trump\nEverything from the judges to the court's travel but not much has worked\nAnd so I think you're right they do realize they're losing and you think they really hit of desperation that they've got nothing else to do that's why they're not proposing any ideas to counter Trump's that's why they're not proposing any new policies to counter Trump's because they don't have any\nAbsolutely they let loose when they're\nThe right lose it when we're silent and they they for so long they've expected us to just shut up and go away at\nWell that that's true too I I think they have become accustomed to Republicans caving and Republican voters and certainly conservative media uh well so conservative caving as well I think they've they've gotten accustomed to bullying working the rats lying\nYup threat flying all of that and and and they're hoping that it's going to work together and the only way it works is if we don't show up\nThat's why that's why you see the polling data still showing them winning that's why it showed Hillary was going to win a landslide because they know that if they can to sway does that they can discouraging us enough they could not go up that's the only way they win but if Republicans and conservatives\nStand up when every single time we just have\nTo show up we have to convince other people to show up and convince them to convince
