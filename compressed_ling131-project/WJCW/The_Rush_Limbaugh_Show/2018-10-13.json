listening to the drive [noise] I'm BJ I I Know the\nParents of auto show was going on and they're there just wasn't a lot of news that I that I saw I mean listen I'm only going by what I saw a gold cross Facebook and it was like the big\nThing was that BMW the three series only available in an automatic transmission and for the ultimate driving machine to not even offer a manual was kind of weird but we we beat the hell out of that Carl and I did but I just didn't see a whole lot going on the auto show seem to be just sucking wind\nYeah unfortunately you know the shows used to be cruel because you you were always excited about some really bizarre crazy far out concept\nThat the manufacturers were going to do what did they ever built that are not the fact that hey this is what they're thinking of and this is kinda cool and they don't really have that anymore because they can't afford to spend that kind of money that kind of time\nOn vehicles that are never going to see the light of day will\nAnd we're a global market these days so they got to spread it farmers are I mean China right\nYeah China's a another big area but China's an interesting story because you know what's going on with the trade talks and ready to Trump try to keep everything and built in America and and not wanting to pay the tariff that they're asking and the fight between China and us and tariffs and\nSo what's interesting is that it is definitely and obviously it always does first affect the auto industry so a jaguar Land Rover just said that they're going to shut one of their plants for two weeks\nAfter the sale slump in China I mean the truth is\nThat jaguar Land Rover reporter forty six percent slide in sales to customers in China\nYou know this is the company's largest market you know so it's J. nervous and a and think about that yeah you are Land Rover we know that Ford's sales were down so\nLincoln heavily invested over their General Motors is really invested over there so you know what do you do whether manufacturers thinking I mean you and I believe that that jobs should stay in America I mean\nLet's make our market's strong and then we can go and think about doing other things but tear trade they need to be fair but you know it's interesting because if this is happening now it's hurting China there's no question China's got some problems going on right now\nFighting this tariff and starting to lose power because those who have the best to kind of me are going to be the most powerful in the world that's just all there is to it well so\nAnd here's another factor look I mean I Am American I live in America I Love America I Love what America stands for and I know many people Jesus should probably be playing the star Spangled Banner but anyway the point is that when you see\nYou're just going to say it it it is working his his plan to work and there's a a big steel company I remember the name said that they're going to open up a new plant in Gary Indiana and anybody that knows Gary Indiana knows that there's a lot of trouble there they have no jobs they say it's turned into a really kind of port city that not a good city so you open up a film and all their\nYou know you're employing seven hundred and fifty people and you're making products the United states and\nThe steel will be cheaper because we don't important I mean there's a lot of benefit to that I'm offer for trade I have no problem with trade as long as it's open trade and it's it's terrible for everybody there's no terrorist whatsoever but just not right for anybody no matter to us or any country to get the short end of the stick so\nI mean it's good that that we have a new North American agreement between Mexico and us and Canada so that's a plus and that's\nGoing to help the car manufacturers but you know running off to China because that's where the sales are isn't always the best idea and unfortunately it's coming back to bite him in the end so hopefully things will start to level often and China will start to go okay we need the automotive business here\nAnd we can use the business here but you know I don't even want to get into the human rights you know argument going on with China and all the other countries are too it's just it's just a tough tough industry because automotive as global\nThat's all just do it well you know what I'm all I can say is that I Am glad to see our economy doing better I'm Glad to see that this president is making America a better place to manufacture products that we sell here\nAnd that is going to have a ripple effect it'll help generations to come\nNo matter how unpopular he is right now the benefactor of all of that what he's doing is us we're the benefactors of all and what he's doing he's already a billionaire he's like you said I I've already got money I'm doing this for you I I Believe that got anything I just I Love you thank you very much for being on the show\nMy pleasure as always also big

I've got my good friend Billy Bernard Robert towards online editor chatting with us about high end mobile audio he barely right before the break you know we were kind of winding up customers do and we talked to one of the things I wanted to ask you I Know you spend a fair amount of time on private jets\nDoes the high end audio world carry over to private aircraft\nUh you know to a degree in dies I have been on a plane to end at the top thing about planes is it your sense of being a giant too and so the to channel the fact is really a lot I mean there are some good multi channel\nA speaker systems I've heard but it's sort of a it's sort of have that party mixed effect\nAs opposed to the really control system that you get sitting in the front seat of a car that being said they are not lacking in in cool technology and music service and stuff like that collide escaped which is a big a home theater media server system does or on a lot of the top and playing so you certainly have access to the gear but\nUh just because of the shape of the ... the plane and you're you're not getting the great experience uh that I think you do in a car certainly at home\nI Will say if you're a if your listeners are interested I have been on a number of yachts too and\nThat was my next question of man next question 'cause I'm always totally envious Bailey now I don't know if you do this every year of you for your belly goes to Monica for the ... show [laughter] or they do that every year\nI you know I I haven't been the last year or two but I have been a number of times and those systems are absolutely bananas I mean you know these these things are essentially fifty to two hundred and fifty\nMillion dollar floating homes and you know if the owner of these things in the audio is not going to scrimp at all and I've seen\nThe most bananas systems I mean probably even crazier than most of the ... of these systems on a yacht you know I I've seen ... modeled these systems one that stands out um to me that I'm aware of but I haven't been on board because the owner of this yacht is this crazy Russian who while that media on or you can't take pictures but I Do know cause I Know the guy went all the speakers\nHe has this is the world's second biggest yacht it's called eclipse into was built in Germany there are I I think it is like like twenty or forty gas can can go on the boat\nBut reportedly he has twenty burn master systems throughout the odd so all of his guest rooms have a dedicated to channel system and the speakers are built by this company in Germany called ... audio it's with typically build speakers for yacht like that and they're like\nI think it's like ten or Fifteen grand preparing for the in walls and then another tank ran for the in ceilings these systems are absolutely bananas and so you know if you if you do the math on that let's say a ... system with a you know with a CD player and apple firing a couple of sneakers you're looking at\n... easily fifty or a hundred grand a pop and if there's twenty on the yacht I mean you do the math\nThat wow that's a little nastier than staying at the hotel where they have a a musical turntable in the room huh\nAll right yeah I Know that the things I mean that that's total next level of luxury I mean these guys are a multi level billionaires I mean ... was was reportedly a billion dollars to build and so he he's been at least a couple of million on the audio alone\nWow so the it sounds like from what you're telling me that I'm Audie on a plane versus audio on a boat or a boat a yacht I shouldn't say audio ... versus audio on a plane it's kinda like Austin Powers versus James Bond kind of a ride on the\n... ... you know that the planes are not just about the ... the next level and the thing\nAnd they do have with the plane but when you're flying at thirty thousand feet and you have a you know a giant Rolls Royce engine ten feet away from you you're going to have a lot of noise whereas on a yacht a ... they have a crazy amount of noise happening and stuff to keep the cabins and they're really quiet so so similar to you know having a controlled\nEnvironment in the cabin of a car though the interior yacht a you know as as a very quiet no noise for and so they maybe there's a lot that they can do in their\nWell and I mean I've I've had the good fortune to spend a little time in Monaco too and you know just from what I've seen and\nYou know from a couple of the formula one drivers I've talked to and stuff I mean those boats pretty much state park so there there it is really rare that they even take 'em out there just kind of like a mobile you know mobile party palace on the water really right why\nThat's the thing I mean you know ... with a medical grand prix in Cannes Film that's coming up I mean that's sort of the spot to be I mean you know they're they're they're not lacking for a a land block accommodations in those areas the really hot spot to call your base of operations as a yacht docked at a at one of the nearby marina than any just hopped on all the parties that of course\nYou throw your own after parties on your yacht and then you're you're you're a real big deal if you're throwing a party on your boat\nWell I I saw I Know when I was there and I wasn't there for the now is the show there before after or fairly close to the grand prix or is it a completely different\nIt's after it isn't the temper I got it so both can and Monica ... chose around that time\nGot it 'cause I Know what I saw a to a lot of one guy was explained to me when I was there he said that the bigger yard you kind of helicopter in from the yard to the street\nRight yeah yeah if you're that big video on you\nAt your own helicopter on board yeah you can go wherever the heck you want to and you just drop right and\nWell so so what we need to do when we retire in Monaco is to get like a little yard with a cool record store there so we can keep all those guys in in music\nWill yeah exactly and then instead of a helicopter maybe we'll get a drone\nYeah there you go we'll just have a you know or maybe we'll get Amazon to fund us to be out of Amazon today delivery the Monaco branch so so I'm yeah I'm ... I'm all over the so do you have at Rob do you have anything coming up in the near future that you're doing that might have a really cool system in it\nUm and you know tough\nTo say I mean it it's sort of it I I haven't heard of any new systems fan or thought learning cars coming up you know like I said we just had our car the ear event back in November So I kind of got like the world's\nThirteen best new cars and got to sit in and drive all of them so I didn't hear all the latest and greatest systems there\nAh you know the name system in the ... was pretty crazy a that was a fun one so I haven't you know I haven't heard about anything new coming up we'll have to have to look into that and see what others are doing but I feel like that is trying to start at five or six years ago those guys really ingrained in grade themselves and and and they're now it's like\nYou know the these are kind of a requisite amenities on these cars now I mean I write write or if you're spending a hundred ran on a car you're definitely gonna check that box to get the high end brew master you know I'm already in her being a system in there and I you know and I think\nWhen they have these cars I mean you know I especially if you're getting a belly or rolls and and you know you have a chauffeur someone driving around and you're hanging out in back you're going you're going to want to have a good system and I will say that when when I tested boat see 'em a test and some of the bigger roles but the most and speed last year I are the year that that's the place to sit in that car is in the back man that\nThat you know I read when I had the belly continental I I actually fell asleep I had the massaging seats on in the back in the name system was playing and I I fell asleep and they just laugh they said yeah everybody does\nThat add that the way to do and then and the new ones I missed the kind of a new trend to in the center console in the back there the little pop down champagne champagne tray were a bottle of champagne and a couple of Luther right there so\nYou lean back seats now recline and these big car and in a in a big belly enroll you can or climate the pop the massage on turn up a stereo and enjoy a glass of champagne I mean\nYou know it doing that in a car there's nothing cooler\nYou know it doesn't get better even ask last Mercedes with the ... comes pretty close to that when I had one of those for a week I did that with Pam I picked her up at work and uh you know actually put a suit on and picked her up at work and I had the champagne in the back seat and let her just geek out and I it was fun so\nSimilar or the or the Mercedes my back uh the new my bike without a car there too so so I got to do it back in there I I Will say I prefer they experienced in the name but the sound was pretty close between the two of them\n\nAs a small business owner you make every dollar town so what could you do with ten dollars go to this to print dot com today and you get five hundred high quality custom cars for only nine Ninety nine that's less than two cents for cars\nAnd Mr print fewer satisfaction is absolutely guaranteed it's never been easier to turn five hundred strangers into connections just visit this to print dot\nCom and use criminal code two thousand and check out that this could print dot com tunnel code to zero zero zero\nThere are many words you could use to describe the new ... studying stylish sporting the words breathtaking however isn't just an adjective is a warning because well the ability to zero to sixty four point seven seconds might take your breath away doing sixty to zero with powerful ramble breaks will help you catch it again\nTo twenty teens ...

that you guys did a a Porsche the the big one is that is that the\nYeah the Nineteen uh yeah now that\nThe night and so I mean does that freak you out I mean when you just pull the dash on like a six hundred eight hundred thousand dollar car do you do you kind of ... a little bit when you do that or have you guys been doing this for so long it's like as just another day at the shot\nYou know I I always ask the guys about that I'm Lesley Tom Ridge back they're installing them these cars and they think the same thing you know it's\nJust a car or you go okay and it's just a car and I think I think subconsciously there's\nNo a little bit of a sweat and pulling parts off and you know have to be several thousand dollars um but\nThe great thing is both ranch and Tom the fabric energy or there I mean those guys collectively half years experience on our cars and mostly I on European cars so\nWhy are in the design language and how these parks only gathering them apart um you really don't even need instruction to just kind of ...\nWell that's one thing to and I think this might help some of our you know our listeners um when you're considering doing something like this\nI mean I grew up in an auto body shop and I grew up with a dad that worked for Cadillac years ago and my dad was\nMental about squeaks in rentals and I I had a friend here in town who had a system done by not by you guys and you know this guys I mean this nine eleven was bullet proof type when he got the car and when he came back from the stereo place it was like oh man do discard fullest weeks and rattles\nWhat do you really have to do to make sure that the car goes back with the same level of say structural integrity that it had when you started\nYou know it's a good question Jeff and that's a big ...\nEarn a lot of clients or the ...\nAnd I think I think I can stretch and organization when it comes out on a you know removal and re installation God and then we're going to every art major and then it goes back exactly how you are and then really caring about how it goes back together and how it went on I mean there's times are rattle from the factory and we have to go in and fix\nThe factories rivals in order to make it sound system leaves\nOh interesting ... well and again I'm sure that's where that fifty years worth of install experience comes from that you know you go hey I've seen this before I saw this like that it's almost like you kinda know what doesn't work just as well as you know what does work right\nOh absolutely you know there's a lot of trial and error and I wholeheartedly believe in everything in life we learn more from our mistakes when we do commercials and you know a good part of the first five years of being in or is a lot of years and so you know those guys having over ... years experience together they've gotten most of those out of the way\nWell I Know I Know I've looked on your website quite a bit and I see that you do um you did some stuff for another friend of mine can Mercer oh that I Know you've done a couple of BMWs for him\nAnd I've got a new CSI for so and that things got a I keep saying this on the air I BMW is going to call me one of these days but it's like it might ... got a terrible system in it\nSo um I I have to come and see you guys because I I I needed to upgrade enemy when you've got something you know again more I mean compared to Darren ... my my movie for isn't you know\nIsn't anywhere near that level of car again for our guys in the audience this is something that you can come in and spend\nThree four or five thousand dollars and still get a pretty substantial upgrade right\nYeah you know there's definitely something for everybody um and our shop the traditional car stereo shop one definitely not for everybody but what I what I always say and I kind of snow this from a from and ... and others just liner and one of them are in that car stereo is not that important\nBut listening to music is experiencing are not very ... we take an artist and approach to what we do so if you you know like I said we're not for everybody but if you appreciate art and you love your car and you really enjoy\nWell that that really sounds good I mean it's well you know imparting for our for our listeners that are right here in the northwest that can't just drive any or shop is there anything to either look for or look out for when you're investigating accustom install shop\nThat's a good question as well and that's tough because uh you know I'm looking on the inside it looks like there's about Twenty one I'm terrible shops

I'm here with my ... we're talking about realistic upgrades\nTo your car audio\nKen we've been talking about the guys that music or North West\nAnd you know your recent I Know you just had him do that we were just talking about the system they did in your ex five one of the things I'm really curious about well first of all I mean I'm I'm getting the feeling that it was a pretty major update I mean in terms of you got a pretty good while factor when you got it back\nAbsolutely the or sound quality improvement or significant or just for a\nDrop in the ... the six\nA greater damp bringing a trait at any other speakers anything else so maybe it's all that\nAnd it's all still suffering you don't see anything else just a normal uh only am car stuff so a great a parade sound quality big difference too are\nGetting in the timeline darned yeah each ... I'm a nurse having the I think a road trip over water age out put into the speakers made to improve that\nWere you kind of surprised because I Know that I Know you've got a pretty decent high end audio system in your home where you were you pretty surprised at you know say the clarity and imaging and all of that stuff that that was that a pretty big jump too because I mean you're you're out of your other definite disadvantage in a car\nBecause you're not sitting in the middle of the speakers you're sitting kind of off to the left hand side but did you still notice uh a major jump in I guess presentation for lack of a better word\n... even with the uh I kind of linemen and the hearing stuff but if you uh makes for a\nHuge difference a great thing about music car northwest or wants insults complete back through what sounds calibration ... can't think of the term but\nWhere it measures but found or you know the the microphone right up your location and the driver's seat and they go through in a measure the that'd be ... wizard I Can't think of the name of a tool that they use so\nAnyway they really it sounds like it sounds really similar I mean I've got um almost like room correction in the house you know it's just when I when I did I Do have that on your own system in your own theater system\nYes your policy I think\nWas the the wine and um I think er and I'm\nRight that's what I'm turn I got it and I've got an anthem receiver and you make measurements around the room and then you make measurements where your head is where your couch is going to be so that that's kind of a level of adjustments that they do in your car then\nExactly and it really makes a significant improvement in the sound quality and where the the basic only em sound system I mean the radio satellite um even the pod plane all kind of found similar once they went through maybe improvements\nIt really made the\nSound quality differences between the fade away files coming out of the high pollen or the iPod class like\nThat probably found significantly better than the satellite radio which was really compressed almost like AM radio and then probably ... in between the two are just the standard radio broadcast it can really tell the difference between the compression or the or the and uh make much or a pleasant experience\nYeah I Know when I listen to serious in my car it almost sounds like it's being played through ... or you know it really [laughter] that's exactly\n[laughter] yeah I mean and and if I'm listening to Elvis Radio that's not so bad um but if I'm you know listening to something else it's it's not always as good one thing I'm curious about to\nKnowing that you've dealt with these guys for a long time and you've had the system down in your car for a while [noise] are you hearing any funny squeaks rentals that weren't there or everything still buttoned down\nYou know it's a a better than factory to even say those cars go through and use the bathroom Cape and a phone when different things and a lot of customer fabrication stuff to make sure it's bolted downright bullet proof or affect the political you know I had back\nLike five six years ago they went through and cleaned up some original a fabrication that really was\nSub par so they had some fabricated from a speaker mounting quite the bolt into odd or a a a really cleaned up a lot of the details and a great solid job I mean that that much better than I Am factory stuff\nWhile well then again I think that will be a you know for those in the audience that are considering doing this a good installer will take you to that level will cool man well hey that's all the time we've got for right now Ken thank you for joining us\nThank you very much I'm your host Jeff ... we're here

we're talking about costs a mobile audio with Meridian marker so long ago Marco you know we were right before we took the commercial break you were talking about\nWorking with the design engineers at J. can range rover now one thing I've noticed since a number\nOf the high end car audio or the hiring home audio people have joined car audio you\nThe guy's name for Mr Thing and all of sudden one of the things the other engineers have told me is that you know as a result they've they've\nDone more with making the cars quieter I mean it's been kind of an interesting benefit so was that part of your design process to where you you sat down with range rover will they were designing the car and saying okay we need a little more sounding here we need a little more there that kind of thing I mean so is it is it kind of a two way process working with them on that\n[noise] well again another interesting question Jeff how\nWe would like to say yes he does but you know kill ... is a combination of lakes there since\n... ... ... makes unique an emergency is the main the ... they believe he'll Joel and they're willing to push the boundaries so they are always trying to make the car it quite a quieter than vitamin\nA and that obviously is a beneficial for us because ... and then we'll take colder and we'll give you the writes music so\nThey say it's pretty much how you wore that they believe that has an amazing being the block a very quiet on top of which we believe that our ... needs to get the experience of sound that we we desire\nSo that we were we we saw both each other and we're relying on each shot at a uh expedient to end ...\nWhat would you say was maybe your your toughest challenge doing this kind of a project because again when you got the home system you've got a little bit more you know you've got a little bit more room to make the boxes big or small is you need 'em that kind of thing but in the car you know every every little chunk of space is at a premium so what\nWhat what really was your biggest challenge would you say getting this done\nWell\nThe biggest challenge was to find the right by alone\nWeighed the old ... ... feet in and the music of course you buy a car so all you want to drive eight and feeds that Columbus to a ball you probably want to drive with the wind in your face and\nWhy [noise]\nMaybe ... just going to be over the speed limits or you'll you'll see is charged here you know [laughter] ... or ... or\nSo you have to find the right by low cost all I Want to share then Jean ... Castillo won't see here they get books and day day in general for for for them to it when you're driving for example and left pot so damaging that cycle basketball\nAt that is the most difficult challenge is where we music needs to take hold a ship all wear car and then Jean\nNeat you'll come along and give ... billion or so is this is Nicole provides we had to take with which I wasn't at all there and he's always seem to respect all\nWhile really costs along and who knows but to wall ... customers want to have than ...\nRight right and and I have to say again you know with the F type the because you make\nTwo levels of system in in both cars correct you got kind of a an entry level the one that isn't about three hundred and fifty four hundred watts and then you've got that really big one that is an eight twenty five or nine hundred watt something like that the the F types that I drove had the bigger system and\nYou know even cruising around fifty sixty miles an hour with the top down in the air with the bigger system you can still hear the music\nPretty well I mean it you can you know you can I mean I remember I was driving out I live in Portland, Oregon I was driving out of\nTown and I had the top down in the F type and I was\nThe sun was setting and I was listening to pay for it and it was it was pretty surreal it was it was pretty outstanding you know just cruising down the road as the sun\nSet and it was it was amazing so you guys have done a fantastic job\nTank you'll when we were next to call 'em the science of emotions\nAre all about is like taking you have to find the right mix so sigh and then about engineering balance and so hard but at the end of the day what we believe that it is that the U.S describing\nDecks the essay you're driving along some kind of sad or you are fraud or a ... in front of the top of the vote them at the front of the girls and they really well to do\nWith the right music with Bob Stewart that would probably be driving out of town with the top down and listening to Mahler five instead of paying for it you know but uh [laughter]\nYou know in any way but it is a good\nPoint which is was while although we're a nation and to ... hearing you say back they like to see that which made what we wanted to achieve\nA secret for the last high walls to ... that you have weighed their roof down\nOlder pop it doesn't matter\nWhether you had that ... we want you to provide you the same experience and we'll toppled down just your\nShift you're like in that moment because you want to feel that way and then you'll have\nRight right now would you have you noticed I mean again I'm not too you know make the comparison but I Know the the guys at poor show with prime minister they've said that since they've introduced the ... system in Porsche it's been a huge hit\nUsed to I mean my dealer here told me he said he said we don't even order uh nine eleven without for Mr entered anymore have you seen kind of a similar thing with dragon with range rover that you know now that it's out there it's been out there for a couple of years [noise]\nUm that the other owners have said you know hey I Want that you know I Need to have that are are you seeing kind of an up tick in Meridian systems in these cars from when it was first introduced\nAbsolutely absolutely a Web both ... both job what little there and and us in the region will be very very pleased to [noise]\nTo see how many people are opting for them to read yeah and when that he's a solid see them or they surround sound face them all day but he didn't see any of the reference sit them\nIn that as a matter of just a different experience obviously the top of the range so between the surround sound system is just something to re fake but\nIt's a it's about ... ... it's about they find that people understand the difference of quality and and they want to go for it and when you test something that it tastes many gold you one more [laughter]\nTrue true well you know another thing Bob always I've always because I've known about for quite a while and one one thing that he said to me once years ago he said once you hear it you can't hear it so yes you know you can't um\nYou know you can't once you've had that experience in a car it's pretty tough to go back well Marco let's take one more quick commercial\nTest it was a ...

radio\nI'm your host Jeff door gay we've been talking about high end mobile audio so we've kind of gone all around the world I think it's given us some perspective I mean if you love music on the go\nThere's a better range of options than ever before whether you get a premium factory upgrading the if the car you're driving happens to have a premium upgrade\nYou can go that way there's a there's a handful of really good installers around the country that can take things you know again it's like we were like we joke but foreign car world you can you can take it as far as you want to spend in that in that respect you can spend as much\nAs the car on high end audio if you want to and if you're that guy that wants to get that through walks out you can still do it yourself a number of companies like jail audio dine audio provide a really wide range of excellent um after market drivers usually pop\nRight in I mean they've gotten especially dine audio in jail they've gotten the habit of they just don't make a kit for your car that you can just pop the grills pop the factory speakers pop their new upgraded speakers right in\nAnd again in the ... world you can take that as far as you want to go to or I think as I like to say as far as your nerve will take you taking your car apart\nWe didn't even get a chance we've had we've had so much good information and so much fun talking about this we didn't really get a chance\nTalk about in car entertainment watching movies playing video games on the you know the screens mounted in the back of the head rests and stuff that's definitely going to be another episode where we'll we'll we'll dedicate a whole episodes of that and we'll we'll get some people up there\nI'm so Jason Jason masters is still here in the studio helping me out as always I Know you're a musician what's a you know I Know you love sound I Know you ... you know what good sound is what what's your take on this crazy world\nWell you know for me I have such a short commute that when I think of like spending a lot of money on a car stereo I I imagine using it on like long road trips and stuff but\nWhen I think about those people who have like an hour two hour commute I can easily see why somebody would want to spend a couple of brand on upgrading the stereo system because it's somewhere going to spend an hour or two to work in an hour or two back\nIt's almost as long as you're spending at your job so you're going to really want to enjoy that time\nNo it's true I mean I Know when I was stuck in traffic all the time in Phoenix I mean I I spent four hours a day of listening to my car system and I spent about\nYou know I didn't even listen to my system at home that much anymore you know so I write you know I you know I always had a a pile of pilots CDs in the in the trunk and uh you know I used to commute I actually used to commute a lot to Los Angeles so that was about a four and a half hour drive from Phoenix\nI Would I Would leave town with three three clean shirts and a duffel bag full of music you know it was a well yeah and I can\nSee how like a cause for me I'm I'm twenty eight I'm getting old enough that I'm starting to be able to afford you know a car that's not you know three times used by somebody else and\nUh I think that you know with your first and maybe second car\nUsually like a used car and the stereo and speakers are all blown out when you get it and you just kind of I used to that and right like well you know the the last speaker buzzes with the base so I just turn all the base all the way down and start peering it back until it's just like\nMight as well not even be listening to something and then you you finally buy a new car and you're like holy cow these things when they're brand new\nSounds so good and actually I've been really lucky because\nYou know being as young as I Am all the new cars that I have available to me even the lowest lowest options all come with at least better stereos than they used to be coming out with you know oh yeah and the cassette and those days\nWell and you being a bass player having a having a car system with no base that's the right of your particular form of torture oh yeah [laughter]\nWell yeah if you don't have a good good ability to hear base here literally not even hearing one of the members of the band I agree that's one of the things that that really surprised me about\nJust music listening music in general is that if you if you spend most of your time listening to music on cheap speakers you haven't even really been hearing the whole song\nWell and you know in the car environment to base is the biggest challenge because all the road noise cancels out the lower frequencies so getting good base in the car really is I mean when you get it done right it's really a nice upgrade to the system\nYeah that was one of the first really mind blowing things to me about ... with a you know good car audio is a went on like a four hour road trip and I got to test out this like infinity I think\nAnd it they had just really done it right where you could have like the moon roof opened and it didn't make a ton of noise while you're driving it was just this yeah and they had a\nScreens in the back of my friends in the back or watching a movie and then we're rocking out upfront and it's not getting in the way of each other because they have the technology is a kind of split the front and the back of the half of the car into and it was just like whoa I I have never experienced the car drive like this\nWell hey Jason that's all the
