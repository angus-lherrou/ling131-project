[noise]\n\nWelcome to focus on the family's weekend broadcaster we'll following program will challenge you and encourage you in your faith journey\nTo be an agent of influence has to be someone who is receiving from God on a daily basis because you won't take the risk if your happiness your sense of security your sense of wellbeing depends on what your husband thinks about you had any given moment\nI Would say he's desire is presented the woman to become God centered first so that she could really be an agent of Islam toward her husband [noise]\nGary Thomas has a powerful reminder to wise about how you could positively influence your husband and he's our guest today on focus some family\nYour host is focused president and author gym daily and I'm John\nJohn they've got a big smile on my face 'cause I think every wife just leaned in to say okay I've been looking for those answers as American positively impact my husband um the next couple of days we're going to cover the topic\nWell you know Jim having read through it the bowling Bonaparte can teach us what not to do as much as what he was a ... of the highest order and he was vicious at times to his wife when she showed weakness he said I Need you to be strong the\nThe M fresh needs to show her strength but what we can learn from\nThat is that the husbands need really is for the strongest wife\nPossible that that's the best way to bless your husband to become strong in the lord to become strong in your character the only thing you can absolutely change in your marriage we talked earlier about influence the one person you can change is yourself and if you change yourself\nYou bring blessings into your marriage and you can learn you know what how do I learn to respond to an impatient has been\nIn a holy way how do I learned to dissipate my husband's anger you're not excusing his impatience you're not excusing as anger but you're learning how do I become stronger myself so that I can handle it would amaze me\nThat no one's ever been as wholly is Jesus and yet no one was ever let down or taken for granted or assaulted or attacked or maligned more than Jesus was and yet he never had this poor me attitude he never said to his disciples it what\nAre you going to do for me you know I'm I Do I Do hear I hear I I and\nIt's just amazing how because he was so centered in who got is that um he was talking to so again the platform for influence is strength\nAnd that's what I I think husbands look at I don't\nKnow I hate to talking stereotypes because every marriage is its own story but since I get together with guys a lot they love to brag about their what they look they look up to that and and it might be different things you might be a great athlete you might be great with money she might be a\nGreat ... lawyer she might newer Bible backwards and forwards you just might be so social you know and if the husband particularly to begin to avert that that can be a big thing but ultimately I think that's what you're looking at\nAs you seek to influence your husband say what am I bring into the equation here because it's never you don't want to get to the point of our marriage will be better when you get your act together it's always got to be the both than all improve my marriage\nWhen I improve me but let's highlight that because that's an easy way for our flesh to take us when you get your act together then will be a better couple 'cause my actors already together what about for that woman and I'm I'm sensitive to this for the woman who is trying hard she's the wife that has been doing some of these fundamentals that we've talked about in the first part of the program here\nBut there is that feeling like I'm the only one putting effort into this so to speak to that woman who says okay you're I hear what you're saying you know I got to be the best me I can be in Christ\nBut man I've been doing that and it's still in their excuse the grammar\nLet me make a distinction here gym because I think it's important I Do believe as painful as it is for me to say this\nThat they're rather than trying to save some marriages or some marriages that women need to be safe from\nIn the case of real abuse or dangerous situations um I don't want a woman to hear this and say okay I just need to to focus on myself so let acknowledging that good ice to action yeah I I interviewed a number of women one of them was a woman that I think a similar type of woman you're describing\nHer husband was so uninvolved at home it was so frustrated he was always fishing and then she kept talking cases will fishing season is almost over\nForgetting to tell her that hunting season comes right after fishing season and then he was so involved in work and she was so disappointed she said I I'm ashamed to admit this but I found myself praying lord I Hope you'll have an affair or die so there's a biblical way out she saw in a way for her marriage\nTo be improved or Satan and she was just miserable but it's a committed believe she felt like well I don't have a reason to leave his not abusing me he hasn't been unfaithful\nAnd she prayed through it and this will seem severe to some so I just wanted knowledge that as we go in she came up with what she called the magic question and it was a shock she when he came home when she said\nWhat do you want me to do for you that I'm not doing ... she hated asking that question she pushed back with the lord saying he should be asking me that question there are doesn't things he should be doing that he's not\nAnd his answer made or even angrier he said I Want you to be in a better mood when you get home\n[laughter] and she asked me to do more laundry asked me to paint the house asked me to replace the route don't ask me to be in a better mood if you had in my life you wouldn't be in a better mood either\nBut she realized you know what I make him pay for my frustration every time he comes home I let them know how unhappy I Am how frustrated I Am with everybody and so she said okay I just got put this in my mind I'm just going to try to do it and she did it\nAnd then she asked him again and and he gave her something else that had to do with the kids and it first again she was you're the absent father and you're telling me how to be a better mother but what he said\nWas true and it renewed her relationship with one of her daughters in particular she had a blind spot and that's just what we always have to remember just because their spouse is wrong doesn't make us right you can be wrong in a hundred different direction you can miss a target north south east or west but that doesn't mean because somebody sitting at north you're not missing itself\nAnd then what happened\nWhen she began to make those changes her husband came along and he began to change as well I actually just heard from her last week they're celebrating their forty four wedding anniversary she said it's never been better\nAnd so it's going back to this year the easiest person\nTo change this focus on the family broadcast will continue in just a moment [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] introducing the YMCA [noise]\nYou

again today on focus on the family and your host is focused president and author gym daily I'm John solar John last time we started great discussion on reminding wives of\nThe tremendous influence they have on their husbands it was a good reminder for all of this or that you can't change your spouse but you can influence them and there's a distinction that our guest Thomas brought to that discussion if you missed it get to download because I think there was a lot of meat\nIn our talk about the wives and how they can better manage the environment of their marriage and I think have a different attitude\nThat is healthier more biblical and honoring of Christ and this isn't a pick on the wives day [laughter] I Know it's like a three guys talking about women no it's not that you get better but our guest Gary Thomas has written a wonderful book loving him well and there's just some simply put great insight in there\nAnd uh I I Believe we really excavated than information last time

call is eight hundred a family\nGary has been a one of our most popular guests over the past a number of years and he's married to his wife Lisa so he really studies the scriptures studying history he takes all of that into his own marriage and then it comes out with some great stories me and\nSay hey look we did mention last time we went into some depth this idea of changing your husband versus influencing your husband give us just a quick recap so we can reset with new listeners today what the concepts about\n... I Believe the difference is that when you think about changing your husband you're only going to be happy based on something he does influence focuses on what you do partnering with God to be a positive influence\nTo be a nurturing influence and by example calling your husband to become the man that God created him to be as a husband as a father as a son is a friend as a worker in God's can in fact\nYou're there's so much great content in your book loving them well I I didn't get to this last time and I wanted to quote I hate quoting back to the author abroad but let me do it on page thirty\nSix you said this what if your husband's faults are God's tools to shape you what if the very thing that most bugs you about your spouse constitutes God's Plan to teach you something new\nOh seriously gear that is so stinking convicting\n[laughter] I mean you had to come up with better well and it goes beyond marriage to how God can give you the perfect kid that knows exactly what button to push and in law or somebody at work and and the main thing is learning again I Can't change those around me\nBut I can be changed by interacting with those around me now I Do think they're destructive relations I Need to walk away from that often the ones that most frustrate me point out one of my own weaknesses because I'm contributing to the problem and I I Want to be stronger I Want to be wiser I Want to be a redemptive influence\nBut I look at relationships sort of like practicing none of us have arrived\nNone of us are completely mature none of us are completely Christ like and so when we interacting with the typical person some of their spouse in okay\nI'll give myself a B minus there but here's what I did I think next time I can get a B plus and so you're just looking at that God is growing you as you learn to deal with your spouse and those ... and it's such a great\nA lens to view it through it takes you out of bitterness which is not healthy\nAnd it puts you in a different position is okay what is the Lord's teaching in this tough moment\nIn fact ... again you mentioned a scripture that you know we breeze through and you have captured it to say no focus the light on this is James three to where it says we all stumble in many ways and you mentioned book how that kind of revolutionized how you thought about this\nWhy how did it revolutionize you're thinking\nI have probably talked about that verse forty hours in my lifetime if I were to add up all the marriage seminars and the books I put that in it it's been in every marriage book in in blog posts and whatnot\nAnd it still I forget\nEveryone was stumble in many ways this is all of us stumble in many ways there is no exception nobody gets them marry the fourth member of the trinity that person doesn't exist and we know that intellectually but sometimes in our hearts we resent it\nWas okay lord I Know my spouse has to stumble why does he have to stumble in that way [laughter] or why can't she stumble in this way and so we think how much easier it would be\nAnd I just point out if you married someone else they may not symbol and this way but they're going to find another way to stumble because the Bible says we'll stumble in many ways one thing the Bible is so clear about we have to get it there's only one hero in scripture\nAnd that's geez I mean every major character David\nHe wouldn't qualify as an elder in any Baptist church that I Know when people read his history and history and Moses I mean every one of them Peter ... every one of them has these things that just make us cringe and God is bold enough to say\nHe's still a man after my own heart yeah and I would say the wives can you look at a man who stumbles as David stumbled and have God's heart to say man he blew it here he blew it there he stumbles here he's still a man has my heart\nThat's the tough thing but that's the supernatural grace of God we need to realize that we need to receive that grades the more that I Know how God gives me grace I can give grades to others if I haven't got it\nThat I live by grace that I make myself the euro God loves me because I don't do that got accepts me because I've learned not to do that then I asked the same of other people but when I accepted Jesus is the only hero in the Bible Jesus only hero today\nI've received grace I'm just so much more likely to give grace and Jim I Know people it was what people expect to pass or to say but for me\nI Can't love my wife and others well if I'm not spending time at the beginning of the day receiving affirmation from\nGod when that really does a point us toward the disciplines that allow us to do that in one of the things you encourage women to do is to a form their heart towards their husbands through prayer\nThat can be hard to do when you're feeling this emotional separation when you're feeling antagonistic toward your husband\nReally how do I prefer a guy and I really don't like I Know I got to love them but I don't like him right now so speak through that how that is so fundamentally important that you have a time of prayer for your husband just you\nDoesn't have to be with your husband is yeah I'm probably better if he's not there but they speak to that discipline and what has gained through prayer for your husband\nFirst let me talk about the danger of prayer\nIf you go into prayer with a list of your husband's weaknesses and spend twenty minutes Iranian God about how this has to change and he's making you miserably you're going to come out of that prayer sick in your heart toward your husband and doesn't really help I'm always mindful when I'm Talking to God about my wife\nI'm Talking about his daughter I've never got I have\nTwo daughters so powerful to think of and it was like OK got I'm I'm Talking about your daughter and I know you love her and you get it but ...\nIt just changes my attitude and it takes chain on my approach now on the positive and ... and now they're from my wife one of her favorite things to do Saturday morning she goes to the huge farmers' market and everything is locally sourced than are\nNormally does there is whatever it is [laughter] and\nSix dollars for a dozen eggs\nUm [laughter] but they're happy chickens right right and they have videos that show that they live happy lives [laughter] so every Friday night I have to go to the\nATM machine and and get cash because\n[laughter] I Walk behind her carrying the food and and and showing up but\nNow that's not what most wives want but I think that's where you go to your girlfriends and your sister and your mom or even your daughter to get that but your husband is expressing concern by trying to fix the problem now for the men listening here's what I found to deal with this divide\nI've learned because this is what expresses concern to my wife when she expresses something that's really bothering her that's not the moment for me to fix it that's the moment for me to say now I'm Sorry and to draw her out and then that oh yeah I see that and and to be curious she\nFeels loved when I show empathy and more curiosity not stop talking it's usually tell me more but then I come back later in the day at least two hours I've been thinking about this I've been praying about it what if we did this\nThen she just seems more willing to receive it because she felt heard but what I Want wise to here is is because I Know a lot of why sometimes you feel this with your son's\nYeah you have an adolescent son and he's hurting and you want a smothering him you want to hug him or kiss him and he pushes you away\nAnd you know how that hurts because you're thinking I Want to show you I care and he won't let you care why doesn't you ... yeah that's how she interpreted why doesn't he loved me [noise] that's exactly how your husband feels when he's trying to stop your pain and you resent him for it\nHe feels like he's giving you a hug it's his neurological form of a hug and you're rejecting it you don't want your husband to feel bad for wanting to show up the heat is showing embassy\nHe's just showing it in a different way so for the men listening let's learn to show empathy and curiosity and for the women listening\nBut don't discount the male version of showing empathy if we would just understand the way our brains work instead of resenting each other we can work toward each other God made us complement I'm Glad the world has both forms of brain we want the people who say I really care that you're hurting\nBut I'm thankful for the people that says yeah but I can fix that [laughter] you know energy\nThan either one where you've got going right now she's coaching me on this is my ability to finish her since it's an ... an diversity that's 'cause she'll say you know the other day with a and she'll go into a story and then she'll struggle for that we're not supposed to do this\nTo do that [laughter] she finally what it means that let me finish my son [laughter] it is a struggle for me that's my fix that mentality let me just move faster let me move it along\nWe are so similar [laughter] I'm thinking what are the scripts\nI have running these days is just be quiet don't ask anything just let her process because the you know likes to just throw it all out there and talk and I get lost some times and it has been helpful for her to know\nThat if you'll just shorten things up or let me just pared back to you what I think you're saying it so much more beneficial to the both of us but it's hard work on both parties to understand that's how he's wired that's how she's word\nYeah and to respect God's\nDesign that we just the natural human tendency is if somebody is different we think they're worse we look down on the different because men are different than women women fault men for being different when you think about it put it in a medical procedure if you're going in for a medical procedure you want one person with great bedside manners\nBoy this must be painful yeah we're going to be there everything's going to be okay don't worry but when it comes to the surgeon\nI I don't care if he or she even talks to me\nAnd my son had surgery with just brilliant surgeon it was this Asian woman he had to have his hand worked on she goes here's my first thing if this works this is what I Want to do if that doesn't work I'm going to do this and here's the third thing but this is the first I thought man I'm so glad she's working on my son and she got a gun I just want competence I Want somebody to fix his hand\nAfter he's done he want somebody to say can I get your ice\nHow are you know patting them on the shoulder I'm Glad there are both kinds of people in the world and so\nMarriage is about that men are different than women and that's by God's designed\nAnd Gary said this but we sometimes it's a I don't mean this disrespect fully but it can be a bit of a throwaway comment\nBut of course men need to learn to listen to the ... what does that look like practically for us how do we how do we stop trying to fix it and how do we lean in and and really do that what's the teaching for us here\nLook I I feel like a bit of a hypocrite because we're on three decades over three decades into my marriage and I'm Still really trying to learn it I think I'm getting a little bit better but for me\nI have to learn not to go with my natural reaction when you get the urge back then yeah I should say okay this isn't the time to solve it I'm going to try to you if somebody is bothering her something's happening but it's first okay I when I found Jim that helps me is tell me more\nCuriosity expresses love\nTo my to my wife and I I'm Pam feral really helped me understand this how or why still loved when we're more curious and that that just that one word just okay Gary be curious ... isn't that what makes\nA woman feels so loved when she's dating\nReally tell me what happened or we don't even more to add on and so I just found from my wife to feel cherish I I Want to be curious I I Want to draw route instead of\nGive me the Reader's Digest version I Want to make time for the amplified version so I can really hear if I ask more questions\nOn it but even then I had to learn now why does that hurt you I think I'm being curious as she thinks that's a challenge so it's really learning to read your wife and just say lord helped me with my words to show that I really care about this and I really feel for Gary\nYou've said it and I hope the program the last couple of days has been helpful\nParticularly for those wives who have struggled and who have felt they they're in marriages that are isolated they they feel like they're in a rut they're not going anywhere maybe they've already um since that resentment that bitterness taking them over emotionally\nThis is for you and uh we're here for you to focus on the family and we have a great counseling department they can kinda get that discussion going confidentially don't need to worry about that\nAlso have an intensive marriage program called hope are stored if you're in greater difficulty is Gary has described a ... there are many resources and tools here focus on the family for you and I want to make sure that you're aware of that not everybody listening will know that\nAnd I hope you'll take advantage of that and we also have other great resources like Gary ... book loving them well which I Want to put in your hands and will do that for a gift of any amount and I'm telling you if you can't afford it just let us know we'll get it into your hands there will be others who will help\nUs a cover the expense of that that's why a supporters have donated invested in the ministry that we're doing here we want to help you mentioned last time we have about four thousand counseling calls a month that come into the ministry where people need help so don't hold back\nWe are equipped to help you and I hope you'll do it take advantage of it you\nCan get in touch and learn more about how we might be able to help regardless of the circumstances that you're facing\nAnd uh our number is eight hundred the letter a and the word family on line we have so many great resources and will certainly include Gary's book loving him well ah the website is focused on the family dot com slash broadcast\nHe'd Gary before we say goodbye yeah we talked about the importance of prayer for your husband uh making sure that your rooted in God's word let's end with the scripture or for that wife who is struggling what can she hold onto today to begin her journey with her husband and\nLoving him in a different way it's a familiar averse gym but I think it will change the way we look at our marriage\nFlipping for Nineteen says my God will meet all your needs according to the riches of his glory\nIn Christ Jesus my God will meet all your needs according to the riches of his glory in Christ Jesus we'd go to God first to receive we'd go to our spouse\nPrimarily to give that doesn't mean there aren't legitimate things we want to receive for my husband but it starts with receiving first from God\nYou're a great

we'll do racing information visit Toyota Racing dot com [noise] All right we spend a lot of time telling you what we don't know about what's going to happen at Talladega super speedway so let's find out\nWhat is going to happen and what we do know to do that we need to talk to some of the drivers after the race will name the end zone driver of the week presented by auto zone it could be Joey like auto and he's standing by with our western Kelly\nWell he won when we were here back in April you've got three when your time today can clearly knows how to get it done to starting Mitt pack or\nNot as quick as we thought you guys would be qualified but from everybody we talk to in the garage area but we keep hearing is no matter where those sports far they're going to be strong do you share that optimism about your car\nWhich I had to be a you know he was trying to be his confidence again when he pulling the racetrack like this that we\nHad some success that before so uh yeah were fired up about the faith I I enjoy the holiday I enjoy the challenge I have a lot of fun with it um you know a certain size is the third and uh you know we'll work our way up and wait for the boys are some point you're twentieth anyway I simply you get your thoughts and early so we just got to see that the right time I\nIt's it is a playoff ratio thirty one points to do the good does that affect how you racist race any at all\nHonestly we didn't have the discussion it or go out there and write what even talk about it it's a kind of a no we're going to do\nThree time winner here Talladega wouldn't be bad for your fantasy will join a gonna rolls off when you\nGo to the guy driving one of those blue oval then what do I know we talked about how good and how fast the fourth are here this weekend well alec painted alongside Kevin hardly driver or the Jimmy Johns board\nWho started position number three is dealing with him by Kevin as you get set to go today strapping yesterday was just the horse is one thing to get some get some data under your belt but how difficult is it to go out there and race around thirty nine other drivers with very little practice in that type of draft\nOn this for a long time so I'm pretty good idea of what's going to happen and things that you need to do and [noise] ah cars are fast that's the main thing or Jimmy Gianforte fast and hopefully we can keep myself up front and and I have a good day how difficult\nIs it to remain up front knowing that everybody else's work in the air to\nYeah I mean everybody wants to be a prime everybody's gonna raise harder to try to keep track physician so I'm\nJust happy to see how that goes in our cars drive and go from there\nHe's got all of these teammates running at the front of the field with him as a sort of the race or Fort Stewart hostile towards in the first four spots Harvard qualified third\nThey'd been very fast so far so let's keep that string going another four driver from essay jar with are the post\n... going to roll off your position number four looks like a ... a pretty good here or how how what do you feel about your particular restaurant\nGood I mean you got that a lot of cars in fast and\nWe uh hopefully got a good plan together so now he just got to go execute\nGood planning execution nothing we're looking for is uh I just aren't normal role or he's going to roll off from physician number for once the Kelly\nAnother guy who's been very strong your ... races are\nThree wins on him including one here six popped in size Ricky sent house junior another one of the blue oval drivers Ricky all the fingers are pointing toward you guys in the blue wall was you had some success here how do you feel about your race car and where do you need to be to be there to win at the end\nYou know we take our past um you know good races and and look at those and then you know our past bad ones here and kind of learned from those and um you know the spring right here\nYou know we've finished fifth and if I could go back out and do things like different uh you know I\nI didn't make my move early enough and I didn't have a chance to win because I didn't do that so hopefully our sanity Ford will uh will be good and in fact at the end of the race and you know we can put ourselves in position to to be in that job Bob and I'm In and see what we can do from there but now there is a good track force in\nA blue rebels always working together and then are always fast so\nReally looking forward to this race\nRicky sent house junior definitely one of those looking forward to the right the rolls off well back to allocate\nThe driver starts dilemma is Martin through extra junior and he and I spent some time to get a little earlier here at Talladega super speedway the October race here not necessarily been the most kind to you but yeah the positive attitude going into a race like that how important is\nThat I knew that you know we got we got a lot to accomplish that I think we have a good race car and uh\nYou know we'll see we can do is hope for a little better luck and we normally have here Talladega but ah hopefully we can make our luck and you'll be somewhere near the end when they go\nAnd make his own luck with an awfully fast race car that's more drugs\nStarts eleventh the poster\nBoy or don't hear a lot of the drivers bring the kids on her borders given how the knuckles everybody here I'm\nIs there any bitter sweetness to the fact that if there isn't a championship it will be with each other\nYou have I Wish that we're still in the playoffs right now and then had a chance to cause or compete for an eight um unfortunately that's not the the situation we're in but there are six races left and um we we want to keep our\nI'm winning streak alive and you know with a sixteen winning seasons together it'd be amazing to have our our entire run together a winning season so that's high a high priority for me and\nAnd I know from chat standpoint as well it's important to him but we just we ... we ... we wish one races and that's that's honestly we'll wrap more ready to get that done and I think\nOr last month we've shown that we're getting awfully close to him that\nJeb what's a common misconception that you think people have about Jimmy\nI think the the the big thing that people don't understand is because he is such a nice guy that they don't understand how fierce competitor he really is a the the desire to win and go fast when races really stumps to the core what'd you me that\nHe doesn't necessarily I work ... hours they project um unless you really know when you're in the environment with him to to see that and um you know it's a quality that's that's pretty unique as well to be able to have that desire and have that ability to be able to temper it towards that out of weirdly known and seen too much\nJet can can you and and William beat Jimmy and uh and Kevin mixture\n[laughter] we better\nIt's kind of the whole point of this thing right so what happens is amazing guy Kevin is very very intelligent he's a heck of lot smarter than I Am so to be able to put Kevin with a guy like Jimmy that's going to be a force for the record so\nThe goal is to go out there and compete with the twenty four and when races the goal of those guys just to go out there and when races and like Jimmy as deserve the voice smarter for cheaper than than what he's had with me so um he's got bad mouth with Kevin and it's just going to be fun to watch [noise]\nInterview I had a meandering obviously coming from day are and he currently routine for Allentown Sadler but this will be his first foray into pet theory\nOr they're trying to get a championship over there yeah they are I Love the question you posted Chad though can he and\nWell yeah and the beat and having a Jimmy and I got to tell you how how how they would give me that morning and before I can even get the entire question I don't know enough about who's gonna win first yeah Chad and William or Jimmy and Kevin guinea\nAny jumping on all your young me we're going to win Kevin ... before chatting William cans of like they're going to be keeping all of your car yeah absolutely\nI Love that enemy though and again Jimmy mentioned the friendship means hadn't hadn't echoed that sentiment and knocked out this morning just saying that this new separate each other is actually going to\nHelp them off track their friendship grow even stronger than it already is certainly going to be interesting to watch if nothing else\nThere is a full video version of it

and everything I got to give us a shuttle when\nI think the first thing I mean speeds megacities to start with you because you don't you know handling a Daytona is a big deal here last lots of that and more towards the speed but uh we had really good speed and and and when we were on tape and and we didn't shorten ball fine but I think\nI think we job it was really happy with a race car and work moves you can make and the ability to make moves on straight away this new package as low as it is we don't have much worse in the car so I'm able to make the big moves in a straight away is is a
