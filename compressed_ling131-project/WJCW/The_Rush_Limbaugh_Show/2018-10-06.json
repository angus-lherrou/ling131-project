is because it is a it's been around for awhile hasn't it\nYeah absolutely so I had five dot org is uh the world's largest uh online community for a for headphone and personal audience easiest and I had fi\nDot org started in two thousand and one um and uh I actually became a member of had find two thousand and one so I I myself am a headphone enthusiast\nUh and and how did I find head fight you know and how to most people find had fights it's really about a online research if you're wondering you know what heads on should I get 'em there's so many brands out there are so many different types of products\nYeah if you're thinking about spending hundreds of dollars you want to get some first chance of and people really like him\nAbsolutely and the great thing about ... is it is um you're you're reading um impressions of uh other people just like yourself or you know other enthusiasts who of youth products\nAnd and it's really just a way to kind of sort through a lot of uh you know as as opposed to reading in the past we would you know read printed printed magazines and reviews\nUm online forums like has fi allow a end users just to to create their own reviews\nAre and and create their own content and that's really what drives had fi or it's just that uh that ability of people to post a their own impressions of different products and it's just a great way for people to do research a and to get up to speed on all the various brands\nRight well and I think one of the most important things about your show is that it's a place where people can go and try out all of these brands that are otherwise hard to wrangle up in places other than the Internet\nAnd you can't justify a set of headphones based on how they look you've got to try him out so going and trying out all of these headphones side by side really is going to make it so people have a higher chance of buying something that they're happy with and want to stick with\nYeah absolutely ... that's ... that's really the main benefit um there are no dedicated um retail outlets where you can try on you know so many different types of headphones a and and it's also really just the place where you can and and it's not just the headphones I have to stress also\nThere's a you know a a whole component of electronics that's behind the headphones so just as an example if you buy a pair of a Fifteen hundred dollar a cent highs are H. G. eight hundreds or or the new HG hundred ass\nOr you're going to need a really good amplifier to drive up so I'm\nRight I'm going into the bottom of your own doesn't give you the best sound on

really have to make sure that had someone that you're buying is going to match what you're gonna be plugging into and of course they're they're great headphones also that you can plug right into your

you're listening to uh you know you're going to want to go back in and kind of go through your whole library so that's that's really a huge advantage and I'm One of the other things that were trends that we're seeing is a lot of traditional a high end audio companies or to channel audio companies\nAre really taking notice of the the headphone market and they're creating and and and\nAnd uh and

craftsman America's most trusted tool brand to me to make and if\nYou are a regular listener of the show you probably heard our friend ah Brendan mass uh who was on the show\nRaving about the product ring and amazingly they have ring dot com and no it is not a wedding ring this is a video doorbell and it is not just the video doorbell there's all sorts of fantastic features and safety things in bed it into it\nAnd so we thought we would get the chief inventor on James ... off on the show to tell us more about it James welcome to the show\nThanks for having me now the ring is\nSomething that\nI can easily imagine everybody having a in not too long\nOnce everybody has a chance to hear about it and decided to have to have one [laughter]\nI mean that the world that I Would hope everyone living and so yeah that's how I view it\nRight well now let's talk about the ring and how we the company's philosophy works 'cause it's not just a convenience thing where you know the\nThe FedEx guy comes to the door and you hit a button and you tell them hey I'm not there but leave it anyways and whatnot there's more to it than just outright\nYes I mean you know the the actual product is a video doorbell lifestyle allows you to ... who's at your front door from your phone\nUm and you know someone who's your doorbell your ring doorbell you can see in speech to them and also motion detection which got this kind of more into what you're talking about the security was now you're actually monitoring your property um and as a company which I think is is people sort of\nIs not sort of obvious our our mission is actually to\nReduce crime in communities as it's not actually sell doorbell or they may technology better or whatever that we're actually really a community business and and we've been very successful that actually reducing crime and catching criminals in communities\n[noise] right well and I could see why because I actually am right up your alley when it comes to reducing crime because I actually was testing out a different\nUm wife I enabled video cameras shall we say\nAnd I thought that I Would set it up to try and see who keeps coming in messing up things by the back of our office building and are not only did it not really work well enough to catch whoever did it but the video camera was stolen as well\nYeah but you are you guys have built a a cool\nWay of mounting this where you can um you know you need like a special tool you 'cause you don't just use like a federal up said to take it off so it's not as easy for somebody just walking by to come up and snatch it right\nCorrect and and yeah I mean we have we have a we don't know that is secure way of balancing it I think also because of the way it was it doesn't necessarily look like something you\nCould feel right out and do what it was it doesn't really it looks like it's on that sort of really built into the hall or something just a rip off\nRight it looks like someone that continues through to the other side of the\nWall exactly like any sort of intercom system or something like that and you know we also actually offer so in your case we will give you another one because we will we will give anyone who has their uh rain stolen a free one [laughter]\nWow well that yeah\nThat is not true of the company that uh the mine was stolen [laughter] I'm now let's let's talk a little bit about\nUm the features that are built into it with the the app because that is like it's really one of the only ways that you interact with it and so it has to be a robust system to to get people to really trust it and rely on it and you know because there's different\nNeeds that this this type of device is going to have where it whether it's um proximity or night vision maybe you can talk about some of those features\nYes or it's kind of two devices and what I mean it it it the doorbell right it is it bad or all that is it convenient things someone comes to your door able to answer it\nBut that's kind of just part of it really is a a a very sort of a bad security cameras well it has the motion detection and you're talking about it's also the motion that actually that actually program of all you can how far someone is where they are actually program is a trip right and that's really\nImportant because I've had some other video cameras where the\n... the only setting in the app is either on or off there's no proximity based so you know you end up getting like a couple of hundred of these notifications because of the wind blowing through a tree and then you shut it off and then you forget turned back on and suddenly you don't really have a video doorbell anymore\nAnd really video camera from my perspective you know the value in it is it telling you when to watch it not\nTheir way around because it ... you know you know turning the video camera and say from the ap is great but\nYou know Ninety nine point nine nine percent of the time when you do that nothing's really happening but when there's motion and telling you hey you might want to look at this and you'll be able to program it now you're seeing something that's actually interesting because it's in the front of your house or it gets even more interesting um you know like there was a\nThat it's a really relevant place or have your first camera\nRight now I'm this has a night vision built into it as well uh I Believe\nIt has an infrared night vision um the motion is actually an AC camera and again and to a audio and you know a lot of the\nCameras out there don't have that to a audio I'm Julie audio is oh important because you know you're halfway around the world and someone on your property and you see them on your video camera and you can't talk to them there's really not much you can do except for all your phone at all\nRight or drive home really fast\nYeah or fly home you know it's like there's really nothing you can do so and and being able to talk to someone through it is amazing that they don't know where you are right in the basement you know what are you doing there and they'll you know if they're not there for good reason they're getting out of there I mean that that's it and that's what we've seen has actually been able to prevent\nYou know thousands of crimes that our customers how a locations because of the ability of really having this sort of actionable camera\nRight I'm now ... where can people find a ring because I think that your um availability has been growing and and I think that people may not have to get this on line other than getting it on line right\nI mean it's a ring dot com obviously is a is a is a great place to get it and it's an easy domain to type in so I I Would suggest anyone firing dot com but then it's\nAlso available Amazon dot com it's available I'm at a at a target Wal Mart Best Buy Lowe's Home Depot\nThey ain't got off the list I was looking hard rock stone\nAge age ... I mean it's it's ah it's it's really I we were in over ten thousand stores in the U.S now it's kind of amazing\nYeah that's the list I was looking for pretty much anywhere you would go hoping to find something in this product category uh I I highly recommend it as those are my buddy Brandon who was on the show earlier are reviewing it he he I see him you know looking at it and interact interacting with it\nDaily whether it's um you know saying\nYou know he's he notices that are going off and he sees that it's his wife leaving for the day or whatever and is able to say goodbye because he sees

know\n\nWelcome to object radio I'm your host Jeff ... and I'm In the studio here with Jason masters and we're going to talk to you a little bit\nAbout headphones and headphone amplifiers and headphone related things\nYou know I Know in the next hour you're going to have a lot of headphones related people and so I thought that it would be a good to maybe go over some of the terms that you might use and um I don't know maybe just go in that direction sure sure\nBecause I mean again you know the headphone thing has gotten so popular\nAnd it's it's grown so much I mean again you know even four or five years ago you when you thought of headphones you may be sort of just your eye buttons that came with your iPhone or your portable phone or whatever and it is grown into a giant industry now where you can get X terminal\nActual external headphone amplifiers that you can plug your phone in or plug your the rest of your stereo system in or jak your laptop into so you know stand alone headphone amplifiers have gotten very very popular and again very\nVery diverse in elaborate I mean you can spend two hundred dollars on a headphone amplifier on one thing that I just picked up um again my day job at tone audio magazine we just reviewed\nA new really cool product from our Kim it's called the music boost and it looks like a little and only weighs three ounces it's like a little black hard case for your iPhone that you just slide your iPhone and it may be increases the profile of your iPhone by about ten percent\nIt it's an amplifier and also yeah and it also and it's and it's not crazy money is a hundred Ninety nine dollars and it also has what what they call a deck or digital audio converter and what the deck does is it takes the bits dream from your phone or from your device\nAnd does a better job of higher quality job of decoding those digital bits from your music whether you're streaming from title or spotted fi or you've got music resident on your device and gives it a higher quality rendition\nOut into the head a headphone amplifier and then into your headphones so it it it provides a definitely a um\nMore musical higher quality more immersive experience\nRight yeah I think that's one of the things that is one of the first hurdle that people get over when getting into the headphone amplifier world is understanding that when they make an iPhone\nThey're making a Swiss army knife it yeah there's a lot of things but it doesn't do everything amazingly and yet of the things that they skimp on\nIs one maybe not even skim but they don't put the most high quality\nHeadphone um camp in the iPhone that it works but not everybody who gets an iPhone is an audio files so they don't they they found that they didn't want to spend tons of money giving you the best of the best when it comes to plugging in your headphones so you need something extra added to that\nSure but you know what your iPhone is a great place to START I mean that truly is a great place to start and whether you just plug it into something like the ... music boost or if that was his greatest you can\nPlug something in to the lightning report and then suddenly you've got a headphone Jack on your iPhone that does sound amazing\nYes yes and then also I mean one of the one of the fellows were going to have on this morning a line of good feel from sim audio um they make an extra colonel headphone amplifier I mean it it's the size of a regular amplifier a pre up or something and you can actually again you can take that lightning plug\nPlug it into the they're either one of their headphone amp and again what that does is it by passes the internal digital audio convert or an amplifier in your\nIn your iPhone and just since that digital bits stream directly to the external headphone amplifier\nAnd the sound quality is amazing I mean it's at that point it's only limited by the quality of the files you have either stored or streaming so if you're if you're dreaming something like title which dreams and regular CD quality sixteen bit quality the result is amazing and it's just coming from your iPhone\nRight now here's a question okay there's been a lot of rumors coming around saying that the new iPhones are not even going to have a headphone Jack\nThey're they're pushing their they're saying that they're going to push people to either have Bluetooth headphones or to buy some of the new head phones that only have a lightning jak on them instead of a a quarter inch ah or ... or\n... is our those headphones that just have a lightning jak on them a

care advocate dot com American health care advocate dot com\n[noise] [noise]\n\nWell come back we're here in Studio ... good film from sim audio and he's talking about they're exciting new headphone\nAmplifiers right before we went to a break we were talking about your two headphone amplifiers\nThe four thirty and the two thirty and\nYou know one is a Fifteen hundred dollar product the other one is between about thirty eight hundred dollars and forty three hundred dollars depending on how it's configured um\nYou you would actually when you came to market with these products you had released the more expensive for thirty first why did you guys um choose to why did you choose to release the more the more expensive model first rather than get people in with an entry level model\nOh isn't it was a a new endeavor with respect to product categories would never been in the headphone market before if an amplifier mark or per se but we want the basically make a statement from the get go and create a solid reputation and\nThroughout are many different products ... categories we've always done statement product first and then we offer trickle down technology to tends to help lower price model selling its own especially\nWhen the ... like in this case the pressure for thirty ha over a year in advance to help spread the gospel but what we're capable of doing\nThe other side of this case was as the company's manufacture we offer a tutor a traitor program that allows an owner of a less expensive model in this case to city HAC to trade up to the more expensive model for thirty ha without losing his or her initial investment\nBased on our past experience as another product categories customers tend to purchase a lower and bottle first with a plan to eventually on the costs we're model which typically offers more features relief or in some cases much better performance\nYou know if only you could do that at the b._m._w. dealer you know go in and buy that or to thirty five I and then trade it up to an MP three two years later for full value that'd be pretty awesome\nI'll make for an interesting scenario yeah [laughter]\nWell I think another thing too you know in the wacky world of high end the audio where\nYou know everybody's arguing about what the best new toy is I think the praises been pretty universal worldwide for both products I mean everybody's jumping up and down I mean I bought one I we we reviewed the four thirty\nAnd give it one of our product of the year awards atone audio and I bought the review sample it's what I use as a reference with my headphones at home so it's a it really is an outstanding product\nAnd I know you're constantly mentioned I was really you are with it and I really appreciate that\nWell I you know I as much as I like listening to headphones I use the damn thing is the preempted my ... my two channels system at home it's it's really outstanding I mean this is this is one thing that's important to note for people that have never heard of semi audio\nThese guys make you know fifty sixty thousand dollar amplifiers that our world class and it's all made in their facility in Montreal everything is made I think about the only thing they don't make there is the screws I mean they do all their own machining they they build everything from top to bottom nothing's farmed out it's all designed\nBuilt tested in house and I've been to their factory and you know they're great guys they're the big music fans music lovers they have an outstanding sound room to him by which they used to develop their products so you know when you buy a sim audio product\nYou're getting a lot you know you're getting almost forty years worth of background and they also they offer a ten year warranty on all of their products to so your investment it's safe\n[noise] yes that's all correct that we currently have about thirty different product models in two different products series once called evolution which is\nPricey here more luxurious\nThey'll like a tank uh and then the other shows as Neal which is less costly but still when you go product by product compared to the competition I feel and a lot of our customers at our business partners all feel that it offers a lot more money than what's out there\nWhich state has to have your have the people buying your both of your head when apple first have they been existing stem audio customers or have you been getting a lot of kind of knew knew people in the fold with this product\nOr actually both I mean we were were a gardener many new customers and cuts a new customers are discovering what else we have to offer and some of them are taken the plunge and the button to some of our other part of categories as well so if I'm a I guess the marketing perspective\nIt's just getting into this universe has helped us expose are glad are beyond the traditional borders of high performance audio so it's been it's been a boon for our success absolutely\nWell I Know I certainly see them quite a few places when I've gone to ... you know headphone meats and headphone events you're pretty well represented there will idle running up

bears now\nYeah but you know don't you have to be a little bit careful when you're wearing headphones I mean especially when you're where are you know when you're using a headphone system that's of that high quality and that low distortion it's easy to isn't it a little bit easy to crank it up a little too far and ah\n[laughter] [laughter] yeah it certainly you know what\nIt's close attention to

little bit of a hint of what's coming up in the weeks to come\nOf course vinyl is the hot button and music these days in a lot of people I mean some of us that are hardcore audio files never stop listening and final but it's made a big comeback in the last five or six years vinyl sales went down as far as\nMaybe a million units a year in the heyday of vinyl back in the seventies or end of the seventies beginning of the eighties vinyl sold six seven eight hundred million copies and we all knew a transition a CD and then a transition to downloads\nBut vinyl is making a big comeback so ah the last this last year vinyl I'm pretty sure vinyl sold about twenty million copies\nSo you know it's definitely a formidable format again and part of owning a record player and part of getting really good sound on vinyl\nIs getting rid of all those nasty clicks and pops and all those little crunchy sounds in the background that's that you don't have to sign up for that if you don't want to so I'm going to have a good friend of mine on next week to talk to us about you know kind of care and feeding of your final collection and how you can keep those records sounding their best\nYeah I'll definitely be looking to uh to hear how to you know care for and repair the uh the the vinyl records I've just been starting to get my very first a vinyl albums just kind of\nSnatching things here and there at at the local goodwill and every now and then I see one where I'm like Oh yes it's this record and then they open it up and it's all covered in scratched\nWhich is a huge bummer you know 'cause it's like if it didn't have scratches it would be well worth thirty five cents but covered in scratches it's worth absolutely nothing unless you're able to repair them which sounds like you might may or may not have some kind of secret sauce to talk about that\nIn the not so much the scratches if they're really scratched up put them back but vinyl records tend to get\nYou know dirt from the air dirt from handling a lot of people pick their records up with their fingers in the dirt in oil from your skin beds itself in the groove and that makes that kind of you here that you know again when you when you hear the press there have been a lot of stories about vinyl in the press lately\nAnd they always talk about that and vintage that's scratchy sound of vinyl and again that if it if the if the actual surface of the record isn't damaged and scratched if they're just really dirty\nThat can be cleaned out believe it or not and there was a that's another process that you can make that as a geeky or simple as you want but you can get most of that out and I mean even when I'm shopping for records\nThe difference between a really dirty one in a really clean one might be the difference between say a two or three dollar album and a ten or twenty dollar album and I know I can take that home and give it a spin on my record cleaning machine\nAnd get that all out on a limb yeah so we'll help you with that too\nWell so now before we go before the show at let's talk a little bit about what's coming up on your magazine that you are the main guy at the you know tone audio
