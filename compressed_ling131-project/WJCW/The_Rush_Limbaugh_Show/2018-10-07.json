I'm I'm Muslim wouldn't have it on Central Asia in this this Leslie and its later but many before me vitamin welcome to our home um I remember I went to replace bars and um\nIt is very different experience things like the next thing with them\nThat I had never before you actually feel the presence of the enemy the places is one I wanted them to feel the complete opposite when they face or at home and my sense was bragging for this meeting that basis than the law and the rest of them got as soon as they can ...\nAnd ... what does them I don't remember that when I was with them in one of their place that they had to be excused one by one because it has to do with a prayer time in bay off you know the five o'clock I have to pay a certain times so I said well he said okay for the end I\nBut I also um and they were ... yes but you don't mind that I had learned to waste my life so I was kind of respect for the most votes in place for them to name was ... when they came to my house then we're going to put eight\nMy style of we watch it so we have on hand and we played and I tell you what a blessing up on each one of them in the ...\nAnd and I you know what to them but our children and one of them left before I mean the list on while you may but\nThe ... ... we have there's so much when I'm eating the little ones so that the kids would sleep after that to them and they tell us we love the women that much with them and I'm at the end of my meeting just sick and we play again and when I was so thankful that the lord moved them to feel\nThat the whole theater even though they don't know who the whole experience but the lord has less ... less than ... believe it or not with him and I know\nThat the reason why they have gone to Latin America had to move them as the war that we just read said that they can get to know him\nOne of the ... the woman at the end of the table when we're talking said\nWhat is the difference between you buy you Christians and other religions so\nWe have a Bible study out an ad our home every Tuesday night so I keep a Bible right that in our living room and one of the important things we had known him good in this might not a treatment is among not appointment\nMight not actually eating or you can tell if not my language on that it is it is powerful to trick a wonderful guy in their hands\nIn those power in the war in Iraq they can read it you see the better so I Do for a ceases to\nEight to ten and I asked the lady with this past it just made that it is by race that we hadn't said\nBy say and even that is even a guy in ... I Want when no one can both\nIn that we are God's walkman she created to eat like he's got to do is go to war that he had beforehand so we could do that but he's not\nI I Would not\nHow we I say when no one can vote but I Do all of our relationship with your right because they don't want us all the time and they hope that one day when they when they die and then in front of God that they might say you know what I think many a lot you know I\nThink I think most of our understand the gospel and we know that he's from the fact that we say my faith in the second time that he says make what I from that but I think even in\nThat many people that think that by being a person\nHopefully you know when we die I Will get us and this is what I mean these background but sometimes we feel like what we can get it hadn't so I had the opportunity to explain to them\nThat they don't say something out of our own how would that we can let it ends up heading in that case out of it with one of the hat in my house when it might well if you want to say look for the time what about\nThis is when people are coming toward us we can welcome them in fact the theme of ... is loving are Muslim neighbors\nAnd that requires breaking down some barriers in our thinking because we may have a tendency to to think that there are all terrorists or all that are all here to do this or that or the other and the fact that there are people just like us with the same kind of thing wanting to do the same kind of things that we want to do with our families and such and and so we need to be able to accept them\nAnd love them and share Jesus with them if they reject Jesus that's on them but we need to be able to share Jesus with him and that's what we want to do when they come to us but we also have an opportunity because of the world is the way it is and got his allowing people to move freely world we also have the opportunity to the Senate people\nSo we created the sending agency so that we can send people from our different Latin American countries and uh\nWe send a I I work especially looking for what we call ten makers\nPeople who are using their professions and go somewhere and work their job and that's how I actually began when that's when I met I was teaching and I went to her country and and was working there and getting my salary out of that and working locally in the in the church and that's how we met\nBut there are people that do that we call them ten makers and one of the things I Do is is um recruit people to do that\nAnd then also we said traditional workers or or missionaries who will go to those places do a number of different kinds of things tree planting a Bible translation those kinds of things and now we want to talk about those who go out and answers had a particular opportunity to minister with some of our people from Latin America\nWell when we lived here for we wouldn't be happy with that and they have that so one of the difficult things\nThat I had to deal with when the long haul the\nLatin America um is that I had to give out my medical practice and that was a big deal for me\nUm and I always thought that I'm making a sacrifice okay with it at home and I'm like wait a confronted with her and I went when my Bible study on my ... how ready for my money and how to talk of meet up with\nThe study of that which is that what I wanted to go to heaven on it gets\nSo hot and follow him he had to have a lot well I wasn't we're we're not afraid of the original ruin them we had our things and and what the Bible and and when the phone with his life that I didn't why not do what he did it you know he he he couldn't part with\nWhat section and then he was\nGoing to fall he so anyway so the hunting and with that so I thought by going to see I was giving up my medical practice and that was hard for me and I thought that was enough to use that somehow that I've listened to a lot of it\nYou know than a less than I was I was hoping that I Am from Honduras and initially we went by there for three years and then we went to our next month on and I visited places every place I went\nWith medical nieces what's in place for me the only thing that does seem I ... in a way that I hadn't ever been able to do it under sort of area a little alias I Want to see a black Molly even when I'm In and also from property with that if I can or cannot read bless me with him a lot of\nArt center on me I got well\nBut then when we became old allies of mobilizing people to sort of a lot for the end of the art and or the Latin America and that doesn't mean when they didn't they say that yes we have black females\nFit in much better than you guys in some parts of the world but that doesn't mean that looking on you I mean can he can call anybody and and he can call you at any oh we've seen workers for the lord sweaty I envy that many agency when agents doing wonderful\nSo you're not off the hook yet but the lord you know if you live a well he can

life of each of you against even the one that's the most challenging and that child and really in effect will be the mask\nAnd will teach you you're in need forgiveness and his ... for you so that you in turn can fill it over to pick is so much of what we do when we land\nThat's sissy golf and she joined us a focus on the family along with her co worker and fellow author David Thomas and I'm John fuller your host is focused president and author Jim Daley Okay John\nSo what do you recall a about your children's milestone well\nEverybody remembers the first steps that the child to and from the you know the coffee table the sofa so that that kind of thing\nBetter ability to articulate those things so that's why we have to labor a little longer I Love your word of concentration concentrate on that space with boys that we've got a labor longer than that space so that he developed an emotional vocabulary and\nWe talk about how these milestones build on each other parents are so quick to want to go to I Want my kids to figure out how not to melt down and want them to figure out how to work through frustration better and that's an important objective but the if the\nI don't even know what they're feeling like that's the foundational building block that's why we start with vocabulary we've got to figure out what is it then I'm feeling so that I can then figure out what to do with it\nSo you have all these um obstacles and the culture in in the home and in your make up your personality or gender plays a role in that how do you begin to counteract\nThose to um work with it I guess would be a better way to say it and provide building blocks\nOr that the child like the emotional chart you know how are you feeling today let's move that up to five years old when they are a little more capable of expressing themselves a sissy with a little five year old girl what are we going to do\nWell and it's interesting 'cause boys have a hard time expressing which is our first milestone in perspective as a second one which would really be regulating and that's where girls struggle little bit more is in the regulating of their mission because there's so much more aware of it and and I've started one of our building blocks that we talk about but\nIt's really borne out of counseling with girls I've started doing something called a scale where you know we think about emotions on the one to ten scale and you all know having children yourself some of them just lean towards ten on everything sadness anger embarrassment worry that they live at ten and and because I work primarily with girls I call it a drawing I'm I'm at her\nAnd my mom monitor yeah I I could use one of those yet\nAnd so what I Will do with families is in a calmer moment for a child who lives it tends to have the parents say to them\nTell me what a ten would be on your scale you know what's the saddest are the worst or the scariest thing you can imagine happening and so they name that early on just like we're talking about naming our feelings and then when the child gets in the car and says this is the worst thing I've ever had in my whole life\nYou can say gosh that sounds really hard 'cause we always want to start with empathy that sounds really hard to tell me what number you think it was on your scale and then that some automatic perspective that that child in particular doesn't have\nTo say I don't want to let go of this because again in your book the stumbling blocks that you identify a for girls in addition the one you just mentioned like the pressure to please yeah that's a big one of the pressure to perform and the need for control\nI mean I I most women listening right now are going yes I still struggle with struggle with those things 'cause that and again it's not to this merger demeaned this is just wiring issues you know and this happens\nAnd that's such a big part of it because I think as we talk about the net it components that from the earliest stages girls are kind of defined themselves against this backdrop of relationship and so that need to please comes out of that is born\nHow do we equip our daughters and at what age and again I Want to move kind of the age continue if you can carry it all the way through from a three or four year old up to sixteen Seventeen year old\nHow do we give our girls equip them to avoid the pressure to please that if you can achieve that as a parent in your girls that is a milestone in a city that is an incredible achievement how would you go about that just take us all the way through\nOne of the things I talk with parents of girls of all ages about is a combination of kindness and strength and how often we lean towards one or the other that we either just\nDon't have a voice at all and so we don't ever stand up for them ourselves themselves or were really strong and we have these strong boundaries and were unkind in the midst of that and so\nTeaching girls from the earliest stages to say things like\nI Want to play with you but not when you treat me like that you know how different for a woman that my adult relationships would be if I learned that they were at ten or at fourteen what that looks like in a friendship I Want to be your friend but I'm not going to continue to hang out with you when you're posting like that about me on social media are when you're relating to me and\nThat really is the strength to be able to say that they feel safe going on there and voice to adult express a how give me a practical example of how you would do that at age eight\nAre you taking your daughter's side if you observe something and say hunting here's a better way to handle that or if she comes to you in tears because she was overrun by a friend gave me an example of how the players\nAre magic formula we get you over and over our empathy and questions that sounds really hard what do you want to do about that what do you think would help where it's her voice starting to say this is what's going to make a difference and were empowering her rather than when we say I want you to go right back after and you tell her\nShe doesn't get to tell you then all of a sudden we're saying you can't figure it out\nI'm going to tell you what you need to say if you don't have it inside of you that's really critical we want her to feel like she's got it\nAnd that really is true all the way along that continue on my own age was at the same question let me uh let me ask you this\nDavid when it comes to the boy side of that you know these things that we just expressed the pressure please the pressure to perform the need for control what's early in the boys' development that would be similar to those things but more boyish\nOne of the first and biggest obstacles for boys is going to be\nHis hardware and we're kind of back to those differences and I talk early on about how emotions for a boy have a lot of physicality to them so it's white toddler age boys are so prone to\nBiting kicking screaming teenage boys are so prone to punching a hole through a wall yelling moving toward disrespect and so part of what I Love to do with boys and parents are boys is helping them understand that's a normal part of how God hardwired you like you need an outlet to channel that intensity that physicality so with\nToddler age boys for example I have twin boys when my son's for three years of age we we purchased one of those Bozo Bopp it's like an inflatable something was saying in the bottom where you could punch ...\nBelt that goes into the ground and springs bad yes and it would\nBounce right back up and and a part of what's happening and that is is that we're training boys to recognize when our bodies are sending a signal or sirens or alarms are going off inside of us that if I don't channel that physicality in a direction that's constructive or healthy\nIt'll come outside\nThis focus on family broadcast will continue in just a moment [noise]\nWho do I perform for\nReform for all

figure out what is it then I'm feeling so that I can figure out what to do with\nDavid Thomas is with us again along with his co author and co workers to see golf and they're going to share more about

chart that we mentioned last time at focused on the family dot com slash radio John how are you feeling today\nA ad Andrea I'd rather not talk about a gym I answered the question I have it in and says the welcome back pain where do you have to be that David Thomas you not the guy that invented the Wendy's hamburger I Wish I had an inherent and I just want to get better connection\nUm we uh ended last time talking about um you know the impact of data on the daughter we talked about boys and how they respond to mom and some of those basic things identifying the stumbling blocks as you call them\nUm and says you talked about a control of a little girl what she's developing their kind of the insecurities of that wanting to be perfect that idea of perfection\nAnd again if you miss that get it I Want to come back to that briefly on the anxiety side um and this can be both a mom or dad but when you see an anxiety and a child what do you normally see in the parrot\nMhm well there's a lot of research that said things out as a childhood epidemic in America today I think from our camping out because we would say anxiety as parenting epidemic in America today\nAs a parenting epidemic his parents are the ones who were anxious and we're transferring it to our\nCat yes yes and some of it I think is really ever compensating that I think we all are kind of near the same age and we grew up in a generation where we weren't talking our feelings\nAnd our parents were often asking us about our feelings and so maybe we had anxiety and no one ever name and so we're seeing parents who are over talking with their kids and\nAnd really trying to step in and fix it like you said and basically what experts will say is with anxiety to work three jobs just to be the scary thing and so when we don't ... them or in effect preventing them from working day but they need to do it in a gradual way but they still got to do\nSure give me a handle I'm a mom or dad David you can jump in on the bad side here what does that handle for a quick self assessment that I'm dipping toward anxiety how do I see it in myself with my child yeah what would be some of those\nExperiences if you're doing this then you may be um informing your child and an unhealthy way\nAre you doing it for them or are you stepping in and written moving whatever it's causing the anxiety and fresh like if it's track\nAre you letting her quit the track team immediately without pushing through and having to work a little harder doing homework deal in the homework going to school out of family recently have a lot of kids in school refusal where they're worried about going to school and\nAnd there are ways that you can help them work to do that without just pulling MFL family who had completely pulled their daughter from school and by the time I got with her it was obvious she was in complete control of our house\nAnd that's part of it is they've got to know that were bigger that makes them feel safe yeah\nDavid what about boys in that same way do they suffer from some insecurity uh\nOh absolutely they do and I was even thinking when you were asking that question my parents where I mentioned earlier with boys I'll do a lot of training around listening to your body and figuring out when your body signaling an alarm and I have to do a lot of that with parents\nLike we laugh about how often what parents in our office who will say things like he's so worried and I don't know where that comes from\nReally challenge\nParents hopefully in a respectful way to just say like are you where even right now like your voices elevated your hands are clinched at this point you're yelling as we talk like not listening to signals your own body is giving\nYou the reason for my question is that our self awareness can be really diminished in this area of parity because it's so close and we're going to be far more self awareness social setting in a workplace but at home we're kind of just who we are that's where we're relaxing at least in terms of facades\nWhen we talk a lot in the book about panning out alive and not out of fear yeah kind of the bottom line yeah that is so true and I think the key thing there is\nWhat I'm trying to pull out of his head as a parent do a quick self assessment that I Am a fear based parents and I've got to change\nNo there's no quick way to do that but I'm just thinking of the poor mom or the poor dead listening who's saying okay I think I'd do parents out of fear how do we confirmed that for them ... what would you say\nIn the chapter on awareness we do talk with parents about the importance of not only knowing your stuff checking your baggage but talking openly obviously age appropriately with our kids to to be able to say things\nTo them like you know what I have a tendency to bend toward catastrophic thinking\n[laughter] but I Know where I go\nI go quickly to worst case scenarios and so being able to say those things telling ourselves in that way and understanding what do I need in response to that like we've talked about empathy and questions and coffee and case though the third kind of magical question we talk a lot with parents about his time and space and to be able to say the kids we love you know what\nI'm amped up right now like I'm flooded with worry right now like in this moment I don't feel like I'm In my eye with boys that caught your dinosaur brain or you're thinking brain you know your emotional brain you're thinking brain for us as parents to be able to say I'm not I'm not thinking brain right now\nI Love you too much to argue so I'm going to go take Fifteen minutes to walk the dog\nDo whatever I Need to do at this point and then we'll come back together and talk so that I'm not parenting out of fear so they're not parenting out of emotion when we're emotionally charged kids or adults in those moments it's like what happens when I go to the grocery store on an empty stomach I just I don't make an awful decision\nLet's move to empathy talk about the importance of empathy what empathy is in teaching your child how to uh express sympathy it's kind of a big question there but really the one who just kick it off maybe\nA short definition would be a vocabulary the mountain of vocabulary reading emotions empathy is responding to emotion so it's the ability to kind of look at you and have some sense of what's going on inside of you climb and do your shoes and we know there's so much research out there that continues to come from that empathy is one of them those\nFoundational ingredients and healthy interpersonal relationships of all kinds\nMarriage relationships parent to child co worker relationship so we don't really need to have much of any conversation about whether we think it's important or useful it is no doubt about it and the research continues to confirm it so\nKind of where we go in the empathy chapter in every chapter is breaking down what are the stumbling blocks for boys whether someone blocks for girls were the building blocks for boys building blocks for girls and then at the end of every chapter is ten practical easy user friendly ways that a parent can be doing this in your home every day\nWell let's go with the boys one of the stumbling blocks have been one of those uh antidote to help them\nAnd to better understand it is critical so you're not freaking out the mom and dad saying oh my goodness we have an ax murder you know this is a nurse assistant personnel that would not be a good thing but it's being mindful of it and taking the long view and understanding where you're at I'm David let's go to the the\nBoy maybe that little boy and they're expressing a blame or avoidance or deny all kinds of stumbling blocks for that little boy when it comes to resourcefulness what is resourcefulness and what are the stumbling blocks look like\nResourcefulness is really taking the emotion to something constructive it's problem solving strategizing it's critical thinking and it's kind of part of that to part agenda we talked about earlier figuring out what do I feel and what to do with it it's the what to do with it part and\nIn boys I Love helping boys developing this year because I think again as males were kind of natural problem solver so this is flexing a little stronger muscle but the three someone block she mentioned are kind of his biggest road blocks of blame avoidance and to not have that acronym of bad\nIn the book because I think boys do a lot of in the face of failure in the face of your difficulties swinging between blame and self hatred somewhere between\nIt's your fault and I'm an idiot and they have a hard time getting to that good healthy middle space like I had a conversation with an eleven year old boy just yesterday my office and he struck out three times in the same baseball game\nAnd he was talking his way through it and the things I heard from him where those two extremes like the\nPitcher couldn't even throw the ball there's lying\nAnd then he got to at some point in teary moment on the worst player on the team but nowhere in the middle was the sense of I had an off day\nRamis practice one day this week and I was a little bit you know not as in my in my read them they were all these different factors that I had to lead into that he just couldn't get too easily on his own and so I think as long as a boy swinging between those two places it's really hard for him to develop\nHow how does a mom or dad minimize that pendulum effect how do you narrow that in what can you say that will help them cope better and equip them so I\nI Do think that empathy and questions formula is really useful in these moments of that sounds hard sometimes when when they're stuck in blame it's tell me what you think your part was in it what was your contribution or we laugh I have a story at the beginning of that chapter about one my sons were six and\nThis is an example of how early it starts with boys we had a soccer game or run around the house on a Saturday morning and my son walked up to my wife and said what did you do with my soccer cleats like nothing's been thought to say did you see where I left and you have any idea where I put them\nAnd so in those moments rather than just again coddling like I'm going to go to finding them for him\nYou know my wife with him and said I didn't wear them I didn't wear those with not black skirt she was all playful for a moment like where did you leave him last year like helping him move towards some problem solving on his own as opposed to doing it for him but not letting them stay stuck in blind\nAt that is really helpful I'm I'm thinking of that just in my own parenting my own father and those are good things to come back around on and when you notice them not doing as well as sympathetic questions I like that I'm Suzie how about for the girls when it comes to resourcefulness what's their stumbling block and what's the building blocks for them\nI think girls for any of us when we come up to read block resourcefulness is really working our way around it and I have more and more girls who just sit down by the red block some of them plant flowers and let him drop or they don't even care about getting around it and\nWhy is it important right\nYeah and so motivation is one of the building blocks that we talk a lot about and I think sometimes were imposing our motivation on them rather than helping them find their ... and so we keep going back to empathy and questions but I think even in those times when the questions I asked them most and my counseling offices what do you want\nWhat do you want to happen here what do you think again is what do you think's going to help\nI Want to end with this question in for each of you to answer this because I think um you know you're doing counseling you have the technique\nSort of counseling a these are things that we believe as Christians are are rooted in biblical truth I think we can all agree to that\nWhy do you think God does it this way I mean when you look at the uh little years of trying to teach them and then those hormonal adolescent years and then\nPuberty hits and you've got the teen years when you're looking at the big picture what just got one from us as a parent as a father David and as a mother Cissy ...\nI Would say I think what he wants most\nFor me as a father is that to be transformed more into the image of his son and what's the use these beans to disrupt me take me to the end the myself and help me figure out I'm making more of a mess and I'm\nDoing it well and a lot of moments and that there's grace for that and we talk about this and spiritual milestones of just\nHow we cannot really understand the beauty of grace unless we understand the depths of our neat and so\nI think that's more what it's about for me more than anything sissy\nIn that mob space the mom that's to her wits and she's so worried\nShe's

this race track it's all one mile lay out but not like any other one mile in the world to cover the actual pours off turn it down to the back straight away my bag leave from right here in Milford, Delaware baggage\nOh good afternoon everybody we're position on top of the clothes grandstand halfway down the back stretch got a great view of turns one or two and three and four of the quarterback twenty four degrees here at the monster mile we always talk about the drivers it's like a rollercoaster here at Dover while you come out the front stretch it\nAbout thirty foot drop down to the bottom of turn number one and because these cars are going so fast it really loads up the drivers the jeep horses or felt at maximum\nIntensity as they dropped down into these corners they pick up the throttle very fast they're in the gas before they reach the Centre part of the corner and then they rocket up all the facts straight away and they're in lies challenged number one there is a war that wraps around on the inside of the racetrack\nTo keep the five eight smile harnessed ... separated from the one mile automobile racing track on the outside and because of that wall wrap around that creates a blind the back\nThese guys are committed to the throttle when they come alternative or two if somebody gets crossed up\nEverybody comes piling in we have seen it time and time again here at Dover and it's something you do not want if it works well you're up onto the backs right away a five seconds sprint down to the back stretch and then he had died back down into turned three and repeat the process it's a handful that's why they call it the monster mile and we're positioned halfway down the back stretch to cover it all\nIt's all for you here this afternoon at Delaware Dover

stop at least one time in each of those first two stages not hearing anybody's going to split the difference because you're going to lose two labs\nLess you're just right up on the leader of you're not within four seconds later you're going to lose two labs and you're not going to be able to get the wave around and that's going to be too risky but we're not hearing the teams are going to say all the way so that Ninety to Ninety five laugh when they're hearing the first off probably gonna be somewhere\nIn that eighty to eighty five laps and I always said we've also heard different things about higher where and how they're going to utilize those eight says center city in the boss\nAt different ... different ways of thinking here and I think it all Winston depends on how your cars handling if your car handling well\nWell then you're going to be able to do right side tires only and I always thought yesterday and the expert at erasing it necessarily work for granted Jones\nBut with these cars and the way they're set up a load of the ground they can get away with that according to some crew chiefs however the costs not running quite the way you want it to the handling is not there
