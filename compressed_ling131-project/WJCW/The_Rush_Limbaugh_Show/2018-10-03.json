Johnson sea Kingsport Bristol accumulation gyms motorcycle sales on the motorcycle mile west markets re Johnson City\nDue on the shore outcome fight Mike moss the FBI could ramp up its investigation\nToday the sexual assault allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell says protesters will not intimidate supporters from confirming\nKevin all there is no cats in the world they're going to scare us\nOut to do in our new President Trump mocked accuser Christine Blasey Ford last night at a rally in Mississippi and independent senator Angus King was among those critical of the comment\nYeah I watched it two or three times it it made me feel sort of sick I I I don't understand why felt they had to do that handful\nOf senators are undecided on Kavanaugh their votes could decide whether Kavanaugh wins confirmation attorneys for Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke charged with murder when the shooting death of Laquan McDonald or expected to rest their case corresponded why and you know and this was\nYeah yeah yeah I'm On to talk about what Trump there the Trump did not mocked her last night he made fun of her ... she did not imitate the way she speaks\nAt that but look I understand Republican senators being alarmed about that but you gotta look at it as a trumpet simply providing cover Trump is giving them\nHey ed to go ahead and vote the way he and Trump said what needs to be said but these guys aren't going to say it\nHurt timeline alone has shifted\nWhen do you think this incident when Kevin all the alleged incident happened because she is described it as early eighty to mitigate eighty two sometime in eighty three heard timeline is changed based on who she's been talking to\nAnd that has been documented the fact that she has lied openly now about not knowing anything about polygraphs and not helping people pass them there is a signatory to one of the support letters written for her Monica McLean retired F. B.\nI. special agent her best friend for a wife\nAnd she is named as one of the people that Dr forty helped pass a y detector tests in her appointment application for the FBI\nMonica McLean issued a statement the ABC I have never had Christine Blasey Ford or anybody else prepare me or provide any other type of assistance whatsoever in connection with any polygraph exam I have taken it anytime\nI ... I think they've been caught big time and I'd Rachel Mitchell if I have the time I I just got enough data on this right before the program again I didn't have time to assemble it but the questioning\nThat we all thought was a waste of time has exposed potentially Dr Ford just so many lives that if it ever came became necessary to use them she could be destroyed the credibility credibility can be destroyed\nA and I think everybody is going to try to get past this or through this with out\nIn the in a challenging or Dr Ford because she's a elicited such sympathy\nAnd one of the way she did that was with her speech pattern which I Am one of the only people in the media that I Know of a pointed out her speech patterns I look I'm a professional and highly trained broadcast specialist\nVocal work\nA voice capabilities voice talents [laughter] excuse me again art that I may have gotten it out there that time we'll see\nAre especially of mine I recognize speech patterns I Am able to attach speech patterns to personality types you can definitely do this\nWell a voice actress in a highly ...\nDecided to post on Twitter her impersonation of Dr Ford afterwards and the Twitter universe came down on this woman on mercilessly so we have not mentioned her name it's out there but I Want to protect her\nOr at least here from any further assaults\nTaking place but here he is what she posted and it is so spot on\nTheir merit anybody in person and have a ... ... ... ... ... that's that's how I found an hour at AT T even ...\nI talk about an attack on the ground and right now and I found out about that that hates gr piety\nHer as far as the baby even now I'm back on a really yes that's correct a day and so now has kept me by down ... or ...\nUm bad he can rest and tonight that Ninety [noise] sad [noise] Atlanta I'm In town for their privacy by yeah\nAnd ... that that speech pattern what does it make you think you're dealing with a child here the elite up talking at the end of every sentence that\nFits volunteer ability is its fragility almost in a way or maybe even somebody nervous and traumatized and scared and that is exactly\nThe a personality that I think she wanted to ask facts and she succeeded with it and it's because of\nThat but I think I don't no matter what has learned about her and how much she has\nLived if you will a which again Rachel Mitchell has if necessary [laughter] could blow this woman out of a water that's what I had no one else has put this together by the way that I've seen I've just in random show prep Reno story here story there I've been noticing things\n\nWill be a little reference to what Rachel Mitchell asked her about subject a and her answer it and you read another story and there's one more reference to Rachel but you could put all these together\nAnd it it\nIt's almost as though Rachel Mitchell knew going in that she knew a lot more about balls the Ford than anybody has eluded to she knew about Monica McLean she knew about the polygraph you don't know why she asked him this\nWhy why are you this is not what this is about chemical why are you asking her details to confirm about her story instead this prosecutor was asking all about seemingly unrelated or not really important things\n\nSo we will just have to say again Monica McLean retired FBI and this by the way brings up or conjures up\nFBI\nFord has a best friend and the FBI who read resigned retired in two thousand sixteen a wonder how many people\nWorking on the Trump case that the FBI druthers they have this collusion that Dr Ford in Monterey McLean no\nMatter what kind of a possible connection here is there maybe\n\nSo it's it's it's I'm fascinated as is the letter from the from the ex boyfriend\n\nAnd the primary reason the ex boyfriend says he broke up with her is how she lied about using his credit card he took her name off a credit card when they broke up and she can tend to use that she charges about six hundred bucks on\nA board was asked directly in the hearing if she had given tips on how to pass a polygraph she said\nNever never\nRachel ... have you ever given tips your advice to somebody who was looking to take a polygraph\nTest never remember when that question was asked I Do see what the hell was this\nNow Senator Grassley has been busy refuting claims made by ... and others Grassley is on fire by the way Grassley is doing such a bang up job\nAs his his staff here\nAt Grassley sent a letter to Ford's attorney telling them about the ex boyfriend seeing her coach somebody on how to pass a lie detector test\nAnd has again we ask\nFor the therapist notes and the polygraph the audio visual they want to see it rationally and the committee want to see the notes of her meetings with her therapist and they want to see the polygraph test that Ford took and Ford's lawyer's have returned reviews attorney any of that over\n\nSo they're not being forthcoming with things that that are a crucial now Dianne Feinstein has made a move to steal the FBI investigation I think they think that cases collapsing and you know what I think\nEvidence of the case collapsing is this New York times story on Trump's taxes\nThat's the first thing I thought when I saw that's New York times story because they've been sitting on this so long that Showtime hasn't been able to prepare a TV documentary on it\nSo Showtime which is owned by CBS\nBeen working with the New York times on this documentary on the ...\nThere were two people in the truck no injuries were reported a Johnson City moment places

of Trump's taxes now I I don't know where they got the returns that it's illegal that they have them\nObviously somebody up the IRS doesn't care I mean the left is infiltrated everything is obviously that's how this happened what does it matter wants to the times has um that that but they've had them now for a year and note when the story runs\nThey ought not be trying to crowd out the Kavanaugh story right this is something ideally you'd want to wait until closer to the election\nYou want to maybe wait a couple of weeks but no they ran this thing yesterday and now there's a companion Showtime network documentary on this so there's been some collaboration might even say some collusion on this\n\nWhite cover up the Kavanaugh story with the this is providing a huge challenge for the cable news networks what to do what to do we got Trump out there they claim he's mocking Boise forty wasn't marketing or\nWalk I I understand Republican senators saying what they're saying oh my God this is on the subject I don't know why president that he did it for some reason\nEverybody's pointing out that the Trump just last week was saying she was very credible yeah he did and we knew when he said that why he said it\nHe had to everybody has to\nBefore all this is a investigated and put your but you can't run out there\nAnd start ripping on her even if it deserved even if it's warranted last week you could not respond Christine balls before there was nothing there is no upside to doing it no matter if you were right\nEven if she was lying to her teeth and you can demonstrate last week was not the time to do it so Trump joined the chorus I find a compelling I find her very credible will now\nShe's not so credible she never was but now she's not so credible as all kinds of holes in Trump just pointed out all Trump did is playing out the flaws in her story which should have happened\nDuring the hearing last Thursday but the Republicans were not going to go there and they were not going to challenge or because it just wasn't\nSmart\nEspecially with that voice that she was affecting the go after her in any way that would seem like an attack or like you didn't believe her whether or not been politically useful but in a in a normal rational hearing\nCommittee hearing her allegations would be challenged in tested they were not that's all Trump did\nTrump pointed out the mistakes or the ... or the difference is the prevailing occasions she can't remember where when who the people she says ... says they weren't that's all they did Republican senators should have done that last week but they put\nSo Trump's given uncovered Trump's writing shade for them and let them go out and rip him for doing it if they want to understand that by this time we have to assume Trump knows what he's doing when he goes off script he doesn't step in it\nIt may look like it but he doesn't but that's not the big take away the big takeaway for me is this one you know you know John it was it's been investigating that Trump's for forty year they've got tax returns going back who knows how long\nAnd guess what's not part of the story I guess what is not part of any income tax story on Donald Trump guess what one word you do not see in the report anybody want to take a guess\nWhat did you say no that's not the word\nWhat one word is not in this entire New York times story I'll give you a hint\nIt was the sole reason the last one I didn't get their hands on Trump's tax returns\n\nRussia at ten for that yet they want in Trump's tax returns because their tax returns they said would prove Trump\nPolluted because his money came from Russia because his wealth was because and due to Russian connections that's what everybody on the left was convinced\nWas true and now here's the New York times story year long investigation Trump's taxes going back more than forty years and they're not able to find any Russian money\n\nSo now they didn't find any Russian money and I guarantee you they expected to\n\nThey're the ones that said this they're the ones that said I'm Talking about everybody on MSNBC CNN going back a year ago back to the two thousand sixteen campaign when everybody was hell bent on proving\nThat Trump was they put in storage\n\nTrump once it totally Trump was compromised by Russia because it was Russia that enable Trump to get rich\nAnd his tax returns would prove it they said so I guarantee you when the New York times got these documents the first thing they did\nWas make a B Line key word search however they search it looking for Russia Russian Russian names answer big fat zilch zero not so now they're on to something else now they're back to what's always been said about Trump that he got rich from is that\nNow they're saying and all kinds of phony entities were created like shallow corporations\n\nAnd other things for Trump and his siblings not just Trump trumpet his siblings ... money from the IRS which of course they say is fraud during all of this time forty years you're think\nSo not only do they live in denial than it ever happened now they're trying to shut down anybody who brings it up you know the Clinton years in what they did the women supposed to go down a memory hall\nNow I have a transcript an anti Kevin all protester with confronted I'm a Republican senator and he pushed back\nThis was an attack or a confrontation walking down the hall or any Kevin all protesters have flooded Capitol Hill and they've been around to get into the hallways of the offices\nIn Senate office buildings how does that happen\nBut what we all know that what happens but they're they're one of these protesters approached Republican Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana on his way through a Senate building walkway Monday\nAnd she said why are you supporting Kevin up where are you supporting capital Cassidy did not ignore her he took the chance to push back he asked her if she would like it if her loved ones were destroyed by uncorroborated charges\nCassidy why wouldn't I support Kavanaugh protester because rapist or bad Cassidy wait a second everybody there Senate didn't happen either rape anybody so why am I gonna so you're going to you're going to believe mark judge over a woman no I'm going to believe her best friend\nWho says it didn't happen she wasn't there\nHer best friend didn't say didn't happen her best friend said she wasn't told about it her best friend said she didn't remember it\nProtester so you're okay as a doctor to harm a woman Cassidy wait a second you okay as a person to go ahead and do accept the non corroborated charge to destroy somebody's life\nIt would destroy your wife your son's life or your husband's wait a second answer my question if it was your husband your son your father whose life has been destroyed by uncorroborated when you write that protester I Would support a full FBI investigation we're dealing with a program robots I'm Glad Cassidy push back but it's a lost cause on the protestors\nProtestors not even hearing what he says she's got program dancers bought and paid for by George Soros\nAnd she hears key words and what he says knee jerk reaction causing things replies accordingly\nCast that you know no would you like an on corroborated charged destroy I wouldn't marry somebody that was a drunk said the protestors hold on wait a minute uncorroborated answer the question I don't think you're able to because you know it's unfair protester I Would stand up\n... you know it's unfair protests I Would fight it would make sure women or heard clearly you're okay for rapist goes on the Supreme Court castle you know not\nBut then on the other hand clearly you're okay the absence of evidence obviously means nothing to you protest there's no there is evidence looking at a standard how many people are in jail for west\nSo what this ... unless somebody like me gets hold of a transcript of something like this and help people understand that it's a total waste of time to engage these protesters especially if you're trying to persuade them you can't persuade them I just like you can't persuade the media\n[noise] you know I'm I've told this story when I was first at this\nVery young wet behind the ears naive and the media wouldn't want to talk I thought just because they're really interested I didn't know nobody's ever heard of me a radio shows taking off I thought they were legitimately curious\nAnd that's how I went\nInto early interviews I found out that's not at all they weren't curious about anything they were simply there to discredit me\nMake fun of me to raise doubts it took me\nLonger than I Want to admit to figure this out you cannot persuade these people you can't change their minds and debate it's

him credibility\nIt makes people kind of caught their head they don't think Trump can be that's fair I'm Talking about the media and the left Democrats they don't think Trump can be that that a reasonable\nBut he does just to them every time it gives them the credibility later\nTo be critical as a step away he said yeah I found her credible I've found a compelling then as we learn more and then as events play out Trump is able to parlay his original statements into what he really thinks based on\nWhat is not any jerk reaction if Trump were to have said initially what he said last night of the rally why there would have been held up pay but now he can back it up now there's all kinds of evidence that her timeline doesn't make any sense\nWe've got an ex boyfriend claiming she is a polygraph expert has taught people how to beat them\nWe have people challenging her account we didn't have that last week it is perfectly fine for Trump to do what he did\nIt gives him a credibility later to be critical step away it's a common technique you use as he does it on everything\nIt's why I've always told you don't take his first draft statement or his first tweet as a sign that he's caving or flipping you people you I'm sure you remember there haven't been many instances in fact I may have fallen for one myself that's how I learned that Trump\nWill tweet something or say something it'll make you look like he's about late ... before he pulled out of a ... the Paris climate accord\nWhat did he say\nClimate change very serious thing and we have to look at it than we are looking at it than will do the right\nTo oh he's on record as being open about then later on when he's learned when he needs to learn comes out tells you what do you think's\nReally thinks it's a pattern it's a technique is a trumped developed I don't even open developed or it's just how he does it naturally and instinctively\nBut I call it pacing now Republicans have not built up this reputation Senate Republicans haven't Trump has Trump has established\nThat after he makes it an initial statement on something that he can make fun of things and what really irritates the left he gets away with it I cannot\nTell you how ... irritates them see he shouldn't have survived the Access Hollywood video he shouldn't have survived anything they've thrown at him the fact that he has and continue to prosper and triumph I cannot tell you how the lions Lee insane it has made them with rage\nOther Republicans have not developed a going adds to do this\nAnd pull it off\nTrump hasn't been attacked so much we're now if you go back to two thousand Fifteen when this campaign started this is two thousand they did was three years\n\nIn fact it's it's it's three years in three months Trump gets in in June of two thousand Fifteen Trump has been attacked so much he doesn't care anymore\nIt doesn't bother him anymore is my point he's not willing to take the arrows he's willing to take the hits for everybody else that's why he is needed smokes he is willing to do what he did last night I Know\nMurkowski and Collins or shuttering cowering in the corner with the vapors\nOh my God it was horrible it was so ... was a horrible everything he said is true\nIt was not mocking her the actress video audio we played mocked both before\nTrump didn't\nHe just said we probably she she can't backup she cannot corroborate there isn't any cooperation for what she said why is that not relevant why does that not matter\nWhy have we gotten to a point where any woman can come forward and accuse any man of anything and it's gospel\nAnd then be joined by a so called movement called me to wear all women can joined the can you imagine if there was something going on they can you imagine if men organized for the express\nPurpose of destroying women\nYou can't even imagine it can you\nYou can't even imagine to organize movement the male version of me to\n\nWill rush ... million women or nor do the research we well yeah yeah that does happen but that's not the point this is not about even ban and set it this is not just about sexual abuse this is about Raul power this is about female rage\nBecause of things that have happened to them the leftist women\nAnd they have organized all of these disorders into a giant political movement I'm just asking you to think can you ever can you envision\nA movement of men\nIf if such a group existed and Oprah Winfrey had invited the leader on her show he'd been thrown off and the first ten minutes and it been ridiculed and make one up in the rest of his life you could not happen\n\nWomen are a minority and supposedly even though they're not\nUh in numbers\nBut it's so out of balance all Trump\nDid\nWas say what everybody following this knows even the Democrats the Democrats know all kinds of holes in her story\n\nTrump doing what he's doing provides a lot to cover for a lot of people as one of the many reasons why he's needed\nTrump said guilty until proven innocent that's very dangerous\nFor our country that's what this is that's what the Democratic party has in store and that's what Democrats senators have said that the accused has to prove we didn't do it that the accuser doesn't have to corroborate anything the accuser doesn't have to prove anything where in what civilized society is that ...\n\nTrump said guilty until

Rush Limbaugh the network books you're here is the there's the James of the gym and\nGuarantee quote from a National Review um the more time I spent covering politics the more I'm convinced that a significant chunk a grassroots political activists are not really arguing about politics at all\nThese people are actually struggling with personal psychological issues and projecting them onto the world of politics bingo I've been searching for that description for years\nI have no problem admitting that I was unable to put this together it's one of the rare moments I was unable to this is exactly right\nWe're dealing with people who have suffered some kinds of psychological disorder they've turned to politics\nFor the solution or the written Ben is actually what they're looking for and they don't just want revenge against who ever did whatever to them they are now demanding that every representative of the group that ... or the individual that did something can be made to pay a price for it\nThat's what the ah this this um [noise] well\nThe me too movement in large part was never bipartisan it was thought to be said to me but it never was\nA and even if it if you okay even if it was it's been co opted by the Democrat Party look at look at the uh [noise] Occupy Wall street move by looking black lives matter I take take any left wing group that you want it's made up of people\nWho for some reason I think they have been unjustly mistreated by somebody\nAnd instead of dealing with that in their lives they enter politics and they demand that the Democratic party take up the cause of the Democratic party willingly has the Democratic party has become the party\nOf all of these disparate constituency groups\nWith their singular causes because the Democrat Party realizes that they can combine all of these things into a singular assault on the concept of America that America is responsible for what happened to these people\nThey capitalism is responsible that the power structure that the founding is responsible\nAnd so people with psychological disorders are being granted the status of normalcy\nAnd then the big donors come along and underwrite them and fund their efforts and they become political movements\nAnd then they become victims and then of course allows him to blame everybody for what has gone wrong in their lives and then they demand reciprocity or revenge or what have you and I can tend to do that most people in our side have no idea how to deal with this\nNo idea whatsoever so we ended up and debates about whether\nBoys want to pretend to be girl so they can go on the girls' bathrooms and becomes legitimate\nSick it ... it in in many it's not that specifically but just the whole\nConcept of what is happening here and it is a virus\nBullying intimidating\nMovement that has been constructed to push all of these disparate various agendas\nAnd the target is America the target is America is founded the target is\nAmerican Capitalism and so when our caller says that Kavanaugh is simply a stand in for men who have abused every woman out there he's right balls\nThe Ford will end up being supported by other women who have been abused whether she's telling the truth or not it doesn't matter because it didn't happen to them these women we do know that are out there watching this it did happen to them and by God somebody's going to pay for it in this case I mean capital that's how they're going to be heard\nRather than just deal with the specific incident that happened to them it's the same thing I think with\nBlack lives matter or the NFL players kneeling for the anthem\nA all cops are bad every white ... every black convict is in is\n\nIn every instance here points to the country at large as being responsible in unfairness in biased in discrimination it racism all of this the Democratic party is the organizing party the collection agency for all of\nThese complaints\nDemocrat Party he's happy to make victims out of anybody who wants to be one\nAnd Democrat Party is happy to promise these people that they'll fix it and they never do they never the rage and the anger never ends if only gets worse because the Democrats don't fix anything and finally\nIt doesn't even depend on being fixed it just means somebody's got to pay in this case capital he's got to pay\nWhether he did it or not\nNow Sarah Sanders White House press briefing is going on she just lay the end of the press and she said exactly what I said if I don't mind saying so she said Trump didn't mock anybody last night he simply recites did the facts\nAnd he said all of this can be laid at the feet of the Democrats there to blame for this none of this needed to have happened in public\nThey had ... forge email or in a letter ... way back in July they could have done everything that's been done to investigate her claim off record behind the scenes nobody knowing about it but they didn't do that they waited to use it as a Hail Mary\n\nShe dispute the idea that Trump mocks she said all he was doing was reciting the facts here it is again this is what the press the media everybody is out now ripping Trump claiming that he mocked Christine ...\nHow did you get home I don't remember how did you get there I don't remember where is the place I don't remember how many years go on and I don't\nAnd here is Sarah Sanders from the press briefing just now exactly as I said she got a question from John Roberts and\nIt was all about do you think that maybe the birds we shouldn't have done it marking her like that because you get Collins and Murkowski ended me in the way they vote or what do you think the president for maybe should have not done it\nThe president was gaining the facts and frankly facts that were included in special prosecutor Rachel Mitchell's report he was stating facts that were given during Dr Ford's testimony innocent it has to make a decision based on those facts\nAnd whether or not they see judge Kavanaugh to be qualified to hold the position on the Supreme Court every single word judge Kavanaugh has said it's been\nPicked apart every single word second by second of his testimony has been picked apart yet if anybody says anything about the accusations that have been thrown against them that's totally off limits and outrageous\nExactly right ya can't challenge her so Trump did\nFor everybody else who doesn't have a gun ads to do it\nTrump did it in yeah he's providing the little shade for some of these people to hide under\nAnd I'll guarantee you they may be publicly saying I Wish you hadn't done in such outrageous what prompted their thinking everybody he did it privately\nSomebody has to say it it's the freaking truth\nOkay not back to the phones and we go to Tom's river New Jersey ... is next and he is Fifteen Years old ever him I'm Glad you waited you're next on the program thank you for calling\nHey rushed grade to speak to you again a right to have your back yeah\nGreat to be on again anyways so I'm watching this whole thing on me too movement watching the Kavanaugh hearings I'm I'm Fifteen I'm just regular straight guy\nThat's into abnormal but I think that I really cannot believe any of these women the pop up on TV anymore you can't believe any of them were common old guy raped me the guy did this to me did that to me you know he had to draw on CNN while you are a couple of months ago saying that a guy raped or because he asked her for her phone number\nCan't believe any of them and I think that what this this hold me\nTo get away ... ... ... ... that that is my exact point I Believe that\nWoman I Believe she thinks she was raped when somebody asked her for her number that's how she's been conditioned\nWomen's studies on on campus the the outright hatred for men you know I keep talking about it\nBut it's relevant cats really can and this was back in the nineties she was a professor of women's studies at Michigan She taught women in her class the all sex is rape even the sex of marriage the women were lapping up\nAnd women have been taught for two generations now that men are basically predators and that their own kids are not safe from their fathers\nAnd it's not random it's widespread it is part and parcel of higher education today so you have a woman and she could be acting I mean she could be making this up could be a political activist but it's entirely possible at the same time out from\nThat the cause of what she's been taught\nAnd heard on the news and talking to her she may literally believe that memory I have no right to ask for her phone number is the same thing as bullying her raping her that's my point she may really believed it\nGoes well rush of you know the same woman that are screaming about how they've been raped or off the ones who want to have the right to having abortions it so they could have unlimited sex\nOr have you\nEver um [noise] um you're right sex without consequences but you better not but\nThen they claimed that all men are predators but then they run to run to hook up and then they want to have abortions for free\nWhen it's their idea then everything's fine you\nKnow the hook up at a ride by the way here's this you're\nAlso random it's not all women but it's been\nIt does look like that isn't it the me too movement supposedly include

B. I. D. O. J. people that were doing this\nAnd I think the objective of Christine balls before this whole thing not her specifically but I look I think she's an activist in on it but that's neither here nor there the objective of this was to get Kevin on the withdraws nomination or to have Trump pull it\nNow that that hasn't happened in this case is beginning to collapse you see stories all over the media but how all this so called evidence just isn't there\nThey thought that the mere allegation that that Kevin I Would not sit there and let his life to be destroyed like this they fought Trump wouldn't sit there and let his nominee need be destroyed\nYeah because they think Trump's ego is such that he will not be allowed to be made to look bad because of what somebody else did or didn't do so they fought there would be a giant cave on this and there hasn't been\nSo now it is panic and scramble time\nSo the zero in on the lake\nAnd Trump couldn't hold it in any more last night at the rally he just on ... on the fact that Christie and Ford doesn't have any evidence is changing her story and the media is all over the place now saying well you know this this may screwed\nIt they do mccaskey and Collins they both think that Trump was horrible and they both now might not vote for Kavanaugh\nOkay\nWell ladies and gentleman I told you some things yesterday but I'm sure people have forgotten but there are no different today than they were yesterday\nDemocrats senators in red states are in heat being ... reelection trouble in fact there was news yesterday polling data late polling that we may be looking at a red wave and the Senate not a blue wave\nIn North Dakota which Trump carried by thirty six points Heidi Heitkamp is in deep doo doo after having come out against capital of the latest poll taken after the\nDemocrats began smearing Kavanaugh but before the committee fiasco last week showed that Kevin Cramer to Republican opponent the high camp has opened the ten point lead\nOver I guess\nJoe Donnelly in Indiana and similarly nervous Claire McCaskill in Missouri is losing their her challenger Josh\nHawley Joe Manchin of West Virginia they've all been hoping that McConnell would win out\nOr that some Republican senators wouldn't wimp out and not vote for Kavanaugh so that they would be off the hook and not have to\nLook at words these three Heitkamp Donnelly ... what's actually for Don blamed McCaskill mansion in Heitkamp have all been hoping\nThat Collins caves that maybe even McConnell would cave and ... Murkowski would cave and that flake will continue to flake and cave\n\nBut in their states they're held to pay in their states people want Kavanaugh confirmed in fact in North Dakota voters back Kavanaugh's sixty to twenty seven\nPolling has been gun heading the wrong way for Heidi Heitkamp\nSo my point is it may not it may not matters or matter what happens to Collins and Murkowski\n\nBut if they if they actually don't vote for Kavanaugh simply based on what Trump said last night\n\nWell that would be embarrassing for them\nNow\nSince Trump's on the record as questioning the veracity of Dr Ford I Want to share something with you I found today a power line Scott Johnson one of the contributors a power line\nWrites that a reader of theirs\nNoted the changes in the timeline that Dr Ford herself\nPresented\nThe power line reader refers to himself calls himself an engineer with a specialty in data visualization\nAnd he made a graphic you created a chart in essence based on public sources based on the Washington Post and other legal documents\nAnd it is the dates to varying dates the different dates of the sword did invent Dr ... says happened\n\nAnd the dates float she's not even consistent with the so the timeline of her story doesn't even add up\n\nThe reader notes the sudden story changed correlating with the time progression in the story date column I'll get that isn't just a second his question why the sudden change\nWithin a few weeks after July six of two thousand Eighteen the answer is that's when Dr Ford came into the Democrat orbits of Anna Eshoo Democrat California and Feinstein and their staffs\nAnd the highly partisan Democrat lawyer Deborah cats recommended by Feinstein right after that foreign changed her story two more times in two months\nShe grew more specific after she began consulting with Democrat activists\nAs they conspired to destroy Kavanaugh\n\nSo the charge here and try no tried served a difficult to convey but this is a text charge\nThere is some\nUh some bars in this thing but it isn't titled Dr Christine Blasey Ford's ever changing story multiple inconsistent stories of the date of the alleged incidents\n\nIn the therapist notes the incident is said to have occurred and the men the Nineteen eighties when she was in couples therapy\nThe therapists notes from when she was an individual therapy say that the story occur in not in the mid eighties but the late eighties in her text messages to the Washington Post she's back to saying that it happened in the\nMid eighties and heard a letter to Dianne Feinstein she said the incident happened in the early eighties in the hand written statement at the time she took her polygraph high school all summer in the eighties and early is crossing out\n\nEarly eighties could've been eighty eighty one\nIf the Senate Judiciary committee hearings she said it happened in the summer I'm Nineteen eighty two she had never said that before\nShe had said mid eighties late eighties mid eighties early eighties highschool summer early eighties she specified summer Nineteen eighty to\nThese changes occur as she is in consultation with all these Democrat activists the staff of Feinstein and an Anna Eshoo endeavor cats the lawyer\nAnd hurt changing story leaves her short on credibility put aside her emotional performance\n\nHer testimony reveals her as a witness was memories change at her convenience\n\nThe problem for Dr Ford is not that she doesn't remember everything if the everything she remembers changes that her convenience first Ford's testimony the assault occurred in the summer of eighty two when she would just Fifteen conflicted with both her therapist notes and the text message\nHere is that President should order your phones and ... yeah I forgot to warn people about this to Eighteen today there is an emergency warning system\nTest it just happened to my watch started going crazy and I'm going to delete it
