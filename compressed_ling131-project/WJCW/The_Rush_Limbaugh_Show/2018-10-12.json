the ... murders in Philadelphia got away with the wand and murder of\nThousands [noise] nobody can get\nThe media interested in the story even after he was charged and convicted and put on trial and the reason is that correct guys\nNow [noise] [noise] was the worst thing that ever happened to people who want to keep abortion [noise] [noise] thought of and\nCategorized as something other than what it is [noise] the media wouldn't cover it and nor the trials very much\nThere have been a lot of people who didn't covered Michele market was one of the leaders also people at the end Marcy an hot air was was hot on the trail of guys and I think they rolled over a hundred and\nSixty different articles so the trick has been how do you do a movie about this how do you get it made me in\nMovie equals Hollywood how'd he get stars had to get people to start at how do you get money to finance it how do you get it made and how do you get a distributed it how do you find in theaters\n[noise] that will exhibits that thing how do you do or and they they ran into every predictable problem that you can imagine\nBut they ... and they got it done and the way they got this ... this is a movie about the trial of karma guys now it's it's it's a\nIt's a procedural moving like a procedural crop cop show crime in a cop show on TV meaning it follows a formula\nIt doesn't get overtly political it doesn't it doesn't want to limit the audience by getting political even with a trial this movie has a rating of PG Thirteen and it's about wanting abortion murder\nThere is not a lot of\nHardly any [noise]\nAbhorrent [noise] Gore and violence in the movie it's it's depicted in a in other ways it's not meant to shock it's meant to entertain and educate it's an attempt to you is a movie\nIn a responsible way to do things in movies are supposed to do entertain entertain entertain enlighten maybe informed it's not the political movie that the left with me [noise]\nAbout a story like this I Can't avoid the politics but it is exceptionally well done for the subject matter you're you're not going to be if you go see it you're not going to be watching people advocating for a cause [noise]\nYou're not going to see a movie designed to separate you from your money in terms of political fundraising you're gonna see Hollywood professionals who happens to be pro life producing a movie about something that really happened [noise] a mass murderer [noise]\nHe was a mass murderer of people in the womb [noise]\nThat nobody on the left one at anybody to know about [noise] what he did Kermit guys now was despicable but he was a charming guy even engaging smile and laugh and even and his trial it was said that he was charming people now are oh buddy Nick Searcy [noise]\nDirected this [noise]\nAnd I don't know anything about directing movies [noise] but I can imagine some of the challenges in in a movie like this you don't want to preach and you don't want to make your movie at target but you want to be truthful about it and you want [noise]\nThe message to be delivered\nBut you don't want to turn people off you don't want people to think that you're being they're they're they're being preached or any of that and so\nThe way I looked at it I didn't I didn't see Nick Searcy use a bunch of special effects or other things to distract you just let the story tell itself and it's basically the trial there some set up\nThe story itself is all anybody needs to know the number one mass murder in America which he was never referred to as as because of course the\nLeft abortion is not even human it's a Bible tissue mass or what have you uh it's got [noise]\nStars people that you know people put their careers on the line to star in this movie the odds are that they're going to have trouble getting cast and other movies having been identified with is dean Cain is one\nOf the uh the actor\nIn ...

rush either down in Miami last week and I work I pass by what has to be the ground breaking up the largest mall in the United states\nIt got me to thinking I said to myself this is off Boesky underwater two years ago it was all supposed to be a new or all of Miami and it was based on a two thousand and seven Nobel Prize winning award winner Albert Gore predicted that wall of Miami manmade global warming you\nKnow the rising sea level twenty feet which would be underwater and I just got to think well you know he's not good at predicting the future maybe you can explain the past or someone please explain how about twenty thousand a year why the United states\nThis is really a great point and you're you're you're making a really great point here and and\nBecause it you're right on the money out Gore had said just in general that current shorelines and he has he has mentioned Miami in South Florida in Manhattan\nHe has predicted when they are going to succumb to rising sea levels will be underwater and he did say\n[noise] about Miami [noise]\nThat it was only a few short years at Miami's certain parts of it would be inundated by rising sea levels and one of the places where he said so they are breaking ground on one of the biggest malls in the country\nDo you have to ask yourself [noise] [noise] who in their right mind would go out and get the financing and make\nAll of the decisions and hire all the architect everything else has to be done to build\nA gigantic mall only to realize it's going to be submerged underwater in a few years who would do this [noise]\nWhat kind of responsible planning commission would permitted what kind of developer would waste is money the plate is nobody really believes that where does mall is being built is going to be inundated by rising sea levels anytime soon\nThere's a there's another analogy to this ...
