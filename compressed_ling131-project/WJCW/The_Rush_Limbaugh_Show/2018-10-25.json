they can call him Hitler they can lie about the things he says and does all day long with no recourse that's what Makin and he's talking about here now is Natasha on a top respond\nTo think that the president controls himself as best he could last night at his rally that he was poking fun at the whole idea of oh I'm not going to talk about the things I'm going to be a presidential which is essentially saying to the audience you know what I'm thinking and then this morning he tweeted that it was CNN his fault which basically is it came to a woman gets actually thought that\nWas her fault for wearing a short skirt has been completely\n... saying that CNN and was responsible for that to get the fake news that they're spreading this is no one's fault but the arranged maniac that ascending does\nBut I Hope of all let me just add a van and that's what they want to be on the record of metal pipe bomb showed up and not culpable\nFor the pipe bomb culpable for the rhetoric that we're seeing back and forth CNN you had an anchor on that network indoors to play in Central Park depicting the assassination and the president\nIs saying that the leader right\nNow you heard Natasha on a top there say you really you you want to be on the record saying that when a pipe bomb showed up how about her analogy that Trump blaming CNN is akin to because they got about neighbor she is like blaming a I'm a ... a woman who sexually assaulted blaming her for the assault\n[noise]\nI mean that's that's that's the logic that's the analogy she used okay so so um the conversation continues you're now you're here to senior writer for Washington Free beacon Liz Harrington or join the conversation at resumed here by by Natasha on atop\nThe kind of rhetoric at the pride that unhappiness out saying for years he recently commended that Congress men about body slamming the reporter he has called the ... the enemy of the people have to say that can you paint a legal for anyone who got inside what about the\nLast what about the languages I'm having an outlet and over again that Tom ten times as mild Harrison Brennan\nAnd CNN had a choice yesterday he was told the president come out saying this is abhorrent white America stand for what ... what is the un and she has to make sure we can blame that on the president can blame it on Sarah Sanders John Brennan echoing that how\nDoes that move at Fort Larry Flynt them at Ford fighting they took the low road President Trump put the highlights whatever and Clinton said last week we cannot have stability\nRight we cannot have civility [noise] so what you're heavier you hit on a top actually trying to blame all of this on Trump\nAnd of course using this\nI'm from the high road and I'm I'm from uh I'm from propriety and so just simply because she's on the on the left now before we go to the break\nWe're going to we're going to we're going to switch gears you're just a bit to talk about the caravan\n... I saw this coming up right after I saw the soundbite that you just heard and I switched over to see it and I caught the governor of Ohio there John Case thick and he is being\nInterviewed I I don't know who the reporter was at the CNN another matter ... interviewed about the caravan and America and how to deal with I just I just want you to hear this we have to buy your number one\nWe have a caravan coming north we don't want all those people coming across our border and there are ways to deal with it I Believe that if we would check those who were legitimately in need of asylum could be vetted before they even get to the border\nBut you know what we're born in America you know how lucky we are to be born in America and not be born in Guatemala where they would say to your daughter deal if you don't do what we want we will rape your daughter or we will kill your son if he's not a drug meal\nNow they're marching north and you know what it could easily have been all of us that we're in the caravan there were marching north trying to save our families and save our children\nAll right so what is the ruse here or the technique here is a moral equivalence\nThere but for the grace of God go watch Phil Donahue your sitters all the time bill Donahue and hosts the show and when the subject of illegal immigration would come up he would be he started preaching about the accident of his birth [laughter] no I was born just a few\nMiles inside the U.S border and it's it's what difference it made for me and if they started ... the guilt if he felt\nOver how the accident of his birth resulted in him being an American how basically on there that was\nTo want to other people in the world as though being born into a country of prosperity and decency is something to feel guilty about\nAnd\nIt may be something to feel very grateful for I have no quarrel with that but it's how you deal with\nThis that matters we simply can't take and everybody in the world the answer the solution is to spread our area of dominant influence\nAnd to get rid of tyrannical regimes and dictatorships which treat their people like dirt\nAnd condemn that and do our best to spread our way of life around on the belief that it's good and decent but they're way too many people don't think we're the good guys and they think that the American way\nOf life is an imposition of others and that we don't have the right to impose our views on people but somehow we ought to stay on the side and let everybody who wants to him in because of our guild\n\nAnd he says uh you know ... they're Marjorie nor is it could easily have been all of us that we're in the caravan that we're marching north trying to save our families and save our children\nBut it isn't you know you can deal with what ifs\nIt would be ... and all of that but but it isn't unless you're trying to accomplish something else so here's here's governor cases now continuing as\nThe four lane highways ... good right now Westwood One more and more and listen to a clogged with a mail bomb scare has widened as law enforcement officials see three more suspicious packages today\nTo those were address the former vice president Joe Biden the other two are actor Robert De Niro authorities say they're similar to crude pipe bomb sent the former president Brock Obama Hillary Clinton and to CNN\nNone of the devices exploded no one was injured early voting continues in Tennessee for the November sixth election as we've reported turnouts been heavier numbers could approach those like in twenty sixteen\nElection officials say they're pleased to see this much interest in the mid term there are a couple of high profile races driving the turnout in Tennessee including an open US Senate seat and governor early voting in one week from today November first and remember\nYou must have a photo ID to cast your ballot either early or on election day itself\nPresident Donald Trump has signed into law legislation aims to combat the opioid crisis the bill includes money for treatment law enforcement and more according to first district congressman Dr phil roe we\nCan't just spend this money we we've got to make sure we spend it wisely and then we moved the needle for people have treatment options not jail options and we have to do it when we prevent this before it ever begins that means education starting in the first grade\nThe opioid crisis has been described as an epidemic in Tennessee with northeast Tennessee at the epicenter\nChecking Wall Street stocks are rebounding after a rough day Wednesday that our two hundred eighty two points this hour than as the acts up a hundred and sixty yes and the five hundred and thirty eight or Richard love it's W.
