evil and it's not just like\nAn colonies and mansion it's all the Republicans are hearing it is one of the most disgusting things many of these people say they've ever seen\nIn that regard Jeff Flake and Susan Collins\n\nI think they have to be credited for doing the right thing they are both facing enormous pressures flake is getting pressure like you can't believe for not only members of the pain\nProfessional mob squad on the left but other Democrats\nAre in the Senate and on the Judiciary Committee\nAnd\nI don't think for for as far as flake is concerned he voted today for\nKavanaugh in is it's not technically a vote for Kavanaugh to vote to go to a final vote\nAnd the rule of thumb always says that as these procedural votes goes so goes the final vote but but but you can't make book on that simply because of the ab jak real frightening threats these people are getting\n... and I think the vote for flake today was really hard I'll tell you why he went from being a yes vote to being harassed on the elevator\nTo becoming a yes vote with the FBI investigation he got what he wanted there still leaning on him he's leaving the Senate\nThis was his final term the easy thing to do here would be to vote against Kavanaugh and received the praise of the mob and received the praise of the Democrats and he went ahead and he voted\nIn what many of us think is the right way he did the right thing is going to be attacked viciously\nHe is going to be a cost and by the left\nAll the way through the rest of the day tonight and tomorrow\nThe same thing with Susan Collins a senator from

been ... by them\nBut if you have an if you believe them they can honor view\nAnd yet flake and Collins did the right thing here I only hope that they're able to maintain their positions not Collins has announced that she's going to make a statement after three o'clock today\n\nAnd of course everybody's on pins and needles wondering what that's going to be now they're thinking on this goes that that there is no way she wouldn't vote yes on the procedural vote this morning\nIf her intention is to vote no down the road if you're going to kill the nomination do it now not tomorrow I don't think any of these theories or traditions\nCan be hoisted up and used and relied on I think we're in we're in brand new territory here for a number of reasons I don't think you can say that just

are so as to maybe convert them\nTo what never Trump or anti Trump presents an amazing display of arrogance\nAnd by the way the same can be sent a Republican political consultant they don't care who the Trump voters are all that matters is that they are left out in ... and made fun of so I get a known for my last night\nAnd she is explaining to me what the Kavanaugh hearings have meant and what has happened\nOut there in these areas she has studied and she made essentially two points\n\nOne that something has needed to happen after the two thousand sixteen election to keep the coalition that voted for Trump together now a lot of us of assumed that if people voted for Trump in two thousand six day and that they did so for very specific reasons\nAmong them Trump is alone in fighting the Washington establishment that Trump is alone in in in pushing back against Democrats and the so called Washington conventional wisdom\nAnd then the assumption is that if people knew that in two thousand sixty and if they would not forget that and if they would realize the need to continue\nTo vote in ways that would continue to support and unable Trump to be successful and she makes the point that it doesn't work that way [noise] sadly that\nAfter a single election with the known results something needs to happen besides just another election of party members or Trump is not on the ballot something needs to happen to make those people as eager to vote two years later as they did in two thousand sixteen\nAnd that\nIs the Kavanaugh circumstance in her mind the conservative populists coalition\nThat elected Trump needed something outside of Trump to coalesce around in the midterms in other words in her study of things\nJust continuing to vote for a Party Republicans to enable Trump to keep going was not enough to get them out there\nI don't know why [noise]\nI Would think it would be but she says it's not Kavanaugh however has provided the catalyst because of how Trump voters that per se and specifically the conservative populace coalition perceive the way he's been treated not just by Democrats but by the media and by Hollywood\nA new road project is getting
