mob like bullying behavior it's their only\nAngle [noise] and they're actually paying people to go engage in this kind of behavior\nLet's review some things that were in the news twenty four seven\n\nAnd the reason they were in the news twenty four seven because this was how to drive by media working with the Democratic party was going to get rid of Donald Trump\nAnd yes folks I mean get rid of Donald Trump I I don't think what this has been about is simply waiting until Republicans lose an election and such as the midterms I think they've actually sought\nTo have Donald Trump for being moved from office since the day after the election I guess what ... about that is what the collusion thing is about that is what every one of these stories has been about\nIs somehow magically forcing Donald Trump out of office and effectively canceling the results of the two thousand sixteen election this is not about been not been about setting the table and making a case for removing Trump\nSay at the ballot box and twenty twenty or having the Republicans lose the house in twenty eight teams this has been about literally removing Donald Trump from the White House ... that has been the mobilizing energizing thing that's gotten them all out of bed every day\nEverybody from the drive by media leaders to the Democratic party leaders of the interagency abnormalities that make up a Democrat base\nAnd I mean that specifically I guess one of the reasons why the range and anger is now so out of control is because usually these people are able to accomplish most of this kind of thing against any other Republican\nThey want to destroy Mitt Romney or George W. Bush they pretty much they know they're going to succeed they've tried everything they know what Trump haven't even made a dent really\nAnd it's all been about\nHaving Trump thrown out of office twenty Fifth Amendment that's now that's not two years down the road they how many times they brought up the cabinet needs to get together to determine this man is not that they they want him out of office every day now\nThe failure compounds the raid look at just some of the issues that were twenty four seven for at least two weeks\nAnd then no particular or to hear all of these were designed to take out Donald Trump Christine balls e forward\n[noise] that was a tool for that was get rid of Kavanaugh as well in that case they didn't care if they destroyed Brett Kavanaugh's life his family his career his past his future no problem [noise] that's what they were trying to do\nChristine balls before Stormy Daniels a porn star became a hero to the Democratic party and her creepy [noise]\nPorn star attorney Michael ... who was then touted\nAs perhaps a Democratic Party presidential front runner for twenty twenty [noise]\n\nAnd Donald Trump's taxes that was an issue that was effort investing below the surface for the entire time and then there were a couple of days where it made the lead\nHow about the shooting\nAt the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High school in Parkland, Florida and the creation of a couple of new Democratic Party activists camera hog and I forget the other one how long did that story go on how big a star did they turn camera hog into and\nWhere is he now and where\nIs the issue of gun control where is this story that young people [noise]\nHigh school and college students in had enough and they were going to take control of the apparatus of government and they were going to get rid of guns that are going to wipe out the un alright where\nIs that the day what happened\nOh camera hog is still there and the next time something happens that makes him a useful to be brought back to life there he will be again\n[noise]\nMy point is these are all manufactured [noise]\n\nTailored [noise] people and the issues based on a happening or a moment but none of it is organic or real\nWhat do you mean Russia's soon David ... he's totally real\n[noise]\nAs David Hawk doesn't have an audience David hog did not literally create a bond needed as okay seal protest these people do not have connections with an audience they don't have connections with voters [noise]\nLike Trump ... or like other successful people and media do they have been made media heroes by the media but it isn't real\n[noise] like ... gone but nobody's alarming ... where we miss hawk women we want to see it nobody saying where's hog\n\nI'm that's not a criticism he hasn't had time to build up a connection or an audience point is none of this is real it's all soap operas script material\nWhat's another me too movement\nHillary Clinton has affected we killed that by saying my husband\nYou can't say that he did anything wrong with Monica Lewinsky she was an adult she was consenting adults jihad mile print\n... she was at consenting adults I knew what Bill was\n[noise]\nIt's not abuse because Bill Clinton knew that she was an adult\n[noise] well bye-bye me too movement [noise]\nI mean if the ... random bimbo eruptions unit to destroy women\nClaiming her husband abused them comes up now to defend her\nGuy what good is the meat to move\nAgain another manufactured moment it hit by manufactured my my point about all these is none of these issues or people have the legs to survive on their own without\nThe media fanning the flames or propping them up each and every day that as my precise point Trump doesn't need the media to be who he is Trump doesn't need the media to be elected President Trump doesn't need the media to remain popular\nBut all of these people do balls before and could not come close\nTo establish a connection with serious number of Americans to be able to make herself a public figure without the media making of happened did all Stormy Daniels dental Michael ... you know any of these people\n[noise] camera hog people in the me too movement

I all I can say these are smarter man than I Am\nA navy but but I uh\nThey they seem to your theory is really quite insightful but it requires ... for the Democrats to pull it off\nA lot of Trump voters would have to believe he's not trying not trying hard to ... and ... for the Democrats to capitalize on flooding that his own with four thousand people that get into the country just to demonstrate that Trump pass a bill for wall Trump really can't stop these people that Trump therefore as ineffective\nThose people in order to abandon Trump would then have to conclude he's not really trying very hard I I don't even think they would abandon him this soon yet over\nAll I don't I agree I I Know I'm not and I don't think most of them well but my question is what else do they got\nWell they've got my behavior a lunatic\nInsane range right but I mean on on Trump\nThat they got nothing they can they can put up the Trump hasn't done that he's promised and that's the that's the uh well that's exactly right\nIn the wound right there that was four in the Trump supporters that we haven't got the wall and we want but it's not even you know that they aren't even begin to foundation yet and I think even start so it really aggravates me personally that this is something that they just keep the continuing resolutions and leave things to keep the\nOh hey yeah I'm with you all of that you're talking about all of the spending bills we've had new budget ... we've had continuing resolutions um we Democrats can't stop anything in the house they can in the Senate\nWhat what here's what Trump's up again and I'm ... before you go to I don't want to get your thoughts on the Trump is still up against the fact that leaders in both parties do not want that ball\n\nIt's not just the Democrats are opposing Trump on this it's all so there are a lot of Republicans don't want that wall because of Republican donors the Trump is still pretty much fighting the establishment the swamp on that\nThey they didn't want tax cuts either no they didn't and that there's a lot of other things\nThat they didn't want that he's he's a a that he's come through and he's twisted I'm a into doing what he wants\nOut in many of them are in the ... I think many of the Republicans have bought the idea\nThat Trump was not to be gone or a before now I I I they are so convinced the media will get rid of whoever the media targets I I think\nFirst is certainly the first six to eight months of two thousand Seventeen Trump's first year I think the Republicans didn't do anything to help him because they didn't think he was going to survive\n\nAnd it it that's one of the reasons that the Obamacare repeal and replace didn't go anywhere because the Republicans just bought into the notion that most of the country actually hated Trump despite the fact that he had been elected\nIt's been a slow reversal than a slow realization on a part of the Republicans that Trump is the guy and the Trump is immensely popular particularly on the Republican side\nWell we'll see if this story on the caravan turning around Pompeo is there a palm pale left Saudi Arabia after having that when king Solomon and Mohammed bin so I'm On the crown prince season

the soundbite from the hands of the interview last night uh that Fox has been playing all day long to get people's reaction\nI still say that I think there are things that have yet to happen that are going to determine outcomes in some races the we don't know so it's still very hard to predict Kavanaugh feedback reaction was one hundred percent positive for Republicans and Democrats really blew that\nBut there's four hundred and thirty five of these things I don't know I just rely on hope which is again naive I don't have survey data I don't trust the\nIt hasn't been the rights consistently enough for me the people doing these surveys desperately wants Trump goal and I don't know how they can take that out of their work I don't believe in pure objectivity is like this ... if I put on the spot for addiction but we hold the house and we increase the Senate\nBecause I think that's just I think that's just I think the Democratic party deserves to lose\nIn the single biggest electoral landslide defeat in my lifetime meals they actions they've taken just in the last month\nOkay so that by that by lit up\nThe Fox news channel the day our first stop is America's Newsroom bill hammer a

sites I Do I mean I rent a congressional committee I've been doing a long time\nThere are Fifteen seats that are now gone nine of those in the open seats there's another twenty five to thirty that our our seats that are in play was only about two or three Democrats seats are in place totally on the defense everything has to go our way to basically break even\nLet me run through them and say this is the stuff that I'm going to be honest with you I I Do not get into this stuff this is this is walk a stuff and to me this is totally absent a ... any any one what's the word personality or I mean this is just raw numbers\nUh based on data that is the result of polling and\nI Know as well as anybody that polling sometimes is right sometimes it's wrong and and I just\nSend them to bite [noise] I'm just suspicious of of\nPolling units because I think I don't think these people can take their passion and their desire to outcome\nOut of their work and we know that they know we look in the presidential polls in two thousand sixty and I mean that those people were all literally caught short there was no way Donald Trump is going to win it was just not possible Hillary was going to win a landslide maybe not the biggest ever but Trump didn't have a prayer\nAnd there was one maybe two polls that showed that he was really in it and couldn't win at Rasmussen was when they were ignored\nAnd we've got a replay here's what informs me what makes me make these kind of productions\nIs reality and as I also mentioned last night since ... rock Obama was elected in two thousand eight starting in two thousand ten including the midterms in two thousand twelve [noise]\nAnd the midterms in two thousand fourteen and the election or two thousand sixty in the Democratic party has lost twelve hundred seats\n[noise] the trend is people voting out Democrats [noise]\nAnd that was happening while the Democrats were in the White House with Obama there that could be a factor Obama's gone\nSo maybe the anti Democrat ... is not as high as it used to be when he was there as I Do believe he was a drag on the Democratic party\nBut [noise] then I asked myself what has happened in the last two years [noise] to make people all of a sudden want to elect Democrats again [noise] as everybody's\nTelling us is going to happen house has gone Raj Senate yeah we're probably pick up look up the house is gone\nAnd then they say because rush these house races have nothing to do with any of the way you're looking at this these really local races and they are have have to deal with things that are not on any national radar will not true if these races are being nationalized by the various candidates and them [noise] [noise] but\nAnyway what has happened to make people all of a sudden stop rejecting Democrats or the Democrats have they done a one eighty are made now performing and executing and behaving in ways that make people love them again\nWell no not in a just an insane world the Democrats aren't doing anything that would grow [noise]\nSupport [noise] they're promoting rage and anger there promoting insanity and lunatic behavior [noise]\nSo then okay maybe as a Trump [noise] is\nThere this much opposition to Trump from people who didn't care one way or the other two years ago has the media succeeded in creating a bunch of anti Trump sentiment\nIn a mid term turnout profile of voters well\nThat would have to be what it is because the Democrats are not the Democrats [noise] so I say the\nJustice associated with the Democrats are doing his landslide defeat the Democrats are not responsible for anything good happening in this country [noise] and they're not even trying to be associated they don't even trying to claim credit for the economy they did for a couple of weeks they tried that Obama out rumor Obama's trying to say the economy was his\n... well that would over like a land balloon\nAnd they died with it so they abandoned map and outside\nOf that there hasn't been one attempt by the Democrats to associate themselves with anything good happening in America\nThey have in ... dad continued to try and portray America as this unfair and unjust on desert [noise]\n\nExceptional superpower that discriminates ... that violates that ... that [noise] it's all negative so I'm just ...\nWhere is this body of evidence that suggest that trend voting against Democrats has reversed again I acknowledge house races are [noise]\nAre not the same as a presidential race with a national issues of national turnout on balance Shannon ... dream last night Fox News at night with Shannon brim a wonders what my strategy was\nIn predicting what I predict\nAlmost no calling says that the Republicans are going to hold on to the house so where do you think this is coming from a with Rush Limbaugh what's the fat ends\nI tend to agree with him um and I think what we could be saying is again the phenomena ... the Pony Express called the spiral of silence the shy from voted to the shy breakfast votes is the kind of people who know that it's not the dumb thing necessarily to support a particular view but secretly in the polling booth that's what they do\nThat Steve sheltered and who has a week at a show on Fox and he was instrumental in the Brexit vote in the u._k. and so a\nReason why one was Limbaugh getting this is not a single pulled out of the shows this happened precisely my point is not a single poll not a single poll shows\nSo far this where to conclude and these people live and die by polls I'm telling you folks nine out of ten of people in D.C live and die by him\n... their ... and I really think ah\nIf I Lived in Washington each and every I I don't\nI I wouldn't it be ostracized after not too long I just couldn't get with the program living there I have known that for for many many moons\nIt was you know I tend to agree but I think there's a lot of\nPeople don't tell the pollsters the truth a lot of people don't even

this is George welcome it's great to have you with us George how're you doing\nGreat thanks for taking my call um I was calling I just wanted to make a show that you actually um that you did years and years ago that I thought was was just great to be probably one of the best show ever hacked and we're really simple\nAnd you basically had a roll call and people just called in with their you know start a business is you know small businesses and just talk about\nHow they're doing you know when we're there are\nSeveral yeah yeah you know you don't want that was you know you you what you remember there was a um it was it was a period of time it was the early nineties folks and white collar employees were being laid off executives\nAnd magazines and newspapers like USA Today we're happy they were running stories how wonderful it was that if people are getting laid off it's finally executives it's finally white collar\nPeople and not blue collar people and so I decided we did three days of this we took calls a ... as as best we can manage it from people who had been laid off in their forties\nWhite collar managerial people laid off in their forties or earlier and asked what they were doing about it\nRight and that's what you remember hearing was all these people calling saying\nOne version or another of this is maybe the best thing ever happened to me because I'm finally focused on doing things I Love I finally have because of necessity I'm I'm I'm looking at at the kind of job I've always wanted to have starting a business or what have you and they were\nThey were all amazingly upbeat and positive about what had happened to them not depressed and down the dumps or angry or any of that\nRight now it was it was just it was just I mean it was my my second year in business so I remember I remember it well because there was working in January ... or ... or at least one maybe with another a rip off from that other\nThree day things that are right I just I just think it would be a good a good thing to try you know what I mean just maybe on a friday instead of doing you know Republican good Democrat bad stuff I mean which people the people would want but um\nWell don't don't downplay the Republican or Democrat bad thing because there's still\nA [noise] a whole\nSlew of people who don't get how bad the Democrats are but let me ask you something to do you think that people need to share business people calling in describing how great the economy as before they'll believe it\n\nThat why you want them to hear it so that they'll believe it\nAre you as well are you thinking some people don't believe it or doubt it\nNo I just I just think it's a Brotherhood and I think that it's a way to support one another that run an operator own businesses and I don't think that we get enough credit for what we do because you know like most people I work a lot of hours and I'm I'm I'm grateful for what I make and what I can provide for my family but\nUm it's just it's a good inspiration for the people who do it and we're the people that make this country work\nYou know so that's all I mean it's it's it's a it's a simple as that the way I see it\nWell small business small but there's no question that\nSmall business is uh the vast majority of of employment in the country and some could say the backbone well okay\nI I Do remember that we've we've done a couple of instances of this and it is inspiring to listen to individual stories of people describe how they started their businesses and why and how they're working and why\nThey they are working so I appreciate the suggestion I really do other hosts would\nMaybe get a complex and think GMI failing if the audience is telling me what I but I'm not\nThat week and I'm not I do not have any self\nDoubt so I can take any kind of criticism for anyone and not take it personally so don't ever fear folks telling me how you think I ought to do this because everybody else does too here is George thinking this is Lloyd in in in ...\nMosque in Wisconsin It's your turn Hi how're you doing their young man why not just fine thank you [laughter]\nAnyway yeah man I was listening to a guy named Donald Trump he was in Iowa discussing how he has done over three billion dollars on the wall so they have been breaking the law you had a caller earlier that did not know that\nWell yeah but there's not a Britain has been all aimed at stopping anybody crossing is the point his his point was that the Democrats may be trying to illustrate the Trump hasn't gotten that done isn't going to get it done\nMaybe doesn't really care about getting it remember these people are focused on trying to demonstrate that Trump has a phony is not that we says he is\nAnd they want to distance Trump's voters from them and that's all the callers theory was\n... I don't think that could happen either done too much into a little\nTime oh I don't either get and the leaders but it was it was his theory as to what the purpose of this caravan is\nUh I I Know that there have been a little incremental appropriations aimed at building the wall\nBut his point was how many continuing resolutions if we have independent budget deals if we had and then there's not\nAnd we have control of the house and control of the Senate and there isn't any money in the wall for [noise]\n\nYet not serious money and certainly not serious construction there for his theory was that the Democrats\nAre trying to demonstrate that is never going to happen to Trump doesn't even cared in it and going to happen [noise]\nAnd what better way to illustrate isn't four thousand people storming the border and not\nBeing stopped uh let's see grabs sound bites", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Johnson City", "day": "19"}
