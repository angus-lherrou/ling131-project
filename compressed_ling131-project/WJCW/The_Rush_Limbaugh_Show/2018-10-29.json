never came current events dead but not politics\nLet me ask you this or something like ... or in your opinion and you said you've got some experience with the Hollywood types in Europe here in the opinion can liberate the Jews be anti Semitic when it comes to it when it comes to Israel\nSaid when they did they probably wouldn't say that they were but they they they yeah I mean a lot of them\nOh I Know they wouldn't say they were but could could have said that they were I mean because one thing to\nSay that yes because a lot of a lot of a lot of them also would tell you that they don't even believe in God or racially Jewish but they don't they're not religiously Jewish which I also think it's a load of\nWell you know [laughter]\nI Know there's all kinds of young people justify their existence and all kinds of ways ...\nThey're really they're willing to claim the victim had nothing else [noise] [laughter]\nThe reason I ask you that specific question was because many people do not understand how a liberal Jew is like the New York times ownership and editorial board can be so anti Israel when Israel is\nThis it it it it it's it's the Jewish state and yet there is there's so much\nAnti Israeli sentiment among Jewish people in America that are predominantly liberal that people scratch their heads and do quite understand it\n'cause it's a lot because it's it's anti that religion is not anti Iran they still need the race in order to have racial politics\nBut it's in their religion and time the religion\nYeah because you can't separate the Jewish state from my religion I don't think you can and it you know any any time you're Jewish and you're in a you know you're in a liberal you're in a conversation\nWith liberal and Israel comes that no way that this flame or I'm Jewish but I totally disagree with everything Israel feeling that it yeah that comes up and it's it's really sad\nBut isn't that more disagreeing with the politics is associated with with Israel as a poke 'cause if their entire religion that's big I mean the Jewish religion I mean you've got the reform and orthodox and and and other branches how\nMany different flavors [laughter] um yeah but\nI I don't I used I used to feel that way I feel like it but yeah with a push toward Indians that many theaters they're anti Christian Tito um I don't\nSee them as necessarily being seeing it in Islam but I you know but I Do the it's a it's anti\n... that's exactly right I says where Mrs all headed this is all headed towards atheism anti God that's exactly what is a unifying the people on the left whatever they claim their religious views are\nThe trend is towards atheism and no God or at least agnostic ... because that removes any judgmental isn't right it removes any limits on behavioral morality or anything else if there is no ultimate\nPower that can meet out approve or disapprove of one's accidental one is totally free correct\nAbsolutely\nWell I I just I'm so ... how\nThis of this event in Pittsburgh given everything else that you say that you are the goals of liberalism creep into Judaism and a rising anti Semitism you're right it's it's\nAnti Semitism is rising in Germany and nobody's talking about it is rising throughout Europe and there aren't very many people talking about it so this event in Pittsburgh did it did it adds\nTo any of the uh discomfort or on ease you're having about things in general\n[noise] ah I I I don't I don't feel like that there's a million people out there targeting\nI'd Jews and the way that they would not negotiate up a thing that I think that that these are isolated is an incident in this country that causes the country it's so good that so many people I mean this guy is facing the death penalty he he went he certainly wouldn't be facing the death penalty anywhere else\nAnd I I mean I don't I don't feel unsafe\nAs a person who is Jewish walking down the street because I'm Jewish I and I and I obviously don't think I Trump has anything to do with it at that absolutely ridiculous and it's it's not going to make me not vote in the ... or anything like that\nI Am glad you asked because I'll tell you there's a lot of people that think and there are a predominant bite thank you thank you so much Rachel I prefer this racial for Thousand Oaks California [noise] um [noise]\n\nI don't think these events are going to have anything to do with them in terms of a lot of people do\nA lot of people think it's going to dampen a turnout what you you think I'm wrong or you\n[noise] [noise]\nYeah I don't think it's going to have a thing to do with them in terms like and now after Caesar say a dare I say this year I put my hands together and look to the lord and do I say this\n[noise] ... Caesar sites [noise] and his pipe bombs none of which exploded [noise] ... what do you think\nThe odds are that the drive by the Democrats are thinking\nOh well I don't have to ask as we know what we had people talking about how that whole thing last week was suppressing turnout remember [noise] even Trump alluded\nTo the fact that that story was maybe going to dampen some people's enthusiasm\nRemember that [noise] okay well there were some people I'm sure not too unhappy about\nThat [noise] [noise] and then the second event happened [noise] on Saturday in Pittsburgh [noise] [noise] and\nIt was the to the people to politicize everything [noise]\n\nAnd that's the people I'm Talking about\nThat would be the media and the American left ... people look politicized and of course you've got extremists out there in in the fringes everywhere [noise] who [noise] irrationally try to explain things away [noise]\nBut the people at politicize everything who look at both events through a political mountains\n[noise] [noise]\nHad to be thinking are right now this is going to this is going to really help us in the midterms this was going to dampen turns going to dampen enthusiasm for Trump I have\n[noise] [noise] I have a\nTwo tier early different fish why I did the show opened today but I did I don't think it's going to have that impact on people in fact\nI think

that's its purpose so a shooting anywhere it takes place Phillips says [noise]\nWhat's the president's going to do it by the president nothing to do with it in the first place [noise]\nThe president has nothing to do with gun control laws except as a supporter or opponents Congress writes the laws but the idea\nThat Washington should be able to command anything at any time is what the left wants
