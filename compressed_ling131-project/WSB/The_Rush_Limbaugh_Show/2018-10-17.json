Saudi constantly and disposed up at the council general's residence a short time ago President Trump said the United states has requested audio and video from turkey if it exists\nStill unclear though how President Trump would respond if evidence of a case points to the Saudis ABC News the White House correspondent Jonathan Karl\nDid say that there would be severe punishment those were his words if it turned out the Saudis did this but he has made it clear he doesn't want to jeopardize arms sales he's made it clear he doesn't like the idea of sanctions so it's unclear what the White House would

October's is blown up and now you know they've thought all along the mother is going to get the good on how Trump stole\nThe election by keeping including what the Russians and when this story broke that Mahler is not going to\nDeliver a key findings until after the election you mentioned the anger and the frustration not so much with elected Democrats 'cause they know the they know the game show but they're they're looking to take\nThe reins psychologically screwed up base\nIs probably beside itself because this is really ball game for this is what they have been counting on they have been they bought it they drank the Kool Aid that Mueller has the goods that Trump treated with Russia mother has got it he's going to announce it trumps finished after them in terms wait a minute why\nNow there are two things about this books\nThe rules of this game which are going to be a baby here\nInclude that report such as this from a special counsel will not be released within this close proximity to mid term elections it's an unstated rural it is a it it's an establishment or deep state rural and frankly I'm I'm surprised that it survived\nI Would not have been surprise surprise I mean it's it's a it's one of these unwritten rules of gentlemanly Washington procedure\nThat a bombshell report if any nature will be held until after the elections I thought that would blow up I thought that they would somehow find a way to release this thing or if not that leak yet if it's got things in it that they like which the latter it's still possible\nSo Mueller and his buddies in a drive by media\nRather than break the rules and released a report prior to the election they're going to do the next best thing they're going to start talking about it all the time such as this story Muller ready to deliver key findings in his truck probe sources say\nSo each day we're going to get references to the fact that Mueller's done\nRollers wrapped it up my mother is going to be releasing at\nAny moment are going to be talking about\nThe midterms in hopes in the hopes this was what they're hoping they're hoping that the acknowledgement that most\nThe report is done we'll be perceived by voters as the proof that Trump stole the election is imminent that is what they're hoping they're hoping that you and well I don't think they think you're going to fall for it but they were hoping that the great on washed up near\nThe ill educated under educated on an educated miss educated are going to believe that it's only a matter of time\nBefore this report is made public proving that Trump colluded with Russia and that well then he influenced the way they vote that means they will vote Democrat that's what the effort here is\nThey will create this cloud of suspicion this cloud of danger that puts\nHandles disaster for Trump they'll reference this each day leading up to the mid term elections\nAnd you'll hear people in the media speculate oh it could be trouble be removed after the midterms when mullet releases a report it could well be Trump's going to have to be removed to report my all of this is going to happen to one degree or another to second thing\nThis tells me is that Mueller himself is waiting to see who will be running Congress before he decides to really end of this\nBecause his report goes to Rosenstein\nWho is technically who's boss at the department of justice and to Congress and there is deciding whether or not\nThat it is made public so if the Democrats do when the house\nThey're going to insist that Mahler not conclude the investing particularly if he hasn't found any collusion of the Democrats win the house they're gonna tell when we got time man we can all the time in the world keep digging\nWe don't need to report right now we rented one house and we didn't mean your report so you keep digging\nHint hint you keep digging until you find that proof ... meaning since\nThat's what amazes me the most I mean I was always brought up the Democrats for fair and my dad was a Democrat my mom and that they sort of the country\nWhat you thought the Democrats for for the little guy looking out for the little guy and try to help the little guy make it economically and overcome obstacles Republicans wasn't away\nExactly and so so I'm very proud to be a Trump supporter but I'm about to pack it in I'm going to tell you what frustration is so high right now for not only my shelf people in the neighborhood because she said it before with Stuart gardening um he said the Trump ...\nAnd he says is the only reason the only way I can get my message out well\nHis choice to good but not that many people really here and I can't understand why he is not addressed the nation I don't understand\nWait a minute when you say when you say packing it and you mean you're about to abandon from\nThat advantage Trump but I'm going to really losing a lot of energy and frustration I really am because so many people don't know the good things that are happening they're not gonna learn preaching to the choir which treat tweak most of the time and the press conference fish they skew anyway\nSo if he addresses the nation any should it should be proud of what he's done this is the greatest time economically that I can never remembered I'm sixty six I can never remember anything like this\nIt is amazing in it but you know you said something here very by I Want to I Want to circle back to something you said an observation you've made of the modern day Democratic Party that they don't seem to be happy right now the country's doing well they don't they don't seem to be encouraged or want to be included in it they don't want to even\nTry to get some of the credit for the country doing well and that shocked you write\nYou know not any more at a ...\nYear and a half ago but I'm starting to realize they don't care about the country they really don't care about social issues they care about taking this guy down who I think the strongest guy since Reagan I've ever seen how we can take the bullets day after day I mean he's ... this guy\nYour frustration is noted and I think it's shared by a lot of people what you're you're really\nYou you made it sound like your frustration is with us from because he won't do a national impressed and try to reach people that his tweets don't rich or ... that he that he doesn't reach but your real frustration of the U.S\nIs with a news media and many people are in the same boat who are doing their best to hide all of that and make sure people don't know it's\nIt's a joke amazed at frustration I've never been so frustrated in my life I Can't it baffles me it was me out of the country so it was so well and so many people going to go out and vote and they you know like a newscast and they\nWhy do you think that you are well why do you think you're one of the few people that let realize how great the country's doing if you think about why why do you think more people have\nListened

point seven unemployment are you kidding me with all the jobs and all of them a ... wage is going up or my ...\nMy point is I think you're going to be a little confidence that you're not alone in seeing all of this and that more people are aware of it than you may know\nAnd of course you could be a it'd be understandable if you fear people don't know because the media is doing everything they can hide it or even worse lie about it\nAnd you are of the impression that most people get their knowledge information from the media but\nI think what happened with a lizard with Warren here they could not carry that covers surprised they could not cover for the fact that she's bogus they used to be able to do that they're not able to there's a reason for that and I think it's also helping get the truth out about Trump's achievement\nWe take a break for that has to have much to say rush probably by being met four\nNinety five five and a um seven fifty\nAll right to all of our listeners out

reporter is going to get noticed and that's how that's how that reporter climbs led if you go back to the early days of sixty minutes it was all about that\nAnd it remains so today it's just\nIt's evolved to adapt to the current climate which the only person they want to destroy the day now is Donald Trump and any Republican who gets in the way like Kevin all it's all about destroying people to think about\nThis series is it makes no one's about\nIt I I don't recognize the names of the writer or writers I don't recognize the stars I've never seen them in and things for I don't recognize the names of the producers and I haven't taken the time to Google that many of them but I watch this\nI've seen two episodes so far out of the ... and I catch myself my mouth is wide open it's agape a couple of times watching this thing at how\nBrave in early on is this is one of the the editor the head honcho of the of the tabloid paper is one of the most this thick of all human beings I've ever seen portrayed\nWho is not set up as a criminal who's not establish he's he's just two years and he is totally on affected by life to\nHim everybody is a bad guy you just have to find out why\nHis favorite his philosophy in life\nAnd the white guy just journalists is the world has no solutions I'll stop what what if that were your world view of the world has no solutions\nAnd he's telling you it's not your job to fix things it's not your job to feel bad about who you destroy it's not your job to try to solve problems because the world is not about solutions it's your job to sell this paper it's your job he one episode\n\nWent to great lengths to show how this this sleaze editor\nWho has some kind of a secret relationship with the prime minister the u._k. no no no no not sexual stuff there that they have some kind of a relationship they not producing like each other but they owe each other from way back before the series began\nAnd the editor\nRanges a cover story about appear to file and then puts a picture of the prime minister on the cover with his his picture only an inch away from the word ... to file\n\nYet the story is not about the prime minister being Pete if I was about somebody else for the prime minister is limited and outrage calls the guy in and the editor says you don't run me you don't control me and it was a mistake I I'm Sorry well then you wish you and I'm ... I'm not apologizing for anything you don't like and live with it\n\nIn the primary I didn't want to do the story in the first place I didn't want to pursue the pictures the editor says you did I mean this guy has no empathy or feeling for anybody\nHe doesn't [noise] it's just it's ... it's it's perfect if the kind of personality you wouldn't have to be\nIf your job is destroying people no conscience the belief that everybody is flawed everybody's a dirt bag that everybody is a rapper ... and at some point their time to be called out is going to happen\nNobody's decent nobody's white [laughter] it's amazing how this in the\nEyes of a journalist an editor now\nI imagine real journalists are going to look at this thing some of them are going to marvel at it and think it's wonderful others are going to have it because it's\nIt exposes too much\nUh people have never had encounters with reporters have never been targets I don't know how they're going to react to it other than the entertained by it it it starts kind of slow but it picks up speed\nOr\nMany of the primary characters are women\nThe competing editor of the queen paper the above board and paper is a woman who gets out smarter than tricked into not publishing one day because she can't confirm the ... story while the other paper\nPuts it on the cover of having confirmed it because the editor at the other ... doesn't care whether it's true or not wondering calls that got us will be the ... just get it up there and get it on the news ... whereas the female editor didn't have the guts\nTo run it and sell the paper doesn't rot and I'm thinking\nThey obviously are not worried about the me too movement here ever put this thing together so the name of this press I have no idea it's it's I think it is just completed airline\n'cause I've got all six of them so I just competed completed it's um it's run cycle in the u._k. which means it's going to be on Netflix\nAmazon Prime wherever I don't know where it's going to be but it won't be long and if you remember me talking about it here\nAnd if you watch these kinds of things it's it's fascinating 'cause it's not about politics not about current but it's not about Trump it's not about conservatives liberals any of that\n[noise] if it's a it's a bad hip everybody everybody as a rubber ... including the people at the papers\nThe reporters [noise] um\nI I have to admit I was so [noise] anyway here's ...

on a layover about his meeting with the Saudis\nHigh stress the importance of them\nNothing to the store tapping Donald Trump simply took it upon himself to inform the American people what the drive by maybe were hiding\nThat she didn't know anything about the event she couldn't tell anybody where it happened when it happened she couldn't describe the house where it was she wasn't even sure of the year much less of the month she\nIdentified for people over there all four said they were not there she did not have any answer for how she got home what she said to the person she first met after this happened none of all Trump there was remind everybody of this or actually inform him because the drive buys have not\nAnd that then caused a meat eater run the story of Donald Trump saying this because they hadn't been hiding it\nThey hit it because it was not helpful to their ... their claws which was getting rid of Cavanaugh\nI mean it's a central part of the story that the person making the charge doesn't have any evidence\nPlaces people there who deny that were there and can't remember anything about the event other than she had one beer the media not reporting that Trump does the media falls for the trap and reports over and over Trump saying it while accusing him of mocking her mocking is not what he did\nTo mock or he would have had to attempt to impersonate her and he did not try to impersonator he's simply\nReminded everybody in the real world language that she has no evidence and it was the turning point in the outcome of those hearings make no mistake\nOnce Trump did that and caused the media to end up reporting what they had been ignoring\nThan\nA lot of support that was their instinctively fur balls the Ford family she has no evidence there was nothing to support\n\nPeople the common sense there was nothing that you you believer yeah the basis of what well it started happening one but she doesn't know when she doesn't know where the poor people she said that we're there to say they weren't ... she became impossible to support and\nDefend other than by partisans and that was the turning point in Kevin came in and of course his his retested while he was re appearance was a subtle factors that the whole thing is happening again\nThe story was that the porn stars defamation lawsuit a Trump got thrown out\nIt wasn't nothing burger\nForum on ... drive by media reported that Stormy Daniels and the creepy lawyer that she hired ever not we're going to destroy Donald Trump they were going to prove that Trump had violated campaign finance laws remember all of this\nAnd there was Michael Cohen in the mix and he paid are often Michael Cohen's slipped and has now become a Democrat and he's offering to testify against Trump that's how last he is\nBut the other media\nInvested a lot in stormy Daniels' where ever she went to perform whatever polls she was slithering around a drive by where they're making a hero out of her\nStormy Daniels became a cause lab even before balls the Ford did and then that fell apart\nA judge in Los Angeles threw out the porn stars defamation lawsuit of Trump\nClaiming it was bogus it has no merit\nSo in one decision the porn stars entire reason for existing vanished political and so did the lifespan of her creepy porn lawyer who had already shot himself in a couple of feet by bringing forth some charges that Kavanaugh had arranged gang rapes in high school and college\nSo all Trump did\nCalling her horse face was call attention to what news story that the drive by as we're trying to ignore the news story was\nHer lawsuit with strong Trump was not guilty of whatever she was ... he had done to her\nIn fact she had been found guilty the judge it through the lawsuit out demanded that she pay his legal fees\nI said this makes Trump a big winner again you're ... the prostitute porn star is paying Trump who among us can arrange it that way folks but Donald Trump can\nThey also ignoring that part of it ignoring\nThat the stripper porn star and been ordered to pay Trump's legal fees but when Trump called her horse race in a tweet all of the meeting here were forced to run the story of his victory so you can sit there and say that Trump is embarrassing\nI guess they were talking about people that way I think it makes it so hard to\nRemember what I told you about the white Trump operates and pacing how he his original tape or opinion on any issue might make you think he's selling out but he gets that first take on the record\nMedia says well it was very reasonable you said that Dr Balt the Ford was very ... very compelling shakedowns surprising then after the passage of time with Dr balls the Ford clearly has no evidence Trump says you've got no evidence and here's the evidence that she does know evidence blah blah by the\nTrump gets his news covered\nThe media was not reporting this lawsuit a bit from the media was not reporting and she had to pay him it was legal

ingredients and beer [noise]\nBad news for judge Kevin alright\n\nInvestors business daily Trump's approval rating is better than you think\nSome pull quotes as a matter of fact Trump's approval rating is now higher than are tied with\nThree of the past six presidents at the same point in their first terms he is currently tied with Obama at forty four percent he's above Clinton at forty one percent Reagan at forty two percent at this time in his presidency\nBut there's a broader point here Democrats in the media keep describing Trump as a hugely divisive figure but the polls show that his approval is starting to line up with previous presidents and\nWhat's more Trump's low numbers are almost entirely because Democrats are universally opposed to one\nAnother for quote at this point in Obama's presidency ten percent of Republicans approved for the job he was doing\nAnd that was after the failed pork you it was\nIt was after the signing of Obamacare in after the signing of Dodd Frank and other policies highly antagonistic\nTo Republicans Trump on the other hand gets approval from only five percent of Republicans and that's where it's been throughout his presidency so Republicans in other words were far more forgiving of Obama the Democrats have been if Trump\nSo who actually is being divisive\nTrumpet the GOP or the Democrats who will hate Trump no matter what he does I have to think that the drive buys are fully aware of this may not want to admit that Trump's approval numbers really much stronger than it's being reported and is\nA much higher here's that story certainly you didn't believe it Daily Beast Democrats fear Obama going soft for the midterms\nHe's not out they're\nNot going soft he's not it was you know don't got me on this during his presidency he did not like campaigning for house races it was so nice the office of the president's eating his mind\nHe didn't want any part of it\nI think there's a bigger reason now I I don't think

confirmed so they'll likely or thought to end the story is that\nIt took him seven minutes to die that they dismembered him alive at some point gave him drugs to knock him out and then they listen to

to make it look like the Trump knows the Saudis did it and is trying to\nProvide them cover that's it's despicable graphics that they are using to try to make that case\nBut I think there's a lot of a

than needing it for claustrophobia and pay the as the\nLike being afraid Kevin always going to show up at any moment in the last thirty five years well anyway everybody has a home with a front door and a lock on most people have one front door\nFor some people that's all they need to feel secure for others securing every door and every window is what's important\nTo feel safe inside\nNow how you go about securing all of those entry points now that's another thing early home security system providers gave you one solution and it was it was fairly expensive and then simply say home security came along offering a solution\nTo protect all of your doors and windows in the most effective ways for far less money\nAnd they get that done by using state of the art technology and the systems they make\nThey use ... folks to connect all of these components together the sensors on the doors and windows the age the cameras the motion detectors that glass break sensors all of that they communicate with the primary bay station in the house my wife I started wires to run that is\nSo so important so crucial in making this\nComplex less of a problem and it makes it much harder to hack it I mean cutting wires is easy but disrupting wife I connections takes a little bit more work\nThey use ... and they use computer chips than there are sensors in an detectors ... cameras that come with every system that sends signals when the doors and windows are open\nAnd if you wander simply say system as you've left the home you get a notification when there is activity I e somebody tried to break in
