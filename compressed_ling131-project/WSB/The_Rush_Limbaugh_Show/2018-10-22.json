it well the pain again from when that police chief like aired or brain that they were able to have more details later this afternoon reporting light and when that county heritage devil us they\nAnd here's what I have found today CNN is spending almost eighty percent of their time on the show ...\n\nEighty percent may okay even if it's to sixty percent of their time on ... they're not focusing on the care of him that tells me that if the caravan weren't a Democrat idea\nDesigned to embarrass Trump that they would be covering it and building it up and with people down there interviewing these people creating sob stories there'd be there'd be Mandel treated here's what it means that Trump is are they just want to come to America and that may yet happened down the road but CNN\nIs is not wall to wall but they are predominantly\nFocusing on the show Gabe\nAnd of course whenever CNN does just to try to damage Trump let's look at sea wife CNN is so ticked off because Trump's approval numbers are higher than they've ever been now\nAnd there are higher than Obama's war at this stage in the ah in his mid terms of the same point in his presidency after two years there just resigned themselves none of this\nIs happening the way it was supposed to happen now there's more and more stories about how the blue wave may not happen hint hint it never was going to happen I don't think anybody has ever known whether it's going to be a blue wave they've been relying on polling data but nobody knows for sure that was that the media narrative\nIt was a meeting that was not born of any evidence that couldn't be any evidence for a blue wave or a red wave the election hasn't happened yet nobody wants to rely on polling data to suggest that it's going to happen but the polling data hasn't been accurate either starting in two thousand six dean of the presidential race\n\nSo we've got this caravan chugging north and I think you know put some things in perspective on this again the way to look at it is is as a\nA microcosm of what's happening every day and our border every day this is what's happening\nNot seven thousand a day but but but every day this is what's been going on for decades and it needs to stop\nAnd Donald Trump is the only person that's ever talked about working to make it stop now the Democrats\nIf they're behind that was one of the strategic ... besides getting somebody hurt\nAnd blaming it on Trump maybe what they're hoping is that Trump actually won't do anything about it maybe they're hoping that Trump will be all Huffington puff\nTalk about sending the military down they're talking about setting a National Guard but not actually doing anything they might be rolling the dice that Trump isn't going to do anything because they think they've rattled Trump\nWith their stories earlier this year about how he separated families the border and how Trump doesn't like the narrative and didn't want to class and so he did what he could change if I\nDo know this despite everything that you think you wouldn't know the common sense there are still Republicans elected Republicans look at this caravan and their solution is to let them in\n\nAs elected still there so you have a piece yesterday they are so scared of this issue they are so scared\nThat when ever the subject of illegal immigration comes up Democrats automatically when Republicans think they've got to show they're not cold hearted mean spirited and all that let them have they're not publicly saying this but I Know that there\nMay be the Democratic gambling is too is is is a wild guess at Trump's actually you're not going to do anything after huffing and puffing and I'll tell ya if Trump doesn't do anything if this caravans allowed to get to the border and come into the country what do you think that would do the Trump\nThere's one issue that could separate Trump from his voters or at least make his belt voters beginning to\nI don't doubt is the right where they would be my only disappointing particularly after Trump has said over and over again that this caravan is not going to get him if if if if some Republicans are behind this the ... there's obvious uh but I just somebody has to be\nSomebody has to be making this happen folks we're talking with we we've got how many\nTwo thousand miles stop and think of this from Honduras to the southern border of\nThe United states assistance to Arizona is around two thousand miles\nSeven thousand people one day just decided to start walking to the United states to thousands of miles\nI also think if you're looking for people behind this you have to look at the drug cartels and if you want to start trying to analyze will what their politics in this be that opens up a whole new can of worms but I don't doubt that they are playing a major role in transportation\nBut there has to be political involvement here too because the money has to be available there has to be money being spent on this\nSo you've got seven thousand people who all of a sudden to side all of a sudden because nobody saw this coming and there was no advance word seven thousand people to sign to start walking to a thousand miles\nWe don't see pictures of of of where they're using the bathroom we don't see pictures of them gathering or getting food and eating it\nI mean look at random video you might you might see some people's choice things I mean we don't see how this is being handled we don't see the port a potties we don't see and are they just urinating and rivers and streams of what were the environmental wackos think about that if that's happening\n\nWell if if I guess you you may have a point welcome to San Francisco they could already be accustomed to it especially the dedication to the street and they get maps in San Francisco for tourists couldn't blame the piles of human feces\n\nSo how long would it take to walk two thousand miles along with a ...\nRemember they're vowing to get married

the polling data and it's it's being acknowledged by the Democrats that that it is real and yet they have continued to maintain that Beto\nO'Rourke is gonna be the guy can take out Ted Cruz\nHas anybody found a hundred thousand people trying to get into a Beto O'Rourke event\nYou have a venue that whole Seventeen thousand people you have anywhere between Seventy five thousand in a hundred thousand people who want to get in that is not the kind of thing that happens\nWith him a political party that is losing losing favor losing support losing elections every where Trump goes these

through the parking lots to get in\nThere was a mile long line\nOf people to get them to see Trump in Mesa, Arizona the media is not reporting this aspect of the Trump rallies the media is not telling you how many people want to get in are trying to get in how many people are showing up and standing in line because if they did\nLocal media may I don't know national media CNN and MSNBC ABC NBC CBS are not showing this because if they did it would put the lie to the notion of all the energy is on the Democratic side meanwhile there's not a single Democrat drawing anywhere near\nThese kinds of rallies nice ... these kinds of people what the Democrats are doing is continuing to show up where Republicans are having dinner and harassed\nThe turtle and his wife are at a restaurant Louisville,

isn't this isn't about civility this is about what I brought up three weeks ago this is not how decent people behave\nAnd I said decent people don't know how to deal with this kind of in decent which is what we're up against the on the Democratic side or whatever you want to call a lack of civility in decency whatever it is it is not the things you associate with winning\nIt's not the kind of behavior you associate with good times good vibes positive outlook\nThese are people in a rage and angry disappointed depressed what have you\n\nThe the contrast here is striking and that's why you do not see any news coverage of the size of let me tell you something the ... the number of people the size of crowds to get into a Donald Trump\nIt is ten times the size of this mob that is invading the country currently coming up through Mexico you've seen those pictures in the media is happy to show you all those pictures the media can't wait to show you this so called\nCaravan of seven thousand people soon to be a thousand people and they claim might end up being ten thousand they'll show your pictures those people all day well here's what you need to do\nWhen you see that picture seven thousand people or what is said to be seven thousand people multiply that times can that's the number of people trying to get into a Donald Trump rally in Mesa, Arizona and even more than that at a rally in Texas\nI Wish they'd use AT and T. stadium is Jerry Jones palace where the cowboys play with a hundred thousand people in there\nSo you think the Democrats can get together a mob of seven

great to have you here\nI think the reason why I called it with a lot of years military are retired from the older we're very good a lot of things we are not good\nAt basically civilian type a non lethal warfare we've gotten much better at it since Afghanistan and Iraq started but that is one saying throughout the years we not be good at so this situation and look I I'm One hundred percent for putting the military before but this one's perils and we have to be careful\nWell when when you said the military is not prepared for an invasion you're talking about ... this is not a military invasion of talking about a a human way of uh invasion of people\nThat are largely are going to be thought of is starving or steep poverty stricken this kind of things simply demanding\nLife or am I gotta let it\nIn the military is not used the standing up to people like that certainly not in Flint thing and and the harm on them is that what you're saying\nI think the difference is you know when it comes to locality we're very good when it comes to less lethal we that's just not something we do that well we're individual you're sort of very good at it but that when you're not\nOkay what about this what about just the president's here's the U.S military standing at the border you will\nNot cross okay what happens then if they do and there's\nAlways the problem that's the peril is part of the problem\nWe have like you don't you you you don't use bullet you use a ... one of the dummy is called I forgot but that you use use some kind of force but not lethal\nYou only have a quality of the things you but you know all it takes one person going down and squeal like a pig and then there's you know we ... we just have to hold up I don't see anything good coming out of this but the president would be tremendous\nBut the president would be okay so there's ... ... you think the military showing up is\nLet me just put words in your mouth and you tell me if I'm right or wrong in interpreting you you think the military showing up as a lose lose proposition\nNo I think initially is a great idea but we have to be prepared for the next step\nWell but you say we can't take your next step because the next step is not what they're good that they're not used to know how to do it\nNow that's the power you know I ... I think we should but we'd have to be prepared politically and militarily\nWell then what is it what's the preparation\nHave to be prepared to use deadly force like\nOkay well let's let's let's let me give you a scenario then okay I'm just doing this in the interest of time I'm not that may it may sound\nIn since I don't mean that they hold the line I hold the line\nProvide a visual presidents a visual obstruction they send the signal not welcome do not cross there will be constant warnings but somebody dies and they have to shoot one or two then what happens\nThat we'd have to want to tell you I think you see a lot of people fall in line probably what Bush or talking about members of the the immigrants illegal aliens but we'd have to be prepared to take that one or two it's terrible but that's what it\nTakes you don't think if one or two got hit that it was storm that caused the mob in rain storm the military just in and and and it it essentially stormed the bullet storm ... you'd think they would cease and desist\nI'll tell you they will cease and desist I'll tell you there's a lot of times you guys have a tendency to fold up when they are met with equal strikes are we just have to\nEven if there is a casually or to the drive by their story Trump Terry fires on harmless or an armed hopeless people\nAnd there's the peril yeah okay so the alternative is to let them in\nNo no I have to hold a lot it and like I said somebody you know what the Democrats are always saying hey somebody's got to tell you one for the team or the political legalized now let's see it's unfortunate but this is what they this is what they take it all by taking this just\nYour own okay right so the responsibility for what happens to them has to be on them you think the media is going to allow that that this is I'm a left I I look I Can't start another thought because I couldn't finish it we've got to take a break\nRush Limbaugh making radio\nRain again you're listening to the network\nI'm pretty handy around the house but now that I had kids I don't want to spend my Saturday installing a toilet or fixing an air conditioner but thankfully there is ...\nHome advisor helped me find them back home pros in my area to handle any kind of project you can read reviews from kick their bail ability even book appointments on line and when my wife loves knows his home in mind is completely free you\nDo it at ... dot com boy download the ... to get started\nIt's people we believe investment advice is about more than helping you manage or well\nOur investment advice is about ... it's about providing your kids with opportunities for head start in life feeling secure and your retirement in ... in your dreams just may become a reality because you have a plan\nWe believe in you\nHave to investment advice starts with your people financial advisor find your news people financial advisor ... dot com that's S C I F E L people make with some company incorporated member S.

Melosh he's a sunny and warm this afternoon it might miss most accurate dependable forecasters\nAgain the latest news out of Texas where Trump is a is doing a rally for Ted Cruz\nThere had been a hundred thousand people seek tickets essentially RSV piece together the venue holds Seventeen or Eighteen thousand\nIt originally over the weekend was Seventy seven thousand people that wanted to get him now that swollen to one hundred thousand people and my point is this kind of thing does not happen\nTo political parties losing favor it does not happen to the candidates losing favor am about to be over run by a Democrat blue wave and just to remind you Tom ... on CNN Today the Germans DNC no no no no we we always knew this election was going to be close [noise]\nWe always if you know the right places to look the drive by and the Democrats are really walking this back\nNow I Know a lot of your ... rush don't get sucked into this they're just doing a rope a dope they're trying to make you think that they've lost count but they haven't this is just I don't believe that smokes these people are not rational right now\nThey haven't been rational for a long time and the irrationality really was jammed up\nAfter Trump won but there's a companion story to all of the people showing up for Trump and that is not up for the people showing up for by the Democrats are sending Joe Biden out to try to draw crowds for various democratic candidates and it isn't working\nNow by showed up to do a rally for the Democratic candidate for governor of Florida Andrew Gillum who as an aside and he debated Ron dissenters last night on CNN [noise]\nUp this this this guy Gillum for those of you who live in Florida I I Know he seems attractive\nTo some of the one that Obama like way a would be the first African American governor uh is is supposedly just filled with love and compassion the guy is a full fledged\nLeftist Marxist that really makes a bunch of evil just talking about Florida as a collective no that's communist ... she was talking about Florida as law or a collective he hit it would be a disaster for Florida\nRight now to elect anybody like this guy because of what he will do\nIn wrecking a growing economy do you live in Florida and Texas economies are growing like gangbusters and you and it's not just because of of senior citizens moving here from other areas of the country it's about tax policy\nFlorida and Texas have no state income tax as such people are moving here in droves and businesses in Florida are growing left and right and this guy wants to shut it down\nThis is this guy is a ... is Andrew Gillum is they clap classic modern day Democrats leftist who doesn't want to be any private sector success\nBecause the private sector is corrupt it's unfair it's it's illegitimate I and and it it's it's not everybody's treated equally in support this guy wants government in charge of virtually everything\nFor his express purpose of determining outcomes based on what he thinks is equality fairness\nHe doesn't know about running businesses like every other Democrat in the world that never run one has want an open criticism for them and the people around them and the people who found them and the people who start them has a deep resentment he's part of the Elizabeth Warren Obama crowd you to build that\nYou didn't look that up a\nWould just be just bad news horrible news at the exact worst time\nFor anybody like this guy to be elected governor\nUh in in Florida Rick Scott's the outgoing governor gosh I Hope this guy beats Bill Nelson he's running for the Senate down here and he had Rick Scott\nIs one of these guys self made and as as a has become very successful and as governor he tackled a whole bunch of emergencies and disasters in just came through with flying colors and and\nNelson has become a just a static flat line just a a walking echo chamber for whatever left his leadership in the Senate wants done whether it's a benefit to Florida or not\nBut the Santa would be great defense is is a is a Reagan I conservative Republican who happens to have a good relationship with a with Trump\nA but Andrew Gillum ... wrong decision to make there is nothing if it's not just Andrew Gillum this is no time to be electing people\nWho want to put the brakes on what is happening in this country right now we've got more job openings than there are people to fill them we have people getting raises getting bonuses businesses are growing left and right the economy is rising we've got trade practices coming back into balance now\nWe've got people feeling more optimistic about America at least the surveys the may have expressed in quite a while\nThe trend is constantly upward people have have are exceptionally positive thoughts about the future and electing any extreme leftist Democrat as governor or senator or even as as president in two years would be an absolute disaster\nIt would constitute rolling back\nEvery achievement that has been made in the past ... if you want to go back to flat line the economics of decline where the president tells you this is as good as it gets and you've got to eat better get used to it because America's greatness in the past really wasn't deserved\nWe waste all of a lot of what we have we mistreated people all over the world if you want to invest in the idea that the United states is the problem in the world and not the solution then you'll elect these Democrats I Can't\nI Can't imagine people who are engaged in thinking about this and living lives actively involved with ... in any way want to put the brakes on this and for what reason because they don't like Trump\nTweeting because they don't like Trump's manners because they think Trump is goldfish or whatever some of the silliest stupidest reasons that's not why Trump is supported\n\nTrump is supported because he's in the last line to hold off on this attempt at transforming America into being something that it was never found it to be if you want if you want America to actually be determined by shaped by like this this mob\nSeven thousand people demanding entry into the United states and demanding benefits from the United states because they are deserved because America is responsible for what's going on in their home countries if that's what you want America to be that you got to vote Democrat\nBecause that's what the Democrat Party of today wants to happen successful American needs to be punished whatever else is going on it's still boils down to an age is old argument over philosophy and it's this\nAre you better at running your life or is the government better at running your life the Democrat\nParty believes you are not capable of running your life and they don't want you to learn that you can\nThey don't want you to learn that you can be self reliant and achieve great things they don't want you to realize that you can be happy and content on your own the Democrat Party wants people to believe all of that is only possible\nIf government makes have happened or let's have happened but more and more what leftist actually want government to do is punish the Democratic party has become a party of groups\nOf victims\nAnd these victims have turned over to their own futures to the Democratic party they have decided that life is too unfair and to me in and they can't overcome any adversity without the Democrats running interference without the government running interference and so more and more what they want by voting for Democrats they want Democrats to punish\nThe successful\nOr anybody that these people believe is responsible for their unhappiness\nThe Democratic party has become a party of ... means spirited extremism the Democratic party has become the home of people sadly when psychological disorders who are demanding that the political system of the country address those disorders and normalize them\nAnd that's not the purpose of the United states government and it can't succeed any way\nI mean this is just hands down at this Andrew Gillum personified as personify the exact total wrong direction to take at any time but especially
