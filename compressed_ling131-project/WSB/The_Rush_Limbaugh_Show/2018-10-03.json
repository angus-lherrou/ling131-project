got the returns that it's illegal that they have them\nObviously somebody at the IRS doesn't care I mean the leftist infiltrated everything obviously that's how this happened what does it matter wants to the times has them that's that but they've had them now for a year and note when the story runs\nThey ought not be trying to crowd out the Kavanaugh story right this is something ideally you'd want to wait until closer to the election\nYou want to make me wait a couple of weeks but no they ran this thing yesterday and others a companion Showtime network documentary on this so there's been some collaboration might even say some collusion on this\nWhite cover up the Kavanaugh story with the this is providing a huge challenge for the cable news networks what to do what to do it got Trump out there that claim he's mocking ball before he wasn't marketing or walk I I understand Republican senators saying what they're saying oh my God this is all they don't know why president that\nHe did it for some reason\nEverybody's pointing out that the Trump just last week was saying she was very credible yeah he did and we knew when he said that why he set it to everybody has to\nBefore all this is um investigated and put it you can't run out there\nAnd start ripping on her even if it's desert even if it's warranted last week you could not ... there was nothing there is no upside to doing it no matter if you were right even if she was lying to her teeth and you can demonstrate of last week was not the time to do it so Trump joys of course\nI find a compelling I find her very credible will now she's not so credible she never was but now she's not so critical is all kinds of holes and Trump just one of the mild all Trump did is playing out the flaws in her story which should have happened\nDuring the hearing last Thursday but the Republicans were not going to go there they were not going to challenge or because it just wasn't\nSmart\nEspecially with that voice but she was affecting the go after her in any way that would seem like an attack or like a dozen believer\nWould have not been politically useful but in a in a normal the rational hearing committee hearing\nHer allegations would be challenged and tested they were not that's all Trump did Trump pointed out the mistakes or otherwise orbit differences the prevailing occasions she can't remember where when who the people she says ... says they weren't that's only ...\nRepublican senators should have done that last week but they could\nSo Trump's given uncovered Trump writing shade for them and let them go out and rip him for doing it if they want to understand stuff by this time we have to assume ... knows what he's doing when he goes off script you know step in it it may look like it but he doesn't but that's not the big take away the big takeaway for me as this\nOne you know the New York times it's been investigating but trumped for forty years they've gotta catch returns going back who knows how long\nAnd guess what's not part of the story guess what\nNot part of any income tax\nStory on Donald Trump guess what one word you do not see in the report anybody want to take a guess\nWhat I often say no that's not the word what one word is not in this entire New York times story I'll give you a hint it was the sole reason the left I wanted to get their hands on Trump's tax returns\nRussia heading for that yet they want to Trump's tax returns because their tax returns they said would prove Trump\nPolluted because his money came from Russia because his wealth was causing due to Russian connections that's what everybody on the left was convinced\nWas true and now here's the New York times story\nYear long investigation Trump's taxes going back more than forty years and they're not able to find any Russian money\n\nSo now they didn't find any Russian money and I guarantee you they expected to\nThey're the ones that said that they're the ones that said I'm Talking about everybody on MSNBC CNN go back a year ago back to the two thousand sixteen campaign when everybody was hell bent on proving that Trump was they put in storage Trump wasn't totally\nTrump was compromised by Russia because it was Russia that enable Trump to get rich\nAnd his tax returns would prove it they said so I guarantee you when the New York times got these documents the first thing they did\nWas make a B Line key word search however they search it looking for Russia Russia and Russian names answer big fat zilch zero not so now they're on to something else now they're back to what's always been about Trump that he got rich from is that\nNow they're saying and all kinds of phony entities were created like shallow corporations\nAnd other things for Trump and his siblings and I just Trump companies siblings to hide money from the IRS [noise]\nAnd that's Hillary Clinton was right in there trying to help destroy those women and Lindsey Graham was referring that these people in the audience didn't know what they thought he was talking about Ford\nAnd that's when he stopped and said I see that's actually a reference to something somebody said James Carville most of your other too young to remember this\nSo not only do they live in denial than it ever happened now they're trying to shut down anybody who brings it up you know the Clinton years in what they did the women supposed to go down the memory hall\nNow I have a transcript and anti Kevin all protester was confronted and I'm a Republican senator and he pushed back this was an attack or a confrontation walking down the hall or any Kevin all protesters have flooded Capitol Hill\nAnd they've been allowed to get into the hallways of the offices in Senate office buildings how does that happen\nBut what we all know that what happens but they're they're\nOne of these protesters approached Republican Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana on his way through a Senate building walkway Monday\nAnd she said why are you supporting Kevin up where are you supporting candidate cast that he did not ignore her he took the chance to push back he asked her if she would like it if her loved ones were destroyed by uncorroborated charges\nCassidy why wouldn't I support Kavanaugh protester because rapist or bad Cassidy wait a second everybody there said it didn't happen either rape anybody so why am I gonna so you're going to you're going to believe mark judge over a woman no I'm going to believe her best friend\nWho says it didn't happen she wasn't there her best friend didn't say didn't happen her best friend said she wasn't told about it her best friend said she didn't remember it\nProtester so you're okay as a doctor to harm a woman Cassidy wait a second are you OK as a person to go ahead and do accept the non corroborated charge to destroy somebody's life\nIf you destroy your wife your son's life or your husband's wait a second answer my question was your husband your son your father whose life has been destroyed by uncorroborated when you buy that protester I Would support a full FBI investigation we're dealing with appropriate robots I'm Glad Cassidy push back but it's a lost cause on the protester\nThe protesters not even hearing what he says she's got program dancers bought and paid for by George Soros\nAnd she hears key words and what he says knee jerk reaction causing things replies accordingly\nCastle you know no would you like and on corroborated charged destroyed I wouldn't marry somebody that was a drunk said the protestor\nOh no wait a minute uncorroborated answer the question I don't think you're able to because you know it's unfair protester I Would stand up ... you know it's unfair protester I Would fight and that would make sure women or heard clearly you're all care for rapist goes on the Supreme Court castle you know I'm not\nBut then on the other hand clearly you're okay the absence of evidence obviously means nothing view protests are no there is evidence looking at a standard how many people are in jail for laughs\n[noise] so what this ... unless somebody like me gets hold of a transcript of something like this and help people understand that it's a total waste of time to engage these protesters especially if you're trying to persuade them you can't persuade them I just like you can't persuade the media\n[noise] you know I'm I've told the story when I was first at this\nVery young wet behind the ears naive and the media would want to talk I thought just because they're really interested I didn't know nobody's ever heard of me a radio shows taking off I thought they were legitimately curious and that's how I went into early interviews I found out that's not an all they weren't curious about anything they were simply there to discredit me\nMake fun of me\nTo raise doubts it took me longer than I Want to admit to figure this out you cannot persuade these people you can't change their minds and debate it's why I say the only

they don't think Trump can be that that's a reasonable\nBut he does it to them every time it gives them the credibility later to be\nCritical and a step away he said yeah I found a credible I've found are compelling\nThen as we learn more and then there's events play out Trump is able to parlay his original statements into what he really thinks based on\nWhat is not a knee jerk reaction if Trump were to heaven sent initially what he said last night at the rally why there would have been held up pay but now he can back it up now there's all kinds of evidence that her timeline doesn't make any sense we've got an ex boyfriend claiming she is a polygraph experts has taught people how to beat them\nWe have people challenging her account we didn't have that last week it is perfectly fine for Trump to do what he did\nIt gives him a credibility later to be critical step away it's a common technique he uses he does it on everything\nIt's why I've always told you don't take his first draft statement or his first tweet as a sign that he's caving or flipping you people you I'm sure you remember there haven't been many instances in fact I may have fallen from one myself that's how I learned that Trump\nWill tweet something or say something it'll make you looked like he was about like ... the ... before he pulled out of a ... the Paris climate accord\nWhat did he say climate change very serious thing to do with a look at it than we are looking at it\nThan voting to the rights oh so he's on record as being open about then later on when he's learned when he needs to learn comes out tells you what do you think's\nReally thinks it's a pattern it's a technique if they trumped developed\nI don't even know if he developed or it's just how he does it naturally and instinctively\nBut I call it pacing now Republicans have not built up this reputation Senate Republicans haven't Trump has Trump has established that after\nHe makes it an initial statement on somebody and he can make fun of things and what really irritates the left he gets away with it I cannot tell you how ... irritates them to he shouldn't have survived the Access Hollywood video he shouldn't have survived anything they've thrown at him the fact that he has an just continue to prosper in triumph I cannot tell you\nHow the lions Lee insane\nIt has made them with rage\nOther Republicans have not developed the golden adds to do\nThis and pull it off Trump hasn't been attacked so much we're now if you go back to two thousand Fifteen when this campaign started this has two thousand they did was three years\nIn fact it's it's it's three years in three months Trump gets in in June of two thousand Fifteen Trump has been attacked so much he doesn't care anymore\nIt doesn't bother him anymore is my point he's not willing to take the arrows he's willing to take the hits for everybody else that's why he is needed folks he is willing to do what he did last night\nI Know Murkowski and Collins or shuttering and cowering in the corner with the vapors\nOh my God it was horrible it was so ... was a horrible everything he said is true\nIt was not mocking her the actress video audio we played mocked mostly for Trump didn't\nHe just said she she can't backup she cannot corroborate there isn't any cooperation from what she said why is that not relevant why does that not matter\nWhy have we gotten to a point where any woman can come forward and accuse any man of anything and it's gospel\nAnd then be joined by a so called movement called me two were all women can joined that can you imagine if there was something going on that can you imagine a man organized for the express\nPurpose of destroying women\nYou can't even imagine that can you\nYou can't even imagine the organized movement the male version of me too\nWell Roche are men and women are nor do there should we do well yeah\nThat does happen but that's not the point this is not about even ban and set it this is not just about sexual abuse this is about Raul power this is about female rage\nBecause of things that have happened to them the leftist women and\nThey have organized all of these disorders into a giant political movement I'm just asking you to think can you ever can you envision a movement\nOf men if if such a group existed\nAnd Oprah Winfrey had invited the leader on her show he'd been thrown off and the first ten minutes to them and ready to kill the made fun of the rest of his life he could not happen\n\nWomen are a minority and supposedly even though they're not ah in numbers but it's so out of balance all Trump\nDid was say what everybody following this knows even the Democrats the Democrats know all kinds of holes in her story\n[noise]\nThe Trump doing what he's doing provides a lot to cover for a lot of people as one of the many reasons why he's needed Trump said guilty until proven innocent that's very dangerous\nFor our country that's what this is that's what the Democratic party is and so and that's what Democrats senators I'm Sandy that'd be accused has to prove you didn't do it that the accuser doesn't have to corroborate anything the accuser doesn't have to prove anything where in what civilized society is that real\n\nTrump said guilty until proven innocent that very dangerous for our country I haven't myself all the time but for me it's

around to be like\nThis is a senior officer knowledge are mixed to southern clubs this afternoon highs near eighty eight lows tonight around sixty seven right now we have eighty degrees of doubled USB depend on it\nPsychological issues and projecting them under the world of politics bingo I've been searching for that description for years I have no problem admitting that I was unable to put this together it's one of the rare moments I wasn't able to\nThis is exactly right we're dealing with people who have suffered some kinds of psychological disorder they've turned to politics for the solution\nOr the written baggage is actually what they're looking for and they don't just want revenge against whoever did whatever to them they are now demanding that every representative of the group that or the individual that did something can be made to pay a price for it\nThat's what the ... this this uh ... well\nThe me too movement in large part was never bipartisan it was thought to be said to be but it never was\nA and even if it if you okay even if it was it's been co opted by the Democratic party look at look at the\nOccupy Wall street movement looking black lives matter or to take any left wing group that you want it's made up of people who for some reason I think they haven't been unjustly mistreated by somebody\nAnd instead of dealing with that in their lives they enter politics and they demand that the Democratic party take up the cause of the Democratic party willingly has the Democratic party has become the party\nOf all of these disparate constituency groups\nWith their singular causes because the Democratic party realizes that they can combine all of these things into a singular assault on the concept of America that America is responsible for what happened these people\nThey capitalism is responsible that the power structure that the founding is responsible\nAnd so people with psychological disorders are being granted the status of normalcy\nAnd then the big donors come along and underwrite them and fund their efforts and they become political movements\nAnd then they become victims and then of course allows them to blame everybody for what has gone wrong in their lives and then they demand reciprocity or revenge or what have you and I can tend to do that most people are so I have no idea how to deal with this\nNo idea whatsoever so we ended up and debates about whether\nBoys want to pretend to be girls so they can go on a girls' bathrooms and becomes legitimate\nThat's sick it ... it in in many not that Pacific way but just the whole concept of what is happening here and it is a violent bullying intimidating\nMovement that has been constructed to push all of these disparate various agendas and the target is America the target is America is founded the target is\nAmerican Capitalism and so when our caller says that Kavanaugh is simply a stand in for men who have abused every woman out there he's right balls the Ford\nWill end up being supported by other women who have been abused whether she's telling the truth or not it doesn't matter because it did happen to them these women we do know that are out there watching this it did happen to them and by God somebody's going to pay for it in this case will be capital that's how they're going to be heard\nRather than just deal with the specific incident that happened to them it's the same thing I think with\nBlack lives matter or the NFL players kneeling for the anthem a all cops are bad every white ... every black kinds of it is in is\nIn every instance here points to the country at large as being responsible in on the fairness in bias and discrimination it racism all of this the Democratic party is the organizing party the collection agency for all of these\nComplaints Democrat Party is happy to make victims out of anybody who wants to be one\nAnd Democrat Party is happy to promise these people that they all ... and they never do they never the raging angered never ends it only gets worse because the Democrats don't fix anything\nAnd finally it doesn't even depend on being fixed it just means somebody's got to pay in this case capital he's got to pay\nWhether he did it or not\nSanders White House press briefing is going on she just lay the end of the press and she said exactly what I said if I don't mind saying so\nYou said Trump to mock anybody last night he simply recites did the facts\nAnd he said all of this can be laid at the feet of the Democrats they are to blame for this none of this needed to have happened in public they had ... for ... ... email or in a letter ... way back in July they could have done everything that's been done to investigate her claim\nOff record behind the scenes nobody knowing about it but they didn't do that they waited to use it as a Hail Mary\nShe dispute the idea that Trump mock she said all he was doing was reciting the facts here it is again this is what the press the media everybody is out now ripping Trump claiming that he mocked Christine walls before\nI did you get home I don't remember how did you get there I don't remember when it was so I don't remember how many

Kavanaugh has said it's been picked apart every single word second by second of his testimony has been picked apart yet if anybody says anything about\nThe accusations that have been thrown against them that's totally off limits and outrageous\nExactly right young cat challenge her so Trump did for everybody else who doesn't have a gun adds to do it Trump did it in yeah he's providing a little shade for some of these people to hide under\n[noise] and I'll guarantee they may be publicly saying I Wish you hadn't done it that's outrageous what prompted their thinking everybody did it

next on the program thank you for calling\nHey rushed great to speak to you again\nA right to have your back\nYet to be on again anyways so I'm watching this whole thing on me too movement watching the Kavanaugh hearings I'm I'm Fifteen I'm just regular straight guy\nThat's into abnormal but I think that I really cannot believe any of these women that pop up on TV anymore you can't believe any of them were coming old guy raped me the guy did this to me to that to me you know he had to draw on CNN while you're like a couple of months ago saying that a guy raped or because he asked her for her phone number [noise]\nCan't believe any of them and I think that what this this hold me to\nKind of white ... every man credited anyway at that that is my exact point I Believe that woman I Believe\nShe thinks she was raped when somebody asked her for her number that's how she's been conditioned\nWomen's studies on campus the the outright hatred for men you know I keep talking about it but it's relevant Catherine McKenna and this was back in the nineties\nShe was a professor of women's studies at Michigan She taught women in her class the all sex is rape even the sex of marriage the women were lapping up\nAnd women have been taught for two generations now that men are basically predators and that their own kids are not safe from their fathers\nAnd it's not random it's widespread it is part and parcel of higher education today so you have a woman and she could be acting I mean she could be making this up could be a political activist but it's entirely possible at the same time out from that the cause of what she's\nBeen taught and heard on the news and talking to her she may literally believe that memory I have no right to ask for her phone number is the same thing as bullying her raping her\nThat's my point she may really believe it\nIt goes well rush of you know the same woman that are screaming about how they've been raped or off the ones who want to have the right to having abortions it so they could have unlimited sex\nOr have you\nEver um ah you're right sex without consequences but you better not\nBut then they claimed that all men are predators but then they run to the white hook up and then they want to have abortions for free\nWhether it's their idea then everything's fine\nHooked on it if not better I by the way here's this ... you're\nAlso random it's not all women but it's been made to look like that isn't it\nThe me too movement supposedly includes all women women on across\nAmerica who do not think this way are being lumped into this

J. people that were doing this\nAnd I think the objective of Christine balls before this whole thing not her specifically but I look I think she's an activist and then on it but that's neither here to there the objective of this was to get Kevin on the withdraws nomination or to have Trump pull it\nNow that that hasn't happened this case has been getting the collapse you see stories all over the media but how all this so called evidence just isn't there\nThey thought that the mere allegation that that Kevin on with not sit there and let his life me to strike like this they fought Trump wouldn't sit there and let\nHis nominee need be destroyed like that because they think Trump's ego was such that he will not be allowed to be made to look bad because of what somebody else did or

have forgotten but they're no different today than they were yesterday Democrats senators in red states are in heat being ... reelection trouble in fact there was news yesterday polling David late

capital of the latest poll taken after the Democrats began smearing Kavanaugh but before that committee fiasco last week showed that Kevin Cramer to Republican opponent the high camp has opened the ten point lead\nOver I camp\nJoe Donnelly in Indiana is similarly nervous Claire McCaskill in Missouri is losing their her challenger\nJosh Hawley Joe Manchin of West Virginia they've all been hoping that McConnell when wimp out or that some Republican\nSenators when women out and not vote for Kevin also that they would be off the hook and not have to\nKnow the words\nThese three Heitkamp Donnelly market what's actually for Donnelly McCaskill mansion and hike camp have all been hoping\nThat Collins caves that maybe even McConnell would cave and the Murkowski would cave and flake will continue to like him cave\n\nIn their states they're held to pay in their states people want Kavanaugh confirmed\nIn fact in North Dakota voters back Kavanaugh's sixty to twenty seven\nPolling has been gun heading the wrong way for Heidi Heitkamp so my point is it may not it may not matters or matter what happens to Collins and Murkowski\nBut if they if they actually don't vote for Kavanaugh simply based on what Trump said last night\nWell that would be embarrassing for them [noise] [noise] now since ...\nOr does questioning the veracity of Dr Ford I Want to share something with you I found today power line Scott Johnson one of the contributors in power line writes that a reader of theirs\nNoted the changes in the timeline that Dr Ford herself presented the power line reader refers to himself calls himself an engineer with especially in data visualization\nAnd he made a graphic you created a chart in essence\nBased on public sources based on the Washington Post and other legal documents\n\nAnd it is the dates to varying dates the different dates of the ... event Dr ... says happened\n\nAnd the dates float\nShe's not even consistent with the so the timeline of her story doesn't even add up\n\nThe reader notes the sudden story changed correlating with the time progression in the story date column I'll get that isn't just a second\nHis question why this sudden change within a few weeks after July six of two thousand Eighteen the answer is that when Dr Ford came into the Democrat or bits of Anna Eshoo Democrat California and Feinstein and their staffs\nAnd the highly partisan Democrat lawyer Deborah cats recommended by Feinstein right after that Ford and changed her story two more times in two months\nShe grew more specific after she began consulting with Democrat activists\nAs they conspired to destroy Kavanaugh\n\nSalt\nThe chart here and try no tried serve a difficult to convey but this is a text charge there is some uh some bars in this thing but it isn't title Dr Christine Blasey Ford's ever changing story multiple inconsistent stories of the date of the alleged incidents\n\nIn the therapists notes the incident is said to have occurred and the men the Nineteen eighties when she was in couples therapy\nThe therapist notes from when she was in the individual therapy\nSay that the story of courage and not in the mid eighties but the late eighties\nIn her text messages to the Washington Post she's back just saying that it happened in the mid eighties\nAnd hurt a letter to Dianne Feinstein she said the incident happened in the early eighties\nIn the hand written statement\nAt the time she took her polygraph high school summer in the eighties and early is\nCrossed out\n\nEarly eighties could have been eighty eighty one\nIf the Senate Judiciary committee hearings she said it happened in the summer I'm Nineteen eighty two she had never said that\nBefore she and said mid eighties late eighties mid\nEighties early eighties highschool summer early eighties she specified summer Nineteen eighty to these changes occur as she is in consultation with all these Democrat activists the staff of Feinstein and an Anna Eshoo endeavor cats the the lawyer\n\nAnd hurt changing story leaves her short on credibility put aside her emotional performance\n\nHer testimony reveals her as a witness who's memories change at her convenience\n\nThe problem for Dr Ford is not that she doesn't remember everything if the everything she remembers changes at her convenience first Ford's testimony the assaults occurred in the summer of eighty two when she would just Fifteen conflicted with both her therapist notes and the text message\nHere is that presidents should order your phones and ... yeah I forgot to warn people that
