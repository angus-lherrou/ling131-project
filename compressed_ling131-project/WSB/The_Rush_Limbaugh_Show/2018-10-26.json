of the suspected mail bomb or the\nThe the\n... or\nA former national security advisor James Clapper on CNN after his name was on a package discovered in New York earlier today and\nTrump critics Trump targets [noise] skills they keep in mind as you can be reporting there's\nA Florida residents just from the article a Florida resident identified friday as the suspect to send a dozen python

Nineteen sixty\nTwo ah income information pending what does this site can't tell what the site is it it's um [noise]\nAnyway identifies when as a member of the Green Party uh he's got pictures of Trump and he's a GOP stickers all over the uh the window so law enforcement has a press conference slated for two thirty\nThis afternoon they don't know if any more pipe bombs out there or if he has sent everything that he had the latest to recipients by the way our Cory Booker\nThe New Jersey senator and the former director of national intelligence James Clapper worthy recipients today all saw Fox News is reporting that law enforcement is telling them that\nSome of these bombs none of them have gone off but some of them have been detonated because they were judged to be so unstable that they couldn't even transport them to a Quantico, Virginia FBI lab to study them they had to go ahead and detonated a blow 'em up because they might have blown up in transit although none of them have gone off\nNone of them if they were ever intended to they may still a lot that isn't known here and a lot of people are rushing and trying to fill in blanks and this is typical during events like this everybody becomes a journalist and everybody wants to have the first\nNews on every everybody wants to be the first to learn something the first to pass it on\nAnd on to law enforcement says what they're going to say about this at all is a speculation our law enforcement so I'm definitely gonna be leaking\nBetween down to thirty to various members of the media but they like trust or what have you so there's going to be a daily use of information and what happens during these periods is that the first thing people here is what they ended up tending to believe\nThe first thing they hear the first thing they see is that that makes the first impression\nAnd that is why during this whole week some of the some people have been concerned that the media without waiting just went ahead and signed this guy as a pro Trump anti democratic guy\nIdentifying the people as Trump targets they make America Again a great again bomb or the ... bomber because it creates first impressions it it created this worldwide\nPresumption that the bomber was an angry Trump supporter set up at the people Trump is this is this is the uh the narrative if you will drive buys attempted to establish before anybody knew anything because everybody knows first impressions are what\nMatters is the thing is happening today with the economic news we have a GDP report today that growth was three and a half percent but that's below what was expected and so the drive by reporting\nThat economic activity has slowed down it's not nearly what people but it would be trying to create that first impression among the people in their audiences that there's something wrong with the economy\nThere's nothing wrong with three point five percent growth the reason why\nThe economic growth is it didn't come into the at the verdict in three point eight to four percent if guess what the tech stock sector is taking a bath specifically Google also notice alphabet and Amazon have reported earnings and every other day stunningly disappointing\nAnd it's causing sell off it's causing a big problem on the NASDAQ which is where many of the tech stocks report where they listed in and saw the same thing is happening now and with intensity because we are now at a period of time or less than two weeks before the midterm elections and what better time for the drive to report that the economy is slowing down\nEven though it's chunk of the right along jobs are still being created everything's my three and a half percent growth nobody ever saw that in the last eight years of Iraq Obama we didn't see that much before Obama wins and very often this economy still trucking right along with the Dr wiser reporting today\nThat it has a slowing down there could be trouble on the horizon and then there is this from the media right\nThe headline Trump unfortunate the bombs stuff is slowing Republican momentum going into the midterms\nNobody talks about this yesterday this was a I bought a left wing media narrative that it created but apparently Trump has signed onto what President Trump today complained about the pipe\nBombs being center prominent Democrats lamenting the scare has distracted from news about them in terms of even slow and Republican momentum\nSaid Republicans are doing so well in early voting and at the polls and not as bombs stuff happens in the momentum greatly swallows news is not talking politics very unfortunate what's going on Republicans to go out and vote\nThat this week\nI did my own little informal survey and I asked people if they've seen any signs\nOf slow down or loss of momentum or all that and then nobody nobody has you might just is sadly I Wish it wasn't the case I think Trump is half right here I think it is a reflection of what's in the nose and what is it\nAnd if there isn't any news about the Republican early voting dwarfing Democrats than the perception is that it isn't happening or negative stopped\nIt's not newsworthy enough anymore so the bomb thing has come along I mean it dwarfs the caravan that news stop being reported but more than more importantly all of the news about the heavy Republican turnout dwarfing the Democrats late Republicans pulling ... I've got a pool here today from strategic strategic strategic [noise]\nNew York city's counterterrorism director Jon Miller describing the latest explosive founded\nIn midtown Manhattan mail facility\nThe bomb squad was able to do with their equipment to conduct an X ray inside they saw what appears to be a a pipe bomb\nA consistent with other devices we've seen this week the\nPresident tweeting that the explosive packages are hurting his party's Electra insurance and saying quote Republicans are doing so well an early voting and at the polls and now this bomb stuff happens and the momentum greatly slows news about talking politics very unfortunate Andy field ABC News\nNow we are expecting a news conference from the Justice Department this afternoon around two thirty to discuss the arrest will bring that to your life also expecting to hear from the president as soon as he starts to speak will bring him to this is I think ...\nHaiti the for a limited time measurement even get to complete pairs of glasses frames lenses don't work for checking forty million dollars on single making glasses I'm eighty nine dollars on the ground and that's a good deal but we are\nGoing on over five hundred ... which makes it a great deal right now by to complete package single making glasses protests forty nine dollar or two packs of progress has only eighty nine dollars\nCan work we're here to help you know every detail offered by December ten\nAnd Lee roofing I'm Tom Shane hey guys it's ...\nAs a direct diamond importer shake company has the best value on diamonds every day but it's so much more than that we have by far the prettiest diamonds in Atlanta that's because of how we select our diamonds we go to the three diamond capitals of the world and pork Tel Aviv andme Mumbai where the diamonds are caught\nPolish and been sorted by their G.

ago I'd have to look in the mirror and say what's wrong with you\nBut I've become so cynical towards the media and the radical left in this country that I'm just thinking this way nowadays okay but this this whole thing was a package bombs to me reeks of deep state and I truly believe you've been talking about how you don't think there's going to be a red wave or flu wave I'm Sorry ...\nAnd I think I think these folks know that there is no red but I think they know they're in trouble with these elections I honestly beginning to think that the Republicans are going to gain seats in the house or or you are not nearly going to lose as many as people are thinking they are and I think it's all goes back to what like Jordan saying about that ...\nYou know and this and this whole cover up\nBut if they don't we take that house\nOnce the elections are over I think the real investigation is going to move forward on that Feisal document and that ... and I think these people are terrified the deep state I mean they cannot let that happen\nAnd I think the ... I think this package bombs are means of disrupting these elections to the point where they can then say\nBetween ... between these crazy right these these national strike group planting bombs and the Russians conspiring we cannot legitimize the win in the selection for the for the Republicans and I think they're going to try to throw the whole thing of the turmoil I really do\nI so you think that as we sit here today the deep state they are going to lose their not an American to win the house back Democrats than than they've stayed thing not going to win the house back not going to win the Senate back\nSo all of this is designed to create so much chaos that whatever the result is if the Democrats in the deep state laws and they can say election invalid too much was going on we can't we get our democracy can't function this way\nYou ... and you really think that the the deep state here set this guy out prevent he's part of a flag operation\nDesigned to make it look like a Trump supporters gone nuts here and hates the left when in fact they orchestrated if you think that\n[noise] do you do for the FBI and CIA and the Justice Department could have been corrupted to the extent that been corrupted over the past four or five years I mean I like I said rush three years ago I Would have said I'm Crazy well I I can put nothing pass them of course when you think about what the repercussions could be for them if they don't\nTwelve fifty inquiry carrier WSBIU twenty four hour traffic center just had a crash moved on to the right out of the two left lane Seventy five southbound south more as middle road exit number two fifty four in northwest Atlanta\nYou're still seeing some delays in that area than a James I begin approaching broke would as the downtown right is already jammed up so it looks like trouble twenty westbound on the west side just passively road exit number forty one in Douglas County\nYou're seeing some delays there too and that's I twenty east bound just east of Lee wrote exit forty one a crash causing delays they are getting over to Thornton roads and still slow on the Southside Seventy five north and south bound\nIn the area just south of six Seventy five or six wrestling repairs continue to go on\nAlex Williams W.

good product right now you're willing to spend money on it so I wanted to ask you ask the question of taste such on his comment yesterday about the care of it yeah I Know how lucky I Am ... and I have compassion for oh people all over the world we live in poverty who live under horrible condition\nBut it it kind of the world's population live on less than ten dollars per day fifty percent live on less than two dollars and fifty cents a day so my question to him is are we obligated to let all of them into the u._s.\nUm art to support them all with us tax dollars and it's not how do we choose who to give the gift of coming into the U.S and to exclude I'd like to suggest\nThat we have an answer for that and it's called the legal immigration which is the only fair way to make that choice\nHere here exactly right the way we have always done it\nYou know getting into this country under legal circumstances has always been a privilege it's always been an honor its always required some effort you have to learn about America you you have to want to be an American\nNow as for governor case that I don't think governor case it was advocating for anybody in poverty around the world being let it go back and that's not what he was doing\nHe was simply trying to advertise the size of his heart to I think governor case it is still one of these people\nThat thinks Donald Trump has destroyed the Republican Party and the things governor case that cares about the governor case it once everybody you know hey you know I saw big heart I look at these people who are down try the disadvantages that I still love 'em and I still care about it and I don't think he'll of them and we've got to be able to put ourselves in it\nIn their shoes and understand he he just want everybody to understand that he has a carrying fought for compassionate person as opposed to this bunk and he thinks is in the White House\nAnd uh 'cause he clearly not advocating for every one of the weather

opportunity is enough I didn't fall I'm fine I'm OK this thing goes off on me twice the show while I'm sitting here\nMy wild jak sticky operations my expression field manner of speaking as drinking might watch triggering my watching the thinking like boiling it I Can't\nGet up it starts vibrating not you know what this is a great health featured that a lot of people are buying this watch\nFor grandma and grandpa because it does it work they've had they've tested this watch on Hollywood stumped actors and stuntmen and women and it works but it's also it shows is nothing wrong with his comes back with false positives\nBut I ... my hand and even hit the table it does it just wildly just waiting around to her in my fall alert has been triggered him to watch that's what the rest of me but my point is this guy\nHere has been screaming notice me and how here comes Dana Bash from CNN justice after is a CNN sucks\nSticker on this man [noise] CNN sucks [noise] here we go\nImage than and suck of course the president in direct that he's not technically responsible for that but he is responsible for not just allowing the chat Dana Sachs has rallied stoking making clear at the he likes it and all you need is one forgive me crock pot\nAnd we've been saying this for two years and looks like one may have emerged and that is the danger and that is the reason why leadership is the way it is and you can have an enemy that have a political discussion you that have political discourse but when you cross\nWell mine is extremely dangerous and that has what has been a giant mission and everything they've heard from anybody at the White House\nOkay so in CNN's eyes that's Trump's ban and its Trump's bombs and you know in a in a vacuum and in a narrow world what Dana Bash just seven here would be perfectly fine\nBut the thing that really irritates me about CNN and the rest of these people in the leftist media is that they permit themselves to say all of these incendiary things about anybody they want they permit themselves to attack\nThe character and the intentions and the decency and the honesty of any of their targets\nAnd they can call every president Hitler like they did George W. Bush like they do Donald Trump they can accuse these people some of the most outrageous\nThings in the world and of course there's never any danger that at one of their crackpot viewers is going to take action except the theory is\nCorrect pot CNN viewers shut up a Republican baseball practice crock pot CNN viewers storm buildings where there are Family Research council members and think about letting loose with gunfire\nWe have example after example of attempt in violence against conservatism right when he was in fact one of the one of the central elements of Democrats strategy in this campaign is the public threatening and the public bullying and the public harassment\nOf Republican elected officials in restaurants in public places and these are genuinely threatening people\nAnd they are confronting people and demanding that they leave and\nAnd there's not there's never any condemnation of ... you never hear CNN condemning any of this\nKind of behavior they chalk it up well you know this is what Donald Trump has Raj there's just one Donald Trump's presidency is meant there says what Donald Trump is doing to people he's making them insanity is creating all so it's it's a one way street with these people\n\nThat I Believe Donald Trump is reacting by the way CNN starts this with their unfair bias coverage and unlike other Republicans who just sit there and take it\nAnd ... the stuff well this is politics you know it's hard wall you got to be able to take it and I'm sure the people to the inter find people's data that\nTrump fires back at them and that's what hasn't been done before Trump fires back at him\nAnd a lot of Republicans are very excited about this fighting back because for ... for too many years we've had to sit here and watch\nPowerless late as CNN and others in the media have taken potshots at us and our issues they have lied about them if they miss characterize them they attempt to do with you and the character in honor of conservative people\nSpokesman policy people and so forth now all of a sudden\nWhen an actual Republican get shot by a gun at a bullet there is no ringing of hands over what's happening to our politics because the shooter was a Bernie Sanders supporter\nSo we talk about where of course yeah I was ah mentally unstable include some wouldn't do that to anybody else comes down to Trump\nHow a lot of people separate Russia or something like two wrongs make her I'm not talking about two wrongs make a right I'm simply I I'm not talking about who started it I'm Talking about these people that want to sit here and high judgment\nOver everybody else while exempting themselves\nWhereas they said Donald Trump is perfectly capable and responsible for any behavior on the part of his supporters CNN is it\nThey're not responsible for how many of their viewers act or how any of the people on their side of the ... act and then there's this demand that they have for insulation\nAnd to be exam from having any impact on people that frankly offends me\nBut this is Dan I mean if you [laughter] if you wanted to decorate\nAnd dress up a van that says notice me and if you wanted everybody in the world to know that you are a Trump supporter who is unstable and a little over the top of our major over to stop this is what you would do\nSo my two cents for now here's President Trump at the White House today\nAs he convened a meeting black Leadership Conference\nA young black leaders from all over the country this is not been done before in in this in this manner ah [noise] and he's talking about the rest in these bombs here\nI'd like to begin today's remarks by providing an update on the packages and devices that have been male too high profile figures throughout our country and a media organization I Am pleased to inform you\nThat law enforcement has apprehended the suspect and taken him into custody\n[laughter]\nJob by law enforcement we've carried out a far reaching federal state and local investigation find the person or persons responsible for these events these terrorizing acts are despicable and have no place in our country\nNow I wanted one can remind you of Trump pacing if if you think Trump is not as on\nPoint this is your baby or selling out just hang on I Want to remind you of Trump's first reaction after ... Ford showed up\nAt the at the Senate Judiciary hearing what a Trump say I've found her very credible I really hope that she continues to testify\nI think if what happened there happened and Kevin on maybe ... that's what he said at the beginning and he did it gets himself on record just being proper in the proper way to look at it which frees them up to express what he really thinks later on his things unfold\nAnd same thing here so we may be be cool for a while as this stuff all\nBegins to shape out here I Want to remind everybody here again nobody\nAt CNN was targeted by this guy or the CNN sucks\nYou notice it's not MSNB sucks or MSNBC sort of the New York times like the CNN so have you noticed that's on there\nThe Trump praising law enforcement after they arrested Cesar ... in connection with the twelve mailed explosive devices from\nWe've carried out a far reaching federal state and local investigation to find the person or persons responsible for these events\nThe suspects van confiscated it was covered with pictures of people the president has criticized as well\nThe anti CNN slogan the suspect\nIs Cesar ... fifty six year old from ...

policies and Obama would never he would always position himself as an outsider\nUp up against powerful interests that were standing in his way and he was valiantly fighting them meanwhile it was his policies that were growing up\nAnd I I marveled at this and how the relationship to the bottom of the media permitted to him to go through his presidency on accountable\nI mean all those lives about

Florida who was arrested in connection with a suspected pipe bomb sent across the country court records show he has a history of arrest he was tracked we're told in part using his cell phone the FBI was seen examining a white band covered in stickers agents covered the band with a blue tarp before a car to get away on a truck\nPhotos of that band taken before the ... was lowered show at least one side of it covered with pro Trump and Pence anti media stickers and photos say I catch a very long wrap sheet which stretches back many years and includes one bomb threat at the White House I'm Jamie\nNow if you were here yesterday you remember me bringing this up and I haven't heard it speculated that this was happening on the drive by media and on one Fox show I heard I heard somebody at Fox a member of it was also suggesting that this bomb story had really dampened Republicans Suzie as him\nI don't know what evidence was being site that I think it was just the way people felt and I think they felt that way because all of the news of the midterms went silent\nIt was all Sheldon room to make room for coverage for the bomb story and when the news stopped covering something these people think well let's not happening anymore if it if we're not covering if it's if it's not happening in\nThe sense was that the momentum was big lost by Republicans Republican voters the story wasn't Republican voters were\n[noise] somehow losing their enthusiasm to I don't know what early vote a registered to vote whatsoever that but whatever it was not Trump is drawing that parade President Trump today\nComplained about the pipe bombs being sent to a prominent Democrats lamenting that this scare\nHas distracted from news about the midterms and even slowed Republican momentum he said Republicans are doing so well in early voting and at the polls and now there's bombs stuff happens and the momentum greatly slows news not talking politics very unfortunate what's going on Republicans to go out and vote that was Trump's tweet\nNow\nThere are some who believe that this is another example of Trump\nPacing\nJust like when he made his original statements about Christine balls the Ford being credible and compelling and then later\nSort of lowered the boom on her at a rally pointing out that she really had no evidence and the way to back up what she was alleging so some people think that he's sub during the same thing here\nI'm basically tampering expectations\nWith the bombers suppression state but the trumps out they're lowering expectations setting people up so I asked to be able to say we overcame the bomber and we did great anyway\nAnd some people think that this was very very artful of Trump that he's getting really really good at this lowering expectations while he knows things are going to go well and then when they do go well he can go back and look at what we have to overcome look at the obstacles that we knew that we came through\nAnd we try out\nSo we will see Charlie Kirk of turning point us a\nTweet in a sea there'll be yesterday that the presidential approval ratings have hit forty seven percent of his highest yet I don't need a despite the poll I'll guarantee you it's not a CNN poll and it probably is it an ABC Washington Post poll or even NBC Wall Street Journal maybe Rasmussen\nBuddy you're forty seven percent and whatever pull it is is Trump's highest and also forty seven percent is free plates higher than Obama's approval rating twenty ten midterms does anybody remember what happened is twenty seven midterms\n\nMr certainly a little pop quiz on history now admittedly this is eight years ago it seemed like eight years ago the Obama was president mid term but how many seats the Republicans win in two thousand ten term some of\nThe free\nThe Republicans won the the free now in those terms conventional wisdom one out conventional wisdom is the party out of power makes a big gains in the house and Senate primarily the house in the first election after a president is inaugurated\nWell that's what we have coming up here but but ... point is that Obama was saying at forty four forty five percent back then trumpet forty seven percent ad rising and therefore we uh we\nThey looking here at the ... a bit of an upset\n[noise] there's also polling data here in Florida and let me let me find this is the year ... barely two days after Democrats Andrew Gillum was leading in most polls for governor of Florida a strategic Research Associates poll conducted for great TV\nAnd released a couple of days ago shows Ron ... is pulling into the lead forty eight forty five margin of error plus or minus three and a half so statistically tied the poll is the first since the primaries last month to put the Santa Fe ahead\nOf Bernie Sanders supporter Andrew Gillum now there's all kinds of controversy about Gillum uh caught in this thing operate do I am reading by the way\nThat it is possible that the FBI is going to indict Gillum at some regardless of the election that he's going to be indicted for some of the corrupt practices have been investigated for a we have the news that he had he paid an undercover cops\nThe money to buy handled in tickets in New York beyond that emails in tax raise questions on Gillum trips with lobbyists record she'll Gillum new well in advance that he was out of state meetings without an Corey could help him network with power for developers businessmen and lawyers\nI mean this is incredible that a newspaper is doing investigative journalism on a Democrat but the Miami Herald is\nA it's a it's nice to see how that plays out there's a political story today actually saw it last night that Trump fear as a foreign to wipe out\nThat Donald Trump fears that we're going to lose everything in Florida that the socialist in Florida are going to win everything\nAnd so Trump is scheduling even more rallies and more effort\nFlorida to try to save the day here
