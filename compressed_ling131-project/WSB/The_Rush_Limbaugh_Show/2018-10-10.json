I don't I'm not comparing her tobacco nor I'm saying that's how it significant but I'm to the drive by trying to take these things are so desperate for good news they're desperate\nFor you know for a bunch of people that are brimming with confidence over the fact they're going to be running the world in three weeks I'm finding a lot of evidence in security for example I have a story here what is this was in the hill dot com and it's a column by somebody named Brent Butowsky\nWho sounds like the capital bowling team certainly so he thinks this guy was a legislative aide who who do you think\nThis guy worked for the lord benefit a a former senator in Texas I knew Jack Kennedy Kennedy was a friend of mine and you quail you're no Jack Kennedy that lord Benson right [noise] well whether he did or not he still writes pieces for the for the held up down Butowsky code red alert to Democrats what\nAre the Democrats were smoking I thought the Democrats are going to win everything like the he'll come at a store yesterday I mean it looked like two hundred nine seats are going to convert to the Democratic party\nFormer first lady Michelle Obama one of the most popular respected public figures in America should spend a day typing personal endorsements for democratic candidates for the house and Senate this column is a code red alert I'm reading from it by the way\nThis column is a code red alert to Democrats in a call to arms\nAre the most popular and respect the Democrats with America's such as Michelle my bell Obama do leading the charge for all hands on deck at a critical moment for America and democracy\nIn my view writes Butowsky there is a twenty five percent chance of Democrats and the mid terms with a nightmare scenario what twenty five percent chance of a nightmare wife what you guys had it all locked up\nI thought you're pretty much had the house already done although she's already talking about being speaker you guys are already planning to impeach investigate Kevin on and Trump or versus by so\nNow there's a twenty five percent chance\nThat Democrats and the midterms in a nightmare scenario that's that's not quite the same as a Ninety three percent chance Hillary wins the presidency it five pm on election night ...\nWhy are these people panicking\nButowsky says this is not a moment for complacency\nThey are easy talk of blue waves it's a moment for all the maximum action and turnout based on a powerful look urgent sense of opportunity in danger\nSays it's possible but Democrats when the house by a significant number of seats how ever it is also possible Democrats again only twenty states falling short of winning control\nThat would leave the Republican dominance\nWith a smaller but even more right wing majority of the leading loser is in the house midterms are comparatively moderate GOP house members Democrats could lose one or two Senate seats continuing Republican Senate does even further to the right and even more partners than than a GOP majority the de\n... says it's seven inches in this nightmare scenario for Democrats and America if it unfolds a vindictive and try I'm from Trump having won a victory for the politics of hatred and fear and don't you love [noise]\nYou people on the left don't understand unity when you see it you don't understand love when you see it you do not understand confidence when you see it you'll see love you see hatred\nUse the excitement you think you'll see fear when you see\nThousands and thousands and thousands trying to get into Trump rallies used some house the division\n\nOf vindictive and triumphant trouble stand alongside Republican leaders of the new Congress feeling he's achieved unstoppable dominance\nOver his party our country of every branch of government with all checks and balances destroyed this code red alert right to vote jobs gave warnings about the danger of so much unchecked power concentrated in the hands of a president who tried to criminalize his opponent [laughter]\nWhat who didn't want who tried to criminalize who\nIs this guy serious\nTried to criminal Hillary did engage in criminal activities not only what her email server but in working with the Russians and creating a phony dot CA that owned by the way there is now thanks to John Solomon folks there in ... you know\nThey want you to think they do they want you to be this theory of hand or depressed\nThey are very alarmed in fact that the latest polls that show the cabinet effect on the Republican side is ... up turnout ... up\nInterest and they're really flunked andme ticked off\nAt a bunch of polling data there is an NPR poll out there there was a Fox News poll a couple of others but show some bourbon Republican women are saying in polling data that\nThey have veil reading new interest and increased energy and intense desire to go vote this is\nNot what we're supposed to happen that's why all of these attacks\nLately in leftist media ripping in two white conservative suburban women and do we need them or not and we don't they say so this is not as we sit here today this is not developing as they want you to think it is\n\nBack in two thousand six in as you remember any pieces before the presidential race\nAnywhere in democratic media warning people hey hey you know what there is a nightmare scenario here where Trump good when you got a diamond back we've got to be very careful you remember any of that\nThere was none they were so solid sure they were definitely of of uh convinced that they weren't going to win every Hillary was going to win and the biggest landslide\nI mean they had Trump's chances at three percent seven percent ten percent\nBut nobody gave Trump a chance in fact some of the news even said Trump never thought he was going to win Trump never even wanted to win Trump was the most surprised guy in election night in the world when he won he didn't want to when they were all depressed that Trump headquarters that's what they want you to believe\n\nNow they started out saying the same thing is no power is a birthright that every American realizes the Democrats have to be put back in power\nEvery American realizes the mistake of voted for Trump every Trump voter can't wait to apologize every Trump voter realizes embarrassed wants to fix the mistake can't wait to vote for the next Democrat on their ballot\nNow all of a sudden it's not just Butowsky by the way either there are others who are\nRaising red flags out there that this might not be developing\nAs they wish also from Fox News the homeland security secretary Kirstjen Nielsen\nSaid yesterday that the Chinese coms are engaged in an unprecedented influence campaign leading up to the midterms this is the Trump administration's latest warning that the check comes or attempting to sway American opinion I handled the elections\nWho to the Chinatowns want swim [noise]\nChai comes want the Democrats to win right why do you think that is why why would a bunch of international communist dictators want the Democrat Party to win and they're trying to come through not our friends at trying calms want American leadership they can easily manipulate and triumph over\nA try comes don't want to be part of Trump Donald Trump\nThere's this new trade deal getting rid of NAFTA you know what this is done\nThis has put China back on its heels\nLike nobody fought Donald Trump the United states now controls access to Mexico and uh all of North America United States and Canada\nYou've got to go through us you've got to make deals with us if you want to export you're going into Mexico Canada United States because Trump put together this new deal getting rid of NAFTA made the new deal the ... never thought this was going to happen\nThey don't want Trump they don't want any more if Trump they would be eager for whoever the Democrats put up I just find it fascinating international bunch of communists are trying to affect our elections so that they're friendly Democratic Party and America wins\nThat somebody has to have to say Russia's probably by being met for\nNews Ninety five five and a um seven

S. B. meteorologist Cornell is\nThe greatest risk for flooding or wind damage or south of the line from Athens to le Grange rain amongst the next forty eight hours one to three inches on average with isolated higher totals heaviest south in the suburbs\nUnimportant yes that's right white women I forgot white women we don't like white women right that's right we don't even though I Am one\nWhite women all white women or women went for me white women went for Trump and look white women have been voting against democratic presidential candidates for decades now\nThe white vote has only then won twice in the last six years my husband being one of the two Lyndon Johnson being there it's just not a surprise it's a disappointment to white women vote Republican and not for me but it is what it is\nAnd they're in Hillary Clinton's stumbled Anna swerved in to a truth except for the very\nExceptional election year of Nineteen sixty four which was following the JFK assassination\nThe Democrats have not gotten more than fifty percent of the white vote in the presidential election since Nineteen thirty two\nNow when you look at it that way you can understand why in the Democratic party circled there's hatred for white people white people white women had been rejecting the white married suburban women had been rejecting them this is why the kind of Nazi movement sprang up this is why\nThe ... the left as as as started contacting all different categories for non white suburban women to be plugged into so that they can then be said to be democratic constituents\nThis by the way this is again why in Nineteen sixty five Ted Kennedy and the Democrats re opened the floodgates to immigration I Need to remind everybody again from about Nineteen Twenty one and Nineteen twenty three if you're Nineteen sixty five we shut down immigration I Would not to zero\nBut we put very strict limits on and the reason was to be able to assimilate\nAll of the immigrants that come into the country the late Eighteen hundreds through the Nineteen early twenties\nAssimilation was key to American immigration policy arriving immigrants all wanted to be citizens by the way and there were things they had to do\nTo become citizens they had to learn a language and they had to learn the history of America they had to be able to pass questions about the history of America on a test\nAnd they had to swear and pledge their loyalty and devotion to the United states and they were eager to do it and they were happy to do it now they they maintain their ethnicity\nThe Irish the Italians unit but they wanted to become Americans and they did and it took a number of years to assimilate them all well Nineteen sixty five is when Ted Kennedy led the charge to reopen the immigration floodgates\nThen of course when to once that happened illegal immigration ramped up in an uncontrollable way\nAnd\nThat wave of immigrants starting in Nineteen sixty five came from third world socialist countries the Democrats\nRealized they could only when the White House if they changed the population of America they were losing presidential elections with the Native American population because they were losing\nWhite women and Mrs Clinton just admitted it here it's a Christian I'm for up CNN it never occurred to them to change their policies what they have to do in order to attract white voters what they have to do\nWas change America so back to Hillary she said what was done last night in the White House meeting Trump apologizing for the nation to Kavanaugh what was\nDone in the White House last night she said was a political rally it further undermine the image and integrity of the court and that troubles me greatly crusty on I'm for it saddens me because our judicial system has been viewed as one of the main pillars of our constitutional to\nAddress the judicial system has been viewed by you as he lectured insurance the judicial system has been viewed by you and Mrs Clinton the rest of the Democrats as your private refuge\nYou have looked at the court as a place you can stock like minded the leftist activists\nTo make sure things that you believe in which never could pass legislation somehow become law in America that's why they want the courts\nIf you want to really get frustrated you've heard me say this and you've probably heard a lot of other people but stop and think about this outside of Obamacare\nPractically every liberal\n... the steak every liberal idea and belief that now is the law in this country would not have become law in Congress because it never would have passed liberalism and the Democratic party's ideas have never been mass popular the only way\nThat we have bastard ice pop culture the laws of the reality today is because Democrats activists judges have been essentially writing law when they take cases and interpret them and then pronounce\nDecisions roe versus Wade is the most certainly example of this but there are countless others the simple fact of the matter is the Democratic party has never been capable of winning\nLegislation to implement the ideas they believe in because most of the American people when they know what's at stake don't wants them that's the value of judges and that's the value of courts to the Democrats wouldn't Mrs Clinton says\nThat what happened in the White House the other night saddens her\nBecause our judicial system has been viewed as one of the main pillars of our constitutional and got the ass not by you in fact to Hillary Clinton and people like her the Constitution's an obstacle is well it's certainly not something to revere\n\n... did you see any way even a conservative state college where I was speaking to yesterday said the only way to repair America is to try to get back to some civility to try to make it that even if we had political disagreements we're not going to go to war with each other we're not going to destroy each other\nHillary Clinton well certainly I Would love to see us returned disability Christianity on for listening to one another working on our differences\nBut that is not the Republican Party that exist today that is certainly not the administration that we haven't power right now when the Republican Senate denied the right of President Obama to have his nominee for the Supreme Court Merrick Garland here we go off to the races again missed characterizing that\nBlue in the face\nThat's a Joe Biden rule the Democrats invented that rule that presidents don't get the name Supreme Court justices during vacancies that happened in the last year of their term that's a Democrat inspired instituted rule and she knows it\nBut the Republicans didn't destroy Merrick Garland the Democrats didn't have to fight battles

podcast so I was wondering do is try a member of rush twenty four seven can you reveal that\nAre not allowed to reveal not allowed to reveal who are who are members are we of course you know we know everything about our members but we're not allowed to divulge any of that information\nYou you you you don't have a chance to listen to you you basically check the website twenty four seven the up and the pod cast every day\nWell I mean like I say I've been working I'm a fan of yours for thirty\nYear understand that you're yeah I I'm so you think you'll do you listen to this program the pod cast to check the website and you watch a Trump rally and you hear Trump say things that you\nHeard or read a ... my website is that right\nOh yeah I mean I hear him say the thing that I Know he you know he's smart that he doesn't come up with himself but so I mean I can see him listening to your podcast like in the morning when he gets gets up at the White House and things like that would be the most efficient way\nI can honestly say that I Do not know if the president listens to the podcast now he's told me he listens to the program and it gets a chance and he is is that but\nYou know who knows but he's told me he does I I I've been very flattered by by your comment can I ask you a question before we go on I'm sure I just I Want people to hear it how do you get the podcast everyday how have your range to receive it\nWell I have your app and I download your podcast\nRight there right there on the app right if it and it's not complicated is that you were able to figure it out\nYeah no I Would not have I mean I'm Sorry I was able to figure it out um I think you have fixed a few bucks which which are good the releases you fix were good\nAnd we're constantly working on bug fixes we uh what the there's a new wave of ... just the other day that the developer yeah and I get this done 'cause I'm tired of waiting on it\nYeah it used to be if you were in your car and you're listening to our one and then out one runs out it wouldn't go automatically to our two\nWell that now that interestingly that was not exclusive to us that happened to be the way they ended up being bad\nAnd we did have to change the way they got to have the download 'til you want to play back in the proper order but that wasn't just our podcast it was any number of people that originally it was an eye Jones problem it was the way I children's organize them ah we're we're eventually able to overcome that with our with our own ... did you use I chose ... got a straight to the ap\nYeah I mean in fact I bought my first I thought you know I didn't even know what it was right and I bought it because that's how your test\nDrive as it doesn't want to people here that I Want to hear how easy it is and the

want to you about an hour and a half to listen to the whole show our forty minutes\nYeah I mean it's great because like I listen to all the way home from work\nBecause there are any commercials in the past right it's just me\nIt's just you know and then I I can knock out and listen to you know your whole show and an hour and a half\nIsn't that amazing thing isn't that amazing\nIt's big and we don't double dip on our sponsors [laughter]\nAnd it's an ... it's a benefit for people that joining become members of Rush Limbaugh's time if you want the program out free bow there it is in broadcast

task is how it got to original name now the I ... there's been incorporated into the iPhone and the eye pad\nNo friends you may think that and I'm not going to try to just abuse you of it but the president's doing this because if he didn't\nCan you imagine the stories that would be published Trump doesn't care Trump didn't convened a meeting Trump didn't ask very many questions Trump didn't seem curious Trump doesn't seem to have any real entrance since he doesn't have a home they're all this kind of stuff that they would say about him\nHe does this for a host of reasons but most importantly I Believe\nDonald Trump likes himself and he's very proud of the job he's doing and he wants to be able to see it and he knows that the primary conveyor is of information in this country do not\nConvey\nProper information about him is there's only smart here's here's Kennan Oklahoma City we're back to the phones great to have your er Hi\nHey it's great to be on Russia I'm not only are you all rushed but but you are the lead voice of the mainstream media you should have the best stepping on gas\nOr should have the ... and ... [laughter] hey my point is a today a\nWith Hillary's comments that are basically liberals don't need to be civil to conservatives anymore it reminded me of a profound quota came across years ago and maybe even you set\nA but here's the quote a society is either moving towards civility for barbarism and I see Trump trying to apply civil law and order to our society and\nIt's apparent that the liberal laughter is embrace the farmers\nJust wanted to get your thoughts are ... but the question is do I do I agree that uh our society has always trending toward\nA barber is what what barbarism in a society barbarism or certainly were trending one way or not in the middle of the ... eater trending towards civility or barbarism off the clocks\nAnd the oh it's a constant flocks and so what what what what is your question more Trump isn't it\nWell it seems as if a Republican conservatives are taking the side of civility and working uh you know towards law and order or restoring\nIt and it seems like the Democrats have just outright embraced barbarism right ah with all of their character assassination attempts on Trump Kavanaugh antifa violent shooting\nYeah there's no there's no question about that it's an active choice I mean Hillary Clinton's endorsing it\nYeah absolutely and uh it's it's sad to see because this is not the Democrat Party of my uh mother and father and I remember so well you know the conservatism here in Oklahoma where I live uh in fact in most of the states\nWell let me ask you this was the Democratic party the Democratic party ... what was it when that was all button fine and dandy one more day then\nI think it was before the Nineteen forties\nNone of what they what not when what why are they what were they like when the Democrats worry the Democrat Party over your dad or your grandpa what what they want but I'm doing\nWell um the Democrats at at that time they see a issue was a labor laws and um when\nWhat purpose\nMy point the Democratic party hasn't changed that much is my point the Democratic party has always been rooted\nIn the modern era in our lifetimes in this century and the previous at the Democratic party has been rooted in\nAnti capitalism has been rooted in pro socialism and big government they've just now a band in any pre chance of moderation about that and have gone all in\nOn militant and violent socialism to achieve their means my point they're not that different there just mass getting less today\n... know read about it in the paper tomorrow Raj Shah Mickey I be met work\nHey I'm Brandt so there's this guy didn't Jordan he's a healthy guy he's a data of six and he works as a guide in Alaska and it goes to the doctor a true story goes to the doctor and he was diagnosed with cancer stage four\nAnd here's the thing he had switched earlier for medical insurance to met issue here where Christians share each other's medical bills to the question for Jordan and his wife Jenny was is this actually going to work our medical bills\nExceeded a hundred and sixty thousand dollars met his share members shared all our bells\nAnd it was about more than just the money to this is a real community\nMedicare is is a family a group of people that stick with you because the hardest times of your life I just don't know how I could have done it without ... sure\nIt's still worth looking into there's a reason this is growing so fast so if you want to find out more here is a number for you\nEight five five fifty one Bible that's eight five five five one B.
