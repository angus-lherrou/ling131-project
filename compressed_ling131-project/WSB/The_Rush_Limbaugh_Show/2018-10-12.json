jelly\nListened to this story this was from the federalist papers liberal professor says hurricane victims deserve to what thank God because they support Republicans\nNow do you think these clowns in Boston with zero in on something genuinely deranged like this no they're going to make up the fact that a bunch of people like me who know oh that climate change man made climate change is a hoax are somehow responsible for people having lost everything including risking their lives\nDoes University of St Thomas engineering school in Minnesota thermal and fluids sciences professor Dr John Abraham he's a professor actually believe the Florida Panhandle residents deserve to get hit by a catastrophic hurricane because they elected climate deniers\nHere's the headline in an article written by this guy was published in the guardian not some obscure little rag or penny saver this was published in the guardian\nOn Thursday victims of hurricane Michael voted for climate deniers elections have consequences denying science has consequences and we are reaping what are we so\n\nPeople just like this are teaching your kids and they're being paid a lot of money to do it this is a lot of chicken the reasoning that he is teaching these engineering school the guy is still range this is this is hyper political partisanship disguised as science\nHe thinks that voting for Republicans causes hurricanes to hit red states and the people in red states who voted Republicans deserved to get wiped out by hurricanes for voting for Republicans and his name\nIs Dr John Abraham a University of St Thomas engineering school in Minnesota\n\nDespite the lack of science to support his case Dr Abraham blames Michael's intensity on manmade global warming there isn't any evidence for it it's not the most intense hurricanes ever hit the panhandle\nYet he blames the intensity or manmade global warming are needing to his subsequent claimed that southern voters brought this upon themselves\nBy voting Republicans into office\nIt's a wonder that a state like Florida which will get pummeled by Michael couldn't vote for somebody that denies climate change this doctor wrote\nPointing to governor Rick Scott andme to Senator Marco Rubio on the his argument is that in the last Republican climate deniers or voted out of office that more hurricanes will bring more death and destruction others not be so

Republican and and denying climate change that these hurricanes are coming after you know do you remember after Hurricane Katrina you people might have thought that I was joking there were people\nIn the leftist medium\nWho literally we're trying to tell people in New Orleans that George Bush wanted that hurricane to strike Louisiana he wanted it specifically the strike New Orleans this is why there weren't any warnings it wanted it to strike New Orleans because Bush knew that residents of New Orleans would have to abandon the city\nAnd go to Texas\nWhere as Democrats they would be absorbed and wouldn't affect any political outcomes but in Louisiana you can turn the state Republican if you get rid of a bunch of New Orleans Democrats and sort of people out there saying that Bush actually wanted the hurricane to wipe out New Orleans so that residents would have to leave\nWould have to go to Houston there\nWere some even saying that Bush was doing what he couldn't just steer the hurricane that Bush was responsible for it because Bush told the weather service to downplay the warnings\nWell I didn't want to mention that but I'll go ahead and mentioned there were some ... now these were not mainstream media people but they did repeat this there were people out there talking on a tax on the Internet who were claiming that Bush was steering the hurricane\nRemember that\nThat Bush was hearing that hurricane Bush himself the president was hearing the hurry and and what this guy is professor at the University of St Thomas is no different by claiming that simply the way people\nVote determines where a hurricane goes how stronger hurricanes going to be and whether or not the hurricanes gonna wipe you out and he doesn't know\nYeah it's the redneck Riviera and yeah

theatres it's God's Nell\nThe trial of America's biggest\nSerial killer now ... is an abortion doctor who got away with the ... murders in Philadelphia got away with the wanted murder of\nThousands\nNobody can get the media interested in the story even after he was charged and convicted and put on trial and the reason is that correct guys now\nWhat's the worst thing that ever happened to people who want to keep abortion\nThought of and categorized as something other than\nWhat it is\nThe media wouldn't cover it and nor the trials very much there have been a lot of people who did covered Michele market was one of the leaders also people at the like and Marcy on hot air was was hot on the trail of guys and I think they wrote over a hundred and sixty different articles\nSo that trend has been how do you do a movie about this how do you get it made me in\nMovie equals Hollywood how'd he get stars had to get people to start at how do you get money to finance it how do you get it made in how you get a distributed and how do you find the theaters\nThat will exhibits that thing how do you do or and they they ran into every predictable problem that you can imagine but they ... and they got it done and the way they got this ... this is a movie about the trial of karma guys now it's it's it's a\nIt's a procedural movie like a procedural crop cop show crime in a cop show on TV meaning it follows a formula\nIt doesn't get overtly political it doesn't it doesn't want to limit the audience by getting political even with a trial this movie has a rating a PG Thirteen and it's about wanting abortion murder there is not a lot of hardly any\nAbhorrent Gore and\nViolence in the movie and it's to pick them in a in other ways it's not meant to shock it's meant to entertain and educate it's an attempt to you is a movie\nIn a responsible way to do things that movies are supposed to do entertain entertain entertain enlighten may be informed it's not the political movie that the left would make\nAbout a story like this it can avoid the politics but it is exceptionally well done for the subject matter you're you're not going to be if you go see it you're not going to be watching people advocating for a cause\nYou're not going to see a movie designed to separate you from your money in terms of political fundraising you're gonna see Hollywood professionals who happen to be pro life producing a movie about something that really happened\nA mass murderer he was a mass murderer of people in the room that nobody on the left one at anybody to know about\nWhat he did and Kermit guys now was despicable but he was a charming guy even engaging smile and laugh even and this trial it was said that he was charming people now are oh buddy Nick Searcy\nDirected this and I don't know anything about directing movies\nBut I can imagine some of the challenges in in a movie like this you don't want to preach and you don't want to make your movie of target but you want to be truthful about it and you want\nThe message to be delivered\nBut you don't want to turn people off you don't want people to think that you're being they're they're they're being preached or any of that\nAnd so when I looked\nAt it I didn't I didn't see Nick Searcy you as a bunch of special effects or other things to distract you just let the story tell itself and it's basically the trial there some set up\nThe story itself is all anybody needs to know the number one mass murder in America which he was never referred to as because of course the left abortion is\nNot even human it's a viable tissue mass or what have you uh it's got\nStars people that you know people put their careers on the line to star in this movie the odds are that they're going to have trouble getting cast and other movies having been identified with is dean Cain is one\nOf the ah the actor who plays a gazelle himself as a as an actor in a I think ... commercials name as Earl Billings and for somebody\nThat's only widely known as an actor in TV commercial this guy does one heck\nOf a job it's probably the finest\nRole that he's played or for the best performance that he's had a I Would guess a as an actor but I just want to let you know that if it if you're thinking about going to it's PG Thirteen we're not talking acts we're not we're not even talking are here so\nYou're not gonna be immersed in a bunch of\nRepulsive Gore and again it's it's thought that they don't need to do that tell the story of the story itself tells itself\nThe trial of America's biggest serial killer there are a lot of people who have\nPut everything in their careers on the line to get the movie made they got it made a lot of people who put their careers and the line agreeing to appear and star
