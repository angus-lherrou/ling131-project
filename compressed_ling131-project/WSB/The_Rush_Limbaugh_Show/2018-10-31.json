fifty nine\nFriday mostly caught in much cooler showers sixty percent likely in the morning high sixty three lows forty to forty three we have\nSunshine sixty eight degrees a WSBIU depend on it\nI listen to and again this is Monday Night on CNN steak in a couple of days for this to reach the mainstream [noise]\nNon ... says it on Monday Night on CNN and noticed today and again he's talking the freight Cuomo\nAbout all the recent shootings in mailed pipe bombs and ... says there was another have filled criminal just last week in Kentucky another white man in custody for shooting and killing two African Americans in a grocery store we barely had time to cover it\nWe have to stop demonizing people and realize the biggest terror threat in this country is white men must have been radicalized to the right and we have to start doing something about them there is no travel ban on them you know they have the Muslim ban there is no white guy ban\nNow John Lennon uh what is your reaction to this I mean the folks I'm telling you this is not a one off this is I mean there's specific of a white guy ban them that that may be something that he individually hold so the idea that the opposition\nAs far as the leftist concerned as white men predominantly white Christian man that's that's that on the money that's right exactly where they are aimed in the perverted view of the American left it as white men who created this racist in bigoted unfair unjust immoral country do not consider me to be exaggerating here\nThat is what we are up against and there's all of this from the from the ... days all the way up for the Obama administration and a real objective has been\nTo transform America away from the\nTraditions and institutions of the founding based on the fact that it's all racist and it's all bigoted and it's all unjust an unfair they continue to point to slavery as the primary\n\nEvidence to the primary example or exhibits\nOf their claim that America's unjust or unfair that of course pay no attention to the steps America took to end racism that gets no credit gets no mention whatsoever as far as they're concerned racism in slavery still exist in prisons on the caravan and immigration policy you name it [noise]\nAnd so this is what's animated or this is certainly one has energized and field of women all over this country with rage leftist women it's being utilized\nTo what a great effect but that's the single organizing purpose is racial or as a racist but it's racial in uh in its origins\nNow it covers much more grounded in terms of its objective but that's their target that's what they're using and had been for a while to energize everybody who is not a white man they're using victim allergy and victimhood in to a tea\nThey are making people think that they have no chance in America as long as white men continue to run it and be a white men to continue to be the majority\nAnd I just continually enraged people they ratchet up the anger there has to be an outlet for it I think they are if you if you want to start attaching if you want to start attaching media\nResponsibility to the actions of people you notice how quickly they want to do bad notice how quickly on the left at people who commit crimes are not really responsible for them they're always the result of environmental things\nAnd so on the left telling us that these guys are being motivated by Trump either love Trump or they hate Trump but whatever Trump is making them do these things I think it's day if you're gonna if we're going to go down that road and if we're going to start attaching blast\nWell who don't really have any responsibility for making the bombs or pulling the trigger on the guns who is that that's an raging them like I say you cannot turn on the news today and find a single thing positive about anything\nYou can't you cannot find any reinforcement anywhere in public media for the good innocent decency of America it's quite the exact opposite\nAnd since these people are the vast majority of media you know they exempt themselves from having any role in all of this while they are eager to try to find anybody else in media who might be to blame for this\n\nDon Lemon sad or is it Monday Night also that he doesn't see Democrats killing people over politics\nYou mean Don like the followers of black lives matter aren't Republicans in that group looking number of police officers have been murdered Mr lemon by black lives matter supporters and look at how many of those cops murders have\nBeen defended and explained away by people like you\nIn the sense well there are cops and they mistreatment racist they deserve it but don't try to tell me the Democrats are killing people yeah how about the guy but shut up the Republican baseball practice I think he was just telling a wound to people stay squeeze almost did die it's amazing these people why they talked about things they conveniently forget\nOr don't even register maybe in the first place five cops in Dallas two thousand sixteen\nOr the Muslims in this country who have committed murder or they Republicans nope many of them are very loyal Democrat voting bloc Muslim Americans in fact maybe and even more reliable Democrat vote than black voters\n\nAccording to Forbes magazine of the free thousand three hundred and forty two people killed by terrorists in the U.S between Nineteen Ninety two in two thousand Seventeen Islamic terrorists are responsible for Ninety two percent of those murders and yet Don Lemon on CNN says the problem\nThat yeah where did it go down\nIn leaders Taiwan there about a hundred and eighty nine people died it was a brand new I Believe is Boeing I'm not exactly sure\nWell there's no way to link it to Trump good point\nThere is no way to link it to the mid term elections there's no way to use that crash to gin up anti Republican anti Trump no I'm not joking\nThe hell I'm not sure I'm not joking and they don't care about it because it has no impact and has no usage they can see in affecting the outcome they wanting to mid term elections don't worry they'll get to it when their side of the time to attack a corporation\nLike bowling or whoever made the plane they'll get to it after they've done what they can do on the midterms\nMuch appreciate it you do you do you do you do you do doubt me on this\nPersonally no but uh just trying to remember CNN go when wall to wall on that last plane that went down\nWell of course because that's CNN CNN neighbors there there was they were sucking hot the uh they were in last place out there and this was that was pre Trump and the ...\nThe belief in media is that airline airplane crashes airliner crashed as a lot of passengers is white glow eyeballs are below the TV\nSo they believe and then they had a mystery where it is a damn thing where is it Don Lemon\nEven ask the former director of National Transportation Safety Board could it have been swallowed by a black hole\nRemembered that you remember that\nCats but certainly remember that ... ...\n... but they they had a mystery on their hands and and they you're right they went wall to wall\nWith it and it became a standing joke you know that the the best way to make anything you're doing it success is to lose it and and have CNN try to find it for you\nI just haven't seen it on any media or whether it's Yahoo\nGoogle CNN NBC none of the nightly news show one picture from what I've seen it wait a minute how do you know about it then\nWell I saw it on a headline\nNews maybe where Monday morning when ... was the headline news\nHeadline news they just announced they're getting out of the news headline news just announced they're going to go eighty percent\nUh uh advertising or something like what do you ever forget what you call that program but\nI just wanted to kill your that that was not one ... usually any kind of ... showing that many people especially it was a brand new planning that\nAre when are you such a brand new playing what kind of playing was that he says about what you remember the model number\nBut since it's brand new has got to be one of the time you know somewhat but uh and that's what made me think even more that we would see news as to a brand new plan going down his unusual and ah we went out\nTo sea sucked into it I'll tell you what it was a bowling seven thirty seven max which is the latest uh upgraded to seven ... seven thirty seven is a debate wide body\nAnd not as widely courses a jumbo jet wide body but it's stuffy and they have a mix of the damn thing to try to make a whole more passengers went down but\nIt didn't go down in America a Donald Trump has nothing to do with it going down that they could they make a case uh they they could not say that the pilot was angry at Trump and decided to take everybody out in his ... ...\n... no way to link this I'm not I'm not joking\nI Wish I was there is no way to link that crash

Sabrina cupid live in the delta USC twenty four hour news that are\n[noise] I don't want us to be covers Georgia's race for governor how big ruling\n[noise] get the impression that all of that inertia and energy is lost but I think people in the news business and consumers of those are two different things and I really believe that people in the news business in all businesses are among the most detached from their customers\nConsumers that any other business out there\nAny other retail business I think the news business has people that know the least about their customers and consumers and I don't know of a business out there that that has contempt for their customers and consumers like the news media does don't know if one\nI don't know of a business who ... who who rejects half if not more of their consumers are customers like the news business does but the news media\nHas a habit and that is is assuming and then the operating on the assumption ... whenever they think and wherever they care about is what everybody thinks or everybody cares about\nSo I'm not so sure that all that momentum got interrupted if the momentum was interrupted if that energy level decline that wire Trump's rallies still so over the he's got one in Fort Myers like it's Ford miners\nYeah fertilizer thousands of people already wind up Trump's got six rallies planned between now\nAnd election day you've got all the way up to the night before the election\nAnd he's pumping a series of themes and one of the themes is how great these past two years have been for the U.S economy reviving moribund industry is bringing back employment bringing back wage increases bringing back a economic confidence consumer confidence in the economy\nUh he's talking about how all the things he wants to do to slow down the illegal immigration but he was having to deal with obstacles put on his way by both parties always messages\nAnd he remains is upbeat and optimistic as anybody ever has in circumstances like this so whatever is out there in the daily news media's not affecting Trump doesn't affect his mood doesn't affect his uh\nAttitude or anything of the sorts I think a lot of it as wishful thinking I got a lot of this idea that all of this momentum that the Republicans had has been kinda stopped because the pipe bomb and the synagogue shooting\nThis was\nYou know I I circled back to I really don't know what's going to have another election day and I don't believe everybody else does because we don't have fortune tellers\nAnd all we have is polling data and then yeah that's a toss up you want to believe in the end not want to believe it is it is it accurate is showing these close races really close we we don't know we never know until the aftermath\nHere's Trump tweeting out at Paul Ryan Paul Ryan should be focusing on holding the majority rather than giving his opinions on birthright citizenship something he knows nothing about\nOur new Republican majority will work on this closing the immigration loopholes\nThis is about this is this a classic Trump comes out and gets a conversation started on eliminating birthright citizenship and Paul Ryan is one of the first opponents to speak up criticizing Trump\nSaying why you can't do that that's unconstitutional but it's ... I'll tell you what's frustrating to me there is all kinds of great news in this country economic news all kinds of a rebirth and there's evidence that everywhere and the Republican Party itself is not even getting that message out\nI don't know about individual candidates an individual races but the national Republican Party apparatus\nIf it weren't for Trump and his tweets and his his rallies\nThe American people wouldn't have anywhere near the idea of the decent good things going on out there because Trump's own party is not joining the PR parade on this\n\nThat's one of the reasons I'm never going to join this crowd and people thinks Trump should stop tweeting and Trump should stop all these uh incendiary things he says why let me ask you some people\nIt's horrible what Trump said about ... why\nIs it why is it why is it\nA problem the Paul Ryan talked the first chance he had to disagree with his own president about this and by the way all this this is a conversation starter right now\n\nIt's it's mandatory it's necessary that we have a conversation as we don't get a handle on this immigration problem you can say goodbye to America is you know it\n\nWhich is the design that's one of the reasons why the supporters are what they are Mollie Hemingway has a great piece today [noise] speaking of cabin on it's just right on the money and let me ask you a question during the cabin on hearings\nRemember all the Democrats questioning Kevin I remember all of the allegations we had balls the forward with her allegations of whatever capital I did that led to the fact that capital spiking punch with drugs to set women up for serial rape we had all of these women that were dragging forward claiming\nThey have evidence of it none of them ever present at any but\nThe media and the Democratic party were hell bent on convincing everybody that Kevin was such a rotten guy that his life and career deserve to be destroyed\nSo\nAfter Kavanaugh's named to the Supreme Court he is he passes it gets ... gets the confirmation vote and is in sworn in why did the media drop it\n\nIf Kavanaugh was such a rotten S. O. B. Y. has the media stopped its investigation\nRemember all the Democrats are yeah yeah I Would have Kavanaugh's confirmed we're going to a piece you were going to throw out of there we're going to get one of those guys are represented serial rapist where is all they just it's gone is it not\n\nMollie Hemingway\nIf the media and other Democrat leaders wanted to have any credibility of all that the post hearing release of multiple allegations was not a pure political\nStunt for which they were willing to destroy a man why they continue to fight for justice everyday wouldn't they they'd still be out there trying to nail Kavanaugh if all of that was legit if\nIf everything Kavanaugh was accused of being was\nActually true as they would not have stopped at him being confirmed on the Supreme Court they would still be out there right because of\nJustice\nThey would be out there asking every democratic candidate whether he believes Ford and supported impeaching Kevin why aren't they doing that\nThere is a big campaign going camping all of us have been rallying point Kevin always a reason to deny the Republicans continued leadership in the house so why isn't the media asking every Democrat candidate running for office\nTheir opinion if Kavanaugh did you believe balls the Ford and if you did do you still support impeaching capital where are these questions\nThe reason those questions are being asked of the reason why the media isn't doing is just because it was all trumped up it was manufactured none of it was true it was a classic Democrat operation like every damn one of these is\nNone of what they were saying about Kevin office was manufactured they didn't bring balls the Ford up until the very end as a Hail Mary if balls the Ford were actually telling the truth she would have been\nOne of the first witnesses she would have been one of the primary ways the Democrats sought to get rid of Kavanaugh but they had this little requests from her not Jimmy made ... Ives terrify here and so they had a built in excuse not to use it that was convenient\nThis whole thing was manufactured the whole thing was made up\nYour Republicans running for office if you have these debates left you need to start asking a Democrat opponents\nThey still oppose Kevin all don't let them get away with dying they ask you ask them if they still support Kavanaugh or oppose Kevin I asked them if they are going to demand that he'd be impeached if they win reelection or election\nIf this Kevin all thing is going to work it's going to have to be turned back on the Democrats the Republicans running for office are going to have to keep bringing this up either in campaign and we've got a week it's not too late to include this in any ad campaign if if it's been decided to leave it out\nNot too late to cut some new ads and re inserted\nPeople need to be reminded\nLet's pretend that some of the momentum was lost located we got plenty of time\nWe got the E R B network got all kinds of ways to remind people what happened to Brett Kavanaugh who did it what its purpose was and the proof that it was a series of lies and made up charges as evidenced by the fact that now there's not a single story about it\nBecause the media lost the Democrats lost\nIn their effort to destroy Kevin ... they lost in their attempt to use Kavanaugh they're hurt Democrat hurt Republicans in the in the mid term elections\nHere's another one if the cabinet confirmations circus\nWe're about justice for his alleged victims the women instead of about killing his nomination by any means we'd still be getting updates on the story when we I mean if it was really the purpose\nAbout getting justice if it was to make sure that these women that were sold on the line and so abused in Seoul raped by Kevin ... is the point of all that wants to get justice for them then why is justice not being sought\nGreg Lucy recording this afternoon just two hours after Stacey Abrams announce it Oprah Winfrey was headed to Atlanta Marta campaign at an event\nTickets were sold out for President Obama campaigns for Abrams at Morehouse on friday and then President Trump will be in Macon Sunday with Republican gubernatorial candidate Brian camp and careful on the roads today a new study of us traffic data finds a forty three percent higher risk of the destined deaths on Halloween\nThan any other night of the year we're going to check in with that\nWell it just a moment from the USB twenty four hour traffic's arms\nAre they going to be ... you want to learn how to make money flipping houses right here in Atlanta\nAnd happens if so we have an amazing opportunity for you\nWere looking for a small group of motivated individuals to join our real estate investing team no more in our simple three step system for flipping homes right here in the local area than Meryl store of any hit TV show flipped this house my team and I are looking for a handful of people in the Atlanta\nAn Athens area who want to learn how to make money living houses in your spare time using other people's money Atlanta in Athens are perfect markets for my system and this week I'm holding a free to our educational workshop where you will learn how to make money flipping homes and how to build long term wealth with income properties\nTo get to free tickets to the fans workshop texture five digits ZIP Code to eighty two thousand seeding is extremely limited so texture five digits ZIP Code to eighty two thousand right now because this free ticket offer expires this Friday just texture ZIP Code to eighty two thousand\nFrom Justin Boots and horse el starts in Marietta and snow this weekend\nBest deals will be your own Justin Boots bruises or the ...

call I was a twelfth grade American history teacher for Twenty years and I finally had to\nLeave because ... was becoming more than I can handle I started writing my own class has caused courses because I couldn't handle how they had revised American history the reason I called was the topic on immigration\nImmigration if it's in the book probably gets about one paragraph\nWhat most people don't understand is when these millions of people came over to Ellis Island we didn't just open our arms and say come on in a way that Democrats want it to him now these people were given a thorough examination by the ship\nEspecially looking at their eyes they take a device and flick open up\nThe upper I live and if you had a disease called trick karma you were automatically let go they made you walk up and down steps to make sure that you are strong and we're not when did\nNow wants to ship doctor perform his examination you were put on the ship and you were sent to Ellis Island where they gave you a second examination\nDoing the coma exam once again\nWalking up and down the steps\nAnd if you didn't make it you were sent back about two percent of people were sent back and the reason why it was so low is because the ship doctor really did a thorough exam\nIf you were sent back that ship had to pay for your passage back to Europe so they wanted to make sure we did not want any on that could not work\nWas not healthy and which not strong\nYou realize that what you're describing is factually correct there are people listening to you today who think my God America was cruel back then why is that what people are thinking listening to you tell a story\nI'm sure they probably are because they've never heard it and we were compassionate to those who couldn't work um there was a saying that said I heard in America they had streets\nThen I heard the streets were paid with gold and then I found out I was going to be the one paved streets but we did not want people would be on welfare we did not want those people we want it only strong healthy people that's been totally left out of history books and\nI Can't tell you how much it frustrates me\nTo listen to these Democrats talk about how wonderful it or we will have a lot of everybody not true\nI have a nine year old grandson and I just shudder to think about kind of history he's going to be learning it so I don't get on giving him for Christmas one of your books oh wow you know very was because I think that\nWhere's he going to get it he's not going to learn it from his own history books all revised they give even a paragraph maybe Benjamin Franklin\nI'll Try a paragraph Abraham Lincoln John Silver at Boston University at Boston University way back in the night is\nIt a survey of the most popular high school history textbooks and found one paragraph in reference they read one paragraph there were pages devoted to Bill Clinton\nFor example in an American history the name that you want to know is Howard Zinn Howard's than as a textbook writer as a as a as a as a ... a socialist Marxist and he somehow has been a gold\nThe vast majority of textbooks purchase for use in American public schools have been written by this guy but you know you remind me of your a story about Ellis Island I Need to tell this story again\nBecause immigration has been a subject for as long as I've been hosting the program so over Thirty years in one white thank you very much A L L for the call I really I'm Glad that\nYou got through to remind us about that was it was it not only by the way we're checking people's health\nThey were determining whether or not people actually wanted to be Americans it was a restrictive process\nWe were on much newer and younger country then and we had an entirely different attitude about immigration and growth and it was required that immigrants assimilate and it was required that they'd be healthy we we're not going to open the borders to illness\nWe we're not going to expose the American people to things through accidents or or design but more importantly the immigrants who were allowed in had to demonstrate\nThat they wanted to be Americans they had to demonstrate that they love America\nIt wasn't enough to be fleeing war it wasn't enough to be fleeing discomfort it wasn't enough to be fleeing poverty you had to want to be an American\nThe young people in that in that room erupted into a game standing ovation\nAnd I said to myself well it's over the environmentalist wackos with this age group have one\nMore than any technical advanced what're achievement more than any cool aspect to many of these gives most the fact that there was a hundred percent recycled it just these kids have been told that climate change is destroying the habitat that there may not be\nA way for a life to be sustained when they hit sixty five you'd be amazed at the number of young people who have been brainwashed into propagandize to believe that and so the fact of Apple's introduced a little bitty computer year and it's made a one hundred percent recycled aluminum was the big news of the day\n[noise] holy smokes\nNow let's go to the audio sound like this this folks I talked about this earlier here's the evidence first up Jake Tapper CNN with Erin Burnett last night\nThe president of the United states making a controversial visit to Pittsburgh today after the deadliest attack on Jews in American history president was greeted\nBy a hundred protesters singing this land is your land protesters with signs saying the president's not welcome until he saw what they perceived to be his assault on immigration and refugee the protests are not surprising\nOf course not after you protest or not support what what does immigration refugees have to do with this event anyway why are these protesters there okay so here's Jake Tapper\nThe protests are not surprising it's totally understandable nobody wanted Trump here Trump is hated Trump is reviled everybody wishes Trump would not come in every did come they wish they would just\nLeave so now we go to the University of Pittsburgh Medical center\nPresident Trump first lady you Blanca Trump Jared Kushner walking through the halls to visit people wounded in the synagogue shutting down the road\n\n\nMap reach your hands around again\nThank you thank you for having chance\nYou will not see this on any network newscast you will not see that video on any news channel anywhere\nThank you thank you President Trump that you were a mock up thank you we love you thank you for coming thank you very much no thank you sir you're the best the best great job thank you Mr President we love you thank you can I shake your hand serve thanks so much thanks so much thank you so much thank you President

trick or treating later some work all day\nBut in truth nobody knows there's too many variables if somebody new there wouldn't be any reason to vote if somebody literally new now there are exceptions to this in Nineteen sixty four everybody knew\nBarry Goldwater was going to lose I mean that the evidence was just everywhere you had a Democratic president Lyndon Johnson having been sworn in after JFK been assassinated conservatism\nWas new as a formal political mess in a ... everybody knew it was just the conversation started just exactly like what Trump is doing with suggesting that we need to uh and birthright citizenship claiming the fourteenth amendment does not say that\nYou have everybody in the world out there disagreeing with him but the purpose of it is to start the conversation Trump is done that that's what's conservatism was as a form of movement back in Nineteen sixty four\nA and there are those examples where were you know that that somebody's going to lose either at a local race or a presidential race but in mid term elections I can I can show your countless in two thousand ten when the Republicans picked up sixty three seats nobody forecast that\nThe closest I remembered it anybody forecasting a massive Republican takeover was none other\nThan the prince of darkness in self Robert Novak back in Nineteen Ninety four predicted I think to within two seats the Republican takeover of a house in those elections I think we one fifty four seats are forty something out of he predicted was off by two\nBut nobody predicted the Republicans are gonna pick up sixty three seats in two thousand ten\nI mean the media didn't want to think anything was even possible because it's so much love and devotion respect for Obama and then when it happened you should've seen if you remember the bottom fell out the window and it just totally came out of their sales in two thousand two everybody thought\nEverybody to Democrats were going to walk away with the house of representatives 'cause everybody hated Bush Bush was not duly elected Bush stole the election and the Florida recount with the help of a twisted Supreme Court\nAnd Democrats did the Wellstone memorial and that was going to galvanize Democrats all over the country to show up and vote and it was no way and what happened Republicans\nGained ... seats\nThe left was done ... that drive by media couldn't believe it so they're examples even when people are damn certain what's gonna happen they end up being surprised the brightest minds the greatest go rose the most heralded analysts\nAnd it's all about presenting an image of making it look like you know what you're talking about more than anybody else does I have here a piece from um observes the real clear politics by one of the renowned\nPoll analysts and data analyst there is Sean ...\n\nAnd I got to read the whole thing it printed out the four pages bought the headline here on certain days loom as mitten terms and her final stretch nominate tell you what this long piece says I can do this long piece in three\nWords we know nothing\nOn certain days alone as mid terms that her final stretch\nThe twenty eighth timid germs are working their way toward a conclusion in a week we should find Leno who will control the house although at the outcomes close it could take weeks to finish counting ballots in California\nThe consensus is that the Democrats are favored to take the house of representatives analyst disagree on just how large the majority they're going to win is\nAnd how likely that majority is if you are split the real clear politics toss ups in half that's much polls it results in Democrats gaining about twenty five seats\nA narrow two hundred and twenty to two hundred and fifty majority\nI tend to think as Mr trend day that the toss ups will break disproportionally toward Democrats\nAnd see something more on the order of a two twenty five to two hundred ten Democrat majority but this is here splitting to a certain degree okay so here he says in the second paragraph it's over and it's a Democrat's two hundred and twenty five seats the Republicans with two hundred and ten\nNext paragraph at the same time\nThis isn't the only way to read that data the Democrat\nPickups could be larger but they could also be smaller here are some things that shouldn't bother\nAny sober minded elections analyst enough final week of the election why we just concluded here and as the Democrats are going up a two hundred and twenty five seats the Republicans two hundred and ten so why do we analyzed ... because the truth is we don't know\nThose are my words and I'm just trying to raise his words resume here will there be a late break\nAs we learned in two thousand sixteen and in a less dramatic fashion in two thousand fourteen a late breaking the racist can alter the landscape substantially this year there are a lot of undecided voters remaining look at the most recent house polling from the New York times Sienna in some races and get to the gym or Egypt numbers\nThis adds up to a situation where a slight break in the undecideds toward one party or the other could be the difference between a healthy Democratic majority in a slim Republican but wait he's are these are predicted to twenty five to ... I'm not harping on the street\nPrint day here is we don't know he's given you his best gas but now he's giving you every reason in the world is ... ... you can think of where it might not turn out that way\nGiven the closeness of many races and the president's improving overall job approval is also unclear how about your weight all of this in the current cycle\nWell then how did you get to two twenty five to ten if it's really unclear how to evaluate all this [laughter]\nBut that's just me into being smart alec\nOr in New York's twenty second congressional district Sienna college places the president's job approval at fifty three percent so Republican representative quality of Tammy is possibly in better shape than her polling numbers suggests\nBut what about the nineteenth representative John Faso is up by a point that the president's job approval is at a forty six forty nine split\nThat suggested very close race and there are likely a lot so Trump's on the ballot or he isn't\nIsn't gonna matter what Trump's approval number is in some of these house races or is it not\n[noise] anybody who thinks Trump's not on the ballot here leads to reexamine things\nAnd then the next part about how many votes are Democrats wasting one of the biggest news stories this cycle has been a massive influx of money\nAnd to Democrats campaigns this initially showed up and marquee races like Beto O'Rourke challenge of Ted Cruz but it has since filtered down into more marginal races like Indiana's nines or California's first or a\nOuter Mongolia seven and all of this is relevant because Democrats right now have a roughly seven and a half point lead in the generic ballot\nWhich asks which party would you prefer to have control of Congress and I'm normally this would be enough to flip the majority but if Democrats run up the score in districts that are unlikely to win suddenly that seven point margin translates into way closer than expected seat but then there's another consideration and that's how correlated army errors\nMeaning how 'bout liable aren't the most me [laughter] and then\nThe next paragraph are we're relying too much on one pollster oh that's a pretty straightforward concern and then the next one\nIs early voting telling us well the pet response is nothing but that's too simple early voting returns usually tell us something but unfortunately they\nCan only be deciphered in retrospect meaning we don't know in the early voting is still it's over\nWe're not counting votes so all we know is party turnout but we don't know how these people that voted nobody does the only way you can determine early voting is\nAfter the election is over but yet we're still going to talk about it [noise] so the final paragraph what else is lurking out there and this is probably the biggest concern and what else is lurking what yet to happen that hasn't happened that could swing a bunch of boats [noise]\nWhich renders every poll prior to this day largely irrelevant\nWhich is why I continue to rail against polls about congressional midterm races in November the year before or in August of the summer before because the stuff that's going to determine the white people vote hadn't even happens to want to go to the polls but here at the end of this four page story\n\nWhat else is working out very well that's probably the biggest concern we've we've gotten good polling on the\nCandidate coal competitive districts but take argument to and then realized that in some of these districts Republicans might be caught napping we've seen some examples of this such as the open seat in Florida Fifteen or the incumbent Rob all in Georgia seventh them we don't however\nNo how big a problem this is right now or even if it is a problem I suspect we'll have a surprise or two on election night but what if there are tens of prices regardless of whether that happens\nWe are well set up for such an eventuality bottom line I happen to live this idea what's going to happen but my job is to tell you how it all looks to me [noise]\nAnd this guy is one of the best and I do not anybody misunderstand what I'm doing here this guy is one of the best
