apologizing to Kevin all on behalf of everybody in America for what was done to him for what happened to him\nAnd the cabinet episode caught a size exactly what I think we're up against and it

my being able to explain this the most recent starting point\nWould be the most compelling I think it was the best way to get people's attention or whether it because most people's historical perspective begins with a day they were born\nI Am so ancient history is there not been taught it or they don't know it so the the closer to the president you can trace the beginnings of current problems the more effective persuasion will be it's always been my feeling on this my thoughts\nBut they don't ... folks we are not legitimate in their eyes\nOur ideas are not legitimate our existence is not legitimate and not even worthy discussion or acknowledge\n\nThat they don't even look at the United states the way we do\nThey don't accept the founding of the country the principles in our founding documents they accept none of that none of that is relevant ... all of that is part of the discrimination\nThat was founded as part of this country as far as they're concerned\nAnd it was all on display in a capital hearing everything that we are up against the absence a presumption of innocence cabinet was guilty because he's a conservative Kavanaugh was guilty not because they had on the evidence Kavanaugh was guilty because in their minds he's got no business being a judge\nAnd he's got no business being a judge because he's not one of them it's no more complicated than that how they get rid of him that's another story\nBut his image intimacy is born of a simple fact that he's not on their team that he's not one of them\nSo anything that can get rid of him and the reigning in their world is entirely not just permissible but it's required if you have to deny him the presumption of innocence then that's what we'll do if you bring forward a woman who can't prove what she says

[noise] I\nProve anything all I have to go on um experience guided by intelligence and intelligence guided by experience I instinct I'd just died like everybody believes this blue way if it doesn't matter where you go every story that drudge for example links links\nHis page is a story of the Democrats with a massive landslide re taking of the house of representatives and there are stories\nWhere Republicans supposedly think the same thing is going to happen\nCertainly you you've talked to swamp dwellers you I mean you do hear from a lot of Republicans who think their toast big march you do you think they're toast big margin toast in the house of representatives\nWell [noise] [noise] what I Know what what what what [noise] [noise]\nWell yeah I'd like to get an individual Paul's visual nine percent of the nine seed advantage even after the worst happens of all that that's getting into the into the ... I'm just talking about over all the national attitude\nUm and I look I'll be honest I'm always having to dial myself back um I I'm One of these people you probably are too I'm only ... people are thinking everybody agreed with me we would have the best country in the history of countries\nIf everybody looked at life the way I Do and looked at other people a way I Do it looked at issues of everybody looked in America the way I Do nobody would ever stop it\n\nAnd I'm sure you feel that way now and then but we have to temper that with the reality is is is a lot of loony tunes out they're incapable of seeing the country the way we do for a host of reasons heavier heard\nLadies and gentleman that the Clintons are going to start a massive stadium\nTour\nBill and Hillary won again in want to get in on all of this Trump action\n[noise] now I\nI'm I've been wondering how long it was going to be until somebody in the Democratic party cried\nThis Trump's rallies dating back to the two thousand sixteen campaign\n\nAnd do not doubt me on this either the Democrats and the media publicly\nAct and I'm concerned on interest in\nAnd would always say a variation of you can't judge voter interest on the basis or rallies you can't predict how people are going to vote simply because of the size of crowds at political rallies\nThese Trump rallies they're not telling us that it doesn't mean anything he's or just rabbit people upset with their lives and they think Trump is going to kick all the people out of the country they don't like it's nothing it's not anywhere near representative\nOf the population is is what they all said that every Trump rally privately\n\nDo not doubt me privately they were jealous if they could be and they were the thing\nBecause there's not a one of them on the Democratic side who could come anywhere close to ... that kind of excitement that kind of loyalty and knows sized crowds\nObama couldn't do it not in two thousand sixteen Hillary couldn't do it ever but certainly not in two thousand she couldn't she\nCouldn't she couldn't draw flies there her book signing ceremonies Hillary Clinton who couldn't draw a crowd anywhere good people knew she might not be able to stand up for a full twenty five minutes without some aid coming out the proper up by the albums\nBut seriously I guarantee you they were looking at those crowds they were looking at those Trump rallies and they would never say so publicly but they were scared to death by him they would never say so publicly they would never admit it publicly they would say just the opposite but\nThey're human beings in any kind any anytime anybody in politics has that kind of popularity and that kind of loyalty that equals jealousy envy and anger and all things that attached to jealousy and that'd be\nThey have the Trump to begin with and the fact that Trump was turning everything they believed in upside down the fact that Trump was being able to accomplish things they couldn't\nJust in terms of average Americans being interested in the campaign interested in the Kansas City and those rallies twenty thousand Fifteen twenty five thousand as many people lined up outside who couldn't get an wanted to get in\nTrouble with his airplane perfectly placed so that Trump in giant letters and the fuselage was behind him at every stop when he made his speech except for those events that took place inside\nActual arenas so I I've been wondering how\nLong it's going to be before somebody on the Democrats' side tries to get in on this action and I always thought you know who I thought it would be that would make the first Abbott trying it Joe Biden\nI really thought that Joe Biden would be the first guy that try to replicate this\nThen I thought maybe Michelle my bell Obama but then I thought no they've got too much to lose if it doesn't work\n\nMaybe Kamala Harris maybe some of these ... somebody's going to do this somebody's got to try if they've got to be\nAble to show the Democrats thinking they've got to show that there's as much excitement as much loyalty as much attention as Trump and draw up till now nobody on the Democrats' side has even given it\nA prayer until the Clintons\nThe daily wire has the story Washington Power couple bill and Hillary Clinton announced yesterday that their embarking on a nationwide stadium\nToured

[noise] just just today political story right about his\nPolitical race ratings than GOP house is crumbling\nHere is the sub the headline Mr ... there are now two hundred nine seats either family or leaning in the Democratic column only nine shy of the two hundred eight team needed to win control\nThis is what you were just telling me right and it you've got Republicans telling you that they think this is true\nSome I'm not asking for names but you've got some elected Republicans are people in their offices telling you they believe this\nOkay so political says the GOP house it's crumbling it's falling apart\nThere are two hundred nine seats\nFirmly order wing Democrat I guess this is according to polling data two hundred and Eighteen is a number of seats you need for\nThe majority in the house are flooded with thirty five total numbers there\nTo eight teams the majority salt\nTwo hundred nine seats familiar leading Democrats I mean this if the Democrats two hundred nine seats\nWith this this is a white\nBy the Republican Party would have to be a party of for this to happen a party of Adolf Hitler's\nFor this and yet they believe it now\nBut I don't have any insight information on this I don't know anybody with internal polling get I don't know I don't know beans and I don't I don't really pay attention to that I never have but the people in Washington live and die by their stuff I'm telling you\nIt is their blood and water and food polling data it's how they get through the day every day pulling anything\nAnd if the Democrats are publishing stories to each other that to nine seats are leaving their way and if there is no blue wave I don't think there's gonna be an ounce some sanity anywhere to be found on the Democrats' side of the Iowa or in the media\nTo hundred nine seats firmly or leaning\nIn the Democratic column let me ask you a question what could be causing this let's let's assume for a moment just as a as a hypothetical exercise let's assume this is true\nCan you tell me what it is\nAnything one thing a series of things that have American voters so so ticked off at Republicans that they cannot wait to go out and vote Democrat\nSo that the Democrats run the house what is it what have the Republicans done or not done that would warrant this kind of nationwide ... with the party\nNow the left will tell you the answer to that question is Trump that the people of this country despise Donald Trump\nAs a people in this country have been poised to send Trump packing ever since election night two thousand sixty they can't wait to get out there and showed their ... for Trump and the only way they can do it has to vote against Republicans\nAll right well as I say we're hypothetically protesting this is true what\nHas Trump done to generate that\nKind of disgust other than be alive and be president what has he done no no I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm being serious what you want it\nAll started we said he separated families at the border I'm Glad you reminded me of that\nIt's getting harder and harder to watch television shows what was I watching this this last week was premier week for all the new network prime time shows I think it was law and order in yeah law and order and you're asking will be or something and and\nUh the\nShow started out focusing on a bad guy who had little kids in his basement in a cage and the FDU\nCops are running around trying to prove this guy was reprimanded the first order and you\nKnow officer you know our\nIs separating the two\nIs that are born or an eye on\nThem and the cops we fought ever say oh wow we don't have a pervert here we have a hero this guy and I watch the so well that's it for the show\nThe level of idiocy and stupidity and ignorance that just permeates\nPlaces in this country where it ought not be there people ought to be more educated more informants smarter\nBut that's gone we have replaced informed people educated people learned people what am so load block cab idiots\nWere not separating and Trump never did separate families at the border that is actually Democratic Party policy it's related to families crossing the border illegally seeking\nDon Juan running around the Senate just begging everybody they got a nice way this guy has more allegations I literally\nI remember one of these allegations all kinds of senators came forward to defend him while telling him he needed to resign one of them was a [noise] Sam Nunn of Georgia I'll never forget is attempt saving the reputation of John Tower\nI knew John Powell\nI think John Tower actually was forced to resign and because of one of these things was only but I'm not kidding I mean this this guy was a ...\nBy reputation\n... go get a picture that guy put him on put him on Rush Limbaugh got caught on trying to find one here and show you on the digital camera I mean we're not we're not talking about George Clooney here\n[noise]\nBut anyway Sally Quinn says that John Powell\nOnce assaulted her but she didn't come forward and here's what she says Anderson Cooper says look in your memoir you talk about an experience for a sitting Senator John tower basically tried to sexually assault you in the back of a\nTax\nFolks John towel would never be in a taxi that would be such a demeaning kind of car to be in the Senate or you don't drive around and yellow cabs [noise] you have a car service a limo driver ... well anyway she search it happened in a cab that John Powell tried to sexually assault you in the\nBack of the tax that you didn't come forward them and you didn't come forward when the senator was nominated for ... ... that's what it was a nominated the guy for secretary of defense\nAnd that's when all this came out but Sally Quinn didn't didn't Anderson Cooper wants to know why she didn't say anything he dragnet\nRid of this nightclub and ordered brandy and wouldn't let go of me and finally I got away and ran out and gotten a cab and he came out and jumped in the cabin jumped on top of me\nAnd basically I tried to assault me and the poor cab driver was desperate 'cause I was screaming and pounding Adams senator a stop and I was living at Fort Myer Virginia where my father was station he was in general and the army at the time\nAnd the cab driver was going about Ninety miles an hour because he realized what was happening in the back of the carbon screech to a halt in front of our quarters and I think then tower got scared because he thought maybe the general would come out with a shotgun\nBut I went in the house that night I cried all night long I was absolutely traumatized I never told my parents are very\nUntil much later several years later because I was so ashamed and so guilty\nSo Sally Quinn the assaulted by John Tower um but but you know she doesn't want to hear yeah there's one more ... we've got Times Square here here's another reason why number forty three when I\nThink about it I thought I'm so glad I didn't do it because I could have met Anita Hill and Anita Hill's life has been completely ruined destroyed had always gonna be the person who is in that hearing having to talk about is disgusting thing Christians Ozzie Ford's name came out against her well she didn't want to be there\nWhat I think is that if I had that I made a hell and I've known better I wouldn't have done it if I've done Christine ... Ford she didn't expect it to go public but I Would have not done it\nBecause their lives have been ruined and posted buzzy for just got an alumni an award from UNC Chapel Hill for this and you're going to get movies like ...
