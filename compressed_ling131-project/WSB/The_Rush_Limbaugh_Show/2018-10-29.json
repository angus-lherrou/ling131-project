what are we to do when something like that happens what what I my natural instinct is to rise up\nIn defense of something clearly you're responsible and that to me and you may be able to come up with a better example than that to me is an example that explains all of these others because what it shows if that whenever there is any kind of violence any kind of\nUprising any kind of the first instinct is the drive by media has\nAnd not what I say drive by media may as well be someone can say a Democrat part of the first instinct they have is to try to find a way\nTo link who ever committed the bad deed to the Republican Party or\nThe so called conservative movement and of course now it's blamed Trump everything everything at all what ever it is blame Donald Trump\nBlame me blame you blame anybody that supported Donald Trump\nAnd frankly I'm worn out with this reaction I have had it I Am fed up with it's been this way for years there were showed up during the Obama administration there were mass murders and at the time that the drive by media ever try to link any of it to Obama\nAnd yet [noise] people have forgotten\nWasn't inflammatory just said that Republicans were going to be responsible for millions of deaths if Obamacare was not passed it along with anybody remembers that because I sure as hell do because I was set up on it then\nWe're trying to impose a government takeover of one of the great industries in America better than anywhere else in the world we're trying to take them to prevent a bunch of incompetence\nA bunch of government bureaucrats and left wing politicians from taking over the American health care system\nMeanwhile Obama is lying to everybody about it claiming that if they like their doctor keep their plan they didn't get get get to and if their premiums are going to be reduced by twenty five hundred dollars a year or lie after lie after lie not called out not reported\nAnd then the Republicans come along and try to oppose it on subsidies grounds and the Democrats in the media start running around talking about how the Republicans are going to be responsible for the deaths of millions of people you want to tell me that's inflammatory or not\nHow many years have average ordinary Americans had to listen to this like you and I have\nWhere every time something happens the Democrats politicize literally everything and that's why none of this stuff ever gets that it's why none of this stuff is ever going to get resolved until this politicization of everything stopped in other words you have some guy who's been mentally ill for ten Fifteen Years\n[laughter] excuse me then decides to take action and all of a sudden it's ... it's the fault of a political party or it's the fault of eight presidents and and so predictable because they hate the president will do and then they can to get rid of him they spent two years trying to get rid of him they fail to get rid of him they're fit to be tied over their failure they're ratcheting up this this anger\nAnd if it were getting so far away from the notion that whoever did it is the person that did it\nWe're getting to the point where in this country because we politicize everything nobody's responsible for what they do whatever anybody does it's because of the politics of the Republican Party or the conservative movement\nAs far as the drive by media is concerned it's not because somebody is mentally ill disturbed who knows what's been going on in their lives I mean he doesn't care about that except to the extent that can link the Trump\nWell I've I for one am am fed up with it I'm sick of this reaction to every freaking event\nEven though whether we can't even get away from it from the weather extreme weather happens it's our fault it's the problem of the Republicans or Trump\nBecause we don't sign on to this asinine manmade global warming theory so we end up being responsible for ... [noise]\nAnd then when we stand up and defend ourselves again then all of a sudden we're attacked and we're assaulted for being anti woman anti anti black anti minority what have you\nBecause they politicized literally everything [noise] and you know what\nIf I have gotten to the point I Can't tune it out\nIt is by your man to pay attention to it it is my man to come here and pay attention to

eighty five percent chance that you're going to take the house do you have to take these two seven fortunate events in and build them up into somehow they are Donald Trump's fault and this is why you should vote against Republicans in the midterms\nI can tell you right now but I don't know do not know it from a exact hands on knowledge under start my gut is that there are millions of Americans wants this stuff starts they turned out they're fed up of being blamed\nThey're fed up with the people they love and support being blamed they're fed up with their country being blamed and so they

control law cancer not putting someone with a gun that can stop this\nWell look I hate to be the one tells you a ... uh there's no amount of death there's no amount of shooting would ever get your mayor to change his mind about what he believes because you say it's really not about guns he thinks it is supportive is not really about guns it's about something much larger than that it's about being able to tell people what they can and can't have\nIt's about it's about telling people that they have freedom of speech except you can't say this you can't say that's\nKept but other than that

racial politics\nBut is it that religion is high but religion\nYeah because you can't separate the Jewish state from religion I don't think you can and that you know any any time you're Jewish and you're in a you know you're in a liberal you're in a conversation\nWith liberal Israel comes out now with a disclaimer I'm\nJewish but I totally disagree with everything Israel's doing that and yeah that comes up and it's it's really sad\nBut isn't that more disagreeing with the politics that's associated with with Israel is a book because if their entire religion that's big I mean the Jewish religion I mean you've got the reform an orthodox and and the other branches how many\nDifferent flavors [laughter] um\nYeah but\nI I I used I used to feel that way I feel like it but yeah with a push toward India than many theaters they're anti Christian Tito um I don't see\nThem as necessarily being seeing Islam but I you know but I Do the right guy\nAnd this ... that's exactly right and I assist wearing Mrs all headed this is all headed towards atheism anti God that's exactly what is a unifying the people on the left whatever they claim their religious views are\nThe trend is towards atheism and no God or at least agnostic ... because that removes any judgmental ism right it removes any limits on behavioral morality or anything else if there is no ultimate power\nThat can meet out approve or disapprove of one's X. men one is totally free correct\nAbsolutely\nWell I I just I'm so you have this of this event in Pittsburgh given everything else that you say that you are\nThere's all the liberalism creep into Judaism and a rising anti Semitism you're right it's it's anti Semitism is rising in Germany and nobody's talking about it it's rising throughout Europe and there aren't very many people talking about it so this event in Pittsburgh did it did it\nAdds to any of the uh discomfort or on the ease you're having about things in general\nI I I I don't feel like that there's a ... million people out there targeting\nI'd choose and the way that they would Monica she'd have to bring it on I think that that these are isolated is an incident in this country that causes the country it's so great that so many people I mean this guy is facing the death penalty he he went he certainly wouldn't be facing the death penalty anywhere else\nAnd I I mean I Know I don't feel unsafe\nAs a person is Jewish walking down the street because like I'm Jewish I and I and I obviously don't think I Trump has anything to do with it at that absolutely ridiculous and it's it's not going to make me not vote in the near term or anything like that\nI Am glad you said because I'll tell you there's a lot of people that think and they're predominant by thank you thank you so much a\nRe July precepts racial for Thousand Oaks California [noise] um [noise] I don't think these events are going to have anything to do with the midterms\n[noise] a lot of people do a lot of people think it's going to dampen a turnout what do you think I'm wrong or you\nYeah I don't think it's going to have a thing to do with them in terms like ... now after seeing sort of say a dare I say this year I put my hands together and look to the lord and do I say this\nCaesar sidewalk and his pipelines none of ... what do you think\nThe odds are that the drive by Senate Democrats are thinking\nWell I don't have to ask as we know we had people talking about how that whole thing last week was suppressing turnout remember and even Trump alluded\nTo the fact that that story was maybe going to dampen some people's enthusiasm remember that\nOK\nWell there were some people I'm sure not too unhappy about\nThat [noise] and then the second event happens\nOn Saturday in Pittsburgh and\nIt was the to the people that politicize everything\n\nAnd that's the people I'm Talking about and that would be the media and the American laughter people look politicized and of course you've got extremists out there in in the fringes everywhere who irrationally try to explain things away\nBut the people at politicize everything who look at both events through a political mountains\n\nHad to be thinking are right now this is going to this is going to really help us in the midterms this is going to dampen turns going to dampen enthusiasm for\nTrump I have I have an entirely different fits why I did the show opened today but I did I don't think it's going to have that impact on people in fact\nI think the media in their natural state drives more people to Trump each and every day and I think they've been doing it since the Sunday talk shows yesterday with this\nThe attempt to politicize this the attempt to blame Trump for this\nThey can't help themselves they have spent the past two and a half years trying to get rid of Donald Trump they have thrown everything they know\nInto the public domain hoping to influence people to abandon Trump and it hasn't happened to these two events come along and they have ah this is that this has to be what it is their thinking and they just can't help themselves they start blaming Trump for the synagogue shooting started asking the\nPresident what he's going to do about guns as you have a different view on it and so he somehow responsible\nAnd what it does it portrays it gives away the fact that as far as the American the left is concerned everything centers around Washington\nThat Washington is the solution for everything and how is washing the solution Washington is the solution because Washington is where\nThe enemies of the laughter going to be punished\nIs where the enemies of the left are going to be dealt with that's what role of government as far as the left is concerned government as an agent of power to enforce punitive punishing policies on the enemies of the American left that's its purpose so shooting anywhere it takes ... says\nWhat's the president's gonna do it by the president nothing to do with it in the first place\nThe president has nothing to do with gun control laws except as a supporter or opponent Congress writes the laws but the idea that Washington should be able to command anything at any time is what the left wants with the White House\nThat's how they want to use it that's what it's purposes\n\nThey've done everything they can to overturn the two thousand sixteen elections and a cookie

Trump at the center of all the political violence right now something they cannot be established something that cannot be proven but yet there are news reported as fact\nGleefully I might add\nSo now we have a a a tweet from Max Boot [noise] you don't\nKnow what happened to Max Boot Max Boot used to be a columnist a reporter for the wall Street Journal is the international\nPolitical expert at what have you and I used to think of the guy that was a conservative being a journal opinion writer and he would occasionally sent me his pieces in advance\nThinking I Would enjoy them but ever since Trump was elected he has gone off the reservation I'm going to the point that a lot of ... people ask me what what what happened to Max Boot [noise]\nAnd now he's on CNN is often easy as he can get on that just ripping Trump a new one primarily from the sample the Trump manners and his behavior and his uh come Portman just isn't president central and you know the usual complaint from the\nEstablishment Grasso he tweets out\nThere is partisanship on both sides of the political spectrum but know left wing outlets propagate extremism as successfully are widely as conservative meeting of do conservatives are being brainwashed and an echo chamber for rumor and conspiracy theory\n\nThis tweet is then replied to by John Harwood a former New York times Wall Street journal reporter now at CNBC who has never been anything other than and Wilbur ultra left his\nHeart would says Max Boot is one hundred percent correct most important extremism on the right has gotten back into the entire movement and the G O the White House Congress Fox Limbaugh Breitbart the pack\n[noise]\nI maintain to you as I said in my opening monologue in\nThe program today that we get up every day and we see people\nAnd institutions that we admire and respect under attack I mean every day the left is politicizing everything including mass murder wherever it happens they are\nPoliticizing the whether Republicans have been called murderers by the Democratic party and willing accomplices in the media Mr Bush simply because we don't believe in the man made climate change folks\n[noise] murderers Republicans have been called murderers for not supporting Obama's takeover of the American health care\nIndustry for the purposes of putting it under the auspices of government for the purposes of controlling the way people live\n[noise] ah\nPartisanship on both sides but know left wing outlets propagate extremism is successful lawyer why\nThe mainstream media is extremism if you ask me that's what they've become daily media reporting has become extremism it certainly isn't factual\nIt certainly has an investment in the outcome of events and somehow we conservatives in the media are far more successful in property\nDream isn't and and you in his audience are being brainwashed in an echo chamber by rumor and conspiracy theory\n[noise]\nWhich takes me to President Trump President Trump tweeted and I also mentioned in the first hour the Trump was elected to behave differently [noise] he was elected precisely because he is cut from a different cloth these people have never [laughter] look it's\nKinda understand a little one sense I mean the guy goes down the elevator and talks about these hordes of illegal immigrants containing a people were murderers rapists and you just don't talk about on that way I mean nobody's supposed to talk about him that way but Trump dead\nAnd so they all start laughing I think this guy can't be serious he is not gonna last this campaign two weeks\nAnd then the first poll came out and they saw Trump leading and they size is not going to last this craziness Trump kept\nSlowly but surely eliminating all of the other Republicans in the primary on all of them had this preferable\nA laid back a walk all over me attitude toward the left and Democrats that you want Trump kept eliminating them one by one by one with catchy nicknames and so forth\nAnd they fought to sift it can't happen these camps that there's never going to survive in the Access Hollywood video convey thought that was it was over and nobody can survive with Trump survived and then they started to two years silent coups\nAnd that is the real reason for all of the suspicion about those of you on the left I'm going to tell you something Mr boot there is nothing that\nI or anybody else I Know in conservative media couldn't do that even approach is what the Obama FBI department of justice and intelligence community did and he was doing\nIn corrupting\nThe
