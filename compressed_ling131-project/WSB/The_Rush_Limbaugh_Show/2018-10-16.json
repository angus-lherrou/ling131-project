trying to say that there is recorded evidence of the interrogation and murder because ... to show he was wearing an apple walk\nHis fiance was outside in the family says Dan\nShe had his iPhone in the family sedan that she had instructions to call a man I've got his name here I'm not going to bottom will give it up she had instructions to call somebody didn't\nCome back out he was going to get you know divorce officially recognized so we can marry that fiance that's waiting outside of the families and ... and she hadn't structures to identify mutual friend if he didn't emerge meaning he thought\nHe was lord and airy bought something could happen are reporting that he was ... was recording everything that happened folks it's not possible in the first place an apple watch is a slave to the phone\nAnd apple\nDoes and even if the official we had a new watch the series for which he didn't because it hasn't been out long enough\nBut even if you get if he if he bought it in the United states and had it it's still not capable of L T E operation in Turkey apple has not yet brought LT each service to the to the I watch the apple watch in Turkey which means\nThat there is no way his watch could have worked independently of his phone\nNow there is an app there are a number of apps\nOne of the best ones is called just press record and on your watch it's just a giant red button that you press it and it starts voice recording and it ends up saving the recording on your paired iPhone but the phone has to be within range\nAnd I'm I'm here to tell you with the fiance and the iPhone in the car outside of the concept was no way\nYou know its its maximum twenty yards Bluetooth that that connects watches the phones twenty yards twenty five right in front of the golf course when I lose the range of phones stop talking to the watch\nIt's maybe twenty or twenty five yards and most of which would be Seventy five feet on the tops on the outside sixty feet more like if there's no way his watch was recording anything and transmitting it anywhere so there there can't be a recording of what happened with besides that the Saudis with a thing to watch by taking it off\nA and they would have needed the fiance is iPhone to find out what was on it\nThe watch is still not an independent piece of tech even watches that can operate under guilty they still need to be fair to the phone there's not enough storage capacity on the watch distort the data of a recording it doesn't start yeah it can store I think up to a\nHundred songs maybe more now but for the most part it has to stream them it's not an independent device although there probably is no evidence on the guys watch\nOr even on the phone it\nWell the [noise] except for his heartbeat stopping not even that the phone will still have to be at some point put back in range and connected to the fun to watch what needs to be back in close proximity to the phone for his heart rate data to show up\nOn the phone it's simply it's simply not possible what they're saying\nThe way they're saying it's it's not possible to watch is not independently capable of doing what they're reporting it needs an iPhone and and to remain paired to the iPhone you can't be more than [noise] wish I knew this exactly I'm I'm I Know when I lose my connection when I'm On the golf course and it's\n[noise] [noise]\nThirty yards Ninety feet at the tops tops and this guy had walls to deal with inside the consulate or he couldn't have been that close to the phone which is in the car\nThe family sit down with the with the fee\nIt's now a [noise] I've got the audio here of James okay if the secret audio taken of Claire McCaskill and her campaign and Rob meals I this is\nThis is important because this new is just not being reported in Missouri which is Claire McCaskill state it also happens to be my home state now what we did hear we went and we did a Google Search\nFor new laws of the secret video from project Vera toxic Claire McCaskill and we wanted to see where this\nVery task news have been reported so we got Washington Times the Daily Caller Daley wire Russia Today a PJ Media Breitbart News in oak cure report back there is no way piece here or there is no New York times here\nThere is no St Louis Post Dispatch here there is no Saint Louis globe Democrat or even though they publish here in fifty years there's no Saint Louis penny saver here there's no Saint Louis TV station mansions I don't know about Kim election St Louis but we're covering that by me doing it now\nUm there's nothing Yahoo News nothing\nNot one drive by or mainstream media outlets shows up in a Google Search when you Google Claire McCaskill and project ferrets us every site running this would be\nA conservative side or a conservative bloc there's not one mention of St Louis papers or TV stations here\nAnd what it basically is as McCaskill recorded on secret video admitting that she cannot tell Missouri voters and the truth what she really thinks about things like gun control because she might not get elected\nWe can't\nOpenly say that says whatever age we got to soundbites here the first one is McCaskill herself and her staff talking to the on identified project Vera toss secret journalist and in this particular song by Senator McCaskill\nAre talking about in the in the project maritime secret journalists are talking about the second amendment\nThan if we we might think we can actually see them or getting to that and then it's on our all those members are a young\nMan I Am\nWere you able to hear that are you able to understand what she was being asked in her aunt okay All right let me let me read to you because I couldn't if it were I Would not be able to make sense of that\nOr even though I've got a direct audio feed that just sounded like noise to me but here's the transcript\nShe said if we have the kind of the year I think we might have any Democrats winning big we could actually be in a position we can get my son just guns stuff on the floor and we can get sixty and McConnell knows he just doesn't want to put it on the floor because then it goes to the house\nAnd then it's awkward 'cause all those house members are total NRA folks\nThe Vera times journalist so you wouldn't be on board with bump stock oh of course\nI voted for getting rid of ... what what about high capacity magazine I have voted for most of those they absolutely get rid of high capacity bags of what what about for an outright ban oh yeah and that right now oh yeah\nYou'll never hear Claire McCaskill campaign this way [noise] she'll say in fact\nThat she's very open to the idea of bump stocks yeah might have to get rid of everybody's on board but getting rid of bump stocks but start talking about limiting bags and\nBanning things are really can't say might\nLose votes in the Boot Hill but you know what she said about that she said if we can really sweep up in St Louis if we can clean up in Missouri I could I could lose some votes in the boot heel\nSo you people in the Boot Hill in Missouri and that's where my mom when my mom was born in Arkansas but she grew up in Kennett\nMissouri which is in the boot heel of Missouri and\nI remember going there frequently as a kid there was one of those little towns down there I knew people in the ... we own the Boot Hill of Missouri here on the e I'd be ... every radio station worth its salt carries for and I'm telling you Claire McCaskill senator Missouri in St Louis ... votes if we can clean up in St Louis\nNow St Louis is majority Democrat a heavily minority populated and shit basically saying if I can sleep up with the African American vote in St Louis I ever really clean up the big turnout there then I can stand to lose some of the votes of the Boot Hill\nSo\nYou in the Boot Hill a Missouri Claire McCaskill throwaways\nIf she can just really clean up in St Louis here is a campaign ad for McCaskill a explaining to\nThe project Vera ...
