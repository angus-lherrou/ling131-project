Brian camps mole\nOh I I don't think they know yet but I'm sure it probably will\nYes well uh it's annoying because on that very show last week we had the libertarian candidates had mats who's I that I always vote libertarian if that's an option and if not I'll write it and if I can\nAnd um and we also had Garland fabric who did all that work on cap and who just recently today or last week a few days ago\nReally suppressed release on how what Brian Kemp is doing with this exact matching and the registration which Stacey Abrams and her gang are decrying Garland said yes they're right he does not need to do that so we were not chilling for him or anybody else\nBut uh you certainly that is the kind of heat I bet you've gotten\nFor uh for what you brought on Stacey but that happens to be what's what you found this week\n[noise] so what so what did the ... ... you first notice this came out what the New York times is that where he sought first well I found it myself yes no no I Know but I mean that the New York times reported on this story last week after our\n... our show was on Saturday and then on Monday\nThe New York times came out and they claim the details of Abrams involvement in the Nineteen Ninety two flag burning begin to emerge on social media on the eve of the debate one hundred percent false that emerged from us two days earlier and the example\nWill we hadn't had a show in a while because we get preemptive during football yet so it's not it had nothing to do with the debate it was just the first opportunity since you've found it\nExactly yeah I actually found a few weeks ago yeah yeah they said that the image of Stacey Abrams standing up there with the flag while they're burning it uh started to pop up on social media they they cited the exact thing that I cited an hour show\nBut they just said it popped up on social media and then they also happen to leave out most of the important details we talked about during that show\nWell and they allowed if I recall correctly and and everybody on her team including her spine it in a in a in a way that made it look noble which you know for the record I have I\nI had a great color regular listener Brett you call me all the time is Iraq War veteran\nAnd he said look and play it real libertarian he said in places where are you ... you don't the government doesn't allow you to burn a flag I mean that's you're done like you need to be able to\nConduct peaceful protests and even say things and in my mind you should even be able to say things\nThat make people you know even that offend people and not be physically stop from doing that my problem is with her burning the flag and my problem is with changing the flag it's that that uh it seems that I think you are now ready to able came up with some real evidence smoking gun evidence about it\nThat she slowed down the effort to change the uh to change the flag doing this for I Would say cynical political ah\nAh purposes in her path to power at the age of Nineteen which she had said refer to numerous times as a\nGoing back to ah her her really elite involvement in Telluride program as high school students\nWhere she ... where she plotted out her path for decades going forward and she also refers to when she was Nineteen getting a powerful position in the mayor's office after right after she led protests and the Rodney King\nOn demonstrations which I don't know of hers but a lot of them did turn riot us and this and this activism it seemed part of her plan\nYeah and she's had a spreadsheet she said she was a freshman in college mapping out what she wants to do when she wants to do it and she's a very calculated person in her family are activists they have been since they were teenagers or later you know it\nTo describe it as activism on the one hand yes but on the other hand they all end up every one of them seems to have ended up in a position of institutional power very establishment and so the way I look at it as a radical activism is actually promoting this kind of world government global is\nA a um a transformation that isn't really about grassroots or the little guy or any of that and it it it's not\nIf the natural progress of the establishment to have more and more centralized power a at all levels all the way straight up to what ultimately would be a world government and and her

we've been coming out with on a\nStacey Abrams and and Brian Kemp before her so it's not about partisanship bite it is about trying to understand\nWhen people give you a lot of hope that this is different you know that's what Trump get that's what Obama did it's all about you know preserving political fate by bringing you somebody who makes you think even though I've seen it all before I even though\nI I Know the politicians are all along that even though they never end up things never end up getting better somehow someone else comes along and you're like oh this one is different well this one is different actually [laughter]\nShe's just because she's um\nShe\nShe's a big player and she's going to be a big player but it's important I think to understand where uh where she's coming from and where she's going so last week when my producer here ... came up with the story found the information that she\nHad a burning the flag in Nineteen Ninety to the Georgia State flag on the Capitol Steps\n... ... ... during a time when that flag which had a Confederate or the Confederate battle flag on it and and came into being during a reaction to desegregation\nWhy it's so it's totally vowed that I got changed it to get changed why hadn't she'd been bragging about why wasn't she talking about how she led the charge in ... and I think every I I Would say the majority of people in charge right now by far vast majority are\nAre are\nHappy with the change she even set in her debate answer on Monday that Brian Kemp proponent voted for the flag changed ten years later so\nYou got to ask why does she brag why did it take ten years and uh and basically I think you you have ... continued to dig into this story I take it from there\nThat's the question I Would have liked to see now after the debate we understand that you played a role in this why have you been talking about it because if it's true what you say that you played a role and getting the flag changed and this would be\nIs the most a shining example of what you've already accomplish for Georgia so why you never mentioned it on your website in any of your speeches and wide you overlook that fact when you're describing your Spelman experience in your book\nAnd nobody asked her that instead everybody just assume that she did something virtuous but the reality is that all those people who were trying to change the flag including governor Zell Miller\nThey did not want the flag burning because they believed it was going to cause divisiveness and they even told them this will make it harder for us to change the black if you continue doing this and and it's it right yeah ultimately Zell Miller he gave a reason as to why he\nSo give us some of your you're making this claim and ah I how how do you know like what where do you have quotes from these people what's the story how do you know\nAre you confident that it made it where ... why do you think Zell Miller was um did not want them to burn\nZell Miller before her protest in May of Nineteen Ninety two he proposed legislation he was he said that he was going to propose legislation that would return to flag back to the Nineteen oh five flags removing that Confederate emblem\nThen I I think it's called the nights you know to fly but it was totally neutral nice flag I looked I I actually you know look read the wiki injury on the history of Georgia State flag effect constitutes research but you got to see nice you know to flag there's nothing offensive about it\nThan him and several black legislators were working together to try and get a change and they said that burning the flag would make it harder for them to drop that battle emblem because it was going to create increase racial tensions and who's going to calls extremist to come out on both sides\nSo he ah I did see a couple of calls from him around that time did he address the I Can't remember did he address the students directly or what\nThat's why shank company carries hundreds

of the don't ask me we're wrapping up\nOn a Sunday afternoon so\nI guess I kind of go back to where we started the show last week that caused all this there are about safety ... history\nMy entire position is I Know compromise with evil in voting the lesser of two evils that's an expression that people use now more than ever about the Democrat\nOr Republican do wobbly and people will always vote the lesser of two evils and I think\nWhat basically and I have demonstrated over this entire year\nIncluding in the primaries here in this gubernatorial race is that if you really dig in\nIf you do your research if you do your homework if you hold people to the standards not impossible standards just regular ordinary standards of principle you can disagree on ideology you can even disagree strongly unimportant issues but if the person has integrity if the if they're coming from\nA position where you can trust them understand that it's that is a compromise that is not the lesser of two evils and and I think we have demonstrated that if you if you dig in you can you can tell the difference between people who are\nAre acting in good faith and people who aren't so what what's your if you agree with that basically what's your takeaway\nYeah there was a coalition of people who are making progress towards changing the flag on both sides Newt Gingrich on the right was on board people were working across the aisle to get this done and Abrams\nDidn't action where on the surface they were claiming to get the the the battle emblem removed from the flag but in reality her actions prevented the people who were trying to make it happen\nFrom doing it so the very close that she claimed to stay in four she actually prevent it from happening while in the process raising her own store and gaining power for herself\nRight and I mean that's something that that people on the left\nShould care about just like ... I when I hear stuff on the on the left right I'm a libertarian ... people in the right thing among the last people on one thing about the right but I care about integrity there plenty of fake libertarians out there I did not vote for Gary Johnson and William Weld uh because ...\n... if you stick to your music to integrity of the research if you evaluate people without looking at a deer in

one hundred percent of all the grapes that are going into their own wind which is very rare\nThat is correct and that's one of the requirements of da da da da\nDa da da da da da da da da da da ... plateau wine or winds that are created a in that area is you're you're experiencing\nA ... a dilemma because geography July the longest ... geology you know people refer to the taste of wind by a its mineral taste or it's or it's brightness or it's ... or it's a\nYou know hints of this and hints of that and um those winds that are being produced in a lot of ... will have that a similarity will have the similarities but on the other hand the wineries themselves are very different\nYou know I just went on a andme any wind killer of ... over the summer I stayed at a couple of bed and breakfast and um\nI I was surprised at how different the winds were from vineyard convenient mhm and I you would think that over at close a region friend several miles apart that they would have a very similar taste that they were very different and taste\nFirst of all each one of our the lot of good wineries has distinctive architecture and great mountain views and they have tasting rooms and they also can accommodate weddings or the\nExperience that you have a is also complimented with the fact that sometimes those wind are the ones that are producing are different and taste and um but mostly they're dry winds although there are some allies that are infused with a little bit of sweetness\nAnd there are some wonderful sparkling wines that are being created as well for example wolf mountainous one a lot of awards for some of their sparkling wines so the wineries themselves are are different\nThe winds themselves are different\nUh and the experience is unique\nFor everyone to read that you go to it ranges from California casual to Tuscany you you might feel like you've just across the pond and landed in Tuscany\nOr you've also got a rustic north Georgia feel to one of our wineries and you've got to a winery up in a in a lot of good plateau that actually has spectacular three hundred and sixty degree views of the mountains so\nA little bit of everything and so when people come here from Atlanta or from anywhere or you can sort of customize your experience\nOr what you're looking for and you can have a different experience every time you come\nAnd David you said that when the wineries um win awards or those winds going up against California wines when they when they said war or they just going to guess other till Delano got wind\nOh no they're going against the other domestic\nUh California as well as other other places are in clothing Internet some international ones so absolutely and they're winning these awards like for example a wolf as one of San Francisco San Francisco chronicle in Los Angeles international wine competitions brought down has done the same\nUh and then also a lot of our wineries are competing in Georgia wine competitions and doing exceptionally well as well so um yeah it's remarkable how we are emerging as a force in the wind industry\nOkay let's let's break these vineyards down let's start with some let's say let's start with um wolf mountain you just mentioned wolf mountain kind of cat and give us an overview about uh the vineyard and what a visitor can expect\nWell first of all spectacular views from on top of the mountain or were there at ten thousand feet of square feet of vineyards and a white production\nThey have the craftsman style cottage facility that's absolutely gorgeous are the ones that are there are European in style with a more installed in California they used French Hungarian American oak barrels for aging to bring up rich ... fruit without excessive open\nA they have the state vineyards their home to plant things of cabernet seven your own Mel back ... to not to Reagan National uh they blend those uh with to create a reserve estate red wines\nAnd they also have whites and roses and as a measure they also have sparkling ah there are also a they also have a great restaurants and it's open our weekends for brunch and it's just extraordinary and again those views are just exceptional from on top of the mom\nAnd I find that when you do these tastings and the price you pay for these tastings is very reasonable um on average what is it about\nSomewhere between eight to twelve dollars yeah tasting it's really very reasonable and glasses of wine or similarly a spur to cost\n... yeah and you get nice heavy pours I think for ... and those that sometimes does happen [laughter] nice heavy handed poor with that one okay let's let's go to front towns seller snakes\nAnother award winning producer they are they are an exceptional winemaker a they have twenty five different great variety is on forty four acres the some of the reds\nAre ... a lot of talking about wind because you can use a little bit of a fringe yes I Love the accent is wonderful to not to Reagan National Norton which is also known as Cynthia Anna Amarillo and their whites include a seven year old block and sharp and they and they have lots of proprietary blends\nOkay and how long does it generally take to go to ... it's it's pretty much a straight shot at ...\nStraight up four hundred about an hour maybe in our ten minutes a it's an easy drive out of Atlanta and it's a it's a really nice Dr\nGary ... and I'm

the man accused in the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting massacre Robert Bowers some survivors say training on how to respond to active shooters may have saved their lives homeland security secretary Kirstjen Nielsen on Fox News Sunday\nAnd I'm In some cases that's things that we need to be looking at a good ten five ten years away from retirement but you're right have an understanding of what you have at work and what's going to happen when you leave\nAlso understand what options that you have\nUm and what I've learned to is that at and depending upon the size of the company you work for they may not have a lot of education around that so it's really important to seek out somebody whether it's myself\nYour age are person cannot be your retirement plan and you know and a lot of people don't realize too that when they're working with somebody um they may have a great relationship with a banker that they've been working with for Twenty years done a great job getting them to a certain point in her life\nJimmy lady money watching their accounts um but that person might not be the one that's equipped to help you transfer into the next phase of your life because retirement is just not an area that they specialize in so you really need to sit with somebody who is going to work through what happens when my paycheck stops\nHow this is my income pick up what does that look like so entering into the honeymoon phase which is the first with let's just look at it as a two thousand days is important to look into it with somebody who\nCan come along the side you make sure that all your ducks are in a row how you're going to pay and carry on retirement then also look at you know are you going to take what you did for a living and turned it into now a job\nDo you have a hobby that you really like that you wanted to say when I retire I'm going to really focus on yeah just start finding things to do with your time if you worked as a as a big position in a corporate situation maybe you want to go into consulting but have an idea of what you're going to do\nBecause a lot of people say by the end of thirty days I can only play so much golf yeah thanks so much wine with my friends that I now I Need to start doing this right you absolutely need a purpose\nYes okay then that takes us into a stage to stage a force ages and that's the big decision say yes\nAnd no one's the honeymoon stage or early retirement it over and you really adjusted to being fully retired you're going to start to begin some I'm facing some pretty big decisions and a lot of people look at how do I need to be in this house any longer\nYou know I this was a great one all my kids were growing up or when we had a lot of things going on within the house but do I want to downsize\nAnd a lot of people decided they want to downsize they want to move closer to their children or grandchildren so this is really the big decision of before I put my feet into a second career or do something else where do I want to be and do I want to stay local or do I want to move away um and if I Do want a new home\nWhat am I knew what the current home do I now need introduction to a ... you know you may have been in this house for a long period of time and along with that comes a lot of stuff yeah that you kind of pack up and hoard and might be a good opportunity to have a really big yard sale\nOr which you can do on line that I found out um so that's a really a good thing they need they need to be figuring out and then also like you had said before really honing in on finding your purpose for the phase of your life um do you want to cages\nThroughout your life your purpose that you had your twenties it's not the purpose that you had in your forties or your fifties or sixties no\nAnd I'm I'm you and I are almost the same age and you know my husband and I are downsizing because we kids are out youngest is going to college\nYou know it's we're starting at that point in our life to to downsize and um but it it doesn't matter if you're in your fifties or sixties or seventies you're still going to face these big decisions on one of the biggest ones that I see is where we live\nOkay All right now stage three of ... of the force stages is navigating longevity phase yes this is one\nOf the areas that I see a lot of people not paying attention to as they're preparing for retirement that they should\nOkay I'm a lot of conversations that I have with a with clients they assume if they have children that their children are going to step in and take care of them should any health care issues arise um or if I'm planning on it [laughter] did you have that\nHe went through boys [laughter] 'cause I think they may have a different opinion on that [laughter] but you need to you know you need to realize that as we continue to\nTo get older people are living longer medical advances are are unbelievable they're finding cures almost every day for something that you know that's been people have been struggling with for a long time um but you know what happens if something happens to me or to my spouse\nUm we see a lot of people that uh you know enter into retirement and go off and everything's great and then somebody gets sick\nOr somebody passes away and they've not putting the necessary plans in place that they needed to um to take care of either each other ... um or um themselves so that's something that definitely you need to evaluate long before you get to retirement but now when you're into retirement and this particular stage of your life\nYou really have to figure out how are we going to how are we going to face the health care issues that we have\nAnd um how we pay for it okay and there are a lot of things people don't realize that are in the marketplace now that can um help offset all that costs have a plan in place that a lot of people don't want to get into long term care insurance because it's so cost prohibitive\nBut um there are other options out there for them and I would just definitely encourage them to explore them and that's something that we can certainly help them less and you don't want to outlive your money\nNo outside of medical expenses and the cost of that and retirement the number one fear that retirees have is running out of money\nAnd um that's something that you know we can sit down at this stage of your life if you're in your fifties or\nA you know early sixties we can literally sit with you and look at where all of your sources of income coming in and project if we stay the course we make some changes do I have enough ... and that's ... that is the largest fear that retiree have you don't want to run out of money before you're out of breath and he\nSays mind yes okay the final stage stage for the solo journey face\nYes and I know this isn't one that it's not one of my favorite now ... you know it really it really isn't but it is a reality and um for over a decade I've spent just working with women and then a lot of cases is the women who are facing the solo journey\nAnd um you know we continue to talk about you know taking care of who's going to take care of me um and then looking at some things about what do I do now I'm living alone how does that affect my life\nUm and then learning how to reinvent yourself and recreate yourself after you as a spouse right and that's it's really it's sad to talk about a lot of money is not easy to talk about period right but when you start talking about planning for what happens\nTo me when I'm now by myself the more that you have a plan for\nThe better it's going to be not just for you but I Know women are more concerned than men about leaving a mess for their children if anything happens\nSo the more you can do on the front end to take care of the stuff that you face and retirement the better off not just you are going to be but the future generations that come behind you are going to be because you've taken time to not leave them a mass um so\nAll in all look forward to retirement I Know it sounds awful to be ending on on the solo journey but\nHave a plan for it because you are going to go through these things and and make sure that you're working with someone um they can kind of walk through and transitioned her life with you\nIt can be the golden years of your life if you plan for it and plan well and we're

Melinda skill to lead to living\nBrought to you this hour by Marietta plastic surgery [noise]\nAnd welcome the Atlanta living on your host don't lend a scale than well this research in stem cells has really\nCome a long way in the last few years and I brought one of the industry leaders and the studio with me Dr Rick Dr rent and rosy act he is with that talent to help here here in the Atlanta area and\nDr embrace the ac let's let's start off clearing up a net um that that a lot of people have because I had at that cord blood is different than stem cell\nYeah that's correct you there are several different areas that we can get stem cells from and you can get stem cells so a form of stem cell from a cord blood\nBut I'm the and there's several different methods of getting a stem cells you can get it from your own body where you actually that's called ... themselves so you can get it from your own fat or your own bone marrow okay I'm that's an old technique that's been around for Twenty years but the problem with it is that\nUm you get very few cells maybe five or ten thousand cells using that method\nHas very painful to stick a big needle in your fat or to stick it in your bone um the other problem is that the cells that we get are very active as the older we get the the fewer stem cells we have\nBut I'm the or the other sources of stem cells that have been available for the last Twenty years or I'm On bill Koch courts themselves and we used to get them from blood but the problem with blood products as there's a chance of infection and the chance of disease transmission\nSo I'm an allergy reactions as well so we don't use that form anymore the FDA actually told the labs that we're using those types of stem cells that they needed to stop that method because of the risk of diseases um so the process we use and the one we've used for the last five years has actually using something called wardens jelly\nWow and warns jelly is from the umbilical cord matrix which is not part of the blood vessels in the umbilical cord but it it's a surrounds the blood vessels so there's no chance of disease transmission of chance of allergies and it's a pure form of getting what's called missing commerce themselves which are the best themselves or that we use in our offices\nAnd I was looking at your website and ah watching the testimonials of people who had um well football players west\nShelters injuries and turf toe and people who had back injuries and different things uh elements who have played them their whole lives\nAnd they've gotten relief and uh almost cure it through the help that stem cells now tell me how that's how that works [noise]\nYeah it's amazing what basically stem cells are are there there are bodies way to heal itself so when we're young when we're two or three years all we had millions of these stem cells and if you fell down a scrape journey or you hurt yourself within a day or two you'd be back to normal it's because of all these stem cells in our body but even by the time were teenagers we only have one chance that that number\nAnd older we get the fewer and fewer stem cells we have and so that explains kind of why we age and are aging process so by the time we're in our late twenties and thirties we start having bar body breaks down and start having arthritis we started getting problems like high blood pressure diabetes high cholesterol\nA whole list of chronic problems and basically our bodies not able to heal itself we don't have the stem cells are enough of them to heal our bodies\nUm but when we're able to but we're we're able to do is get these stem cells from these healthy umbilical cords from healthy moms and we we go ahead and injects the cells into you know whoever has the problem whether it's a pro athlete like one of the falcons or um you know anybody who's an older person that's having the Iraq War used\nYour facility is used by the falcons\nA we use yeah treats several athletes from a more than one NFL team and and different major leagues as well but um yeah we can we treat people all over the country really\nDoes the needle have to go and exactly where the pain is or do you just injected somewhere in the body and the stem cells nowhere to go\nBut yes to both answers like if someone hasn't an acute injury like say one of the athletes has an elbow or shoulder injury or an injury then will inject right in that area\nBut if somebody has got pain all over their body if their knees are both knees are hurting in their back in their elbow than we might just do an IV injection or or an intra muscular injections so\nReally depends on what kind of problems people have and when people come in for consultation wearable sit down and figure out what's best for them\nBecause you know you hear people who have arthritis and they're getting these very painful cortisone shots and and the actual joint are the end the muscle and that sounds very painful\nUm those can be in the problem with especially with steroid shots of steroids actually break down to shoot cortical steroid that with you know like we used to give them all the time to everybody but then people still get them all the time but the problem is is there actually bad for bodies to actually break down the tissue that we inject them into so", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "year":
