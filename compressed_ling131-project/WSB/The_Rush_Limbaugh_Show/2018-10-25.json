I refer to her affectionately as Natasha on top\nAnd Washington Free beacon a senior writer Liz Harrington they're talking about the Patrick\n... the package bombs these these uh mail order devices that have not exploded yet\nAnd bill hammer starts off I go into came back and tell me what do you what you've been watching what you've been observing over the past six hours what do you see\nI've observed a president who leadership attack he called for unity and you had a response from the liberal media today in ... president they hadn't blaming the president has a cue from the president\nLeadership yesterday called for the country comes together instead of attacking one another with partisan politics time stand behind the president shameful that the New York times today to publish an article and to put the fascination the president of the United states we're twenty four hours I mean 'cause I can deliver and house and for the New York times\nI Know I mentioned that through your toward the tail end of the hour they actually did they published a fiction piece by a writer synthesizing over a secret service agent\nHanding a Russian agent his gun to assassinate Donald Trump not the president not just the president not known engineering Donald Trump you've got a Russian the Asia trying to assassinate his gun doesn't go off and someone nearby Secret Service agent hands but Russian assassin his gun sincere use mine the times\nRuns this story and they excuse it by saying well we must publish stories that relate to react to live with the Mueller investigation of Trump print but what does that got to deal with Trump being assassinated anyway even if there was something to it which there is not\nAnd and then they're preaching to us why publishing that story they're preaching to everybody about civility\nAnd why you need to dial back what Donald Trump is saying and the Donald Trump needs to dial it back in Donald Trump needs to change and Donald Trump didn't\nMeanwhile they can call him and not sitting calling Hitler they can lie about the things he says and does all day long with no recourse that's what Mac and then he's talking about here now is Natasha on a top response\nI think that the president controlled himself at that because I thought it has rally that he was poking fun at the whole idea of all I'm not going to talk about the things I'm going to be presidential which is essentially saying to the audience you know what I'm thinking and on this morning that it was San ... which basically is they can say that but when it gets actually thought that was her fault for Iran short skirts have been completely\n... saying that Santa Ana was responsible for the fake news that they're spreading because no one's fault arranged arraigned that offending does\nI buy it in a couple of all let me just advantage of what he wanted to record that had a python showed up and not comfortable\nFor the python culpable for the rhetoric that we're seeing back and forth and then you had an anchor on that network endorsed to play in Central Park to pick the me assassinate the president\nSaying that the leader right now you heard Natasha on a top\nThere say you really you you want to be on record saying that when a pipe bomb showed up how about her analogy that Trump blaming CNN is akin to because they got up on it but she is\nLike blaming a I'm a ... a woman who sexually assaulted blaming her for the assault [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nI mean that's that's that's the logic that's the ... she used okay so so um the conversation continues here now you'll hear the senior writer for Washington Free beacon Liz Harrington or join the conversation at resumed here by by Natasha on atop\nThe kind of rhetoric at the ... than ... than a thousand and four years he recently commanded that Congress men about body slamming the reporter he has called the ... the enemy that people have to pay the legal for anyone in guiding fellow at about ...\nWhat about the language as an outlet and I\nFast time ten times as ... Harrison Ford iron\nAnd CNN had a choice at today he always thought the president come out saying is abhorrent ... stand for black man if I Want to see an end to tell complain that found the president can blame it on Sarah Sanders John Brennan echoing that\nMove at Fort Larry Flynt forward at fighting the low road President Trump the highlights what Clinton said last week they cannot have the ability\nRight we cannot have civility so what your hand here yet on a top actually trying to blame all all of this on Trump\nAnd of course using this I'm from the high road and I'm I'm from uh I'm from propriety and so just simply because she's on the on the left now before we go to the break\nWe're going to we're going to we're going to switch gears river just a bit to talk about the caravan 'cause I saw this coming up right after I saw the soundbite that you just heard and I switched over to see it and I caught the governor of Ohio there\nJohn Case thick and he is being\nInterviewed I don't know who the reporter was at the CNN another matter being interviewed about the caravan and America and how to deal with I just I just want you to hear this we have to buy your number one\nWe have a caravan coming north we don't want all those people coming across our border\nAnd there are ways to deal with it I Believe that if we would check those who are legitimately in need of asylum\nCould be vetted before they even get to the border but you know what we're born in America you know how lucky we are to be born in America and knocked me born in Guatemala where they would say to your daughter you know if you don't do what we want we will rape your daughter or we will kill your son if he's not a drug meal\nNow they're marching north and you know what it could easily have been all of us that we're in the caravan there were marching north trying to save our families and save our children\nAll right so what is the ruse here or the technique here is a moral equivalence\nThere but for the grace of God alive Phil Donahue your sitters all the time Phil Donahue and hosts the show and when the subject of illegal immigration would come up he wouldn't be start preaching about the accident of his birth\nNo I was born just a few miles inside the U.S border and it's it's look the difference it's made for me it if they started a stolen the guilt if he felt over how the accident of his birth resulted in him being an American how basically on there that was\nTo watch other people in the world as though being born into a country of prosperity and decency is something to feel guilty about\nAnd it\nMay be something to feel very grateful for I have no quarrel with that but it's how you deal with this\n\nThat matters we simply can't take and everybody in the world they answered the solution is to spread our area of dominant influence and to get rid of tyrannical regimes and dictatorships which treat their people like dirt\nAnd condemn that and do our best to spread our way of life around under the belief that it's good and decent but there are way too many people don't think we're the good guys and they think that the American way of life is an
