first\nWe haven't offered today have your portfolio review by professional and after the recent market volatility and that might be pretty helpful\nYeah so it's a it's an offer for a free portfolio review with Social Security analysis and we're doing is we're giving in his chance for this free review because we know that you need help\nRight help adjusting your plans we just plans to what do you need help investing were investing for clients all through the year you need help deciding when to claim Social Security need help figuring out what to do with the rest of your lives and get help head over to investing sense dot com take advantage of this free offer\nRight now we have Thomas calling from Alabama at eight eight eight eight three three eight six three seven that he's retired and that's a question about required minimum distribution so Thomas what is your question\nYes uh I wanted to know things about our I currently have a traditional a or a an a or a roll over and also have a ... right\nAnd my question was when you start checking or in the east which I Will be doing next year or I Know you have to total up about the already but is the raw a or a included in that balance\nThat you take 'em your are in the um\nYeah great question what a great question so when you calculate the R. N. D. amount what you're going to do is that you're going to add up all of your pre tax accounts\nYour traditional i._r._a. your role over IRA your four one K. if you're not working or are you still working right now are you actively contributing to an employer plan\nOr I'm not working part time only but I'm not contributing to an ...\nOkay so if you were working you would be able to exclude that current four one K.\nBut you're going to add up all your pre tax accounts traditional i._r._a. roll over four one K. you are not going to add the raw IRA value in your calculation\nUm and also what you basically have the pre tax you're going to exclude the Ross um and then this is actually when we're building um when we're building income plans for people we look at different and distinct\n... categories of investments the pre tax the raw or the brokerage account any savings and so as we're trying to figure out how to you know get people that paycheck that retirement pay check the the money will come from different places\nNow have you ever thought about so you've got this Ross and you've got the pre tax accounts have you ever gone through any sort of Ross conversion calculation have you ever considered anything along those lines\nWere not on a heck of a considered it out and done on okay about four years ago I'm I'm going to be doing another one because this is my last year so I'll be seven and a half next year I'm going to do a second raw conversion from a traditional our right\nThat the issue that kind of um the sidelines a lot of people is that so what what happens with these Ross conversions is you have these pre tax\nAmounts you effectively take a distribution\nI. E. earned income for whatever you want to move from the pre tax irate over to the Ross\nSo a lot of different factors um you know ... kind of old way on the viability of this move but your taxes are now what they're going to be leader your overall financial situation but the thing that trips up a lot of people is their ability or inability to pay taxes\nOn the distribution with outside of the IRA money\nSo as long as you have the ability to pay that tax burden with outside the IRA money and as long as you've gone through the calculations you should be fine\nOkay great great\nAwesome will Thomas thanks for calling the show and a really have a great week thank you very much\nNow it's time for this week's portfolio review and this is where anti died deeply into a portfolio that's been sent to us\nAnd this week Andy's review has his Social Security twist to it and that's perfect because we're trying to help Americans today with a limited free offer for a portfolio review that includes a Social Security analysis\nNow a reminder make sure you consult with an advisor before acting on anything that we discuss and you can find a local advisor by going to investing sense dot com\nSo now this week's review Larry says his portfolio and he writes if you plan to take Social Security and you have a sizable four one K. does the draw from the four one K. impact Social Security payments\nSuppose I make Fifteen thousand dollars part-time draw Social Security and pull sixty thousand dollars how will that sixty thousand dollars impact Social Security\nHey great question Larry let me tell you that Larry's got pretty cool story we went back and forth over\nOh the first thing that I asked Larry was when is all of this going to come together you've got\nHis reply to yeah he said I plan to retire and the next eight to Nineteen months I'm sixty one I'll be sixty two in January and I want to work part time next year I have about one point four million in a four O. one K. and three hundred thousand in cash\nI Know if I go over a certain kept while on Social Security I'm I'm not going to get the full benefit\nRight so the rule that Larry is referencing only applies when you reach full retirement age and that's\nWhen your earnings no longer reduce your benefits no matter how much you earn now\nIf you're younger than full retirement age and you make more than the annual earnings limit your earnings may actually reduce your benefits so it's based on this for retirement age right for Americans born between Nineteen forty three and Nineteen fifty for your full retirement age is sixty six\nAre beginning with you guys born in Nineteen fifty five two months or added for every ... year until the full retirement age reaches sixty seven for Americans born in Nineteen sixty year later so\nWhat are the Dutch and to the benefits in case you reached the earnings limit\nIf you're under full retirement age for the whole year Social Security ... a dollar from your benefits for every two dollars that you earn above the annual limit and for twenty Eighteen that limit is Seventeen thousand forty dollars\nNow you can imagine it gets a little bit more complex in the year you reach full retirement age Social Security did that's a dollar and benefits for every three dollars that you earn above the limit for twenty Eighteen that limit is forty five thousand three hundred and sixty dollars but\nThey only count earnings before the month that you reach\nFull retirement age I don't know yeah I Know my head spinning I was trying to keep track I was ... right it don't even know it does the first sentence I was okay and then try to keep track of limits an age is just it's unbelievable\nSince Nineteen eighty four of the forecast is this net surplus could end sometime around twenty twenty and that's when more baby boomers will start claiming benefits but please do not freak out that this is you know just a couple of years away\nAnd it's because the Social Security administration says that interest income alone from the trust fund should bridge the gap until twenty thirty for\nOne of the big reasons were running a limited time offer on investing cents dot com right now is because that some Americans are using a risky Social Security claiming strategy both for full retirement age and investing in the stock market\nRight and listen I Will never bust your chops for investing in the stock market because we invest in the market but not like this man what these guys are doing is they're for going these guaranteed increases because you know you just couldn't wait a little bit longer for your Social Security\nSo then you're basically faced with this double risk last potential for that guaranteed increase and you're investing on your own you've got the risk inherent in those investments we manage clients risk all week long knowing this happens\nIs so worrisome to me so when it comes to solving this problem how do you do that for your clients and how does this free portfolio review help\nBecause we've had this amazing nine you're bull market and you've got four one K. balances you got I re balances their way up and a lot of you see this and you think that you're a hundred percent ready for retirement that's great but you have to realize your goal now becomes to try to protect and to try to preserve what she got\nAnd that takes a completely different mindset it takes a different approach to what you used to do with your long term money that volatility alone should've exposed why their Social Security claiming strategy is just crazy\nBut at the more individual level it really depends on your unique situation every body is a little bit different\nSo we solve for those differences for this is you know specific issues by getting to know ya and by and by providing you with three very important items as a part of this portfolio review\nWe sit down with you it's an in person review of your current investments by our local financial engines team we build a a Social Security analysis to help you look for ways to optimize your lifetime benefits and we put everything together into this personalized long term financial plan to help you reach your goal\nEarlier when Kyle from financial engines told the story about how he helped his mom get an extra forty three thousand dollars from Social Security and that was just an awesome story so handy what are some ways that you help people get more\nLook if you can wait to claim until age Seventy you will increase your annual benefits by about eight percent of full retirement benefits per year\nAnd I'm looking at you I don't know about you ... you know this eight percent annual increase it's amazing right but and that's why today we're offering you this

appointments as we said January second I'm of next year so pretty soon\nBut anyway back to the weather absolutely October kind of kicks off what we think of is more of the\nWinter season when it comes to surgery and procedures and most of those things that go along with that or facial or related and some of the larger body type things whether it's a tummy tuck or arm lifts or something of that sort\nIs that because it's easier to hide which jurors sleeve\nYeah and we're not as active you know in the summertime people or the lakes are at the beach or on you know traveling vacations hiking and and just being so active in in the wintertime we're we're still active in Atlanta because we have reasonable weather but we're just less outdoors and the cover up clothing is as much easier to conceal it so you're right\nRight okay if you have a question about cause medical reconstructive surgery or a static surgery\nGive us a call for oh four eight seven to zero seven fifty that's for oh four eight seven to zero seven fifty maybe you're tired of ah what Neil bortz calls the bingo wings are um you're in the news for a tummy tuck you've had all the children you're going to have and\nYou have a little extra skin and that goes for the men too I I Know men who are opting to have those love handles taken out\nUm and maybe you're you've got the the turkey Ken going and I know Thanksgiving is coming up you don't want to be the one sitting at the table\nSo give us a call for oh four eighty seven to zero seven fifty that's for oh four eight seven to zero seven fifty and talked to the nail that something with your practice that's really when I'm In there I see so many men\nWill men are growing\nIn part of cosmetic surgery for sure they've they've been growing of the Twenty years and I've been in practice and it's becoming more and more so and you know men are wanting to look as young as good as they feel basically in we're feeling better were being more active\nAnd a lot of times they're female\nPartner spouse significant other are directing them and ah and like yesterday I did a a lady's\nFacial injections and she brought her significant other in with her ... and you know and so he got some as well and so you know they come in that way but men the common things for men are liposuction common things for men are you know male breast enlargement in reducing that\nA medically is called ... and it has different forms that can be from\nI mean if they have mandated yeah man ... you know but even young men sometimes get this um and it's it said it's a genetic factor sometimes and sometimes it's stimulated by other things that we may take medications or or other things and\nYou know reducing that makes men feel more comfortable in in their shirts makes them feel more secure about their shirts on and and things like that so those are all popular and then the next you know as we age that's just one thing that's hard for men to hide and I think men still look attractive in society with a few wrinkles and a little bit of gray hair but you\nKnow loose ten they don't look so good\nWell when you say no and it keeps going and you stopped maybe it's time to get something done and there's so many wonderful procedures out there if you want to talk about those\nSo you know in our practice we we really are excited 'cause we're board certified plastic surgeons and so we offer minimally invasive noninvasive and you know the typical plastic surgery things like necklace or face left so we really value that when someone comes in we can really look at them\nFrom the full gamut of offerings and make that fit their lifestyle the recovery time their budget you know whatever it is\nBut we also give them you know a good idea of what's going to really you know get them to their desired goal mhm\nAnd so we do and then and a minimally invasive procedure called neck tight and faced tight and it's not good for the person who needs\nA neck left right but it's good for the person who's a twin or who's in between and that was me and I had it done and I loved it yeah they still yes so it's yes for you it's been a year and a half a since we did it and your result is still gray and they think yeah and\nSo I I'm I'm really excited by about that 'cause it's kind of a typical thing right the celebrity or your family member or something like that you're like oh boy this is going to be tough but when they turn out the way that they're supposed to it's it's just awesome and I'm I'm really excited for you\nBut you know it's a great procedure and you know we advice people if it's not perfect for them will say look this can be done but this would be better and then you know we talk about it we show him dozens of of examples said that they can really see what it's going to be about\nOkay let's go to the phone lines and speak with dean and ... you're on WSBIU how are you today\nHey I'm doing great um I was just driving down the road and I heard Dr Patel speak\nUm he might

calls and we only have found the fleas one more and and\nThat's going to be I'm Jessica ... how are you today well I tell you what Jessica says I'll put you on hold\nAnd a Jessica's complaint was that her she's had ... injected in her lips and three times over the last year and they're on even and they can't get down that person who's doing the injections cannot get them even ever so what would you suggest\nYeah that that's a that's a common issue and the lips are so popular these days\nBut a lot of times people have a symmetry to their lips just to begin with yeah and so sometimes it is difficult to get them perfect\nUm but a lot of people enjoy the improvement so if I saw her it would depend on how long ago she had been treated and things like that sometimes will actually dissolve\nAll the filter that she has said that we can get a clean slate and start over and then you know re apply you have something you can inject to dissolve the cheaper for the Jupiter and products that's a higher on the gas a product like Jupiter arm wrestling and they can actually be dissolved and it just takes a day or so for that to bill\nAnd then we can start new and and know where we are so that that might be the best way to start for her\nThat sounds good okay do you have any special let's talk about saving\nYeah honey everybody's always inch in special month of October my staff did a crazy thing when it comes to fillers and we have a filler special for\nJust this month okay but if you buy two yet a third one absolutely free okay now what does that mean so this means that if somebody comes in and they want their lips or their nasal it'd be a full from their nose down or a little bit in their cheeks but they really need more than they can afford this gives them the opportunity to get what we call a full correction\nOut and do they get to really see what the change can be by buying two and get the third one free so that\nThat's an amazing special it's been crazy people are loving it\nAnd then secondly last time I was on a couple of months ago at talk that I was teaching some courses on injecting the back of hands and we've done a lot of that and it's going well and that's also you buy to get the third Winfrey um you know for that and so people are really enjoying that and that special is actually for the hands is running beyond October oh\nExcellent

years old out of North Carolina um but they do this year called the ponds and it is a cucumber jalapeno stays on\nAnd I know that sounds like a lot going on does but think about guacamole this was like sort of an an spice guacamole so smooth creamy a it's kind of earthy in labor and then you add a little bit of jalapeno not through jalapeno but through the beer and why are we did this one the other day it as a magical pairing it's a\nAnd the cucumber kind of right and said a little bit I I Would bet\nIt creates a sort of a flushing as to it that's really fun um and it's cool with the secrete cucumbers kind of cool off Sarah ah so you get the spice from the jalapeno you got the coolest from the cucumber and then all that green weren't as well oh yeah it's a home run\nOkay so I Love
