that would be done and it has been done and it is still the benefit of people that voted for the benefit of millions and millions of Americans in countless numbers of ways\nAnd he's making sure that as many people as possible are made aware of this it had to kill the Washington Post to write about this headline Kennedy agreed to join trade accord with us and make all sending new NAFTA deal to\nCongress\nSo where renegotiating NAFTA Canada Canada which said they want to know part of it they ask in the last moment hey don't forget us can we find that there's still hope said come on in a reporter just asked Trump what am I mean the end of terrorists comes in hell no I mean the end of tariffs\nIf the European Union continues to send unfair trade deal related products in the United states we're going to slap tariffs not\nRemember how to drive by and the Democrats than the slapping tariffs on Chinese goods was going to provoke the conflict couldn't possibly being good it might

November first according to try calm finance ministry yesterday\nAttract I was a pleasure to take steps to increase imports that means products from us\nThis year I've been to rising tension with some of its biggest trading partners such as the United states bottom line Trump said he was going to do X Y and Z and a B and C in trade and if we started they being the I think he's pretty much closing in on the\nHe has rebuilt the economy has created new jobs his economic policies have uh the elimination of onerous regulations which is an ongoing thing continues to show vast benefits\nFor Amri ordinary American who makes this country work and it's something he said could be done to only he could do and in fact it was the only one I thought it was necessary to do and it's not done here is the president today at the White House Rose Garden we have three ...\nI have long contended that NAFTA was perhaps the worst trade deal ever made\nSince NAFTA's adoption the United states racked up trade deficits totaling more than two million dollars and it's a much higher numbers than that\nWith Canada and Mexico and lost vast amounts of money that lost four point one million manufacturing jobs and one in four photo jobs was about twenty five percent of our on our jobs even more than that\nThroughout the campaign I promise to renegotiate NAFTA\nAnd today we have kept that promise\nFor the last half hour the pres maybe even longer\nThan I maybe forty five minutes or\nYou know an extended statement\nOnly recently started taking questions with what Trump is doing here which is something that I Belong advocate that he wasn't just denouncing the deal got done he was teaching why it was important including the drive by media who for the most part are clueless\nA note understand capitalism a think that it's a big bad meaning\nAnd Trump is taking the occasion of all this attention to actually explain how trade works and how the United states has been victimized over the course of a many many years because of American leadership believing well you know we're a super power in the world where the richest we can afford to take it in the short now and then it promotes good relations with our allies\nAnd Trump stood up and said there's no reason we should have our back pockets picket there's no reason that we should just let people have whatever they want from our treasury\nThere's no reason we should feel guilty about being powerful and wealthy and doesn't mean that because we are so much wealthier and powerful that those who are not having did was on what we produce those days are over that way of thinking is over\nAnd he went through the whole process and explaining how trained works why it is important in how the United states was getting the shaft\nBut more importantly why it matters to ordinary everyday people and their jobs and their careers\nIncluding farmers and a number of other\nPeople about whom Washington thinks not very off and thanks very little it's been a masterful performance there is no question that Trump not only knows what he's talking about he is the architect of what he's talking about and he can run the rings around people in this in discussing the process\nAnd in discussing the substance and the details of this new agreement just it puts anybody else it's ever tried this to shame everybody to have the chance to listen to this is going to understand exactly why it was important what happened why it happened and why we benefit and why that is good\nAnd you know teaching as well as announcing is fundamental I Believe that's why the Republican Congress Nineteen Ninety four actually\nSquandered its majority after a while it's because they stopped teaching what they were doing and why as they did it\nMade the mistake of believing that the Republican victory in Nineteen Ninety four men somehow that the majority of the country an overnight turned conservative and so when they began to announce this cut that cut this reform that requires a lot of people to know what they're talking but I got scared to death\nAt lesson hasn't been learned about none other than the than all of this Trump here's the next bite Trump saying it is a privilege to trade with us [noise] [noise] it's kind of thinking we haven't seen we've seen thinking of but both parties who who believe that it's up to us\nOr\nTo earn the\nRespect of others it's up to us just show them that we don't intend to any harm it's up to us and Trump's turning us a hundred and eighty degrees around so it's a privilege to trade with us we're the world

there she is automatically said to be credible every leftist\nSupposedly reviewing her performance I found her credible\nBased on what she was such pain she was so so still shaken by what happened all those\nYears ago you could say yeah because she really knew how to make it look like that I don't think for me I don't think any of this has been genuine I think it's all orchestrated I think a lot of its focus group I think it's scripted\n\nI just I'm because none of this past is any kind of a smell test anyway back to mark pencil very quickly [noise] Americans believe her and both believe Kavanaugh if the FBI fines\nJust sixty percent believe Kevin all should be confirmed according to a weekend harbored Harris Poll of a thousand three hundred and thirty registered voters\nSixty six\nPercent of Americans support the decision to have the FBI investigate that includes eighty percent Democrats sixty nine percent independence with only forty five percent\nRepublicans who are the smart ones\nHuge numbers in the weekend poll reported seeing parts of it or reading about it forty percent part she alone was credible\nTwenty three percent fought\nKevin all was twenty seven percent said both believe all if you combine all that the poll findings indicate sixty seven percent found her credible and fifty percent found him to be\n\nBut the credibility of their testimony doesn't appear to be the decisive factor instead the question comes down to collaboration is the standard for tipping public opinion on whether Kavanaugh should've sent the high court in terms of the overall needle after the testimony was heard\nThirty seven percent taken from a nomination forty four percent say rejected Eighteen percent remain undecided with Democrats going one way Republicans\nThe other but but but but but the hang on don't get depressed\nOnce the voters are told that the named witnesses deny any knowledge of the allegation that ships from forty four percent of fifty seven percent in favor confirmation meaning\nMeaning the people in this poll do not know did not know many of them did not know that the people she places in the room had denied being there\nAnd when the pollsters told them that in fact the numbers of people who thought he should be confirmed jumping forty four fifty seven percent and then up to sixty percent\nOf hypothetical question if the FBI after a week agrees there is no cooperation for her story and they've already done that but now we've got combing entering the picture now we've got a call me urging the FBI to keep digging\nThe same FBI that's been running a silent coups FBI leaders trying to get rid of Trump\n\nI Want to grab a phone call because this guy has a great point and I want to add something to it this is a jet Jason Muskegon, Michigan Jason thank you so much for waiting I appreciate how are you doing\nSaying no problem and thanks for letting me be part of the excellent\nWell I appreciate that you are you are here as part of the excellence by association\n[laughter] yeah I was thinking um that uh there's no better way to um motivate a group by attacking them and by attacking Kevin either basically essentially attacking the entire Republican base we\nShowed up and sixteen and voted Trump and I'm\nOf that reason was for the Supreme Court nomination and here we are Democrats are going to make the midterms about a Supreme Court vacancy and they think that they can last year twenty twenty so they're not really pressing issue as hard as what Republicans could\nAnd knowing that if we want to get our guy in there you know we're gonna have to show up in midterms are going to they're\nGoing to have an adverse effect if they keep the ...\nI've heard people say this I uh uh he he he Jason here thinks that all of\nThis is gonna backfire on the Democrats and motivate Republicans to show up and vote not just now two thousand Eighteen but again\nFor Trump in twenty twenty or\nLet's go to the audio soundbites on this Jason thank you much we're going to start here this is a\nBoxing friends weekend on Saturday morning Rachel Campos Duffy was one of the hosts is talking to CBS em political corresponded David Brody about all this\nAnd she says well we know the Democrats already been really energized about the midterms I don't know how much more energized naked get\nBut I'm sensing that Republicans have become very energized this week this hearing has really fired and the Republicans\nUp from my reporting and from that deplorable evangelical base I can tell you they say the Democrats dirty tricks have riled them up like never before and I know Rush Limbaugh has talked about how if Kavanaugh is not confirmed it is going to be real tough for the Republicans actually if Kavanaugh is not confirmed\nThat would even rile up that deplorable evangelical base in the ... I Believe even more at least the people that I'm hearing from and so what I think that that's a big part of what's going on here now look you\nCan't blame David Broder you for being fifty percent of informed because\nI I pulled back\nThat original production after and then gone viral all over the drive\nBy media that's why it's still prominent in people's minds and my retraction of that production has barely received a whimper because it doesn't serve the drive by it's any good when the drive by here me predicting Republican do\nThey can't help themselves they got to put an all over the world in the media Rush Limbaugh says Republicans are going to lose ... capital not confirmed that production was based at a specific point in time on if the Republicans caved\nIf Republicans didn't fight for Kavanaugh if the Republicans just went bird out I predicted that what happened but once this began to unfold\nI retracted that production and said it could end up being the opposite here but of course that prediction didn't go viral and I want\nTo Jason in Muskegon I Want to thank you for bringing it up so that I could make the case here is one more a bite on this is the CSPAN Washington Journal Saturday morning Jess Holland is talking to a correspondent at the Weekly Standard\nAnd Andrew anger about me\nThere's been several conservative including Rush Limbaugh who warned that Republicans could lose their majority if they don't get half a mile from for him to the Supreme Court is that something that Republicans in Congress are really thinking about mid term consequences\nArguments like the one that Limbaugh makes our little convenience on whether or not having I'll get through I think this whole situation is really fired up Republican voters\nSo once again somebody else you can't blame 'em folks don't get mad at him because my original production was everywhere I literally all over the world it was on Saudi TV was on the BBC it was on Russian television I think even a North Korea is\nThe little pot belly dictator mentioned it in his Saturday Night and message to the people it was everywhere with Rush Limbaugh says Republicans are gonna take it into shorts everybody\nIn the media covers it [noise] and I again I made that production at a at a time where it looked like they were getting ready to bail on the entire nomination and when

yet on the tail end of the me too movement after Clarence Thomas Anita Hill and so forth Christie before it goes and testifies in ... and I'm hearing from so many women who are saying well no my point is that I think anybody can say that but we don't know who's calling these people we don't even know if the people calling him or not\nDemocratic activist to begin with just to create the phone traffic\nMike intention to you is that the me too movement alone\nHas no doubt inspired a lot of women\nTo courageously step up and accused guys that have mistreated them it's not a new phenomenon it's not something for which she deserves all kinds of credit because this is it the tail end of this new awareness insensitivity\nAnd yet it's being spoken of Christine Blasey Ford's testimony in her

movement not give them encourage just think we're being played here folks um [noise] and of course it gives flights cover for what he has done\nTo make himself out to be a hero yeah we need more information we need more now what's wrong with more information\n[noise] what's wrong with more information is not the question why do we need to give the Democrats more time to make up a bunch of other information ought to be the suspicion here okay to the Trump soundbites these are from the oval office was during a announcement\nFor a new trade deal eliminating NAFTA getting rid of a brand new trade deal the drive vice were under orders not to ask questions about capital which meant they ask questions about capital and Trump\nAfter making sure enough time was spent on NAFTA started entertaining the are the questions and what we had one through four of them here\nAnd\nHere is a Trump ... this is this is not actually in response to a question he's just riffing here during the ceremony talking about the mid term election fake news Kevin all things\nWe have Senate races that weren't even in play six months ago as you know there are a lot of repression pose pose that aren't very accurate we had areas and we had congressional seats to\nWhere I Know it's going to be a positive outcome but you look at what's going on and it doesn't seem to be broadcast that way but I certainly have that with my election [noise]\nThey were telling me I was you know in trouble in certain states that end up winning like in a landslide and I knew I was going to win them in a landslide but they wouldn't reported that way you know why fake news\nNow during the Q and a a Cecilia vague go\nABC News the White House correspondent said in a tweet this weekend you said it's incorrect to say that you're limiting the scope of the FBI investigation into Kevin what your own statement on friday made it very clear you said this investigation must be limited in scope so which is a\nThis is our seventh investigation\nOf a man who has really you know you look at his life until this happened what I'd change he's gone through what his family's gone through the trauma\nFor a man that's never had any accusation any he's not a bad statement about him he's led I think he was number one in this class it yeah he was number one in his law school at Yale and then what he's gone through over the last three weeks his incredible so\nI Want the FBI this is now their seventh investigation so it's not like you know just starting I Want them to do a very comprehensive investigation\nLet me explain that answer let me ... let me these soundbites have got to be yeah number thirty\nComing okay [noise] ...\nThis whole FBI investigation started everybody knows we we heard flake\nDemand a week for his vote one week\nSo that's how the committee vote in Lebanon the pen and paper Kavanaugh with the provides though that flake was not going to vote well I'm a floor vote for final confirmation silly FBI had spent at least a lot of weight walking into this\nSo that NBC one's a story out of nowhere fake news claiming that the White House intends to limit the scope of the FBI was a set up it was a it was a trap they\nLay in a trap NBC News which is complicit with the Democratic party in most things later trap accusing Trump and the White House of trying to limit the FBI skull because you see there are things to find the Trump wants to cover it up Donald Trump has had so much control over the FBI the last three years\nSame FBI that's been doing his best to get Donald Trump thrown out off somehow Donald Trump has been able to walk in there and tell those guys to limit the scope of their investigation\nSo Trump or ... I'm not limiting the scope of anything I've told the FBI the look at whatever they need to look at oh\nOK thank you Mr self it needs to go two weeks ago two weeks ago so the White House is not claim there aren't any limit to see how this works\nIt was a trap it was a set up and Trump tweeted out he's not limiting the scope NBC is why course they're lying it was a set up\n[noise]\nAnd so now it's out there but we may not be enough now Fox News is reporting along with Fox Business news at the FBI is saying they might have this wrapped up tomorrow\nBut then the question becomes what to do with that if the FBI just finished talking to everybody I talked to\n\nThat one of the Republicans do with that so they hold on to it till friday and art art art or do they move\nOn or off just tells you if this ends tomorrow if this is all accurate\nAnd the Democrats here but the Democrats are going to be fit to be tied to the thing didn't go on friday and they're going to demand they're going to start saying that this thing is rigged and they knew what was going to be reading and they're going to demand even more time\nTo fix the fact that it was rigged they're going to do that anyway they're not going to let this thing and on friday if we let them have\nTheir way this investigation isn't going to end on friday it won't be long enough besides Trump said\nHe's not going to limit on the FBI so why are they stopping now it isn't possible they could have found everything there is to find on those labels to which the response as well they found nothing you know hundred thousand or more Hillary emails and a couple of days\n\nUh let's see let's let's skip forward here to um [noise]\nAudio soundbite number thirty reporter about judge Kavanaugh there are concerns\nThat might have lied or mischaracterized as drinking while he was testifying if they find that capital lied about his drinking or if he lied about other things do you think that that bars him from being your nominee to the Supreme Court\nI was surprised at how vocally was about the fact that he likes beer\nAnd he's had a little bit of difficulty I mean he talked about things that happened when he drank and this is not a man that said that alcohol was apps is that he was perfect with respect to alcohol look at some of these people asking the question is okay look at Blumenthal he lied about Vietnam he didn't just say hey I went to Vietnam no no\nAnd by the mayor bottom so now it's like a pay raise for the city's police officers WSBIU times to thirty one\nIf you live here in Georgia and you're concerned that you might have sleep apnea don't risk your health and lifestyle any longer Dr Jeff Rogers sort of sleep better Georgia tell us a little bit about the oral device obviously it's not a machine so that makes it very different you're not plugging it into the wall\nRight we make a device that goes in the mail gently pull the jaw forward and when the job comes forward pulls the tongue forward with
