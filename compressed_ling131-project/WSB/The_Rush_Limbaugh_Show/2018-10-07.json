gone through the whole due process you've gone through the gauntlet you've gotten confirmation from the legislative body of the U.S Senate and it has gone on\nTo be sworn in and I believe once you're sworn in\nThe only way you can technically be impeached is via your conduct on the bench itself\nYou know you're found to have been getting bribes for certain rulings are you sir you've broken the law you've done something to stay in the court in the process of being on the bench\nNot something you may have done a hundred years ago or fifty years ago or Thirty years ago you have to have done something on the bench to warrant that so\nI'm pretty sure that that's that is the case I just wanted to get a confirmation on that and we will try to get that as as we go along\nBut it's a talking point it's a talking point being used by Democrats who have not been able to get their way since Donald Trump has taken office and make no mistake when we didn't do this with with Gorsuch no you didn't because you are okay with the fact that Gorsuch\nWhen nominated by President Trump was replacing\nScalia a conservative constitutional is replacing a conservative constitutional is\nDon't play the game\nDon't try to pretend that you're on this whole me to bandwagon and that's why he's not worthy you realize you had Justice Kennedy retiring and he is a moderate and tends to vote on the on the progressive side of the court as often as on the conservative he's a swing vote\nYou wanted another swing vote in there you didn't want another constitutional conservative you didn't want someone who actually believes in the letter of the constitution someone who's going to look at\nThe law and decide if the law that is being passed or challenge to the court ruling that is before them does it hold up to the constitution as written\nNot as fans if we imagined or as pretended to be from some other perspective you can't do that\nAnd judge Kavanaugh does not believe any living breathing document he believes that the constitution is set he believes in precedents he believes in existing law he believes in the rule he believes in order\nHe served folks for twelve years now and the second highest court of the land the second the the the DC circuit court of appeals right underneath the Supreme Court or the United states\nHe served there for twelve years every step\nOf his process through government service through the various offices he served to the bench to the DC circuit court of appeals every step of the way has been through\nFBI background checks through advise and consent through Senate confirmation he's been there every step of the way and the last twelve years not a single complain about his temperament not a single complain about how he treats people not a single allegation of any kind of impropriety\nIn the office\nBut apparently out of nowhere we are supposed to just run with willy nilly claims\nA circus perpetrated by the left and if you don't think it wasn't a circus there's something actually wrong with how you look at the actual facts and the case\nAnd I think we've got now bill crane on the line with us the ws be political analyst bill welcome ...\nHey I don't know if you had a chance to get the email us interest I don't want to put you too much on the spot but we're hearing a lot of Democrats especially some of the leaders saying once we get back in power once the midterms come around and they're they're they're motivating their base as soon as we are back in power we're going to ... we plan to bring impeachment proceedings against Brett Kavanaugh\nTen do they have a leg to stand I can they do that once he's already been confirmed in sworn\nEthic and bring them teach them if they're saying the house has oversight of the judiciary and the same way the Senate has oversight\nOf the of the ah the confirmation process and and the impeachment proceedings against us like they would in the house against the United states but eventually it would end up back in the Senate or they still have to get that two thirds vote for impeachment proceedings if I were the Democrats based on the way things have just gone and the polls have shifted\nAnd several key Senate races loaded I play in that car right now head of the terms they were looking pretty good for\nTaking control of the house but they're still several does have a competitive seats out there\nParticularly in urban suburban districts and given the way the Republican base got energized and vocal during his confirmation hearing 'em they ended up stoking the fire sufficient to turn out Republicans are Trump voters delivered a lot of states that they were going to pick up\nSo let me ask this in light of that because I'm I'm I'm I've read elsewhere that said well once you're on the bench you really have to miss ... have some sort of misconduct in the in the in the office of being a justice or you have to have some kind of you've done something you've been caught bribing being bribed or something\nOr there is there room now for that because I've heard this was well let's just go after Clarence Thomas and let's bring the whole Anita thing they'll need to heal thing back up so that is a possibility is what you're saying\nUnderstanding and most of this focuses on perjury that the house Democrats are certainly House Democrats Johnson joined us work in a rational district has already spoken to this they raise the charges of perjury\nThat judge Kavanaugh was dishonest or less than a candid about it all and frankly habits and high school and college and it they have other to testify to that effect that would indicate that anything like that too much to drink was not a I\nWould advise against taking that tack and attempt to disqualify out of the court justice but there have in the past then\nSupreme Court justices in the United states who were brought up from each other and it\nAll right well we've got that under way we've got that settled let's

me to listen to the I think the reason I couldn't listen to it is because I felt like I was listening to a kitten you know she was like this little kitten and\nI and and then when you were wise but she's been accomplished woman uh she's probably older than I Am that she I mean it was just in Congress to me and and like my mother always told her and I couldn't watch the state of the union address says I literally since I was little it would have to walk out of the room\nShe said you just can't stand hearing people lie so I don't I'm not I did not accept this personally so I'm not I'm not saying that but some of the things that you brought up to me made me I agree with you that this was an act but\nUh but I Know you've never heard I actually concluded that Kavanaugh was getting a little bit of his own medicine yeah in that now did you hear anybody talk about what I told you that I uncovered about this guy no [noise]\nThere and as a matter of fact you thought the opposite of what I thought because you had read in New York Times whitewash piece let me tell you let me tell you a little bit of of what it up with a fake news you or did the New York times was playing the role of snow skew the bunk a\nTotally valid stories so this is it\nA break Kavanaugh was an investigator under Ken Starr against Clinton and the whitewater investigation which then expanded to include Vince Foster\nAnd ultimately Monica Lewinsky never I think everybody knows that ah but what people do not realize what the New York times article said was that cabinet so when people call Kavanaugh conspiracy theorists they're referring to this me put out by the New York times and others\nThat he pursued these crazy conspiracy theories that Vince Foster was murdered\nAnd not a did not commit suicide however it's not like that at all from what I can tell\nI chew things happen that for Kavanaugh and star to a investigate Vince Foster home for the purpose the intention I Believe ... especially since the prison to putting to put\nRumors of Vince fosters murder to rest from the right so these guys were supposed to be opponents of Bill Clinton so if they came up with the idea that if they concluded Vince Foster was a suicide than\nIt would be put to rest and that is what happened and the two things that forced him to open reopen Vince Foster as opposed to New York times saying he was not John Hughes taxpayers' money to track down a conspiracy theories are two things his predecessor or somebody in the ...\nTo get a rural in the office of the special counsel who was pushed out he said\nMa gal Rodriguez I think the name was yet\nRoad which I just printed out I saw for the first time like five minutes before the show started the letter that the this I'm Free for whatever it's called by Rodriguez and the first line is president for this meeting remark to eat Brett Kavanaugh Jeff Green and me\nAre the meeting was can be in to discuss my review of the foster death materials Miguel Rodriguez wrote this in December of Nineteen Ninety four and he perceives to say well he why he does not agree with the other reports that said Vince Foster was a suicide he actually goes through McHale Rodriguez goes through the facts that are wrong\nIn those reports and and he left the that his job as a result of that then there was another guy Patrick militant who was a witness\nWho saw some things at the scene before the body was discovered that a he\nSaid was inconsistent with the FBI report and nobody had the ... nobody had or the FBI had a misrepresented what this guy said and when a reporter brought it to the attention of the special counsel they simply had to talk to this guy so he sued he later sued\nFor the way he was treated this witness she was a witness and he was treated as a criminal by according to him and others Brett Kavanaugh so Brett Kavanaugh when he said I saw a different person in a different car from what you said I saw her for what other people saw I just want to correct the record that your story of the scene that I witnessed\nIs not consistent with my memories and according to him and his statement and his suit Brett Kavanaugh said what were you doing there I said well I was going to the bathroom said was anybody else in the bathroom with you\n[laughter] like well and then it gets really a nasty like the line of questioning is trying to implicate this guy as being engaged in salacious or illicit activities\nAnd what this means to me is that like when I was investigating on\nMerrick Garland and a ...\nAnd Muller these people all pop up in these weird stories and it makes me feel like these these guys are the real deep state and they're getting their reward and like Milton sued the government over his treatment and the Vince Foster thing at the hands of cabin on star\n... and Muller also the government actually paid people out for how they were treated these are supposed to be a law men\nAnd there and the government's having to pay out for the way they violated these guys rights and the last thing I Will say is this is nothing compared to what happened to Patrick no tonight is is nothing compared to what happened to Bill Cosby and you're not hearing about that\nAnd it's much more relevant to uh to you and I want to talk about that in the show also so so what what do you say you're\nA the thing about Bill Cosby is very interesting because he's such an unsympathetic character that people don't care oh there are\nRelations there it's like Alex Jones yeah they came for Alex Jones and nobody cared because he was out shows I care and nobody yeah people haven't forgotten they nobody cared because right that accusations 'cause he's a judge yet and they\nApply the same standards other people like I was I told people our website got removed a few weeks ago and uh so they can put it on Alex Jones nobody cared and they can start doing the same thing to other people\nWell I'll tell you this is what I Know it is so at the beginning I was saying to people\nLike moms of the friends of my kids you know I got you know you shouldn't take this lately the Alex Jones thing because my website got taken down and then they're like oh what's wrong with ...\nRight exactly and you know I Can't but I Would show you might want to do yeah\nSo and they took down so I did recover\nOr the material on there for the most part all checked everything but the pictures are gone most of the pictures and video and meaty are lost and that's where the evidence was\nFor all the things I ever clean for six seven years of work on my part with documented evidence and so I Can't even if people can say oh you just made this unsubstantiated claims and I would like to say no I don't know what it's all done\nAnd I'm going to be evidence huh they stole the evidence is basically what they did it and it's\nIf it's gone from my side scribes universally that was the point of it actually\nYeah it's just important I think that people can you can not like someone and also not like what is being done to them well\nOf course they can't do it to people who are like yeah they can they have to start with the people who are not like they simply and I personally have been told in both of those cases Alex Jones and Bill Cosby\nThat oh who cares because you know what I mean people who are from the left from the right people consider themselves liberty oriented who think they care about race will absolutely representatives from every possible\nWalk of American society have chalked up that stuff too well who cares because they're bad happened to someone they do like\nBut then they might stop liking yeah it's not ... you know that that it once this thing take hold and they're able to blacklist

ballot they keep going in there was no evidence against the Taliban and your girl she played an attack against it had nothing to do with sexual assault at all a really what I wanted to get to go with what you do what you mentioned earlier about\nChild went up to ... in shady history and uh you know being for any voting for things that were\nAdded encroaching on a day at privacy and write a things like that yeah and I have done researching a bad thing that I have found it like that and I just wanted to say that\nYou know earlier in the Bush years again after that you have to realize that the deep state was alive and well back then and we didn't know nearly as much about it back then if you're doing now and I think that\nYou know hey it being was twenty Fifteen\nThat case I cited in twenty Fifteen I think he's just a neo conservative and you're going to get that either way that's the thing I mean there that's what we get now from the Republican so I don't care you know they're not getting judgment ... you're not getting Bork\nYou're getting neoconservatives so that this is just what you're going to get and he's not that radical either so he didn't seem to me he\nShouldn't have been this polarizing for the last and he shouldn't have been a hero to the right and this and this muddied the waters to the point where everybody got their emotions up even though\nThe content was just middling like and always has these days\nI I completely agree with you on that and I will say though I think that what it did more than anything else was it open the eyes\nOf American and it made them realize that\nYou will not hesitate for one second to completely destroy ruin anyone wiping baseless accusation the ad maker aberration or evidence whatsoever and I think that it really rally yeah Republicans and and I think it's going to be a huge red wave and November\nAt rather you gonna blue leg so I I think everyone needs to go out and vote it's extremely important\nAnd I think I think yeah Democrats are definitely going to see the number\nThat's a very interesting take I I agree and like I think or I should say I I Can't decide\nWhether this is more galvanizing for a laugh or is that right I'm not sure if the spike in voter turnout is going to be as a result of this is going to be great are on the left or the right basically I feel like you're and had some I before I Want to move on a little bit to the coffee thing because it touches on on that\nBut uh and I want to ask you something but did you have something to add on to the\nThink the main motivator behind this whole thing was less the Democrats and more the community organizers behind the massive protests that are going on in America and when you look at it from their perspective\nPerspective of the people going to the protests but the people who are organizing it from their perspective\nIt only benefits them for Brett Kavanaugh to get nominated and I said just before I said that they wanted him to get nominated because that will continue to make it easy for them to mobilize people to send out and ah continue to do these acts of civil disobedience it concentrates power for these community organizers\nWell that actually goes to what I ... if you if I Want to be really I'm Down the rabbit hole that why what\nTrump does and sell if you were to take a really long game SARS was on the robes Hillary's ridiculous you know she was not getting the Democrats to get together\nThat that putting somebody that could be really scary\nTo the left could allow people Democrats in the middle to accept
