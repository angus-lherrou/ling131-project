with their intention to get to the United states and the drive by me to just just just being done to upset Trump's base that the implication is that people in Trump's base are just teetering on the

the slightest idea who the people are voting for Donald Trump who remains supportive of Donald Trump but back we'll get to get more details that I ... back to my little test so I read of these people at the event last night\nIt's going to be a red wave Russia I listen to you every day and I'm telling you it's going to be a red white but I said I Hope you're right but let me\nLet me tell you what we're up against forty five Republicans have announced their resignations forty five I mean that is a huge number many of them are\nCommittee chairmen not all but many other committee chairman and they are resigning are retiring because they don't want to go back to being chunks you know just regular house members it's a it's a big come down so we want to try to parlay their years in the house\nInto private sector success I said forty five seats incumbency has has incredible power\nReelection power certainly old back me up on this is a student at the incumbent in house races windows Ninety eight percent of the time well we've got forty five Republicans who are not incumbents we've got forty five Republicans would never run before\nNobody knows I mean their districts they're known but they're not as known as incumbents are known as well known so that that makes some of this somewhat iffy\nI and and then there is the traditional statistical aspect which says that the party\nThat holds the White House in the first midterms after a presidential election always loses seats\nSo forty five seats they have it tough to defend\nAs opposed to if those forty five had not resigned and we're still in the house you can count a lot of those is reelect\nThat you can't count now Israel legs and this is what the left in the ... are counting on is that many of those forty five will slip and then you've got a contested races are in other parts Senate of course another thing now I mentioned this to all of these people they didn't care and\nThey said they're aware of this they knew about the resigned resigning all members of Congress retiring they they didn't know the number not all of them did\nBut their attitude was and it doesn't matter it doesn't matter of the American people are fed up\nAnd they are sophisticated and the people who are elected Trump to know exactly what's at stake they're not going to sit home they're not going to win all their thumbs they're not confident they're not sitting there thinking that job was done when they went and voted in two thousand six named it was kind of pleasant to um\nTo what the here although there was a lot of emotion that I'm like I Can't deny that night interestingly I ran across a piece today have a website called America dot com and it's by Dr Gerard Francisco slum arrow expert on the forecast models\nI'm I'm not familiar with his work but his headline is rent wave coming in the house and the Senate\n\nMy forecast for the twenty H in congressional elections he says there will be a conservative red wave in the house with two hundred and twenty five a two hundred and twenty eight Republicans elected to office\nAnd in the Senate with fifty eight to sixty Republicans elected to office let's look at some of the reasons that went into my forecast Dr Merrill rights\n\nAs you remember from my book great news for [laughter]\nAs you know a member of my great book right in the presidential election of two

together to cause a fundamental shift\nIn uh in each of our two major political parties in addition the other major changes to places well those were predicted unexplained\nUh in addition to lower Democrat voter intensity among democratic voters Democrats have another major problem there are movements of democratic voters that are abandoning their party and voting for conservatives\n\nIt's all

I I have at times I marveled at this country's held together the way it has for many years as it has\nGiven the only thing that really holds its altogether as a piece of paper or a series of pieces of paper the U.S constitution the honor system and the reverence the respect for that document is what's held us together\nIn all of our years we have never elected a desperate or a tyrant who wanted it literally rip it up throw it away and establish is on tyrannical dictatorship it's amazing\nBut we're getting dangerously close to the same thing happening when one of our political parties refuses to accept\nYou watch results for whatever reason it make it up well it was stolen Russia's this or that if it doesn't matter when they refused to accept\nIt means that there really isn't any unity around the premise of our country\nAnd we may not unify issue to issue to issue\nBut we always have been unified about the premise of America as founded that's what's under assault today and that is what is in my mind\nA profoundly dangerous and we are raising ... haven't been since the seventies generation after generation of students who haven't been taught things that have nothing in common with the founding of the country we have not taught children ... we've ... you go back to the days\nWhen we learned that are in junior high intramural football in softball but nobody won\nThat there were no outs in baseball you know no kid ever struck out the kidney hit until they hit the ball put it in play there were no losers there were no winners\nOutcome based education two plus two was five if you thought it was by we weren't going to humiliate people were wrong the people who are really smart in school when a slow them down we're not going to service their superior ability to learn were going to slow them down so it was not to offend anybody else\nAnd we've not gotten to this point where kids have been raised cobbled\nThey had been taught phony notions of self uh self esteem today does not derived from achievement an accomplishment it derives from I have a right to help self esteem parents have been teaching little kids your perfect little Johnny you're perfect little Suzie I'm In it and not prepared for adversity and so when nobody has been raised to\nDeal with adversity which in this case is losing an election we have temper tantrums and we have a child like snowflake behavior on college campuses and we have a political party that's behind all of this\n\nRight now it's rooted in the failure to accept the results of an electorate\nThat is on going and now on Twitter as I said you can find posts Hollywood people promising that there will be blood if the Democrats do not win\nThe house back there will be blood so people are being threatened with\nIt not directly but in a generic sense all of it is designed to limit turn out I think it's having the exact opposite impact on people I think the left and the drive by media continue to understand misunderstand\nWho Democrats are Trump voters are why they are Trump voters and why they aren't going anywhere [noise]\nUh let's see if we were also here being being told that we need a new kinds of civility that the Trump\nPresidency and all of his supporters of promoting all this incivility and the violence and so forth\nWhen it could be said that it's the exact opposite I well I think\nReasonable I'm harping on the fact people refused to accept election results it's profoundly indicative of who they are and it's a large explanation of why they're behaving as they as they do\nAnd it's the refusal to accept this not just because Trump one it's not just because they hate Trump it's more than that it's because they lost they were fully expecting to win and they didn't and so they simply refuse it because\nIt's not a matter of thinking it's a matter of feeling they don't feel happy don't feel good when they feel bad then something's not right\nAnd that's also been part of the education system [noise]\nSo we'll get some headlines Tom ...

to have you here\nThat get Russia I wanted to thank you for telling people about the truth intent of sexual on an amendment fourteen because I've been trying to do the same thing for years and people aren't in the midst impression that it simply means if a child born to illegal aliens in this country automatically becomes an American citizen\nYou can't blame them it's been the case since the sixties and it's it's it's a\n... ... ... ... if it's your we're we're dealing with mass ill education that's taken place on a lot of things in this country and that's why it's so important that we've got a president willing to push back on it yet because what's causing this is causing a discussion of it this is how it happens I've told everybody that this is what pushing back is going to look like so\nWhile you were talking about Dred Scott as a reason why the fourteenth amendment was ratified which was actually on July night they the sixty eight but\nAnother reason why it was ratified is because it goes back to the thirtieth amendment that about slavery well the southern states weren't going to accept that so they passed laws are closed up we're still restricted the plaques that it's actually made them slaves once again and they were called the black codes so then Congress said okay you want to play that game\nThat we're going to formally recognize former slaves as citizens which will make them subject to all the privileges or immunities to the citizens in several states for article for section two claws one\nSo after that they do sweat coach were abolished and that's why we have a ... you know the fourteenth amendment\nAnd matter of fact you know the one of the ... the the guy is considered the founding father to the fourteenth amendment was represented by the name of John ... from Ohio\nAnd he made some remarks about the fourteenth amendment a few few years later and you can find that in a house report number twenty two dated Eighteen Seventy one January thirtieth so all explains how this joint committee passed the fourteenth amendment so President Trump with all due respect to him he wouldn't be not be ending birthright citizenship because it never happened he would be pulled the U.S constitution\nWell that's the point that is exactly the point that I made is why he should do this and that's his point people have looked into this\nMay have found different rationale than you did but the point is if you look at the original intent of people who were involved in writing the fourteenth amendment all Trump is doing is enforcing the constitution and taking it back to its original intent the fourteenth amendment was never intended\nTo confer citizenship on people here illegally or the sons and daughters of ambassadors or foreign agents\nIt was expressly written cooking for citizenship on slaves and now it has been expanded and again that you can trace it back to the Nineteen sixties\nWhen this began which coincides with the Democratic party wanting to re open immigration you know I I still run into people who do not believe me when I tell them\nThat as a nation we suspended for the most part I mean ... there's always been\nA people being granted citizenship but we suspended mass emigration from the mid Nineteen twenties to the mid sixties pretty express reason of allowing all of those who would emigrated starting in the late Eighteen hundreds all the way through the Nineteen twenties to assimilate\nThat's what immigration was people were coming here to become Americans and they wanted to be Americans\nThey didn't have to give up their birthright they didn't happen and they they settled in ah in neighborhoods\nAre Irish had their neighborhoods in New York and Philadelphia the Italians did though but they wanted to become Americans they learned English and they became part of American culture of which there is a distinct and unique American culture which is rooted in western civilization that's what's different now there's no interested in that\nWe don't even make a serious effort at assimilating we're Balkan icing\nIf they use this term tribal that we're Balkan icing our population because modern arrivals don't all sneak\nTo become Americans people trying to get them on the on the legal immigration side of course are but this this mass illegal immigration has an entirely different purpose behind it and the political support is entirely different for it\nThan for standard uh immigration so what Trump is doing is simply with his executive order if he does this\nWill be reestablishing the constitution to re asserting it so yeah no you're exactly right about that so to cost you a great points but the guy who from Pittsburgh who asked a question he lives there and he watches the news and he's been blamed\nFor the Senate guy surely [noise]\nWe've got to tone it down and we got a company gotta we gotta do this we gotta do that\nAnd if it's being set up that's been said in the media you know it's all aimed at Trump and his supporters appreciate the call again in South Hampton in New York build your next great to have you with us or Hi\nThank you Russian thanks for all that you do for us yes you have to share that with the ... um with regard to the fourteenth amendment why not take it to the Supreme Court or is that where this is going to end up actually so that they can decide it will be their language has it'll get there and get there\nYeah it'll it'll have to get there or not Senator Graham is going to offer legislation that in the Senate ah look we're way way far away from this we're just getting the conversation started here which has to happen\nThere there there needs to be a pretty big re\nEducation of the American population in general on the whole subject of immigration and so Trump and his roots of an executive order is good but there's you know what I'm going to be a judge\nThat's going to bring it to a screeching halt everybody knows that\nI mean that'll happen within hours of Trump signing the executive order everybody involved no was that is going to happen that then begins the process and it probably will end up at the Supreme Court unless Congress does right legislation in dealing with a constitutional amendment\nYet but\nI understand that if you want to talk political theory and economic theory it makes no sense in the world and otherwise you know

I Know exactly what the caller ... Democrats get to decide well let me tell you something Fox\nNot true anymore that may be the way they report it and they met that may be what they try to create but people rebelled against they've called Donald Trump people rebelled against the Democrats since Obama has been losing elections don't lose sight of this starting in two thousand and the Democrats have lost over a thousand\nMaybe it's closer to twelve hundred electoral seats at federal state local level\nAnd there's a reason for this they are being rejected\nAnd the media is being rejected as as well and so I guess if if if what the media did to the state of Indiana is gas lighting as if that's what the definition is now heartily endorse it and the ethics up to and it's this arrogance\nAnd this supremacy of superiority that goes along with that kind of coverage and it gets everywhere if you have\nA synagogue shooting ... obvious the obvious explanation\nIs that Donald Trump and his conservative media posse are radicalizing and this becomes the narrative this becomes just the way it is an everybody thinks this is crucial for the media the weather report these things to make it look like they are the majority and they are what's normal when increasingly they aren't\nAnd what really is happening here is that people who know they're not by definition ... numbers normal are trying to\nTurn everything upside down so that what they are is normal and what everybody else is is the one that's odd ball abnormal the media's right than their facilitating I'm telling you it\nIsn't it used to work like a charm and many people still\nDoes we still have a lot of people in our sights don't want to ... the media still wanted to find whether or not conservatives or Republicans are succeeding by virtue of one of the media as being nice to 'em or not frustrating to know when when I run into people like that and they're out there\nBut the", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "30"}
