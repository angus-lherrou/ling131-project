to get together and she said the way to do with that is doing what candidate that can bring us together\nAnd of course that means Democrats\nSo should be ... by the way to bomb that was sent to the Clintons and Obama never got to their homes just F why we still condemning them don't misunderstand the bombs were intercepted by the postal service at one of the distribution center so they were discovered very quick into bomb that was meant to CNN didn't even get sent to the right place\nIn terms of where people work CNN and it was addressed to John Brennan a who doesn't even work at CNN he was over at at a at MSNBC so a\nHillary Clinton right on schedule is now out reacting to this\n[noise] putting on his face of bravery in college she is willing she'll be subjected to attacks like this because America is worth it kind of things\nAnd that you've got to make sure you get out there and vote for the right candidates who are going to bring this to a screeching halt arms Mrs Clinton it's your party forgive me that is encouraging this kind of thing\nIt is the Democrat Party that's home to all of these mobs it's the Democratic party Mrs Clinton herself who said that being on civil\nAt this point in time is entirely proper and understandable it's at a time to go back to the village he will be after the Democrats when\nYou've got bought and paid for operatives by Mrs Clinton money showing up at\nTrying to make them look like deranged Trump supporters the Democrats are even paying people to Russia to to address swastikas on American flags waving them around made to look like a deranged lunatic Trump supporters and so in the midst of this\nAtmosphere we have this series of bombs that were supposedly slept today exclusively to Democrats and it just\nStuff has to pass and so far a lot of people's noses are in the air not quite certain what to make this uh this is just it's it's it's not it's not Republicans that show up for example\nAt the offices of the family or what was it uh well the pro life groups officers some guy shows up in with a gun and was going to shoot people got caught before he was able to sue the family Research Center I think yeah Republicans just don't do this kind of thing even though every event like\nMass shootings remember every mass shooting in areas of Democrats in the media tried to make everybody think right off the bat but some Tea Party or did it or some talk radio fan and did it or some Fox News you or did it turns out it's never ever the case\n[noise] not one of these bombs went off\nAnd that if a democratic operatives purpose here is to make it look like hey you know there are moms everywhere the moms are not just Democrats mobs I mean look at this you got people who are trying to trying to harm CNN and Obama and Hillary and Bill Clinton and Debbie ... show and you know it just it it\nIt might serve a purpose here and by the white guess what's also not in the news now and that's the that's the other mob that's finding its way north through may call attempting to crash the U.S border at or near election day that story is off and I'll tell you there's another story and it's not being covered right down that is the declining blue wave\nThat was supposedly automatic and going to happen a week ago and a month ago but we're not going to let this side track\nUs we are not going to be distracted there's only so much you can say about this incident until we have more information about speculating would be fun\nBut since we condemn all bombs here at the ... network we don't want to go too far down this road

respond civil polls out there into something called a real clear politics average of polls\nAnd political experts from across the aisle site real clear politics and trust it as an unassailable source

seeing the\nTop of it here and Tom ... all the polling data that they have a real clear politics and analyzing it's not there is no crafting\nThere is no blue wave if a wave was coming it would be building he says and it isn't\nBut on the other hand the generic ballot is holding\nMeaning the Democrats are not running away with it they still have a ... depending on three to five point lead and the generic ballot but they're not expanding it there's no growth there is no Democrats pulling away as what happened with a blue wave Trump's job approval is rising\nDemocrats are in the advantage ... but they're not building on anything there's no way that's got to wash everything away and leave only Democrats standing\nHe says the house races are really tight they are race by race real battles hand to hand combat is how he described it\nHe forecasts that Democrats might win the house that they do have an advantage right now because they have a range of Seventy competitive races\nAnd the range of pick up as they look at polling data now\nIs anywhere from Democrats picking up ten to forty one seats\nThey're projecting a democratic pickup of twenty five and a half seats which given the slightest bit Democrats need to pick up twenty three that's the magic number anything above that Democrats have an advantage in the house the range of the pick up according to the polling data real clear politics takes a look Savage anywhere from ten to forty one seats\nThey project a pick up a twenty five seats twenty five of them sort of two and a half seats more than they need\nBut with even a tiny shift in just a couple of races there GOP can hold the house [noise]\nSo all of this synthesized and stripped away and they went to bear essence there isn't a blue wave there isn't this blue wave that's going to sweep every Republican away and leave only Democrats standing\nThe generic ballot is not moving in Democrats' favor Trump's approval numbers are rising over on the Senate side ... and real clear politics project the Republicans are going to gain two seats two weeks ago they were predicting no change\nRepublicans wouldn't gain or lose any two weeks before that the Democrats were going to pick up seats in the Senate so in the past month we've gone from Democrats picking up a couple two Republicans and gaining a couple and that's the momentum and that's the

in and spend some time listening to bill and Hillary reminisce and talk about politics what what if there isn't a whole lot of interest in math [noise] what if a lot of people aren't yet\nBuying tickets\nI don't know that they're on sale with everybody here yet but I mean the Clintons art anybody's radar right now\nI mean the closest that happens is you know when Trump goes to a rally and they start talking about the deep state in Hillary and her ... and the FBI trying to chef trumpet as phony collusion story the lock her up lock her up but I mean the Clintons are not considered political opponents right now and Obama certainly is and\nI Do I ... and and now with so many leftist tweeting this is typical this is Donald Trump has engendered so much hatred and so much anger life in America is not sick I just it's just too packed it it's just\nIt's it it it's too obvious it is becoming what\nInformed and a educated suspicion about this would tell you that it is uh we'll see we'll let time on fall\nHere in the meantime we go back to the phones Andrew in Cleveland it's great to have you with us or hello\nHey Russia or if you if there was a kid a riding around in the car with my father it's a pleasure speaking\nWell thank you I appreciate that you very much\nRush you know it's like you're talking about this passing the smell test I'm I'm sure the drive by spin on this will be that we have a dangerous stories right we're out there putting\nThese bombs in the mail you know if that really were the case where it is a redneck right wing hillbilly which I'm sure that's how this will be owned by the media where do they go about getting a mailing address is I mean George Soros Hillary Clinton Iraq saying oh\nYou know that that information out there for the masses of pain you know there was never any of the country these devices to make their way to their intended target whoever put them in the mail\nAnd I don't know if it's right away to point fingers at certainty but my gut is telling me this is a left wing smokescreen\nWanted for them to be discovered the Democrats the proven time and time again there's simply no load that they want to do everything for they tried to do to derail Trump or the hot and like video that came out during his presidential campaign to Russia to even gone so far to try to ruin the wife of judge Kavanaugh nothing has worked\nWhat makes you think that they wouldn't stoop to something that's whoa it ...\nAlong along those lines if you want to look at it that way\nIt doesn't make any sense for a Republican or conservative to do this if they really care about winning these elections just makes no sense to do\nThis is going to be instant fodder for the Democrats in the media to blame it on Trump and his supporters ... there's there's ... it doesn't make any sense for a Republican or conservative to do this if they care about the elections none whatsoever but flip that\nFlip that around once you make a lot of sense for a democratic operative or Democrat in cocaine and a lunatic to do it because things are not working out the way\nThey thought do not forget this is why I'm spent so much time dwelling on this today and the psychology that's that that's attached to this this is not going the way they have a short us for the last nine months it was going to go more importantly it's not going the way they believed it was going to go they believe their lives remember\nThey believe their pollsters\nIf the polls are telling there's a big way based on the generic ballot they believe that they get it in their heads and they believe it and they start reporting it and they just compounds itself and it becomes even more intensely believed it becomes gospel\nAnd then it doesn't\nAnd then the things that are supposed to cement it like the Kavanaugh trick backfires and these mobs are backfiring they are not achieving that\nSo if you flipped this around you've got this you've got this this this mob of people flooding the border by intention\nThere's no way that helps the Democrats don't and the Democrats as I said let me grab the let me grab the uh the sweet here it's really strange ladies and gentlemen I'm going to quote the creepy porn star a lawyer but Here's Michael ...\nThere is too much at stake in the mid term shut the Democrats do allow the Republicans to use this caravan which just so obviously a set up as a wedge issue it is time for the Democrats to step up and be strong on border security we cannot once again be painted as a week and then lose [noise]\nThere's a translation for this in addition to what you're saying here\nWill tell people what it was ... tell me because I stepped on it tell people what it is\nOh sure sure so back in two thousand and eight or in order to garner sympathy and empathy for the ...\nUm there was a gentleman or series of gentleman that were walking around the Hillary camp for president campaign of two thousand and eight with signs saying iron my shirts or you're in my shirt of course because of you know can't have a woman for president those you know those sexist Republicans\nRight and you know what you're going to do Hillary and be a domestic beer housewife an iron my shirts didn't fix dinner and get my slippers that kinda thing right\nYeah it was a point it was a plant in it and it was all it was all nonsense to garner apathy in\nSeparate it was already plan to go to waste it was salaries plant there was nobody legitimately anti Hillary doing that\nRight correct that's another time telling you I gave my idea but anyway I don't want to step on keep going with the story\nSo so anyway Michelle ... came up with a good teeth and basically quit it's a bad from a follow up that this was a plan\nAnd it was all a facade like everything is with the Clintons at great professor called the ... rush he taught me one time with the ... there are no coincidences and there are no ah are you there is nothing that set in stone with these people not everything is manufactured everything is made off\nAnd so I don't trust them look at Nancy Pelosi down in Miami\nFor someone who is quote unquote running for her life millionaire Nancy was taking her time walking down the stairs or somebody who's open the door for her while she's being shouted that I Believe that's a set up I don't want to sound like a conspiracy\nTheorist here but take a look at it it's a bunch of nonsense and I don't trust the Democrats never have you never let a good conspiracy theory go the way I could never let a good crisis\nGo exactly rush no you're you're ... you're right about the Clintons there are no coincidence is with them this is a this was a philosophy that I have stalled for four years on this program asking people to\nNever forget there are no coincidence and ... and the fact you know you say that these are all deep state players a Soros bill and Hillary a Obama and so forth um if it\nIs curious they're they're they're not even on the radar in in the mid term when you get down to what other then they're trying to get themselves on the radar but\nSee that's I think they're trying to get noticed the Clintons desperately need to be noticed all the time and Obama is trying to recapture some glory trying to show everybody thinks he can still move the needle in working now the reason I think I'm responsible for the\nWhat was it iron my shirt\nI used to be rushed excellent store open up you know with some funny jokes line stories and so forth and I would tell people that I just met Mrs Clinton a week before\nAnd that it was the strangest strangest thing and we ended up in an elevator together and just the two of us she said you know I could never say this outside this elevator
