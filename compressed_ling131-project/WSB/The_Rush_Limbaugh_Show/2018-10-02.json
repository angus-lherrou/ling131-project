Congress began and it went all through the year Democrat advantage in the generic ballot was twelve five seven and the Republicans pulled even in a couple of them are Democrats once again broke away\nAnd all during it I your host of doing this a long time and it doesn't matter\nIt doesn't mean anything me remind you of a motivation technique utilized by the coach of the New England patriots won build double check\nPrior to one of the super bowl the patriots were Emmy might do it frequently I but I Know one time he gathered the players for the meeting and so we're gonna have a former going to watch horse race you had videotape of horse race but nobody had seen it was not a big race is that allow the players to make friends leave that send wages on who was going to win\nSo the players made their ... battle ... starts the tape of the race and stops at at the first term it's OK layer about somebody who's gonna win players go nuts making their choices\nTape resumes that was checked stops and it's a halfway point anybody want to change their bed anybody want to double down players go into gear making their bats have the final turned ballot checked stops the type of horse race again asks the players if\nThey want to make conditional bats or get out of ones they've made players do what they do that will check resumes taped to the finish line makes the point it didn't matter at any point in this race when I stopped the tape\nThere is no way anybody could have known at the first term at the halfway point or at the final turn who is gonna win yet look what you want to do what you were making bets uber guessing somebody you're probably were certain the bottom line is\nSpanish you never know before it's over who's going to win no matter what any kind of expert tells you\nIt was a motivational technique designed to get the players to realize first quarter halftime third quarter and do your job\nSame thing here posing January in front of a November election

red wave innocent Republicans can come out of nowhere act about final term in and take over\nWell\nWe don't know if the Republicans were ever really far behind we don't want anything because there wasn't a vote back in December or January or July or August we don't want anything\nAnd we don't know anything now and we won't know until the day after election day or maybe later that night now one of the brief observation here one thing I did you notice Mr engines knock it in there\nI think you know there's a lot of talk about Kevin on this whole confirmation messed that in fact might hurt Republicans it doesn't seem to be so\nLadies and gentlemen I Am the reason he saying this and everybody else because of my viral prediction of last week that if the Republicans don't confirm Kavanaugh as the Democrats are going to win everything that predicted a mind went viral a drive by loved it\nThey love it when the leader of the G O P and their minds me start ripping the Republicans when I started predicting Louis that's when I become totally credible that's when they run the sound bites me predicting all over the world\n\nYou notice how easy it would be to trick them they run with that

I understand the thinking but he just flies in the face of human nature and beyond that why\nDon't we have to use in order to win I never understood that why do we have to lose Kavanaugh\nIn order to gin up turn out I I ... and depending on how it would happen I'm not sure when general turnout anyway you got the majority party saying they couldn't get their nominee confirmed and they go to the voters say we're the majority and we tried we tried but we couldn't get to confirm you need to vote for us and you need to give us more Republicans\nIn the ... there there's a disconnect there [noise]\nAnybody ever heard the name of Chris theme watcher named Christine fair Dr Carroll Christine fair\nAnybody heard of her [noise] let me tell you who she is she is an associate professor in the security studies program at Georgetown Georgetown's not an insignificant university Georgetown has the same Georgetown University was the nucleus the center\nOf the movement to give a women as much contraceptive help as possible birth control pills as far as the eye can see Georgetown was the center of that movement and this ...\n[noise] well I have speaking loosely where this woman Dr Carroll Christine fair and associate professor in the security studies ...

camera at Rush Limbaugh dot com you'll be able to see if there\nAre but first before I assure you that there's two cartoons I Want to show you Scott grabbed a cartoon of the firemen carrying the baby and put it in a sweater let's let's used that was first go ahead and take that would live up this cartoon ladies and gentleman was drawn shortly after the Oklahoma City bombing\nAfter President Clinton a southern angry voices on the right speaking out against ... there was only one voice on the right Nineteen Ninety two I was ... local talk shows but\nCNN's the only cable out and there's no Fox knows there's no blogosphere theres no new alternative media uh already really conservative website to start everything's starting to ... to to blossom at that point but but this program nationally was still at four years after our founding\nAnd Clinton have blamed angry voices on the right for Timothy McVeigh blowing up the uh building in Oklahoma City the federal building and of course uh I I\nWas living in it was not going to accept that would challenge the White House automation a correction claiming oh we were talking about Michigan Militia shortwave radio\nMichigan Militia short wave radio Timothy McVeigh was listening to the Michigan Militia shortwave radio is is that by the way there's more evidence of of why you should have no doubt I Know what I'm Talking about here I haven't been subjected to this\nLiberal machine in a way it operates a number of times I Know them I Know I Know how they lie and make things up and strategize\nI Know there are the techniques their strategies and everything better than they do so a cartoonist by the name of Chris brick I think it was his name\nGrew up a cartoon of a fireman carrying a dead baby that was actually a cover of time magazine this picture of a fireman carrying a dead baby from the rubble was a cover on time magazine and the artist that his cartoonish\nInterpretation of it and the fireman is thinking as he is carrying a dead baby damn right wing radio\nWhat one of the local hosts at the time John Carlson on the radio in Seattle got hold of that fireman had him on the air wanted to know if that's what he was thinking as he was performing rescue duties\nAt the Oklahoma City bombing the farmers of no no no no we all love Rush Limbaugh we listen to Rush Limbaugh in the firehouse\nWell that cartoonist is back\nYou remember during the hearings Brett Kavanaugh said that his ten year old daughter was praying suggested the family pray for the woman meaning Dr Ford and judge Kevin I'm starting to break down and tear up at that point talking about the wisdom of the ten year old daughter same cartoonist is back\nSome public heavy Illinois southern Illinois journal or some such thing but\nThe cartoons now gone viral all over the Web but of course on Twitter in parts of Facebook they love it switched that show this to the people watching other that'll camp this\nIs the cartoon it has Kevin O's daughter praying at her bedside\nThe description the upper left hand corner Kevin O's daughter says another prayer and in the speech bubble in the cartoon Kevin ... daughter says dear God forgive my angry lying alcoholic father for sexually assaulting Dr forward\nNow as I say if you're not watching the program on the digital camera which you can do as a member at Rush Limbaugh dot com will have the cartoon eventually at Rush Limbaugh dot com or if you don't have to remember you'll be able to see it I'm not doing this has come on for membership I'm I'm just we have the ability to show these things rather than describe them\nSame cartoonist Nineteen Ninety two two today it's just vital\nIt's filthy it's dirty it's disgusting it's despicable and sick and of course it has accomplished it's subjective it's gone viral and people have seen that people are reacting to it\nAnd I weighed whether or not to give it the attention that anything talked about by me ultimately gets and I decided to go ahead and do it\n\nIn my never ending quest to have people understand who liberals are how sick and getting men did did\nThey are this is what passes for humor on the left\nThis is what passes for comedy\nThis is the kind of stuff that makes them laugh Kevin O's daughter says another prayer dear God\nMy angry lying alcoholic father for sexual\nSolving Dr Ford [noise] not a single element of that speech bubble has been established as anywhere near true [noise]\nAnd it's just that flies in the face of decency you know you run out of descriptive adjectives when trying to describe this kind of thing\nThat's why I have settled on the fact that we're really dealing with a bunch of people who at some point in their lives have suffered psychological isn't the events that have led the psychological disorders and they found themselves now as the mainstream of the Democratic party\nAnd and the American left psychological disorders have become the identifying issues and

Can't speak as the NBC starting to get deflated already they think they've got the gold mine of interviews they've got to get\nOf gets they've got you Julie sweating the\nProblem is her lawyer didn't properly vet her because her lawyer didn't think with the maybe it'd be necessary media would accept whatever he tells them because the media wants to go to Kevin O'Toole NBC\nI don't I don't know if they're really vetting her or just trying to get confirmation here to add to what they want to do so\nKate Snow then says did you see Brett Kavanaugh spiking the punched and you'll see him putting

[noise] she said she was going to kill you yes\nRight after she dealt with the unborn baby do that first\nYou will never ever see your unborn child ... the Democrats really want to\nStand behind this\nIs this what they want to vouch for they're backing off of it this is again I don't mean to be redundant but Dianne Feinstein all\nOf a sudden the Sanford and bringing up the fact that we need to start looking again at his roe versus Wade decision women's reproductive health and is assault weapons\nAre thinking on why that's been vetted along and\nOh and you didn't have anything to oppose them they're just so you imagine how they feel about this I mean they're fools to believe this was real and the first place but they're so damn desperate up one let me I Need to go back I Need to find Sheldon Whitehouse\nIs number nine Sheldon Whitehouse this guy's money this is a Democrat\nWho on friday morning the morning of the vote held up one of the enlarged pages of Kavanaugh's ... said that he had figured out how to translate it and the date in ... he figured this could be the date where the incident Dr foreign described happened\nAnd he is thought to try to translate some of the nicknames and phrases that Kevin all used on his calendar\nOf course in incriminating ways a toward capital so\nOn good morning America today George Stephanopoulos of the Clinton the war room is talking with Sheldon Whitehouse is a demographic Rhode Island are you satisfied with the scope of the FBI inquiry can they finish this by friday\nI think I'm satisfied and we don't know how all the details yet but certainly if they haven't been given free rein to interview whomever they want so that's a very good sign the last thing we want to say Sam\nInvestigation I also think that there's a fairly small universe of witnesses here at a very big FBI so yes I think they probably should be able to ah get this done by friday of really put the effort into it\nNow wait a minute [noise] that just makes too much sense that just doesn't fit\nWith Chuck Schumer today on the floor of the Senate who we have we have audio soundbite number eight this is Chuck you he went to the floor right after the turtle dead\nAnd basically made the uh the case that\nWe're nowhere near ending this FBI investigation as the turtles that Schumer and the Democrats are moving the goalposts\nWe are looking at what judge Kavanaugh says at age fifty three not what he did at age Eighteen\nWe're looking at his credibility now is grown adult and if you believe Dr Ford judge Kavanaugh\nNot telling the truth just yesterday NBC News recorded that either judge Kavanaugh people close to the judge we're in communication with his classmates to get them were by the allegations by Deborah Ramirez it seems that church Kevin always at least very misleading to the Judiciary Committee about ms ... story\nSo now it's about capital lying if I catalogue perjuring assumption that means he's not quite on what they've got to make up their minds first he's a serial gang rape is now the frozen ice on people at a bar Denise negative fall down drunk and now\nIs a a liar their flailing\nBut Sheldon Whitehouse totally out of character with his majority minority leader in the Senate Chuck Schumer\nYeah I'm a friday night yeah there's not too many people to talk to hear FBI's got a lot of weight and get this done that's just to central maybe White Houses out their truck in the spirit here to be the public face of a reasonable Democrat Party while everybody else stays insane\nBut they they are moving the goalposts but and yes for\nA delay but they're also trying to move the goalposts as a target or they can catch Kevin in anything\nUh there's one more thing that I Want to play and I'm looking for and I just found it I Want you to go to audio soundbite number twelve [noise]\nThe question of who leak doctor for his letter to Dianne Feinstein you know this\nThis is a leaking this letter my memory and this is kind of fuzzy but I remember Feinstein during a press conference or either on the foreigners to the gym judicial committee or I remember her showing the letter holding it up or\nTalking about it I remember I don't know if that was the week but she clearly talked about it and said that she'd had it since July and that she\nTold us all about it that whoever Senate didn't want to be named and didn't want to go forward and she didn't want to do with it she's holding the thing I don't know what I don't know what to do with us\nI was all part of a strategy so\nLate yesterday afternoon on Shepard Smith
