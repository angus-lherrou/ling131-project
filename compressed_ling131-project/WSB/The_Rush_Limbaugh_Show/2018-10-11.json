chosen son is the air\nNow Mohammed bin Salman is not the oldest son of king Solomon but he has been designated the crown prince meaning he will be the next king\nAs such Mohammed bin ... has been trying theoretically to reform the some of the Saudi economy and to take it away from being strictly petrol and oil focused because\nOf the world is expanding in ways that the Saudis are not involved in one of the things that Mohammed and someone has been doing has been traveling the world and making friends in the United states you spend a lot of time in Silicon Valley he's gotten to know each

criticizing Mohammed bin so I'm not\nEven a running stories suggesting that Mohammed bin Salman mine's father the king has grown so upset with his son the crown prince that he's taking toys in power

you with us or high\nThey rash thanks for having me on Yes sir I\nSo I was there I was in the for the three days of the nonsense last week I saw the the them screaming and yelling and attacking us and and the folks and and so what I Know was this is all they have the reason that they continue the reason that John Lennon saying the nonsense she said on CNN the reason that they just continue with this game plan\nIt's the only game plan they have and they're hoping that the American people are dumb enough to still buy it but I Believe that the American people even in California where I'm at the American people are seeing this crap and they're like this this is an old game we don't find any more\nAnd and and they have nothing else to play there's nothing else for them to but they just keep doing the same market and the luck in our eyes it was like they know they're losing they know that we're not buying it anymore but they've got nothing else to say\nNow that hold on here that's an interesting point because if they do have the maturity of the presence of mind\nThey do have to realize they're losing Trump one Trump is getting elements of agenda his agenda a pastor implemented Kavanaugh was confirmed everything they've done to stop Trump\nEverything from the judges to the court's travel but not much has worked and so I think you're right they do realize they're losing\nAnd you think they're in a fit of desperation that they've got nothing else to do that's why they're not proposing any ideas to counter Trump's that's why they're not proposing a new policies to counter Trump's because they don't have any\nAbsolutely they let loose when they're both the right one were silent and they it for so long they've expected us to just shut up and go away it\nWell that that's true too I I think they have become accustomed to Republicans caving and Republican voters and certainly conservative media uh well so conservative caving as well I think they've they've gotten accustomed to bullying working the rats lying\nYup threats flying all of that and and and they're hoping that it's going to work together and the only way it works\nIs it we don't show up that's why that's why you see the polling data still showing them winning that's why it show Hillary was going to win a landslide because they know that if they can to sway does that they can discouraging us

condemning\n[laughter] Trump says [laughter]\nYou better be careful [laughter] he's wishing for [laughter] [noise] that I can tell you that he'd better be careful\nWhat he's wishing for now the stock market's been kind of see song has been a roller coaster ring\nAnd Trump is suspicious as he can be up and let me just tell you something folks there are a number of wealthy Democrat Wall Street types investors people that run hedge funds who I Am convinced\nWould willingly take a bit of a financial hit to their wealth and businesses primarily their business is not their wealth but they would they would David in person pain if it meant lowering\nEconomic activity on enough to hurt Trump I have no doubt that there aren't enough looney tunes on the left who would willingly do this I think they're that desperate as a previous caller said\nAnd of course it flies\nIn the face of the Democrats in the media tried to say when it was a new age ah yeah the economy's doing well but the president's not going to get any credit for that people don't even leave it there believe it looking aren't pulling people\nObviously that's not true I think they're terribly worried that this great economy is going to be greatly beneficial not just to Trump but the Republicans in the midterms\nAnd so there is a monkey and going on with the interest rates is the point it's calling are causing the stock market the roller coaster and here is Trump was pointed out to him yesterday was not a good day for investors\nThe Federal Reserve is getting a little bit too cute that's what I took over this economy this economy was ready to crash we were in one percent GDP now or a four point two percent [noise]\nIt was ready to crash it was the worst if you look from the great depression it was the worst recovery and the history of our country and Obama tremendous money at it [laughter] don't forget Obama was playing with zero money so he was playing with plenty of money he was it was very easy [noise]\nI'm paying interest at a high rate because of our fed and I'd like are fed not to be so aggressive because I think that making a big mistake\nTranslation he is worried maybe accusing the Federal Reserve of raising interest rates because the economy's chugging along so well that traditional inside the beltway Washington gets very worried when the economy's going great\nMy whole life I've noticed this and my whole life I have been perplexed by this I've asked myself why and let's look the fed here as the establishment in this story\nWhy\nIs a great performing and growing economies so frightening\nTo official Washington and it is because every time the economy starts talking what does the fed and do they leak\nThey leak that they are thinking of raising rates and what does that do that kills activity in equities markets if these people think the fed is going to start raising rates people start selling rather than buying and investing\nWhat Trump is saying that he thinks this is being done purposefully to slow down the economy\nAt the time and totally unnecessary for it right before an election and he's calling them out he's caught it's another thing previous Republican presidents would not do he's calling out the fed Mr Limbaugh doesn't Trump from the ... you know you may appoint the Federal Reserve chairman but know day to day no way\nAnd the Federal Reserve German the odds are that the number of the board of governors are going to be you know a bunch of Tommy leftists as they are at many financial institutions are not going to pretty strictly crazy about Trump despite how much wealth they are earning big cause of Trump\nSo Trump calling them out on it he says there's no reason to start raising rates right now right before the election soybeans down so they react to it and and this rollercoaster stock market day actually ended up being only a one day rollercoaster I think\nThere's positive action today I Will I Will check it's ah let's see one more thing here we have yeah a ...\nSo your wife recently had an interview she said there are people in the White House she doesn't trust people you don't trust that you have to watch your back is that true and if that is the case why are these people you don't trust still in the administration\nWe have great people right now of markets are there some of that I'm not at all with us and them out [noise] slowly but surely\nService some other embarrassing leaks are you any closer to figuring out who these people are\nWell let me get my legs I think a lot of the lake so not only that made up by the newspapers the media is very very dishonest beyond anything that anybody can understand\nNot even a letter to the times that there is a chance there was a very good chance that that was written by the times I wouldn't be surprised 'cause at times is totally corrupt and dishonest\nWhere did you first hear that right here\nWho was the first and maybe the only person to suggest that the times itself wrote\nThat piece that memo that some pose a memo written by an angry staffer\nIn the Trump Administration claiming their up close and personal lives the president doesn't know what he's doing but don't worry there are adults in the room and we're doing everything we can to stop this guy we're conservative they we loved it\nAnd they started a massive manhunt to find out who did this\nAnd they couldn't find anybody and I think on the first day on the first I Would have to go back and check the transcript\nBiting it was the first day I told everybody I don't believe this I think the times made this up I think they wrote it and they're telling us that somebody ... wrote it but I think this is somebody from the editorial board the editorial staff one of the up and people\nThis is a New York times creation I think they're that big a with Sam it's I think they are that frustrated I think they have tried everything that has always worked to destroy Republican presidents and it just bounces off a Trump nothing hurts him\nMuch less gets rid of him and I think they're at their wits end and I think they've run out of things pages in and play book run out of weapons run out of plays

the\n[noise]\nNew York magazine and look at it as Obama had a secret plan in case Trump rejected the twenty sixteen election results is this not hilarious looking back let's let's retrace steps it was the last debate between the Trump stir and the hill the beast\nAnd Chris Wallace was the moderator and Wallace asked Trump if she writes them which swear pledge to accept the election results and Trump said no\nI'm not going to sit here and tell you right now that I Will accept the results of the election I'm not going to do that until the election comes that we've counted the votes\nThey want it I think what was the objective was to be able to create a soundbite Trump acknowledges he thinks he will lose elections that's what they were hoping for\nSomething have you with knowledge that you'll accept the results of the election of course I'm a great American ...\nThat go sit at that time everybody thought that Hillary was going to win a landslide then they the soundbite would be in the head likely trumpet knowledge is likely to feed their upcoming election\nBut Trump cross them up they said no [laughter]\nI don't know what kind of shenanigans if people got to play I'm not going to concede anything tonight Hillary Clinton gets in here\nThis is the biggest threat to our democracy that we never\nI didn't believe in saying that this is an unwritten so then Obama we didn't know until\nRecently devised a secret plan in case Trump rejected the election results and guess what the plan was [laughter] the plan was if Trump wins this election away from it\n\nIn October two thousand sixteens senior staff and the Obama White house\nDiscussed what they should do if Hillary Clinton won the election and Trump refused to accept the result\nThey had caused to be worried at that time Trump and openly speculated that the election might be read during his final debate with Clinton and I told her to the Nineteen if you said that his opponent should never have been allowed to run and declined to answer the question of whether he would concede the\nI'll keep you in suspense Trump said it wasn't a hypothetical\nBen Rhodes Obama senior aide and speech writer told the intelligence just New York magazine column Trump was all ready to hang it on the\nCampaign trail Ben Rhodes seems to have a problem with English Trump was asked a hypothetical\nQuestion what will you do if Hillary wins to which he gave an answer based on a hypothetical premise\nThe Obama White house plan according to interviews with Ben Rhodes and Jen Psaki\nObama's communications director called for congressional Republicans former presidents and former cabinet level officials\nIncluding colon colonel Powell and condo leaves a rice to try and forestall a political crisis by validating the election results so this is not funny looking back there hell bent\nOn making sure the Trump concedes despite being dead certain Hillary was going to win and if Trump refused to concede that we're going to call Colin Powell\nAnd ... and rice and a bunch of ex presidents and they were going to get them to validate the election result in addition to the official count state by state\nIn addition to the U.S Congress certifying the election that apparently it wasn't going to be enough they had to go get Colin Powell and kind of laser rice\nIn the event the Trump tried to dispute that Clinton victory of able to fund the result as well as the conclusions arranged by the U.S intelligence community that Russian interference in the election sought to favor Trump so we're now learning not\nWe're not learning anything we're having our suspicions confirmed they hatch this Russia plot way before the election even took place\nAnd no matter what happen no matter what the outcome was they are going to use your Trump last they were still going to use it to say that even though Trump last he tried to steal the selection of military and it was that was going to validate her election even\nMore that was going to make her an even bigger star an even bigger hero she overcame not just Trump She over\nImportant she overcame the dark she overcame Russia that's what their plan was\nAnd then it got turned upside down Hillary last and she refused to concede remember she refused to go away they refused to acknowledge the Trump and one in immediately became Trump didn't window washing stole it\nAnd to this day there's no evidence for it but there is Obama\nThis story New York magazine they think they're doing an edible here and they think they're really praising Obama they are admitting that there was a conspiracy behind the scenes dealing with this election and trying to handle whatever outcome\nEnded up happening to the benefit of Hillary Clinton [noise] somebody some of the story over to Robert Mueller he may not find out about this\nHuh\nHere's Christine in Asheville North Carolina as we head back to the phones if they don't like to have you here Christine Hi\nTruly

call here before we got to the Camille ... soundbites us Ralph in Las Vegas looks intriguing up there once up Ralph [noise]\nWell I have two questions if you want to take one that's fine uh during the judges hearing all I heard was yeah vi only investigates they do not come up with conclusions or all Indians or anything I heard that too\nBut Fox News and the president at both bought in to the fact that honors\nDid exactly the opposite he was judge jury and not executioner but a probation officer for Hillary jade did he violated all of it so why did he get away with it and nobody else can I don't understand I really don't\nUh who is ... ... you mean call me\n... go ahead I'm Sorry\n[noise] yeah I I made the same point that when I heard they don't drunk and quick call me ... and her before even interviewing her\nJudge jury and probation officer\nRight and and we all know the reason why she was a Democrat nominee their jobs and futures end the shenanigans they haven't pulled\nRequired her to win for them to stay employed in front of the tricks they and pulled on Trump to remain unknown so she had to be exonerated she had to be found not guilty and not even charged in relation to the emails and the ... and the trafficking in classify data and so forth [noise] see I have the same reaction you did what you mean you know coming on cautions\nI Am I understand that that she had to get up but he did not have the right to he was not a judge it was never in trial\nIt was oh no wait wait wait wait he claimed that he did because Loretta Lynch ended up having to her she didn't officially recused but because she met was slick willy\nOn a plane on the tarmac out in Phoenix Comey said she's compromised so he basically took over the gang of energy for the purposes of exonerated Hillary and he went out there on your life after that press conference under the auspices of making the decisions because Loretta Lynch couldn't\nThere why can't we just read up on it and say it didn't have the legal right to make a decision so let's start over from where he just gave that speech\nI agree with you and this is why you're not the only one with Devin newness and a bunch of his um other house members that are on the house Judiciary Committee\nAre hell bent on getting to the bottom of this\nAnd not letting these people get away with it they have been on the investigated that's not the right word they haven't even been invest they haven't been looked at you've got the special counsel what'd you think nor ring the real crimes and criminal me that's taken place while spending all of his time trying to find that\nCrime that they can lay on Trump and they haven't been able to it's frustrating this is why by the way there isn't christening frustration at the president for not declassify these documents that will answer the questions you're asking\nThey don't understand why why the president is protecting Rosen stain the guy who in a meeting suggested wearing a wire in his next meeting with Trump to try to get incriminating evidence that Trump's unfit\nThey were going to gather the cabinet after Rosen's dean had\nHad a conversation with Trump which supposedly was going to show that Trump is insane and unfair never going to play that for the cabinet to try to invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment Rosenstein and so I'm just kidding I just get it was the people in the meetings that he was not getting none of us were\nAnd I believe that I Believe these people back then were hell bent on getting rid of Trump\nI think they still are I I think I think
