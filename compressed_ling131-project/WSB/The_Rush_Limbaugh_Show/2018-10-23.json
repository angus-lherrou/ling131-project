every time I looked up at the TV over the next three hours I saw that that that manner\nIt didn't matter what else was being discussed it didn't matter who the guests were then I saw the Washington Post thing and so I checked the New York times and there it is spreading fear telling lies\nAre hemmed of election this caravan thing you know I [laughter]\nI continue to study this\nAnd try to pick it apart don't analyze it and and make sense of it from a political standpoint and I still can't find anywhere in the media any concern about it I Can't find anybody concerned are worrying or thinking that has been anything abnormal about its\nImpact what you find in the drive by immediate isn't tired total miss characterizations these are desperately poor people wonderful people fleeing poverty in their homeland\nAnd that's not at all what they are they are part of an organized mob\nThere is no question about this is an organized mob in like everything else in the left is behind some point in the future we're going to learn exactly how this thing was pulled off we're going to learn who did it we're going to learn who paid for it we're going to learn who scripted it\nJust like we've learned how they did the Kavanaugh thing with Dr balls the Ford how that was structured how that was planned how it was kept in reserve part is that nothing that appears spontaneous or organic\nWhere it benefits the left is spontaneous or organic and he's all structured it's all planned it's all scripted it's all paid for its all focus grouped\nIt's poll tested from their perspective\nAnd the the obvious because there there there's no ... you look at this you look at this caravan and it is\nYou don't want to scare\nEverybody it is exactly the threat this country has faced for years we now have a focus concentrated microcosm up\nWith seven thousand people that maybe a thousand or ten thousand if they get here by a lecture there there's still a thousand miles away yet vowing to get here by election day at the drive by claiming or walking there not walking they can't they'll never cover a thousand miles in two weeks have been walking it's physically not possible\nSo when the cameras aren't there some of these people have to be\nBeing driven but it is\nAll orchestrated none of this is organic none of it is real from the standpoint that individuals totaling eight thousand people

somebody set this up\n... obviously is a bunch of leftist to step up and when you look at that and examine it from that standpoint you've you've got to wonder what it is that makes them think they are going to win the massive elections and it is clear to me\nNot only examining the caravan the mob see there I go I even get caught up calling it what it is it's not a caravan it's a mob it's bought and paid for and structured scripted mob\n\nThe Democrats clearly believe and they have believed since the two thousand sixteen election\nThat the way\nTo win back their power is to stoke and create Trump hatred that they think organically naturally exists in either a majority of Americans or close to it and that's what they're trying to capitalize on his massive Trump hatred massive Trump resentment\nThey're not doing it by talking about issues you know an individual campaigns you'll hear Democrats promise to repeal the tax cuts and roll back things that have led to economic prosperity but in terms of the national message from the Democratic party you're not getting what you're getting\nTrump fear Trump hatred promoting if an exacerbating it or what have you and it's\nIt's silly it's not the way you build a movement now\nLet me share with you a couple of uh stories today on the polling leading up to the mint terms because it is all over the place and it is contradictory as it can be five thirty eight as soon as the adored do and the indispensable Andy eagerly anticipated Nate Silver\nWho has now said the Democrats have an eighty five percent chance of winning control of the house of representatives the Republicans have only a fourteen and a half percent chance of keeping the house\nThis is almost identical to five\nThirty it's forecasting two weeks before the

lying\nTo deceive people such as you like your doctor your keep your doctor if you don't like your health plan you get to keep their health plan with Obamacare your average annual premium will be reduced by twenty five hundred dollars those lives were told over and over and over again to dupe\nOn winning Americans into believing that Obamacare was going to a centrally be cost free that it wasn't going to cost them very much of anything at all and that if they want their doctor and planned it wasn't going to be any change\nAnd we later found course we know from the beginning he was lying about it\nTried to tell everybody he was lying about people didn't want to believe the first African American president would lie about\nSuch things so much help was invested in Obama\nMisplaced as it turns out those wise again and they were just the tip of the iceberg those lines were meant to deceive people those lives were meant to make fools out of people they get them to agree with Obama's David ... takeover of one sixth of the U.S economy\nFor the express purpose of being able to control people's lives if you control their health care if you control people's access to healthcare you control them\nYou can determine what there'll be allowed to eat or not you can even determine what political party gets preference if there is a line that the doctor and this was exactly one Obama and the Democrats were doing it didn't get a single Republican vote\nTo the media run better headlines Obama spreads wise and stokes fear to pass Obamacare [laughter]\nNo way how about the Benghazi disaster with Obama and Hillary lying for months\nThat video produced by somebody nobody ever heard of caused the unrest that led to the riots and men Ghazi knowing all along that it was a pre planned and executed terror attack that the Obama administration did nothing to defend\nThose are lives designed to mislead to deceive and to protect himself\nHillary Clinton and everybody else that was in on that damn full decision about\nLives Obama told about drawing red lines in Syria the Obama administration was a series of lies upon lies and deception is upon deception and the American people quickly saw through it and began defeating Democrats at the polls in record numbers starting at the two thousand ten minute germs\nAnd Obama is outlying today he went out and get his own little rally in Nevada and he tried to tell everybody\nWell when you think about it was great government knew remember who started or remember who was\nAnd he had his face in his head up in the air looking up over everybody like God like you've got to look up to see him but you're you're so far beneath them you can't see you just look it up like this over everybody\nKnew just remember you just do you remember where it is critical ministry for rock Obama according\nTo create these economic circumstances if his wife depends on it because he doesn't know how and he doesn't know how because he doesn't believe what has happened in the last two years was possible but beyond that he didn't want this kind of economic activity he didn't want this kind of robust economic growth\n\nHe didn't want it demonstrated that people have more control over their destiny acting on their own behalf that if they step aside led government take care of things\nThis guy was a walking talking disaster for eight years\nAbout Obama colluding with Russia on getting rid of American nuclear weapons and open Mike after the twenty what right before the twenty twelve presidential election Obama's overheard\nTalking to ... number one aid he says you tell Vladimir to be patient I'll have a lot more flexibility after this election flexibility meaning I'd have to run again and so I'll be able to even get rid of more nukes in our stockpiled than I could be for\nThe guy was just an honor disaster that the American people quickly realized as soon as the American people were able to get past the idea\nWe're we're we're actually in a political battle with people who are not right mentally forget emotionally these people are not right mentally see them protesting Mitch McConnell and his wife having dinner at a restaurant in Kentucky I mean they're not right\nThere's something really really off about these people and I think they've been driven to various degrees of insanity by professors teachers and the media\nThey've been lied to for so long about things that the things they expect to happen to things they think are real are so devoid of reality and truth that they're on the table do except to Jim Jim Jim Acosta having\nThe president whip people up at a\nRally after rally he says is the most depressing thing he's ever seen as a journalist this is it the citizens CNN conference yesterday in New York City\nIf you want to ask me what makes me the most depressed about my job is covering the rallies and it gets to the larger point of what it's like covering the president United States and in particular Donald Trump in many ways the danger is not what\nTrump is doing to America the danger is how America is changing under Trump and I never thought I Would see the day where I Would go to a political rally and you know people will give you a hard time I'd you know people yelling at me at Hillary Clinton rallies during the two does make campaign\nBut at rally after rally after rally having the president of the states where people up into a frenzy can attack the press to me is the the ... the most depressing thing that I've ever witnessed as a journalist man\nOh man we're has this guy been to the Trump\nWhipping people up and rally after rally and having people get mad at me as a journalist is the most depressing thing I've seen as Jim you can give you got\nAll kinds of the you could go be a waiver you obviously listen well\nMr Acosta however was not finished somebody needs to walk the guy back from the ledge here you're thousands and thousands of\nPeople who are willing to join in and do the same thing I'm at the rally in Montana the other night when President Trump praised grudge and Ford say for body slamming Ben Jacobs I remember looking over to the supporters in the crowd and there was one guy one young man\nWho is doing these body slammed moves you know and and he and his buddies were all getting good laugh out of it and then he looked at me and he goes like this\nLike I'm gonna cut your throat and you know it just it I I went up to him after was over and I talk to him about it and and he was a sort of laughing about it and I I guess he wasn't serious about it but to me that's the Trump effect on America\nWhat do you make of this so it it's it's no different than when Trump is onstage hey Russia hey Russia maybe you can find Hillary's emails and media is looking for um nobody can maybe you can find Hillary's missing thirty pounds name was let the media and they'd love to hear from me\nAnd everybody in the media has a heart attack thinking Trump is asking the Russians to hack\nHillary server Hillary's already done the hack Hillary's already done whatever she has something\nTo hide the emails no sense of humor these people have no ability whatsoever to relate to people as they actually live so Trump praises a guy for being able to body slam somebody\nThey see no humor in it they don't have any idea how to relate to that they see that they think Trump they really do they think Trump is promoting violence\nI think the Trump is recommending and praising ... ... but they just I I have never seen\nA group of people this large that is so distant and absent from reality from day to day life and how people talk to each other he goes up\nTo this guy and the guys laughing hey man hey Jim Acosta how you're

know where he was somewhere in the midst of the mob where packs of three and four or walking by and by the way folks [laughter]\nThey don't look like the kind of people you'd want to run into you know on the street I mean they they just anyway he's standing there and these people are walking past the he's not looking at on her behind him and then they walk past him on his left shoulder\nAnd he's ... he's telling everyone who they are\nAnd what they want and why we must let them in and that they're decent people and all they want is a better life and we as Americans we owe it to these people don't let them in all they want is what we want we all\nCalming will totally bankrupt our country\nAnd then they quoted tweet from Trump every time you see a caravan or people illegally coming are attempting to come into our country illegally think of and blamed the Democrats for not giving us the votes to change our pathetic immigration laws remembered the germs\nThen these guys say Trump sees a twofold advantage it's a way to argue his opponents of turned a blind eye of the problem\nAlthough Democrats remain strongly favored to win back the house overhead TV pictures of thousands marching north\nHave the Democrats booked asked about the\nTiming worry them and national Democrats strategist said in the Senate yeah\n[noise] what [noise]\nSo in the house it's a good deal in the Senate it's not a good deal they're Democrats are admitting that they're spooked over this\nEven before the caravan most congressional Democrats immigration as a loser for them\nA memo circulated among democratic congressional offices in recent weeks\nSaid it is very difficult to win on that immigration was vulnerable voters in states Trump carried in two thousand sixteen even the most draconian of Republican policies like family separation and deporting dreamers\nPersuaded relatively few of those polls to vote Democrat\nOn Monday Trump unleashed an explosion of immigration focused statements warning on Twitter that he made the point the military to the border and threatened to cut off aid to Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador which she has doubled down on by the way\nSo this is a story trying to tell brain dead people read political why Trump is talking nonstop about the care of him because it's going to help him with immigration well\n[noise] [noise] that they think is behind this\nSome of the stuff in the media is literally mind boggling that that the the attempt here to be on attached to it or disengaged from it\n[noise] when when you get down to brass tacks most people in the media would be supportive of the people is caravan and being allowed the lead in the country because they are everyday anyway whether people show up and groups of two or five or ten or in a mob of seven thousand the left as in favor of letting them in\nThat are worried that this was going to be a boon to Trump\nRight before the midterm elections which it is\nThat's [noise]\nBut when you stop and think the Democrats are behind this has to be democratic donor money behind those and the reason I say this it may make no sense it makes it would cause this report is right this is helping Trump's allied with the Democrats do this smoke they're not rational right now\nThis group of people throughout the media the Democrat Party itself and and all of their social media base voters I'm telling you are so\nPoisoned with hatred and resentment all of these emotions they have felt following election night two thousand sixteen and all of the times in the past two years they thought that Trump was gone you gotta\nPut yourself in their shoes every day they'd gotten up for two years and they've read in the New York times I'll Trump is toast\nThey've read it's only a moment of time before a

out or to stop jump in his tracks like the capital thing is backfiring on them now you got ... out there promising subpoena power saying yet we're going to investigate Trump we're going to investigate everybody in his administration as the reason for the Democrats to win back the house\n\nThey have they have lost all grounding here\nIn in rationality and their perplexed because none of what they have\nDone has worked in a white has it worked that it's if it's getting back to the same old thing they can't persuade you to abandon Donald Trump they can't persuade you to stop going to Trump rallies they can't convince you to look at Trump and see him the way they do\nAnd they're just fit to be tied\nOver it they're at their wits candidate right now so they're running these polls showing
