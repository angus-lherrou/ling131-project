on trying to get somebody to handle a polygraph\nProbably yeah that's another story by the way the boyfriends letter has yet to be reported in\nMainstream media nor has the story of Monica McLean pressuring Leland Kaiser to change your test of those two stories have not been reported ABC CBS NBC Washington Post New York times Associated Press people have not heard either of that\nAnd there's other things like for example a Dr Ford mentioned in her son it I mean hundreds and they test of mine she she mentioned regal Delaware was where she would have that and that's the last known address

Dianne Feinstein Cory Booker Kamala Harris to leave judge Brett Kavanaugh subject to claims of perjury and the impeachment which they're going to pursue by the way [noise] [noise] oh yeah or doing\n[noise] some other interesting thing had other do develop it here but hang on just a sec here's a second tweet from Kimberly\nStressful Lisa Murkowski Republican Alaska\nToday voted to abandon due process and the presumption of innocence she voted to potentially leave the Supreme Court and a four Ford that block which puts loaning Ninth Circuit court of appeals in control of everything that matters to Alaska her state\nDevelopment property rights gun rights environmental rules Lisa Murkowski has made quite the statement\n\nThese are two devastating tweets as they are right on the money legitimizing and signing off on the most despicable tactics ever standing with Feinstein Cory Booker Kamala Harris who is in a class by herself\nIn men dastardly and and the number of other things just just [noise]\nNot much redeeming there but more importantly Lisa Murkowski has voted to leave Kavanaugh's subject to claims of perjury and impeachment\nAnd then leaving the court if he's not confirmed that court stays up for for ... what the ... the reason that matters is that in a way if the court votes for four on any case then the decision prior to the court hearing it is affirmed nothing changes\nAnd that means that the Ninth Circuit court of appeals wouldn't be the highest ranking court\nCould make decisions regarding fundamental aspects of life in Alaska her own home state\nIt is it would be idiotic to put the night if you're a Republican and by the way she does believe in property rights and development and gun rights and to put the Ninth Circuit court of appeals with a bunch of left us in charge of those issues and her stay there just shooting herself in the foot\nAll just supposedly be in unison with me\nToo movement [noise] so I mentioned that we had a couple of photos of Dianne Feinstein it looks like she has cornered Murkowski I don't know when the photos\nWere taken presumably they are recent we can find out we just have checked ... wardrobe on that particular day of hearings\nBut go ahead Scott put it in the sweat you're for those of you I'm watching the digital camera there is a picture on standby 'cause we have a close up there is a picture of Dianne Feinstein literally when the Lisa Murkowski up against a wall in a hallway of a Senate office building\nAnd\nThey are chatting with each other and Murkowski has a pain to look on her face Feinstein looks like she is\nA picture speaks for itself and it it would that hand that she got a cornered she got her hand up on the wall framing Murkowski it's an aggressive move it allows Feinstein leaning in to Murkowski\nNow let's switch to the close up of that photo for those will be watching on the dental camp do you see the pain the expression on the face of Murkowski and the expression of in a tent\nSeriousness and you better be listening to me on the face of die for\nNow we'll have these photos up at Rush Limbaugh dot com to I'm not trying to leave it buddy out but I Want to you watching on his that'll came to be able to see these bats that close up is the same shot\nJust to close up of the previous slave televised photo is that right well\nJohn here looking here's why Feinstein sure does look like a bully and Murkowski looks very uncomfortable does she not\nI mean it's it's been really pained look on her face\nAnd it it looks like Feinstein is running this relationship it looks like Feinstein is giving her what for [noise]\n[noise] I don't know when the picture was taken and I will acknowledge that our interpretation could be wrong\nWe we have no contact your other than the hearings and the way this has been going\nWell I wouldn't call that romantic I take that back ah one of these is from California and romance there has all kinds of shapes informed so you could be right ah it it could be a romantic under load I certainly what's\nThe old saw it's not for us to criticize who loves who and why [noise] so um yeah it can be a lot ... lovers quarrel with them but I've got to get these photos up\nThe cocoa unless cocoa couldn't find it at the shore cocoa confined them himself\nOr he may beat me the punch now the other breaking story [noise] that it's not a breaking story but\nIn the Senate campaign in Tennessee this is kind\nOf interesting this is the marsh show Washburn story or race uh let's see [noise] Marsha Blackburn I'm Sorry Marsha Blackburn a story her opponent is filled bridges\nAnd\nRead this and is saying that he's discussed it and then if he was in the Senate he wouldn't vote to confirm Kavanaugh is a Democrat running against the incumbent Marsha Blackburn\nWhat is a Democrat doing saying that he would vote to confirm Kavanaugh this was in the ... this was in the middle of a campaign here now I Know what to Tennessee and it's deep red and I'll just wants to win and so forth but this\nHe expects this to pay off for him in his campaign this is obviously a reaction and reflection of public sentiment for\nKavanaugh in the state of Tennessee\nPhil Bredesen is by the way starting to losing ground to Marsha Blackburn in polling data this this record ... seats And Corker by the white has also tweeted today that it is outrageous\nTo punish somebody who hasn't done anything to anybody\nFor all of these ... pose an actions are men have engaged in against women\nBut his point is we have no evidence Kavanaugh did anything to anybody we're going to design a seat on the court because of that and then the next day we're going to die because of the judicial temperament temperament and then we're going to deny because it committed perjury and I'm going to deny it because if you ice in a bar back when he was in college\nBut Corker made a plan that he doesn't think\nKavanaugh should be held accountable for things he has on his ... that's kind of like the affirmative action argue well why don't one of the world we're going to be punishing people here for racial discrimination when they have it\nEngaged in it\nOh we've got to make up for lost time in the left those Phil breed is and who\nIs starting to lose grounds fall behind black burn in the race to replace Corker\nI mean this is a really strange time to go public and against his own party he's a former governor of Tennessee\nAnd he issued a statement Rubio king Democrats for hijacking the confirmation process as a license to
