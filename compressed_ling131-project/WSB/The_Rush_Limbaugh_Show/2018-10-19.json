Muslim Brotherhood ... which is\nI mean it's pro violent but they actually well they're they're PR is that they attempt to achieve their objectives\nWithin the quote unquote democratic process of the political process they want a United the Arab world and the Saudis are the biggest problems that because of the Saudis are too close to the United states\nThe Saudis are the number one the buyers of American weapons number one they spend more money buying American arms than any other nation\nThat might surprise you but it happens to be true the Saudis have also become recent allies with us and Israel against Iran\nNow don't laugh at this when you go back and look in Morocco saying oh who the drive by media loves well\nObama loved Iran and to Obama paying Iran one point eight billion dollars in power\nLoaded cash Obama signed a nuclear deal with Iran was\nEssentially a pathway for them to achieve nuclear weapons Trump has since ... up that tipped him off that's that's another rewind when Obama policy so if Obama loved Iran or thought it was okay at least to have an allied relationship with them or less adversarial then so does the drive by media\nBut\nNone of this about ... is designed to not not intended to they deserve to die don't misunderstand this just folks were were were between a rock and a hard place here every day we're faced with a challenge to the media picks a story that is their number one story and its purpose is very clear damage\nDestroy whatever as much as they can Donald Trump we have to defend this at least I think this this is my reaction to all of this I don't want 'em taken Trump out I don't want to damaging Trump I don't want any of this to happen\nThis is all bogus I Want\nThe trajectory this country has gone to remain I Want us to remain on that trajectory I Want to beat back the insanity and may abnormality and the psychological disorders that have become the Democratic party I Do not want those people in charge and leading in governing this country it will be a disaster if that happens\nIt will be an absolute just I Can't I got an email from a friend of mine last night who just beside himself over the fact that Republicans might lose the house he is convinced this guy's a former New York liberal by the way he reformed about Twenty years ago he can't he can't he's having trouble\nDealing with the possibility that the Democrats might win the house he's having trouble dealing with the fact that the majority American people might want that\nI understand I agree with him completely doesn't make any sense of Democratic Party doesn't deserve to be winning anything just on the basis of the way they can portray themselves in the cabinet situation but that's just the latest the Democratic party has become the home of the mentally unstable\nWho have used the political system\nTo fix whatever problems they have ... or their grievances that they think they have it all revolves around the age old argument of the purpose of government\nIt really is is you take all of this that's happening domestically and when you're synthesize it now when you boil it down to its essence it's about the role of government\nAnd it's about the fact that the Democrats do not want to promote self reliance they don't want to promote rug in individual lives and they don't want to promote people dealing with life\nFixing situations dealing in facing adversity and overcoming it becoming better people they want people to remain inept incompetent dependents grown up in a mass thinking the government is the solution and the solution is not really a solution\nThe solution at the Democratic voters want is punishment for people they think are responsible for the misery of marijuana is why when we want that\nTo triumph\nWhat we don't but in the in the in the mission to bring that about here comes this ... story and as far as the drive by strict concerned it's an open an opportunity to blast\nTheme Trump to damage Trump the ultimate aim is to get Trump to cave in a band in Saudi Arabia\nNot it's and it's not that the drive by have anything in Saudi Arabia it's just to get from the cave period just just just to prove that they can manipulate intimidate Trump into going against his instincts they've been trying to do that since the campaign they have failed practically every effort they've made\nTheir die to be able to say they pressure Trump into doing something you didn't want to do because she's afraid of them and they think they're getting close when it comes out there saying out looks like a show ... died looks like it's a pretty good rep because she'll be\nThey think they're getting close and they're all jammed up on their own tree and they're all getting more jazz\n[noise] for this that's why we tells you

places the Democrats are running on issues that are not at the forefront of people's minds or they are on the wrong side\nBut if you're really stop to think about it mob behavior bullying the appearance of insane rage in anger is all they have left\nThey don't have any issues or policies to run on for the same old reason they can't be honest\nOr they've got plenty of policies all they got

it isn't much\nFrustrated because they've tried everything they tend to get rid of Donald Trump and not only have they failed he has thrived so all they have is rage Emma rage is actually the anger associated with you\nHere they have failed in every at tempt every effort\nTo get Donald Trump's approval numbers down to the thirties and the twenties so one of the primary parties in America the Democratic party has now become a party of range and violence mob like bullying behavior if they're only\nAngle and they're actually paying people to go engage in this kind of behavior\nLet's review some things that were in the news twenty four seven and the reason they were in the news twenty four seven because this was how to drive by media working with the Democrat Party was going to get rid of Donald Trump\nAnd yes folks I mean get rid of Donald Trump I I don't think what this has been about a simply waiting until Republicans lose an election such as the terms I think they've actually sought\nTo have Donald Trump from a move from office since the day after the election I guess what mothers' about that's what the collusion things about that is what every one of these stories has been about\nIs somehow magically forcing Donald Trump out of office and effectively canceling the results of the two thousand sixteen election this is not about been not been about setting the table and making a case for removing Trump\nSay at the ballot box in twenty twenty or having the Republicans lose the house in twenty eight teen this has been about literally removing Donald Trump from the White House that has been the mobilizing energizing thing that's gotten them all out of bed every day\nEverybody from the drive by media leaders to the Democratic party leaders to the enraged abnormalities that make up a Democrat\nBase and I mean that specifically I guess one of the reasons why the range and anger is now so\nOut of control is because usually these people are able to accomplish most of this kind of thing against any other Republican they want to destroy Mitt Romney or George W. Bush same pretty much they know they're going to succeed they've tried everything they know what Trump haven't even made a dent really\nAnd it's all been about\nHaving Trump thrown out of office twenty Fifth Amendment that's now that's not two years down the road day how many times that they brought up the cabinet needs to get together and determine this man is not fair to say they want him out of office every day now\nThe failure compounds the raid look at just some of the issues that were twenty four seven for at least two weeks\nAnd then no particular or to hear all of these were designed to take out Donald Trump Christine balls e forward\nThat was a to offer that was get rid of Kavanaugh as well in that case they didn't care if they destroyed Brett Kavanaugh's life his family

Michael ... who was then touted as perhaps a Democratic Party presidential front runner for twenty twenty\nAnd Donald Trump's taxes that was an issue is that was\nEffervescent below the surface for the entire time and then there were a couple of days where it made the lead\nHow about the shooting\nAt the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High school in Parkland, Florida and the creation of a couple of new Democratic Party activists camera hog and I forget the other one how long did that story go on how big a star or did they turn camera hog into and where\nIs he now and where is the issue of gun control where is this story and that young people high school and college students\nHad had enough and they were going to take control of the apparatus that government and they were going to get rid of guns that are going to wipe out the in Iraq where\nIs that today what [noise] but\nOh camera hog is still there and the next time something happens that makes him a useful to be brought back to live there he won't be again\nMy point is these are all manufactured\n\nTailored people and the issues based on a happening or a moment but none of it is organic or real when are you in Russia doing wrong on these totally real but he's a media creation\n\nAs David ... doesn't have an audience David Hawk did not literally create a bond neither does okay seal protest these people\nDo not have connections with an audience they don't have connections with voters like Trump has are like other successful people immediate do they have been made media heroes by the media but it isn't real\nAugust gone but nobody's alarming ... where we miss hog we may want to see it nobody saying where's hog\n\nI'm that's not a criticism he hasn't had time to build up a connection or an audience point is none of this is real it's all soap operas script material\nWhat's another one the me too movement\nHillary Clinton is affecting late killed that by saying my husband you can't say that he did

Do remember that way way back that up are you back you\nGo I I've been way back before that even fell a but hey I got a theory about this caravan\nThe last two years there's only one thing that the Democrats won on and that's the wall and it as a Trump supporter every time that the issue of the law comes up I get aggravated that it's something that they want on income trumpet caved on\nAnd I think that they've done that for this time just to put an exclamation point on and to emphasize the Trump is not the winner that he says he is\nYou know that's an interesting thought that it that the idea to flood the border to demonstrate that Trump does\nNot have the wall can't get the call maybe isn't going to get the wall so maybe people should abandon from do you think that would work\nWell it's not going to work on me but let me tell you as a as a Trump supporter that is the big thing that aggravates me every time he finds one of these uh one of these things to keep the government going that's got nothing in it it\nBurns me up at all the time so are you are you a little concerned that Trump is not really trying hard enough for the wall\nNo I I mean I've got a political theories as to why it hasn't happened yet maybe you\nKnow Trump Trump I trust him Trump I I think he knows what he's doing a ... it could be that he wants to do their next year right before the election to get everybody energized you know I don't know if he's a ... all I can say these are smarter than I Am\nA navy but but I uh [noise]\nThey they seem to your theory is really quite insightful but it requires ... for the Democrats to pull it off a lot of Trump voters would have to believe he's not trying not trying hard to ... and ... for the Democrats to capitalize on flooding the zone with\nFour thousand people that get into the country just to demonstrate that Trump has a bit of a wall that Trump really can't stop these people that Trump their pores ineffective those people in order to abandon Trump would then have to conclude he's not really trying very hard and I I don't even think they would have banned it in this so and yet over all I don't\nI agree I I Know I'm not and I don't think most of them well but my question is what else do they got\nWell they've gotten my behavior a lunatic insane range\nRight but I mean on on Trump they got they got nothing they can they can put up the Trump hasn't been that he's promised and that's the that's the uh\nNo that's exactly right but wound right there that's a store\nAnd the Trump supporters that we haven't got the wall and we want but it's not even you know that they aren't even begin to foundations you even start so it really aggravates me personally that this is something that they just keep the continuing resolution than have things to keep the\nOh hey yeah I Wish you all of that you're talking about all of these spending bills we've had new budget deals we've had continuing resolutions\nUm we Democrats can't stop anything in the house they can in the Senate what what here's what Trump's up against and before you go to I don't want to get your thoughts on the Trump is still up against the fact that leaders in both parties do not want that wall\n\nIt's not just the Democrats are opposing Trump on this it's all so there are a lot of Republicans don't want that wall because of Republican donors the Trump is still pretty much fighting the establishment the swamp on that\nThey they didn't want tax cuts either no they didn't and there's\nA lot of other things that they didn't want the he's he is a a that you've come through and he switched it I'm a into doing what he wants\nOut in many of the ...\nI think many of the Republicans have blocked the idea that Trump was gonna be gone or a before now\nI I they are so convinced the media will get rid of whoever the media targets I I think first is certainly the for six to eight months of two thousand Seventeen Trump's first year I think the Republicans didn't do anything to help and because they didn't think he was going to survive\nAnd it it that's one of the reasons that the Obamacare\nIt will replace didn't go anywhere because the Republicans just bought into the notion that most of the country actually hated Trump despite the fact that he had been elected [noise]\nAnd it's been a slow reversal than a slow realization on a part of the Republicans the Trump is the guy\nAnd the Trump is immensely popular particularly on the Republican side what we'll see if this story on the caravan turning around palm pay always there upon pay all left Saudi Arabia after

I can defend the pictures rush the pictures so that's the one thing that has had legs\nOkay so the audio somebody's if you're on hold if you're on the phone just be patient were coming through your elbow quick oh this is the sound back in the hands of the interview last night uh that Fox has been playing all day long to get people's\nReaction I still say that I think there are things that have yet to happen that are going to determine\nOutcomes in some races that we don't know so it's still very hard to predict Kevin off feedback reaction was one hundred percent positive for Republicans or Democrats really blew them\nBut there's one or two three five of these things I don't know I just rely on hope which is again naive I don't have survey data I don't trust the it hasn't been the rights\nConsistently enough for me the people doing these surveys desperately wants Trump goal and I don't know how they can take that out of their work I don't believe in pure objectivity is like this trust if I put you on the spot production but we hold the house and we increase the Senate because I think that's just I think that's just I think the Democratic party deserves to lose\nIn the single biggest electoral landslide defeat in my lifetime meals they actions they've taken just in the last month\nOkay so that bite and bite\nLit up the Fox news channel the day our first stop is America's Newsroom they'll hammer a antibodies Julie ... they're talking to a famed Republicans ... ... it's about my comment\nThat deserve to lose like he's bar act on that front half right on the other front I think will lead some set up cities I think the house is very very much in jeopardy\nSo you are not buying into our scenario hold it Rush Limbaugh said they'd hold if they don't count votes like I Do I mean I rent a congressional committee I've been doing a long time\nThere are Fifteen seats that are now gone nine of those are the open seats there's another twenty five to thirty that our our seats that are in play only about two or three Democrats seats are in place totally out of these has everything has to go our way to basically break even\n[noise] let me run through them and say this is the stuff that I'm going to be honest with you I I Do not get into this stuff this is this is wrong or stuff and to me this is totally abs and are\nThere any any what what's the word personality or I mean there's just raw numbers are based on data that is the result of polling and I know as well as anybody that polling sometimes is right sometimes it's wrong and and I just like I said in the bite\nI'm just suspicious of of polling units because I think I don't think these people can take their passion and their desired outcome\nOut of their work and we know that they know we look in the presidential polls in two thousand six to eight I mean that those people were all literally caught short there was no way Donald Trump is going to win it was just not possible Hillary was going to win a landslide maybe not the biggest ever but Trump didn't have a prayer\nAnd there was one maybe two polls that showed that he was really in it and couldn't win at Rasmussen was when they were ignored and we've got a replay here's what informs me what makes me make these kind of production\nIs reality and as I also mentioned last night since ... rock Obama was elected in two thousand eight starting in two thousand ten including the midterms in two thousand twelve\nAnd the midterms in two thousand four team and the election of two thousand sixteen the Democratic party has lost one hundred seats\nThe trend is people voting out Democrats\nAnd that was happening while the Democrats were in the White House with Obama there that could be a factor\nObama's gone so maybe the anti Democrats ... is not as high as it used to be when he was there as I Do believe he was a drag on the Democratic party but\nThen I asked myself what has happened in the last two years to make people all of a sudden want to elect Democrats again\nAs everybody's telling us is going to happen house is gone rush the Senate yeah we're probably pick up look up the house is gone\nAnd then they said because rush these house races have nothing to do with any of the way you're looking at this these are really local races and they are have have to do with things that are not on any national radar well not true if these races are being nationalized by the various candidates in them\n[noise] but anyway what has happened to make people all of a sudden stop rejecting Democrats or the Democrats have they done to one eighty are made now performing and executing and behaving in ways that many people love them again\nWell no not in a just an insane world the Democrats aren't doing anything that would grow\nSupport their promoting rage an anger there promoting\nInsanity and a lunatic behavior\nSo then okay maybe as a Trump is there's this much opposition to Trump from people who didn't care one way or the other two years ago has the media succeeded in creating a bunch of anti Trump sentiment\nIn a mid term turnout profile of voters\nWell that would have to be what it is does the Democrats are not when the Democrats say the justice associated with the Democrats are doing his landslide defeat the Democrats are not responsible for anything good happening in this country\nAnd they're not even trying to be associated they don't even trying to claim credit for the economy they did for a couple of\nWeeks they tried on Obama out remember Obama's trying to say the economy was his well that went over like a land balloon and they died with it so they abandoned Matt\nAnd outside of that there hasn't been one attempt by the Democrats to associate themselves with anything good happening in America\nThey have in ... dad\nContinued to try and portray America as this unfair\nOn just on deserve exceptional superpower\nThat discriminates that violates that ... that [noise] it's all negative so I'm just so where\nIs this body of evidence that suggest the trend devoting against Democrats is reversed again I acknowledge house races are\nNot the same as a presidential race with a national issues of national turnout on balance Shannon Bream last night Fox News at night with Shannon brim a wonders what my strategy was in predicting what I predict\nCome up no calling says that the Republicans are going to hold onto the house so where do you think this is coming from with Rush Limbaugh what's the status\nI tend to agree with him um and I think what we could be saying is again the predominant ... the Pony Express called the spiral of silence the shy from voted to the shy breakfast votes as a kind of people who know that it's not a dumb thing necessarily to support a particular view but secretly in the polling booth that's what they do\nThat Steve Hilton who has a weekend show on Fox him he was instrumental Italy Brexit vote in the u._k. and so a reason\nWhen one was Limbaugh going this I mean there's not a single pulled out of the shows this happening precisely my point it's not a single poll not a single poll shows\nSo far this where to conclude and these people live and die by polls I'm telling you folks nine out of ten of people in D.C live and die by\nTheir gospel and I really think um if I Lived in\nWashington each and every I don't I couldn't I I wouldn't it be ostracized after not too long I just couldn't get with the program living there I have known that for for many many moons\nSo he'll just yeah I tend to agree very much I think there's a lot of people don't tell the pollsters the truth a lot of people don't even answer when the pollsters call I think\nThere's a lot of people not being contacted up next to Kaylee Mac a nanny who is the spokeswoman for the Republican National committee\nEven bought on selling Russ Limbaugh about that so called hidden Trump voter I talked to a pollster who said to me that in the aftermath of the
