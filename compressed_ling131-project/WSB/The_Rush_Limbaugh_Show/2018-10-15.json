that her twenty twenty campaign is rolling it out as if it's not a complete self own how do they think this was a good idea\nI'll tell you how they think it's a good idea they say they're naming Trump what they think they're embarrassing Trump remember Trump offered to donate a million dollars\nTo focus on us his favorite charity if she can prove that she were Native American so she's come out today and she is according to her doctor in science as as a force he's established that she is\nMaybe an American and now she's asking Trump to pay off to the indigenous peoples circumcision for

that\nAt most Trump owns ... one\nOne thousand twenty fourth of one million I run that number he always maybe most a thousand dollars if he's going to pay a percentage\nOf the million dollars that

most important election in our lives and it's like it's\nNot this is not the most important election of our lives to thousands sixteen was\nIf Hillary had one in two thousand six that that's what we

posts and the agencies what do we know today that we would not know if Hillary had one including names of people and what they've been doing\nIf you hit people between the eyes with what would America be today if Hillary had one\nIt's a different way of getting people to focus on the importance of elections\nUh the the drive by have their formula\nAnd it's rooted in the desire they haven't everybody hate Trump and so that desire becomes narrative and then that narrative becomes the result polling data\nAnd says the media so headstrong they want everybody else to therefore the trend is pro democratic intimate terms in our polling data because people have awake realize what a mistake they made voted for Trump none of that is true\nExcept on the hard left where it's always been true there is nothing new about it and it's not confined to Trump patronage hatred of everybody that isn't them\nLike I said just based on the last two weeks in the Capitol hearing the Democratic party today as constant deserves to lose in the biggest landslide in the history of landslides a Democrat Party deserves to get bumped\nFor the tactics they have engaged in for the actions taken by their lunatic and paid supporters\nAnd it just outrageous the kinds of things that they are engaging in and then the decent world and then a sans society they wouldn't be punished greatly\nIn the midterms I still hold out hope that they could be my point is we will get to all of this as the day is unfold\nIn this weekend in coming weeks but here we go with Donald Trump and Leslie stall on sixty minutes provide provided that are soundbites work I'm not confident now so the only way to know is to give it a shot the first one is Leslie stall\nTalking to Trump about the supposedly hostility that he has created between the European Union allies and us\nAll that I mean what's ally we have wonderful relationships are a lot of people but when I Want to teach us much worse than the European Union the European Union but mine was formed in order to take advantage of us on trade and that's what they've done [laughter] that's how they shot hostile sounds hockey on some of the way they treat us\nWhat our house summit in dealing with and within this country for so many years I knew willing to get rid of that western alliance now I like NATO side\nBut you know what we shouldn't be paying almost the entire cost of NATO to protect your and then on top of that they take advantage of us on Jay Leno don't any more they understand okay\n[noise] so what once again we have here the concept but just so hostile the hostility it sounds so hostile it sounds so mean it sounds so it sounds so it's this it's confrontational and of course in the eyes of the left we\nWant to be Europe they want us to be Europe they want us to be western\nSocialists they think still functioning at a democracy but but that's that's what they want to so we shouldn't be forthcoming and tolerant we should be welcoming we should be in a gray she aiding ourselves and this by the way this is just Donald Trump keeping a number of promises which\nSay what you want this guy has kept more promises probably all politicians in history combined\nThe problem with that is that so many people expect politicians to not keep their promises that I don't know how big of a scoring points that it is for Trump but it does add up to the fact that you can trust them you can count on me it'll lead me says he's going to do something he's going to do it to\nDie trying we don't have a wall yet but not for lack of trying\nAnd we don't have the full repeal of Obamacare yet but not for lack of trying other Democrats are often running here on a couple of 'em read burst issues I don't know if you've noticed it or not but all of a sudden\nThere isn't much more you can do to cut their taxes and yet how often do you hear every ... both parties politicians\nRunning around and we're going to middle class tax cuts and middle class pregnant burn through brand but we got to cut middle there isn't much to cut anymore when it comes to wake up in Texas now which small percentile of taxpayers also paid three percent or more\nIt's fourteen hundred taxpayers the top point zero zero one percent the top one one hundredth of a percent for teen hundred taxpayers\nThat group alone paid three point two five percent of all taxes one thousand forty nine people is the exact number one thousand or fourteen hundred and forty little round it to fourteen hundred and fourteen hundred taxpayers\nPaid more than the bottom Seventy percent\nIn two thousand one bottom fifty percent paid nearly five percent of the top one thousand percent pay to point three so the burden of paying taxes is increasing on the rich not decreasing\nIt is not true to say they are not paying their fair share now this is\nAs it's supposed to be by the way when there are marginal rate tax reductions when you reduce income tax rates you generate more tax revenue\nBecause people shelter last they avoid if if if if you tell people that are going to be able to keep say Seventy cents of every dollar as opposed to keeping forty\nCents or fifty cents of every dollar then they'll work much less hard at sheltering it and she'll it'd be more inclined to pay it plus you have more tax payers because all these people end up hiring more people as the economy grows so the fact that the rich are paying more\nIs actually part and parcel with the theories behind supply side economics supply side tax policy at the bottom line is\nDoes anybody think it's fair that fourteen hundred people for gene\nHungry people out of three ... some odd million is it fair to fourteen hundred people one thousand four hundred people are paying more money in taxes and the bottom Seventy percent\nCombined and yet we never stop hearing how unfair it the rich are not paying their fair share it gets a conflict\nFrance and I doubt that it's ever going to change because if you get the votes of all fourteen hundred people you're not going to win anything\nYou need the votes of the people in the bottom Seventy percent so you need to pander to him you need to constantly tell them how they're getting ripped off you tell them how people aren't paying their fair share the left is very very good at this and what the left ends up doing is telling people\nWere going to punish those which we're going to punish them for you it's not fair didn't fair to have so much more money than you or is not fair to not paying your fair share and their fair share of taxes that we are going to the bottom somebody just go yeah baby punish them\n[noise]\nCNN's Chris Cuomo the son of Mario the pious\nSaid that\nHe thought Donald Trump looked like he was thinking racist

wanted to know what racist thoughts were going on in Trump's had\nMy curiosity wasn't about what came out of Conyers' mouth my wonder wonder what's going on in Trump's head let's take a look at him here is my educated guess okay other than a warmer serotonin flash of happy hormone imaginary headlines black clubs ... blacker than Obama Cuomo said\nWhatever kind of racist thoughts as Trump may be happening here is Kanye goes on so is the racist here the son of Mario the pious who sees race everywhere all the time even when it's not president even when he cannot\nPinpointed\nAt my house in an

just guys going to do wonders for me how does he know what's going on in\nTrump's in they have a crystal ball\nBut no he's not racist I this is the kind of think it's I Know this is not going to be widely known until I tell people about it but I just who these people are and the things they're saying and doing I I just\nI Know they're going to get votes I Know people are going to support him befuddles me though back to the Trump sixty minutes interview with Lesley Stahl we were up here at number just as a big number three\nThis is Trump talking about the necessity of consequences for illegal immigration Leslie stall question what about the force separation of migrant children from their\nParents has the same as the Obama law you know Obama had the same time it was on the books by painted and enforce that like for those who are launched that zero tolerance policy to deter families with tonality then everybody decided and the courts don't want separation and frankly when you don't do separate\nWhen you allow the parents to stay together okay when you allow that\nThen what happens is people are going to porn talk I'm telling you gonna go back to\nThat cat in the west is\nLeslie for coming into our country illegally and part of\n... I mean part of the reason I have the blame myself the economy is so strong that everybody wants to come into the United states you know my fault\nLeslie I've done such a great job and the economy everybody wants to come here I'll take the blame for it now she says she misspoke there\nThis law on the ... Obama certainly didn't for separation of just didn't get reported because Obama was cool and couldn't do anything wrong and if it was happening when Obama dead at dinner had many good reasons for it\nRemember we've got a two tier system of justice in this country and we have a two tier system of media\n\nOnce they see it was on the books but he didn't force what is that what\nYou mean it was on the books that Obama didn't enforce the law but Trump is enforcing but Trump didn't make the law\nThe Democrats Leslie stall included a tempted to make people think that Donald Trump purposely wrote a law or just enacted one that separate they don't run from their family to the ... and you wouldn't believe the number of brain dead people actually believe this happened\nI was watching an episode of law and order in your S.

know it gives her\nLook Elizabeth Warren is resurrecting the one drop rule or an anti alum a a rule created by a southern plantation owners Democrats say if you have one drop of blood that was black you're black\nOr this was this is a grotesque cruel her her percentage are so small\nBy the way of ... excuse me second hasn't that rural been adopted by civil rights activists now that that that if if you have one drop you are going to be called black\nWhat that's exactly right intersection holiday requires quantification yeah and so we we need to know how much of a percentage of pressure you are versus oppressed\nThis this this Willis is grotesque widely discredited used by the KKK in the thirties used in Nazi Germany against the Jews\nHere she comes again this is actually a dog whistle to her base it's not meant for Republicans it's not meant for conservatives is about her future run she needs to tell her face I'm On board with intersection analogy look how much of a pressure I Am and let's find out your percentage of a pressure to\nWould you define the intersection out of it is a relatively new leftist activists concept that I find that most people to whom I mentioned that have no idea what it is how would you\nDefine that let glad to thanks for the opportunity to\nDo so much more than welcome to find a good host I I have never know when I got a little thinking and asking when they listen to a caller savings\nI agree with that look a intersection doubted comes straight out of Marxism Marx said that everyone is either on a presser or oppressed they're either Bush law or proliferated\nAt its later is now being adopted the idea of being able to declare percentages of what you are how oppressed and how much of a pressure you are it's called intersect finality because instead of just being one camp or the other it spread across race gender sexual preference and other variables\nYes okay metric intersection out of the for me great honor to wash your you're talking to your your speaking in language of ah people formerly educated on Marxism many people\nAren't that's why it's so successful um yes any intersection out all the extras basically something that has been constructed by these marches just saying that all of these different leftist organizations meet somewhere they all either sect with each other the feminist having this strain about them that that that uh\nUh cohabitation with that with militant Islamic feasts that then with illegal immigrants and their activists and we're all of these people intersect is where they unified\nWell yes but it also applies to the individual because of these let's say five different dimensions you you are on a different scale and all of those and they intersect into a single number quantifiable says that this is how much of an oppressor or oppressed you are this is where you're on the scale\nOf course this is the root of all this and there was recent white privilege stuff pops ... absolutely\nSo now Elizabeth Warren because she wants to uh justify her cultural appropriation of a Harvard professor ship has to claim a particular percentage of intersection now with the oppression to speak their language\nSo she is saying that she is an oppressed she's asked him anyway she's a woman therefore she's impressed by the patriarchy and now as a one thousand twenty four in the industry as oppressed by the white man\nWhich is a a again a resurrection of the one drop rule that this person is just so low as to be a joke you know if I could say I took a DNA test about four years ago and of course

I Am referring to black sedan okay All right\nJust want to mess up because that sub Saharan this is somebody what ... what is it what it was it and then you start talking to some continent and some people really get confused you're from I'm from India or over to sub Saharan Africa is below the Sahara Desert\nUh which is where most of the population of Africa is most of it\nThere is some north of
