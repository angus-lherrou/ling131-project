purges and an activity over the past several years not you know what what's going on here\n[noise] I Will share with your listeners than you I I worked in the secretary of state's office for five years in the elections division is administered by the secretary of state's office but ... does not like the laws that he is given to administer so in the case of registration applications\nThe legislature passed a law in February at twenty Eighteen called exact match\nTo keep the Russians and other people who are trying to ... vote in Georgia from getting absentee ballots or voting early or voting and more than ... de pursuant to and following up on as you've referenced earlier in the show Georgia's voter id law two thousand five all of this is about\nMaking sure one person gets one vote and the people who are legally entitled to a vote which would not include illegal aliens are immigrants\nAre even though it's not about keeping anyone else out we've set voter registration records in Georgia not just among white voters but among minority voters we now have six point eight million\nRegistered voters which is an all time record and we are at an all time high end registration among minority voters even higher than the registration numbers of two thousand and two thousand twelve went Brock Obama was on about\n... is their race tracking on voter registrations I mean\nYes it's a self disclose but just like on census data put your name your address your race you can choose not to answer the question um and that is on that we had to do it by federal court order for the better part a thirty five years under voting rights act\nA legislator or excuse me court decisions which found George and other states wanting we didn't get out from under Justice Department review until a handful of years ago and during that time on ... so we had to track\nRace data and a sex data in Georgia what to demonstrate we were inside registering women and minorities Asians African Americans Hispanics and that there were not impediments to that registration as well as them turning how does it affect\nThe all time high of a African American males so far it's two thousand and eight the all time high of African American\nFemales by far was to two thousand twelve reelection that President Obama even though the president did not carry Georgia and right now we are setting records in early in advance voting as well as absentees among minorities all of which would tell me\nThat it's easier to vote than it ever has been in Georgia or they're ... a three thousand on voter registration applications being upheld yes\nAre those predominantly minority yet and the majority of them also came from the efforts of a group called the Georgia project which was a minister and run the nonprofit\nHeaded by Stacey from when she was ... when she was in the state legislature but before she was a candidate for governor the intent thing to reach out to enrich during large numbers underrepresented audiences\nAnd the mind to the organization were millennial and minorities they done that but that doesn't remove the requirement that you have to fill out your name and address correctly mhm and that you can't have multiple registrations more than one county so because there are\nQuestions about those registration applications that can range from having their name misspelled to an incorrect Social Security number\nNumbers transposed et cetera there are fifty three thousand that have not fully cleared the hurdle but if they show up on election day or a prior to election day with their voter id and the correct county they still will be allowed to vote but just have to demonstrate they are who they say\nRight okay one of your mind is the most important litmus test issue or issues for voters in the governor's race\n[noise] um it depends on which voters are talking about money and I'm not trying to push back on you know the majority over Ninety five percent in
