I Wonder if the Democrats large ignoring that and him do not think\nThat that behavior is tied to them they don't do anything to stop it and in fact they encourage it Maxine\nWaters is out there encouraging it Mazie Hirono was not there in your Mazie Hirono Mazie Hirono says people are totally justified and harassing Republicans in public in restaurants and even in their homes and forcing them out because they're white racist white supremacist totally totally justified\nSo there's a part of me that knows that Democrats are promoting this there's another part of things some Democrats do not think that this Duran psychological upset\nIs tied to them\n... let me put it this way if we had people on our side behaving like this it would worry me to death it would worry me to death that voters are going to think\nThat conservatism is made up of Iran's lunatics like this the Democrats don't seem to be concerned about that at all some of them like Nate Silver here don't even think that that behavior is assumed by voters\nTo be the behavior of mainstream Democrats\nAnd I I Wonder if that's true and if it is true how can they be so I'm to see if it isn't true and if they are aware of it and are proud of it and are encouraging it then the question becomes this when you get into turn out for the November elections in the midterms by what people are now saying Mr certainly\nThe ... the Democrats some of the people on TV are saying well I I don't think we know yet what issues are going to determine the vote in a bit [laughter]\nI Wonder where they heard that wondering where they heard that idea of what\nWe don't know yet of the issues are actually going to determine turn out and vote of happened yet they're still among the oh more than a minute during the election\nIt is a interesting question though will any of the passion fade away on either or both sides\nOf this and that's on the Democratic side it's not going to fade away and I think everybody needs to know this\nOn the Democratic side this deranged lunacy has become the defining characteristic of today's Democratic Party and the American left you have to remember these people have been off their rocker since November of two thousand six team\nThey have been mad in saying crazy\nPercolating compounding come pressing all of this ever since they haven't been loaded for bear ever since election day and the day after a two thousand six team in his cabinet situation comes up\nAnd I don't think on the Democrats' side they can get any more hysterical\nAnd I don't think they can get any more motivated than they are I think they're at their peak right now\nI mean they're still talking about investigating Kevin offered her pulse he wants to see the F.

a single thing in a decent unjust country that the American left at the Democratic party has done by virtue of its behavior that warrants\nA stamp of approval of winning elections yet they win them within their closely contained bases district and states their enclaves which is actually\nA very small portion of this country in terms of square mileage\nPopulation centers of the big cities on the coasts and then the great lakes\nHere's the\nIt's not a dirty little secret but it's something ... always keep in mind\nAnd frankly I was happy watching the news over the weekend to hear a number of people on our side making this point because it's a point that's been true for as long as I have been doing this program and longer we say constantly to the left uses the courts\nTo act as insurance policies against losing elections that the left cannot\nSucceed in implementing his agenda nationwide except to be the courts\nAnd that's why the courts are so important and that's why the courts a liberal Democrat presidents have stacked as many of the federal courts federal appellate courts as they can with leftist activist judges not just plain old several judges rule of law\nAnd there is a dirty little secret behind this\nFolks\n\nThe Democrats simply do not have\nThe numbers in the country to pass their agenda in Congress they do not\nThe numbers to implement and pass their agenda legislatively other words they cannot get their beliefs their ideas past as the laws in America they have to rely on activists jobs just to do it\nYou might miss it was Russia or your\nWell there's nothing new about it but particularly its in its relevance its power\nAnd it's important has been magnified in this current Kavanaugh fight and explains in one reason why why this is so important to them they are in their minds on the verge of losing the highest court in the land\nThere on the verge of losing the ability to have the highest court in the land a rubber stamp their policies if you go down and look at leftist issue by leftist issue\nThat these issues that have royals our culture turned our culture upside down you won't find any of them that have been passed into law by the elected representatives of the people except for Obamacare\nAbortion the American people haven't decided that that\nWas forced on the American people by a leftist activists judge and a majority on the Supreme Court\nAnd any other number of cultural issues which are designed to strike out at this white power structure that the left so despise isn't so hates\nThat they cannot beat they cannot win they cannot do this legislatively\nThey need\nActivist judges dominating courts in order for what they want to be forced on every ... this is the\nPoint what they believe in the idea\nIs they have must be forced on the rest of the bus if they are to happen\nThey\nCannot withstand legislative tests\nIt's the same reason why every Democrat president up to and including Obama never tells the truth about their agenda they would not win the presidency if they were honest about that which they intended to do\n\nIf Obama had been honest about the way Obamacare was going to end up and how much it was going to cost you and how much you deserve to pay for it because you've been getting a free ride all these years\nIf Obama had been anywhere near honest about that or what climate change was going to cost you anything he would have never been elected\nAnd no Democrat ever wouldn't be\nThey routinely soft sell what they really believe they do not come out an advocate socialism or communism in presidential campaigns they will do it as as a case of Alexandria or gift you could pass who's lunacy on display in a leftist district to New York is harmless\nBut you'll put her on a national ticket somewhere and she kills it\nWe have not lost this country and we have not lost that which can be traced directly back to our founding but the left once everybody to believe that that founding and everything traceable back to it is unjust unfair\nThat it is also racist and sexist and massage sticking all these other things that are despicable we must do away with it\nThey don't have the ability to to win any of these issues legislatively\nAre you left us you can get mad at me all you want out there but you cannot\nReview this every thing they want everything they have achieved\nOutside of Obamacare has been forced on the country the country has been bludgeon into accepting it\n\nThe country has been bludgeoned into looking the other way and if you don't look the other way and if you find it then what do they do they sue you\nThey tried to ruin you or they bully you or they harass you or what have you\nThis is not the behavior that does when things legislatively and yet the Democrats firmly believe that all of this is going to lead to this ... gathering blue wave and I don't care even today\nThere are links all over the Drudge Report where if you click on them you're

socialist communist agenda via the United States Congress they can do it in their state legislatures I give you places like California and so forth they haven't been able to do it nationwide\nHalf to

or in protest then what are we to do\nAnd here is the brilliant answer from Rebecca Traister\nAre me angry that it has to be white women before we take they started seriously or or I think it's an do we also acknowledge that we need to wake the white women and if their power their products willpower\nCan be useful in revealing the degree to which women are still oppressed then in fact is this

to and willing to address the issue do you think that this insurgency as you've described it which is this behavior but just that we've seen the last two weeks do you think that kind of behavior which was widely\nPublicized and Democrats loved it the media loved it they tried to make heros out of these people they didn't try to hold them back\nWhere they want to disrupt the Senate vote they disrupted the Senate vote when they wanted to get in the halls of the Senate Russell office building they did so they got an elevators they shouted these people now the Democrats have not once called out that activity they've never once told outside their side to stand down do you think\nThe American public watching that\nIs going to be turned off by it and want to vote against it or do you think the American public\nDoesn't care one way or the other end doesn't even really notice it [noise]\nI think it's largely going to be turned off but like you said they've they've completely changed their base now they've given up on the working blue collar class and they're now they're now trying their hand to see if they can somehow\nUm increase the numbers with women on these types of issues but I think largely the that the American people are going to be turned off and\nI I think it's all going to come down to a who who was able to get out get out the vote in a month but that had\nWell see my point twenty twenty let me okay this is my I don't think given what we've seen the last two weeks among people in the public who watched it I don't think the Republicans need to do when he got out the vote this one is that\nIn my saying and just world the Democrats just succeeded in getting Republican turnout larger than it's ever been for a mid term I Know I'm probably wrong about that but that's how I look at it that's how it ought to be and I'm the king of books titled the way things ought to be an automated people were outraged by then\nIt ought to be that people can't wait to punish this month just common for the way they have treated in this country the past two weeks alone the Republicans ought not have to spend the time getting out the vote based on this but I Know that's not the reality kinda frustrating to me but that's the case for\nDemocrats think they're going to have to turn out here that dwarfs anything the Republicans have to show up on election uh Democrats think the whole country is except they really\nDon't they know they don't have enough Americans to win legislative battles but they think that\nThey're going to be able to put together enough people to dwarf whatever Republican turnout there is\nAnd they've got new stories predicting that very thing so people are going to be reading it people going to be reading Republicans don't have a chance\nYou may replied\nNo I I agree and um I think they energy I think they energize the base and they did exactly what needed to be done and I think they have the issue that you were speaking of a month or so ago\nThat the the event had happened and what twenty nine days what if it happened\nA true yeah when I when I said the events that were going to shape the midterms hadn't happened uh thirty days ago I was exactly right and there are some people saying that this is going to be forgotten by the time the election comes around\nA lot of people I saw him on Fox they a lot of learning puns and

Bush was an illegitimate president and he didn't stop being a legitimate and they finally got his approval numbers down to the twenty\nSix years later\nIn the middle of his second term so we get the two thousand two and it's the first chance the Democrats have\nTo pay their country back to pay the Republicans back to pay Bush back and they are going to retake the house and they're going to retake the Senate and they're going to reopen the Florida recount and they're going to make sure that justice is finally done and the Al Gore being duly recognize as the legitimate winner of the presidency\nEven though Al Gore didn't want to be part of it by that time\nThey were feeling so up so shore so confident that when it came time for a memorial for their late great senator from Minnesota Paul Wellstone they totally blew up what was intended to be a memorial\nHonoring and celebrating the life of Wellstone it was about three weeks prior to the mid term elections in November of two thousand two\nThe Wellstone memorial was hijacked by activists Democrats and turned into a store Paul lyrical rally\nThe purpose of which was to destroy George W. Bush and Republicans in memory of Paul Wellstone Republican senators who are friends of Wellstone who's doing if we showed up at the arena\nThey did this arena in a place that whole Fifteen thousand people with my memory serves ten Fifteen thousand people\nIt was some time after a while most of them died in a plane crash and it was some time after that but this was the official Mario and it was I don't think it was ever intended to be in a memorial I think it was a political event from the get go disguised as a memorial\nAnyway Republican senator is not knowing up from down at night Trent Lott in the boys all showed up thinking that they were showing up to a memorial\nA religious memorial to honor their form and colleague Paul Wellstone\nThey worm food and bullied and harassed out of the place within thirty minutes of having a rival didn't sat down\nIt was identical to what we saw the way Jeff Flake and others were assaulted in elevators animal hallways of the Senate office building\nExcept this was after memorial and this was a Democrat voters going up to the where the Republicans were seated in getting in their faces and pointing fingers Adam and Boeing after they thought they were there\nTo participate in a solemn occasion they got up and they walked out and they left\nAnd this memorial turned into a hate fast a hate fast aimed at George W ... a hate fast aimed at George W Bush's policies they couldn't even set aside what had happened on nine eleven for this memorial\nThis Morial took place about fourteen months after nine eleven\nTook place so then the men terms a curve\nI remember I was invited to the last time this happened I was invited for election night coverage on NBC Tim Russert asked me to join him and Tom Brokaw I Do to fully accepted and I went\nAnd I was not on camera all night maybe\nFour or five times while they they cycles other people through and they brought me and after it was clear that the Republicans hadn't gained ... seats on heard of\nThe Democrats just like now we're supposed to win big\nBecause Democrats told everybody hated Bush everybody resented the wave of Supreme Court stole only election for Bush\nThat Al Gore had won the popular vote just reached and the the American people felt betrayed by Bush and the Supreme Court and nine eleven and Bush's general stupidity and competence\nAnd as such couldn't not wait for the Democrats didn't take back control of what is rightfully theirs Washington DC\nExcept it didn't happen the Republicans gained ... seats\nTim Russert was great broke all brought me outside and so what do you think happened here I said\nThe Wellstone memorial but Wellstone memorial is what happened and I went on and told them why in a truncated version of what I just said they knew they were shell shocked\nThey were shell shocked is just not in the formula the party in power does not pick up seats\nIn mid term elections is the first ones after a new president is elected so that's a formative experience for me and if it's I like ... if this happened once it can happen again\nSomething it hasn't happened before probably won't happen buddy has\nThen it can happen again and this is a replay of that\nExcept this is a replay of even more outrageous behavior the will still memorial took place on one night the Democrat Party has been insane on display four to four years\nAnd ...

Kevin had failed because then the base wouldn't be so mad so ticked off they don't come out to vote in November\n... that's the money question and I just found myself today that the Democrats Kavanaugh's is worth a lot more alive and dead this is not going to go away they're not going to stop doing stories on Kavanaugh they can you know they got to keep them front and center he's not going to go away in ... defeated him\nThey would have just picked someone equally is right wing his cabinet and then a random through in a in a lame duck session and I think today's resolve is probably as good as you can help all Kavanaugh is going to be an issue and then two thousand Eighteen is going to be an issue in Coney Coney the Democrats are going to keep digging up stuff the press is not going to stop all of the things that they're working on a bike have enough well\nIt sure sounds to me like there was a coordinated effort to continue destroying Kavanaugh", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "08"}
