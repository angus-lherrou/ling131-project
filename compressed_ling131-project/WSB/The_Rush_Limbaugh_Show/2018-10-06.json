X. and then that a passive\nA fund on that side and then you should be good for the international position depends on how conservative moderate aggressive that you are\nOr maybe start somewhere around

Scott thanks for calling fire away what's your question\nSo I worked at a company for Twenty years and I've got a four one K. still was a it it's through fertility and it's about four hundred thousand dollars and a lot of that is tied up in that particular company stock\nI Would like to bring that from Fidel on my current\nUh but somebody mentioned something about the ... because of the stock and movie that I don't quite understand\nThat Scott there should not be a penalty but you probably won't be able to transfer the stock from your old employer to your new employer\nSo I don't want to have this years I'd like to sell off this year okay pretty good price right now so I Would like to take the lump song yup but I'm not sure so first of all there's no penalty then what would you suggest I go to what that four thousand\nSo let's talk location first you can sell the stock take that four hundred grand from the old plan then move it to the new four one K. or you could move that money into something called a roll over IRA with both of those you know we're just dealing with account type\nNow regarding asset allocation\nAnd that's just the investments that you're going to buy with the money right stocks bonds cash\nWithin the roll over IRA you openness on an open platform like swab and you know theoretically the sky's the limit thousands of stocks bonds mutual funds ... all at your disposal but if you moved the money into your new for all and K plan\nYou'll likely see a much more limited selection of funds or institutional holdings\nThe thing is some plans give you access to a lot\nBut others you only see a handful of investment options\nGreat thank you so much All right man have a good weekend you're too\nWhen you think about it you know folks who change jobs pretty often it's so easy to lose track of old for a one caves and I'm guessing that there is a pretty good number of Americans that have for a one case that are not being attended\n... it's a common situation and it could end up being a huge issue for investors down the road if you can relate if you could use some help simplifying a consolidating investing your savings get over to investing sense dot com start talking with our local team\nSo let's go back to Scott's situation and talk about holding the large position in the stock of the company that you work for within a four O. one K. says get us through those considerations\nWhen my clients hold large positions in their employer stock it's usually a pretty emotional situation yes it's normal yes it's a human reaction but I see this attachment to the stock like they do not see with any other holding\nThese emotions can sometimes make it kind of difficult to objectively analyzed the risk and the risk has to do with holding a highly concentrated position in one lone stock or even more and ... and really importantly you've got to take into account where you are in life\nDo you really want to risk most of your retirement success on the performance an outcome success or failure of one lone investment there's just a huge risk here in the situation\nWell and I can hear some people asking well wait a second the risk and holding a concentrated position in stock and go both ways there's the potential for a high reward or return but they just like you mentioned there is also the potential for big big risk\nOh yeah and you know here's two examples let's say you work for Apple you hold a large position in a P L in your four one K. it's done great over the last few years and you've been rewarded for taking that risk\nBut now consider two former American blue chip stocks got General Electric and Sears won a famous industrial giants or the other one of the most iconic retail brains in this country if you worked at either of these companies and all you own was concentrated position in that company stock\nThe risk is that you would not have been able to retire because of all you own was GE or essay Jody you probably would have lost a ton of money in your four one\nK. and by the way the broader stock market has been in a bull market for more than nine years and that means an index fund would have been a much better place than either of these two stocks over that same period of time\nOr lighting your money on fire would have been a much better kind of outcome you know worst case scenario is that your stock goes to zero\nAnd even though this doesn't happen very often it can happen I mean remember names like ... or WorldCom Enron these companies had employees who held lots of company stock and for one case they loved it when the stock went up but what do you think happened\nWhen it did yeah it just went down to zero\nZero okay and the only defense against\nCompanies specific risk is diversification and we build this into all of our clients personalized plans if you could use some help get some help get over to investing sense dot com and and start talking with our local team\nWell that brings us to this week's portfolio review and a quick reminder please consult with an advisor before acting on anything that we discuss and you can find a local advisor in your area by going to investing sense dot com now in future shows if he would like to have Andy review your portfolio here during the show\nAsk Andy at investing sense dot com is the email right portfolio review in the subject line but it's pretty easy ask any at investing sense dot com\nSo Jackie set us for portfolio last week and she writes I have a question regarding bond funds and CDs\nWhich is better at this point bond funds seemed destined to lose value in a rising interest rate environment individual bonds pay the state of interest rate it helps the majority but Kerry default risk CDs pay the stated rate it held the maturity and our FDIC insured\nSo this is where the conversation started with Jackie but I wanted to dig a little bit deeper so I ask more about the overall situation because look planning an income stream and retirement is difficult enough to begin with but now\nYou got rates where they are where they could be later on the market in the environment or going to get even more difficult and Bob you have you ever Jackie's replied\nDo she wrote back and I'm retired sixty seven have a pension and drawing Social Security my spouse is also retired and draws Social Security combined we have about a hundred thousand dollars in annual income from those sources and saving a portion so we don't eat into our savings\nYeah right there okay it's a key point that I Want to you know for those kind of you know the focus on here they are still saving a portion of their retirement income stream\nNow I'm going to circle back to that in the second Jackie may not have realized it but she revealed to me of a little bit of risk aversion by mentioning these CDs\nRight does a rate hike now and do continued rate hikes through the rest of the year the water the politics of that especially here in a in a midterm election cycle and I think\nWhatever politics are are done uh there's not going to be I think there's not another meeting until after the terms okay ... maybe just a day or two before but uh I think the fed has made it clear that they're only going to rate hikes at alternating meeting okay\nI'm\nEven if they surprised by doing a rate hike just before the terms a ...\nAnd then even if that rate hike was a mistake that slow the economy right there's no way that it would have the slightest pick on anybody or anything for months and so the idea that that would make anybody\nYou know less satisfied with Republican leadership I'm In for a vote or you know that kind of narrative there are many different narrative a\nIt is just absurd it's just that whatever affect the federal to have it it's gonna habits are they habits so if it's going to the election it already has\nWell let's talk about midterms I mean you have you've gone out there and said that you know mid terms are basically a referendum on whether America is glad I got what I Want to talk about that talk about how you are looking at the at the midterms right now and what you're tracking versus maybe what we see you know in in in other in other outlets\nUm typically in the terms and you can go back\nMany many many many years and look at the historical record others it's quite clear it seems that with the economy is strong or weak whether the president was popular or unpopular what tends to happen\nIs whatever party does not control the White House makes big gains in the house is okay\nAnd that appears to be a pattern that is just part of the American soul and or maybe it's part of the human soul except the American system so little unique but the\nSo we see it here but for most people politics is like the Olympics were were you get interested in sports once every four years right or at least you get interested in things like gymnastics once every [laughter] so the uh\nThe people who will get interested in it just two years later yeah or the people who are really angry about the way it turned out two years ago okay and this time around is immigrants four years ago it was a Republican\nYou know one of the things that that were asked a lot about is what we're kind of seeing what we are tracking um especially on the trade side you know as the as the U.S China story kind of continues to move forward or in some\nRespects metastasize as we see the additional tariffs um you know they they've taken effect after their announcement\nAfter promises of you know the Chinese retaliation and you and I talked about this in the past in terms of then kind of coming out and saying you know we're not going to devalue\nWhat happened right after the recent move or the the recent announcement on the tariffs I especially as it relates to us equities in Chinese equities ... you know you were tracking nap but what happened after\nThis announcement or a question because what's been happening all during this trade war which really started march is us stocks of basically crawled straight straight up and Chinese stocks of crawled straight straight down there the downright bear market\nAnd their currencies done the same thing so if you're a non Chinese investor who had to buy the Chinese currency to buy Chinese stocked you got hit both ways on the stocks and the currency like some sort of thirty five percent\nThis year [noise] so what happened after sort of the worst of all tariff\nAnnounces came out a week ago if the u._s. stock market went up the Chinese stock market went up twice as much so that wasn't supposed\nTo have [laughter] yeah\nI'm One of the things that was driving the sink or early conclusion\nWas the financial pressure being put on the Chinese by their stock market by their currency market by their bond market and all of which are in great distress and we're sending a useful signal to the Chinese that as painful as it is going to be for you to capitulate to Trump it's even more painful due to have your economy imploded have\nWhat would really be the first over recession it in in China as a modern economy\nThat was Don ... he's the chief investment officer at

this a good time to start\nKind of doing maintenance yeah\nAbsolutely absolutely so I'm new things are going in um that kind of gets back into another benefit of the fall but a lotta we're not a lot but most of the planetary you're getting from the growers this time of year is really nice material\nIn the summertime sometimes material can be stressed right have a heat and it's just they're they're trying to do the things we're only walk\nInto the nurseries and I'm like this plant looks sick\nIt does so you're getting really read bus plant material um you're able to dig most your trees this time of year than they usually are going to be part of a landscape design so ah everything that's going in is really in good shape and that's against another benefit\nAs we get into the maintenance aspect of it were preparing for many many things obviously right now I'm ... over seeding of turf grass is a big deal OK okay so we're doing all the prep work on that and making sure that that's what happens\nIf you just said and you don't ... what's the purpose of air rating\nYes so air writing is going to do is going to take away from the complexion of the soil okay so you're pulling those plugs out\nAnd you're able to come back in and put your seat down the seat will be on the top layer of the soil there also fall down into those air ration corps and then at the same time when you're doing that you're putting down a starter fertilizer uh in in at the same time but you're also opening up that critical root zone to oxygen\nAnd a air show it allows thanks to germinate better\nOkay 'cause I always feel like my lawn looks terrible after the air ration\nYeah the plugs um don't look gray but they're definitely a necessary thing to do for the for the seating process\nOkay folks that something's going on with your lawn and we have we have a big things to talk about that\nGive us a call for oh four eight seven to zero seven fifty that's for oh four eight seven to zero seven fifty okay there's something that's been going on in lawns that is huge and Francis we're going to get to you in just a moment so hang on\nGrabs an army worms and I've never heard of army worms in my life that you said that were really having a problem in Atlanta with this and it's killing lawns and a matter of days\nIt certainly is and with us you know many many calls are coming in on a daily basis from from clients of ours are like hey what's going on with my turf grass\nA matter of fact I had a one of my friends um who's not a gift quiet but he actually called me the other day and it's like Hey Peter which one of my law it looked beautiful like three days ago\nAnd a bill had called me and he had on my lawn is basically dead I tried to water it and I'm like okay well we're\nDoing everything right you're yeah honoring your fertilizing you're doing everything and it just\n... it does so I said hey what you need to do is go out to that law and take a shovel and just scrape off some of the top level of the grass you get down to the soul level\nAnd if you see anything calling me back say ten minutes later calls you back and says hey I see all these white worms down in here and I'm like well there's your grubs and they've attacked your lawn so you're going to need to do a turf insecticide treatment to get rid of him\nBut then again your lawn is already dead yeah\nSo they they can move quickly army worms make much much quicker than grubs ... uh but again with the army worms and the reason I call them army worms I kind of moving away like an army would okay and then also they have like a green and black color town so it's like an army camouflage\nSergeant way origin leads them through but the uh the damage those guys can do is really fast and they can eradicate a whole lawn within a day or so\nOkay well obviously what we need to do here is prevention is there a way to to take care of the army worms before they get started\nYeah blend of the best thing to do is hit it with a preventative and I'll go with that early in the season and that'll help I mean it's not a hundred percent but it's going to help a tremendous amount of keeping them out and then a less damage butter\nOkay say just call a gives landscaping our their local landscaper intel on what's it called\nYes said the ... the the products out there um if you do have um a landscaping service you're working with you know hopefully they're going to see it and you can talk about giving a treatment\nOr the products that the landscape services are going to use it can be more of your commercial products that are going to be available ... if it is a homeowner what you need to do is go to a one year lows your home depot and look for a lawn insecticide OK okay you're going to see those in there you can talk to someone in their can help yeah and you need to do an application of that\nOkay sounds great let's go to the phone lines guys and speak with dance and Lawrence vale vents here on WSBIU how are you today\nBond bearing well doing well how can we help you\nI've got a question are put ... around about probably I'm a veteran too close together\nProbably Twenty years ago everybody has\nAwarded proud history click well now don't add um they're thirty foot so I'm a real wide or died at the bottom the lives of going out so far to try and get a law that now I can see my neighbors for a five foot down\nIs or anything I can do what they did pretty well ... so the bottom ... rose um what do I need to do\n... thanks for the call what do I told you say those labels were now\nAs tall as I can get I Would say that they are thirty ...\nOkay yeah they got there okay they've got that disease the\n... which is the type of kink are in really all you can do is turn that dial back out and then you can inject those were the different types of fungicides growth hormones and fertilizers to help 'em but you know a lot of people are pruning out the bottom and then adding some plants at the base and that kind of thinking\nI don't want to see my neighbors okay or you could do a a nice is a real good one ... corpus was another good one to put underneath and then they'll scream and the neighbor all from the bottom so I'd recommend that for sure\nOkay ...\nYeah a nice and there's a ... corpus was another good one a nice it was like a little better though in that situation a little bit better for the water you know it's drought tolerance for sure [noise]\nOkay ...\nOkay I was just like adults are so bushy mid level right start getting enough sun ... they're just a late in the lives or without the product is they put it out right away I was just all about it so yeah and the standards of the other day which was written\nYeah I Would we do a lot of those injections we do it a Gibbs I mean I you know companies do with injections are really good and keep the water to um I mean don't over water on but definitely want to keep the plants healthy and they will live longer eventually they're going to unfortunately I think they're going to go but you've got some time if you take care of them\nAll right okay it'll lead they or the next go thank you\nOkay ... thanks for your call a dance and that's one of the problems with planting nearly ... a little too close to each other wanting the media gratification of having screening to your neighbors\nAbsolutely it it happens all the time is probably one of the most common things I see when I'm Out of his name was clients are seeing people that had that situation\nSo that that always gets back to the most crucial thing is anytime you're doing a project like that or make sure that you hire company that has really good landscape architect on staff so they select the right material for you and they space it correctly so therefore you do at one time versus having to go back and redo thanks\nExcellent you're listening to Atlanta living only on news ... am seven fifty ws the
