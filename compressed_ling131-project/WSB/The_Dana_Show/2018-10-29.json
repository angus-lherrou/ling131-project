any gee why and [laughter]\nShe has to go find me a ...\nSo uh uh there's a lot of levels here and I when George George says I Want to get to 'cause you're not going to need that ten dollars baggage because\nHere's the deal this is the way that I look at this or that blackface is not the reason she's losing his job and it's it's the best excuse the people upstairs and that'd be see could not believe they've been handed this gift in twenty Eighteen\nBecause this show wasn't working and also I have to say also that she you have to remember on a show that was failing decided to go all the way to the wall in her Matt Lauer sexual harassment\nCoverage and her today slot and so they didn't like her ah the ratings were terrible space either for sixty\nTwo million dollars now wait let me break in here really quickly ... everyone everyone on my show love the show yes I Do believe that people were watching I think everyone was watching my daughter hated it [laughter]\nShe's on a job yeah your daughter is on the today show she hated it\nGeneral attacks me every day man Macintosh dumbest rocks [laughter]\n\nIt was never a good it was not a good citing NBC did this thing and this happens in media lived it happens\nIn radio a lot uh off the heels of her you know Donald Trump stuff at the first\nDebate where she brought up his opposing massage to me and then he said she was bleeding from all over everywhere\nAnd that whole thing is there's people in media just go oh look she's hot she's in the News Let's give her sixty two million dollars to bring her over here but the fact of the matter was she was never going to work at NBC she she's not officially fired yet\n... and she had she had more much more money than at sixty nine\nMillion dollar you know some sort of sexual thing\n[laughter]\nI don't know what President Trump\nWorks for the sixty died no you what do you like Trump it didn't work out with Megan Kelly\nThat guy tried to help through and she doesn't wanna when she took the easy way out to the big they get ... back when I was reading and maybe she'd be where ... is right now [laughter]\nLaurie I tell you I Would rather look at making guaranteed in the Arab ally glory or that any good at\nSo Laura anger but still has a show and backing Kelly doesn't well we'll talk to Georgia about later I my understanding is she requested that Ronan Farrow being her meeting with NBC today because I think she's going to try to throw in some sort of\nThere's some truth there I think that the that her coverage of the sexual harassment NBC's stuff is really the reason but she's being fired along with the fact that nobody was watching her show but we'll get to that little bit later another headlines\nOr Georgia Democrat officials claim that more than four thousand seven hundred applications to vote by mail are missing in DeKalb County yeah who cares\nBut if if the case of a ... there's two different sites you get the New York times saying that this is true yeah and you also have a sea of film that who's the chairman of the cab county saying\nNot true at all well so who do you believe\nI this is what I Believe I get so confused\nBy all the because this is a different story than the one with the judge correct saying that you have to count every but you can't remove people from the rolls because their signatures don't match and\nIt's just the Democrats issue they're going to keep their gonna keep pounding this until they until they get their way\nYeah but the only problem is this is my experience in the United states of America it ain't that difficult\nThe votes it's not that difficult to vote if I've got to go pick you up hold your hand help you if there's a whole process teach you what you need to do\nWe're better off if you don't vote that's what I think\n[laughter]\nYou know what I Would take ten minutes of my life and learn how to vote it's not that difficult where did you got to go what are you going to do\nAnd are now the the part with the judge now I hear the ... campaign is going to appeal that yes I'm not exactly sure that I understand why um if they just moved him into provisional ballots and then count them later it might be the easiest thing in the world because if you have\nIf point five percent of the ballots cast were professional and the winner wins by two percent you don't matter it's just a matter of ... record keeping to go back go back and count that stuff you may not even need them so I the thing with the with the judge saying that they couldn't\nDo what they wanted to do on scrubbing people from the rolls I don't mind that part so much this forty seven hundred\nHow were they lost how are they supposedly last but didn't get the people who are obese absentee ballot so they I I'm not quite understanding\nWhy I think the New York times is honing in on the fact that DeKalb County is voted blue for several years and if the memory seven hundred voters could sway that county so that's why that's why the New York times is honing in on it now the Georgia hold on going on it and I am just become a national election I Know you've been raised here in Georgia you\nKnow the reason is because there's the whole narrative being started nationally that you know Georgia is a southern state full of groups and they're all racist and of course we know with Georgia what they're trying to do it's really kind of like it's reverse prejudice\nOr the eye on the national scale on the local scale this forty seven hundred of these things by them make sure that they're counted all of that absolutely but the narrative is going on nationally about the state of Georgia is is is a different kind of prejudice but most people don't live in Georgia in this country most people don't live in the south\nSo it's very easy to can you tell a story about the south but I'll tell you look there's racism unfortunately there's racism in this world and there's less of it now than there used to\nBe but they're still racism in the world but I'm a I was born a Yankee sorry they'll come after me I was I was born a Yankee and I can tell you in my experience there's less racism in the state of Georgia then the state of New York where I come from that's the true narrative [noise]\n\n\n\n\nWe know that everyone has their own taste and jewelry especially when it comes to engagement rings\nThat is why shank
