people that said they anybody talking about\nWe're trying but that's the way that ISIS doing and now ISIS getting a lot of blowback in these democratic states because they're doing their job\nGoing back to what they want to do\nAnd that's part of the problem with the illegals here they come and they get their bodies illegally and they don't report back because a lot of\nThem are from countries that we're talking about\n[noise] uh you know a lot are a lot of nobody's talking about [noise]\nListen birther we got to attack this thing after the midterms we have to attack it I'm so tired of people playing politics with border security\nAnd now to hear what you've been hearing the last few days we found all these Democrats talking like Republicans five or six years ago and they just flip the issue because they feel as though in many cases they will be able to get Hispanic votes if they're the ones who legalize them rather than have caught on tape\nSaying we have to put a border barrier and senator Schumer's case and Hillary Clinton's case aboard a barrier to keep them out\nThey've totally flip the script on it and it just hurts us\n[noise]\nExperts to birth was supposed to pick up I read all these illegals or that's part of the problem part of the problem right now is the illegals that are here when ice goes to scoop 'em up now they're getting blowback and places like Seattle in places like Illinois\nPlaces like Minnesota in many cases so I think that's pretty terrible or the president spoke last night about the care of and he's obsessed evidently they had a meeting late last night\nA night late last night but you late last they afternoon just about different tactics they could take to stop this caravan before it gets here Alex for error who's you know judge Alex on television he worked for the for the ... circuit court judge and obviously Hispanic descent he says is\nThat we're really not sure really not sure what we can do at the border cut forty five\nThe problem is what leads to beyond that because they've ... let's say a wave of seven thousand or four thousand immigrants make it to the U.S border and Russia are crossed there is no I don't see how they're stopped there but what it does\nLeaves the impression to other countries other people that that's the way to get into the U.S\nAnd that's the problem it's the message sent that's was another track carbon building behind and you know the White House has said that we believe it's Venezuela paying in Nicaragua to go out and go marching create havoc on the border some safe to embarrass the ah American friendly Honduras government regardless\nOf Venezuela who has no money is using money to pay people to leave their border countries and come to America can you imagine that more from Alex for forty six\nI actually think that if these immigrants were able to make it to the U.S by election day it was it would actually benefit Trump because I think that\nThat and videos of people just rushing across the border and overwhelming to border patrol I Can't imagine anything that would be a better argument for the wall that he wants so badly and I think there'll be a lot of people who trains don't you are saying on immigration if that were to happen\nAnd that's why Democrats are laying out they're not saying the president's being mean because they know the American people are concerned about border security and they're not anti Hispanic keep in mind if we're talking Wednesday after election day about the house\nAt the house being in Republican hands still it's got to be because the panic vote the Democrats are under the impression when this president went down those dead escalator that they forever would and got the nomination and added what many people thought was a negative Hispanic stance always talking about his building the wall for security but they interpreted that way\nThat they would have the span of vote for the first ... future he got more Hispanic votes then Romney got and McCain got and I don't see going that way they say a lot of Hispanics that are here legally and there are so many diversions rub it right now central south Americans didn't like Trump\nAnd like the tone and are proud of the fact that they got here they're legal\nThey paid the money they learn the language they pass the test and they belong here there's one reporter wanting to bring to light and I went to prison to get this message the New York times reporting that China and Russia are listening to the president's calls 'cause he insist on using his

at a also this a monitor to have a couple of other 'cause I was looking at some of the X ray images that they all had of it [noise]\nI have to say\nI was kinda flabbergasted yesterday\nWhen I saw the statement that was released by CNN president Jeff Zucker that has to do with that was in response to the bombings\nI just um was really genuinely shocked\nThe statement that he released and that CNN put out on their official PR channel\nReads as us quote there is a total and complete lack of understanding that the White House about the seriousness of their continued attacks on the media the president and especially the White House press secretary should understand their words matter this far they have shown no comprehension of that\nReally what what what what by the way this\nHe comes out and make this statement\n\nFor news organization before any any other details are known while an investigation is ongoing and he immediately purports it's related it's specifically do\n\nBecause of the president\n\nI've never seen it isn't that kind of the opposite of news to make grandiose associations with zero evidence to support set association\nOne candidates bananas you and\nI and the fact that he came out with that I thought this is exactly\nWhat we're talking about when people criticize the media this is exactly why people say what they say when they discuss the media\n\nAnd I want to get into a little bit of that because there were some really rich ironies that took place yesterday and ended up taking place this morning as well\n\nJust I mean I I just can't um it's kind of amazing to me that's the opposite of news and I said on Fox and friends this morning look\nI didn't go out the day after James Hodgkinson\nShot up a ball field screaming about health care trying to assassinate Republican lawmakers and she was very nearly successful\n\nWhat could have easily have said look at this look at his Facebook page people\nLook at all the the all the like city has look at the networks that he likes to look at the region media matters he reads all these things he reads he watches cable news he does he he worked for Bernie Sanders\nAnd in fact\nRecall any one of influence on the right St anything remotely close to that\n\nWhich is why I Am just flabbergasted that Jeff Zucker can say what he said in this statement would know anything to support his association\n\nI didn't go out and say all the rice and that was going to all these Republicans that well there you go Democrat I didn't go out and say the the destruction of all these Republican offices there you go Democrats didn't go out and say oh my gosh look at all these assaults and everything else that are happening in the streets look at it cetera et cetera there you go Democrats\nLook at the college campuses that we're burning look at the look at the lawmakers that are being hunted down and and some assaulted some are being docked there you go Democrats\n\nI ... and
