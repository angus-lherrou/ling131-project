Jay Black uh obviously we're going to win this thing right we have nothing to worry about this is going to be a cakewalk against van de tomorrow night right yes it should be what's the line twenty seven okay we'd have now last\nWeek we won soundly but I guess didn't cover the the line I did not cover the thirty one point spread and now people are taught to get any I don't know there's some people I'm seeing on this sports network a very famous sports network as that are beginning yeah beginning to wonder whether or not Georgia\nIs actually going to make it into the playoffs if Ohio State runs the table in Oklahoma runs the table and a and there was a feeling that maybe Georgia did not win as soundly last week as they should have\nWell you know and everybody's contracted ESPN there's two pages\nAmong the fifty ... let's say we have to create scenarios for the college football playoff no matter when where or what yeah because they they they're the ones that put on the show yes so you must create the drama to lead up to the show\nWhich is you know good broadcasting in in in a good business so I get that I I think that they are you all for Georgia we'll all get settled on the street Auburn LSU you beat those guys\nBeating Tennessee by twenty eight instead of thirty one is not going to\nBe and I now my guess here is that a coach Kirby Smart as being very politically correct and telling us what a tough team these uh these kids from bay and he's very worried about the quarterback\nCounty has a tremendous receiving corps he's very intelligent\nHe understands the system he plays in he's able to know what coverage or in a really good quarterback that understands the game and one of the many in the SEC now that are growing up really bright you know when you you mess up sometimes quarterbacks miss it he doesn't miss it and you can throw the ball anywhere in the field\nAnd there's no defense to trim you mean he has a thing or is this a lot of challenges horse\nThat's what I call political politically correct PC coach smart we're lucky enough to have non PC outsmart who's going to tell us how he really feels about the van de quarterback\nBen quarterbacks going to be hit a lot I think he's a terrible pastor I think she's going to hit hit his routes and our quarterbacks and inside is you're going to take a take 'em down his name ...\nThe son of a former Brown's coach\nYeah but that no matter how he still thinks no way\nAround stinks so you know by the friends of property that is true the browns are terrible even Nick Chubb who who I
