here's why\nI think that these are people who said that they want stability but they don't they don't want stability and I think Hillary Clinton was incredibly honest when she said the other day that they're not interested in civility unless they're in power\nWe can be civil when we're in power I mean that's what she said I'm not parsing her words I'm not spending anything out of contacts with the people who want to watch their butts instead of removed their heads and listen I'm specifically quoting what she said that is exactly what she was talking about\nShe was specifically stating that unless they're in power then there'll be civil I really honestly feel like a lot of people on the left I think there's a difference between liberals and progressive\nAnd I think they're both on the left but there's a difference between liberals and there's a difference between progressive kind of like there's a difference between Republicans and there's a difference between conservatives but the right it's so United Right now because liberals honestly I don't think that they're being loud enough\nI mean match me during the primary I caught holy hell because I Will be consistent and I do not

interested in politics I think they're just ignorant like mean ignorant not like uneducated but they are that also and then you have liberals that are too terrified to condemn it\nAnd because\nThere are these people ... the progressive or they're shocked troops to people that you see on the street those people are the shock troops they do this every damn election it to get out the vote apparatus honestly\nWith yourself who was going to get all excited it'd be like yeah I Want to put a yard sign in my yard Joe schmo were Yuri's for higher taxes in fewer jobs do you wish to ship our manufacturing overseas he sounds like\nWhat\nIs your journey my yard\nDoes that really get that that does that Russia you're ... you're going to know people get excited over that Democrats want you to

well that guy he wants to make you slave that they say they go out there and say this crap\nThey just want you to hate their opponent because they think that they could get you to hate your their opponent it's the same thing is you're getting excited about their policies right\nSo they have their shock troops out there progressive they have shock troops out there and that's what they do they just they want to get you all excited about hating their opponent so they go yeah exactly I mean how do you sit here and run against good economic news how does that happen like guys we are against

I'm like how the hell is that a felony and I went in and started looking at the um so and so anyway you own a small business you're importing fish is safe to seafood restaurant", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Dana Show", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "12"}
