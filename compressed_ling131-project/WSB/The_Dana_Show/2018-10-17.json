I'm now on every weekday nights noon right here on WSBIU [noise]\n\n\nDaniel Philbrick is a is in for just a few more minutes to talk about his brand new book in the hurricanes either genius of George Washington and the victory at Yorktown\nAnd or the Daniel I Want to talk about the big war and history\nThat we're both witnessing but I Do want to do ... and even though the battle Yorktown happens we keep fighting and you said a dig Raasch who was the hero in Yorktown gets humiliated at the end you used the French resort the French libraries in order to get more ah more information that's\nYeah I mean it's it's really the unknown story we think of the grass is a great hero but in France the he's anything but because just a few months later in the Caribbean\nHe suffers a absolutely devastating and humiliating defeat to the British or admiral Rodney like that's what's known as the battle of the saints when Washington or got word of this he thought oh my God you know the victory we had at Yorktown is not for nothing now because the British are going to come roaring back\nThey didn't because a popular sentiment back in England had had was had swayed against the war but just shows you you know Washington never had a sense of I've done it because he was always in the balance\nRight you never had a great moment so ah the guy I knew a couple of things you or care about American history how do you view with this whole nearly during the national anthem how do you think our founding fathers would do it\nYou know I think it's dangerous to say what would they do today um I you know I I think you know a sense of reverence for the country was absolutely important back then\nAnd things times change you know I I I'm you know I I I'm sympathetic to all sides in this I really think the important thing is people express patriotism in their own way and\nYou know ... it's it's and so I'm I'm sort of one of those people whatever you do as long as you have America's Best interests at heart\nIt's okay by me right or did you think kids you stand for the national anthem excuse me you think kids should stand for a while she's made the pledge of allegiance\nI yeah I mean I did at school or you know but I remember also being in the midst of the Vietnam War and being very very you know not sure what was going on and you know I think it's an individual act I mean that's the thing we are or you know individual freedom is essential to who we are\nAnd I think the important thing in America and what's unique about us is that we do allow people to express themselves as an individual there's gotta be some things that collectively we agree on don't absolutely and that's you know that's what was Washington's great theme after the revolution and once he became president it's the union\nThat's what ... that's the only thing we can look at and um and I absolutely agree we have to have things we agree upon in terms of you know why do people come to this country because there's a lot right in this country and I think if you start taking it apart to the point that you know ... we ended up being a group of\nUh you know angry or sex ... screaming at each other is destroying America\nIt's a lack of appreciation too of what we have and I'm much better it is even worse day we're still a destination right\nAnd you know we're never going to be perfect but that's the genius of America um we we we mess up but then eventually always too late we begin to figure it out and I think they are very few societies that have done that consistently all the time\nHow do you feel about this war in our history and William and Mary they're talking about moving Jefferson statue where he went to college or add Robert de leave statue on the in Charlottesville at the University of Virginia uh where do you stand\nWell you know I I I I stand once again I think it's up to the institution where these are I mean I think it's a tragedy that we lose touch with what this country was about even if we don't agree with what this country was about because I think ... things like statues\nOr one of the more forceful ways of saying you know this is the way it was in this soon as we ... your wallpaper the past with\nA picture of what we want today we forget we where we came to uh where\nWere you it worries me because you ever seen an ad slaves which clearly we can't even get rapper head around it even wrestled with and his wife should Washington and Jefferson in Monroe everyone really except John Adams early on should they will be marginalized in history\nNo I don't think so because I mean you this is what we got to get to where America came from and ... this was a slave state in in many ways and we got to understand how we got from there to where we are now and to just\nTurn their back on the past and and uh lose all touch with it is just to lose the ability to learn from the past but what about\nConfederate statues should they be more true Jay be taken out once again I think it's an individual it's it's up to a community to figure it out I think they they should not be burned or destroyed I'd like you're a guy that they were put on a commission to come up with a policy like they're doing it in New York City yeah listen it's a tough one and I think the\nGreat fear of ... of of mine is that emotions in a moment we'll do something

Y. yeah\nDo you remember when we had the story of the sorority that had to end its taco Tuesday\nBecause they it was deemed offensive\nAs I was offensive taco Tuesday was offensive it was a sorority and I thought it was fun and they loved tacos and you know cetera but they were told that because they enjoyed tacos\nThat they were somehow ah being racist and so they had to end their taco Tuesday the sorority\nAs California State University Fullerton\n\nThey had to stop their taco Tuesday I think they said they said you're all the ... year old being racist\nSo the sorority says well look we've never ask people to wear costumes and you know some people were some bread and roses but it wasn't people love the food and they love the culture and that's the whole thing well then you had the whole world culture not a costume program\nAnd\nThey had to stop it so you can't do that your kids can't dress up as Pocahontas or princess T ana you can't have taco Tuesday you can't do anything like that but a white woman\nUp in Massachusetts can lie inappropriate and ethnicity and you all are supposed to look\nThe other way 'cause she got that Democrat white privilege and that's exactly what it is\nIt's just just crazy\n\nThat's that is I mean as I did have identity politics jumped the shark and I think that's the big question right now\nNo lives with one was on to it earlier and she says millions of people watched you real Donald Trump is you've fumbled and lied on your one million dollar\nPledge and then it took and then took a day for your handlers to tee up this recycled racist name\nA name calling you've lost a step okay yeah I don't think that you know what and I responded because I was like you're you're white or the most European Americans and you purposely changed how you identify your ethnicity is you can take advantage of diversified hiring is that isn't racist not racist nothing is\nSo you have now you have Cherokee Nation out there the spokesperson well that\nAnd secretary the Cherokee Nation secretary of state check Austin junior he got out there he didn't like what the president said he really didn't like what what Elizabeth Warren did he said it was inappropriate wrong you heard the soundbite he said it was ... this should not be doing this\nSo it should not be doing is they released a statement just slamming her they the statement that they as you said that uh\nThe great majority of her identifiable ancestry is European\nAnd she hit back at them she actually\nTrying to argue with literal actual Indians the statement that they really set a DNA test as useless to determine tribal citizenship\nCurrent DNA tests do not even distinguish whether a person the ancestors were indigenous to North or South America\nSovereign tribal nations set up their own legal requirements for citizenship\nAnd while DNA tests can be used to determine lineage such as paternity to an individual and it's not evidence for tribal affiliation using DNA tests to lay claim to any connection to Cherokee Nation or tribal nation even vaguely is inappropriate and wrong it makes a mockery out of DNA tests and it's a legitimate uses\nWhile also dishonor rain legitimate tribal governments and their citizens\nWhose ancestors are well documented and who's heritage is prove\nA Senator Warren is undermining tribal interests with our continued claims of tribal heritage\nI mean she's not plan or they're not playing with her\nSo they're saying no that's not going to work but when everyone else says that it's racism so it was a white woman going to call Cherokee Nation racist\nI'm waiting\nLike what do you do white liberals are white progressive because I think liberals and progressives are different what do I progressive do\nWhat do you guys do now\nWe have a lot more coming up including sassy Lindsey Graham I ... he says you know what I think I'm going to take a DNA test due to see if I got more Native American heritage and Elizabeth Warren does will discuss that will also get into how the media is be clowning itself\nBecause they are the media does in this and ran like they were the cavalry come into coming to protect her\nA and later on James that keep joined us at the bottom of the hour to discuss in Missouri Senator Claire McCaskill hidden agenda what does she actually stand for perhaps it something voters should know I don't
