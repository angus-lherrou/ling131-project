yes Greg or does is lackadaisical or he's not impressed by anything least least so himself\nA and a in the end yeah he's probably depressed although he's got a good psychologist I've known him for years he's doing better now with these issues than he ever has before but uh yeah you know he never wants you to think that he cares that's what it's all about ready to do miss\nMore headlines for friday October Nineteen [noise] [noise] well yeah you mentioned uh the rally last night that there has been Trump held in Montana and it was the word out there trying to beat Jon Tester I yes they are\nTrying to be the Democrat Jon Tester and yeah it's a funny moments I say obviously you talked about that care of the and the two have been to Central America all areas I'm but I'm not\n[laughter] so is it that way at any point there did he do this oh yeah he was what about this you know no no [laughter] All right it\nSounds like a bathroom hey hey ho ho Bonnie or\nWas it a where was he in Mali thing no [laughter] mostly in Montana ... because it sounds like a ... he said was he in Montana\nAnd it was the among\nYour you'd be the judge he says he's happy to be in that state\nOh [laughter] and I said I\nKnow that uh obviously you went after the easy stuff ... at the Elizabeth Warren stuff was big um he's he was talking about how the media gets upset with him for fighting back with them and they had some money\nRather than you explaining it how about we hear the actual price of the United states I used to say\nI have more Indian blood in me than she does that I have none\nI guess and I was right\nBut the only good thing she did I think he probably disqualify 'cause you've met a fool out of his stuff but I think the only good thing she did I Can't call her Pocahontas anymore

you believe is that is why the fake news\nAnd then he says obviously anybody ever seen Kevin Hart live yeah you see them ... I've seen is a Netflix shows is that that one movie where it looks like he's playing to a crowd of thirty thousand people or something or has a couple I've seen an idea of the two of them there's no way that he's better with the crowd than Trump\nTrump is the best comedians\nComedy in front of ... I don't know how people were there last night but there were thousands right yeah people are saying how people are saying it's the biggest crowd they ever saw [laughter] I it is difficult to do comedy in front of a huge crowd like that\nAnd I got to think that he does it better than really anybody any comedian working right now I'm Talking about a room with thousands of people in it\nSo it makes him the best touring comic in America\nNot to mention he's doing I like you like you've been saying for the last couple of days I mean he's doing he seemed like all of his PR all this proud he's being and he's been on I mean he's been on the trail I mean I Want to say for it you know hard core on the trail for the last three weeks he's eaten\nUp all the oxygen out there you know it's a and this is obviously his strategy going into the midterms there's no Sarah Huckabee Sanders she's done one press conference I think in ... there was those things were every day I think it's been three weeks since there's been one\nEvery time he walks out of the White House that little period before it gets on the helicopter he's talking\nHe's given interviews to every but he's given interviews to people that Fox News has been given shows yet he's been on every show on Fox News Fox Business but he's also done sixty minutes a pie a a a ... a ... I'm sure CBS ABC and NBC or right behind\nSo he obviously has a strategy that\nIf the Democrats going to be talking between now and the midterms they're going to be reacting to Trump\nOpposed to trying to put whatever their national uh plans are their policies will be if they take over the house you don't know until the election whether or not it works but that's obviously his strategy is everyone's going to be talking about Trump until we get to the mid\nTerm and at that point while the Democrats are attacking him he says he's not going to stand idly by while they do that\nWe find that we fight and win and we fight harder than anybody ever for and then they say\nIt's obstruction\n... if you fight back today it's called obstruction no no no we fight back or whatever that is why\nI think um I I think he got confused there\nNo one's called knowing he got confused there obstruction is what the Democrats are doing a on the hill\nTo him that's the ... I think words got mixed up there they don't call it absurd nobody says oh what do you fight back that's obstruction nobody's ever said that no no no no you know [laughter] is that right after he said hello Montana\nMontana and understand that and say hello to my little front\nNext story the me too founder uh Toronto Burke said it was a founder of me to apparently she is the hash tag me to founder and this Burke said it's tragic that Hillary Clinton denies or Bill Clinton for abusing his power what's the founders name again uh Toronto ...

team that that's the only sport that can play video games yeah exactly they're cutting in the barbershop and I'll get a haircut will do everything that watch the team loses\nA so I just want to know and I'll start why I'm assuming\nIn my mind I'm assuming it's going to be a Dodgers Red Sox world lives like that's going to be the case that this is the thing and you haven't been watching but uh when you watch a Dodgers game from Los Angeles\nOr Larry King has a seat that's right right to the left\nOr right up the catcher's\nShoulder and I always thought that it's not fair that opposing pitchers now if you pitch for the Dodgers are used to it you're staring at Larry king's aging face while you're you're pitching but if you're an opposing picture this is not something you're used to you can't tell me that it's not distracting\nTo seat Larry King rotting away in the front row [laughter]\nAs you try to pitch within suspenders you know of course he's only he's just say I think keeping his own [laughter] he's got like the ...\nI had that patch\nI think it's unfair but it's a it's disconcerting during though it will be you look for it it'll be disconcerting during the world series of Dodgers get there and he gave out of LA you'll be staring right at Larry King some day [laughter]\nLook at it if you've got to tell the opposing picture this is something you have to look don't let a surprise you don't let it you know what I Would do\nWith all my pictures once I found out I was going to be in the world series you had a couple of days maybe before your first game ... and certainly the first picture I Would force him to put a Larry King poster up on his wall in his room and stare at it as much as possible so it's not shocking and disconcerting when you hit the mound\nAnd you've got that mug staring at ya numb to it when you see it [laughter] don't mind you're on the air [laughter]\nMaybe this is [noise]\nIs that Dr him nailed down she got the open Mike Facebook messages and emails we collected ... works for a shutdown yeah arguing Archie Russian they write\nLike isn't isn't there some kind of controversy was all the smaller stuff isn't Russia Today part of that so many of the show there or something and uh and I looked at I saw Larry king's show is on Russia Today\nThey love me over there and you can't just hang it up Kenny\nHe's nine years Ninety to ... at what point do you have to stop working only positive jointly stopped working then you out here I think people like ah I I really think Larry King thing he's maybe he's right if I don't have to go to work tomorrow yeah it was to keep me from just a shuffled off this mortal coil give me some a mailbag stuff's\nHell yeah we have a full mailbag this week so you're ready for this well yeah of course some of them wouldn't be a very good All right when the right way well then let prepare ourself yet [noise]\nOh they are not right for the first one this guy is contradicting yesterday you mentioned the on\nFriending business and social media and how I think but I think he's disagreeing on at least yeah he's he's disagreeing with your ... who is the language Jerry yes he's disagreeing with you and your philosophy which you made a great point yesterday about that you said that it's not worth it to ... people over differences in ... no I don't think\nI think if people are just calling your name's that's one thing but I don't think\nI think we're we have too many people who are silo now you should hear people who disagree with you and you should be able to make your arguments against them and I think the reason that people an friend over politics is because they're afraid that they're not able to actually make a reasoned argument without calling names back\nAnd so and I think it's a good idea to have people around you who disagree with you no matter where you stand on the\nPolitical spend maybe this guy will persuade you otherwise probably not\nGoing to disagree with you on that friends say or\nTo be honest with you a stable either Hillary Clinton is innocent and I believe that that balls the forward lady was telling the truth and I think the Saudi
