Atlanta's most accurate and dependable for cash kinda got Jimmy ... ginger investigating two deadly officer involved shootings a\nAlthough I Do think it was weird it's weird to me because ... was ... alliance or associate with the Muslim Brotherhood\nAnd Saudi Arabia hates the Muslim Brotherhood and I remember in Egypt before the revolution Hillary Clinton was totally behind the Muslim Brotherhood and Muslim Brotherhood had been banned there for a long time 'cause they were extremist and\nThey didn't want anything to do with them and then when Hillary Clinton got involved and endorsed one of the guys that have been a little weird you know what I mean they got a little sketch\nSo she that was under the Obama administration they're completely just messing everything up I Will say this this administration is nothing like the previous and that the previous would have already been over there to try to do something to get behind you know ... in trying to really have some sort of effect\nA and get involved in metal and foreign policy that's why I think it's so hysterical some of the criticisms that I see on this administration because for crying out loud this administration back a dictator and Honduras\nLike they tried to really disrupt Honduran government and Honduran elections let's not forget about what they did in Libya let's not forget about what they did with Egypt and how they backed and previously banned Muslim Brotherhood creating all sorts of hell and contributing to that hot mess\nOr I could go to I mean in Syria I could go on and on and on so they have in terms of uh any kind of I mean it's sort of a joke that that the previous president received a Nobel Peace prize which was apparently as I understand it predicated on the fact that he got people from different countries to talk so big Whoopi at just due to our nobody cares\nBut look how many wars and she started and countries who you served in government to destabilized in the process oh and by the way when they could have went and got involved in something like Iran the green revolution they pretended that wasn't even happening as the Iranian National Guard was or\n[noise] excuse me revolutionary guard which was was shooting people from rooftops\nAnd they had more when Russia annexed Crimea so\nIt was just weird how it's almost like the people that\nThis balance of power had took away from up on the interest of the new administration it's almost like they're trying to get it flipped back\nSee there's a lot of stuff's going into this so and there's a lot more about the the ... situation and oh here's a guy who wrote for the Washington Post that was murdered possibly murder by Saudi operative a\nAnd there's a lot more politics and activism and all kinds of stuff there that's that's involved with it but the thing like I said that that I think is\nIs asinine is if this Saudi prince this\nA crown prince was really bothered by this guy the way that you don't do it is to be really public and do it in Turkey\nBecause turkey would love nothing more than to see Saudi Arabia screw up you definitely don't do it in a sample you definitely don't do it with people that are in your inner circle that are easily identifiable because they're seen with you whenever you travel including to the United states and within the United states it's just not the way you do it I'm not saying that there's a proper way to go and\nYou know assassinate someone because it's wrong but I'm saying if you're trying to be ... just about it that's the stupidest way to go about doing it\nI mean that's just the way it is [noise]\nBut at the same time you know in looking at the relationship the United states has relationship with Saudi Arabia it's not like just be and be real we don't have a lot of options over there we're going to settle it set up to Iran we don't get friendly with Russia I thought wait we're not supposed to like them right isn't that how it goes\nI mean in Iran and Russia are thick as thieves there there one in the same essentially because of the the deals that they have the trade deals that they have with each other and Russia has Iran's back so do the same way that he does with a ... year Russia has a ... back in Syria so\nThis is all a power play Russia wants to be a kingmaker so that they can have control over the region meanwhile the United states has been allied with Saudi Arabia and they really would love to see this reform are made out to not be a reformer which is why he doesn't himself zero favors if something\nLike this happen right and at the same time what how I mean we're we're we're ... show these alliances he\nUm was a legal resident of the United states lived in London and and uh as simple as I understand it went to the Saudi embassy in Istanbul which he was there seven minutes before it was it was reported that he was killed [noise]\nUm he had previous alliances with Muslim Brotherhood that apparently angered the crown prince as well um and he wrote things I'm undermining or what the ... or or criticizing what the crown prince was doing\nSo and there is it's it's not and then that you know Mike Pompeo goes over there to have a conversation and you have the media that loses their ever loving mind because like Wallace here because they think he's being used as a prop he's a damn diplomat who is representing the United states and going over to have discussions with someone to find out hey did you kill somebody\nHow these people think is going to happen pot pales going to go over there and be like hey crown prince to cut him up what's up did you did you drop him up over and assemble how ... how did it happen I mean if diplomacy it's why it's not meant for ... pay if it's an art I could not be a diplomat do you know why because\nI feel like blowing smoke up people's backsides and I can only\nNice to someone I don't like for so long I mean I'm going to be real with you it takes a lot of energy for me to politely smile\nOh shock ... stop it\nYou see what I'm saying is I can never be a diplomat a lot of these people can be diplomats because they're simply\nDumb and it's just that's the bottom line\nThey were talking about his last column ... Jamal ... Washington Post as last column with the Arab world needs now is free expression and our media over here has they're really they're pushing the story because they're looking at at it as a way to indict Donald Trump\nThey're pushing the story because they want to say that the Saudi prince was inspired by Donald Trump's words were in he said fake news is the enemy of the people and then the press lie to but to everybody and said oh no you said the press is the enemy of the people\nAnd then they present these these you know botched soundbites where he you get half of a ... not even half of a full sentence\nBecause they're desperately trying to make it out is though he declared war on the press when ultimately it was depressed that declared war on Donald Trump and as I was discussing this morning on Fox and friends it's really a lot of the chattering class that has declared war on the people who support this administration\nHe simply said fake news is the enemy of the people I think fake news is the enemy of the republic and\nAnd do an insane that he accurately called them up for what they're doing but I made the mad because they don't they don't want to deal with that so here we are\nSo they're trying to blame this on him they're saying the New York times says the president has cow town into a mad prints I don't see how and waiting for details to come in but this is how this is what they're pushing they're trying to make this the focus for midterms instead of the care of and that's gonna that's coming up from\nUh South America and we're going to talk more about that we also have a quick five on the way and uh some of the latest polling where it concerns Texas and uh some of these others and then later on in the program\nA Adam ... who has the gubernatorial candidate the Republican gubernatorial candidate in a a Nevada his communications director was I'm really like rough up by a paid Democrat operative\nThat also works with George Soros so we're going to talk to her about that later on in the program and I mean I think it's enough to beg the question as to our Democrats you know I guess Democrats or pain operatives to go and do this kind of stuff\nSo we'll get into all of that in the meantime the fastest speed letter ever is the elite technical systems the litter the ATF FBI letter is the fastest it'll load an entire mag in three seconds\nIt's the best thirty bucks you're ever going to spend on your shooting hobby each has also makes a universal rifle lower and pistol loaders for nine millimeter forty forty five and three eighty\nGo to ... dot com check 'em out for yourself it's so easy to do less than three seconds and it saves you time at the range so that you can practice honing your target acquisition skills you're drills and whatever it is I'll do\nIt belongs in every arranged back ... promoting it for free shipping that's low ... dot com\nTake one atom of nitrogen and bonded with one atom\nOf oxygen and you've created nitric oxide a miracle molecule your body makes that fuels your cardiovascular\nHealth keeping you focused and energized but every year after we mature our bodies generate less nitric oxide super beach by human has harness the power of the nutrient enrich beach and created\nA super food that helps your body make more nitric oxide on its own decor philosophy of human is to develop heart healthy products for your body one teaspoon of super beats daily support your cardiovascular\nHealth and blood pressure levels giving you natural energy without the need of a quick caffeine fix\nOr sugar high which is why I drink super beach every day it's part of my pre workout called eight hundred six six four fifty six Seventeen or visit dangerous beats dot com and find out how you can get a free\nThirty days supply of super beach and free shipping with your\nFirst purchase feels a one plus one equals soon the fact of super beach called eight hundred six six four fifty six Seventeen or visit ... dot com that's dangerous beats dot com\nIt's a whole big subject from a bigger role do you do things at various John Cho okay\nIt's almost that time of year again and here are for things my listeners ... fire is number one for Congress roundabout way like Ukraine the as well eat them to grow which by on the air will die no\nWord on whether the Jews rich will be more effective number to open fire it mounted place that on another fire in Mount the thinking here that the fire as well where did you are on each other and they ... themselves number three\nMore gasoline on the mound especially if you're not it after you pour warning was not usually not too smart not to mention bad for your yard and my favorite number four\nEvery baseball the red Sox move on to the world series following a for one wind up with the Astros in Houston so I mean the American league championship series in five games ws me news times three thirty one\nHi this is west last host of money matters\nWhen I'm not here to W.

Missouri he's supposed to be going after fraud not participating in it [laughter] so um there was nothing there I've been very upfront about all my positions in fact now I remember that very individual talking to me [noise]\nTrying to get me to say\nTrying to get me to tell him to say something different than what my positions are and I said no you just got to tell the people on the doors it is what it is I've made no secret that I think we can support the second amendment and universal background checks and banning bump stocks my gun record is out in the open for everyone to save\nShe actually said assault weapons ban and then her staffer says yes she does support a ban on some at a map rifles and that's what she is desperate to avoid discussing a Josh Hawley responded and said senator accusing people of crimes as a serious thing if you have evidence of a crime please come forward with it immediately otherwise please stop politicizing the legal process for your reelection\n[noise] I think it's pretty insane that she was caught on tape literally saying the truth about her positions she blames Josh Hawley for it because I guess she thinks that he works with James O'Keefe which that's not even true yeah you're\nConfused can we can views about I'm confused the if it's fraud but she did nothing but explain her positions that she's been public about already how was it for a yeah that was her\nBecause she got in trouble because they're her staff is saying oh yeah we totally take money from Planned Parenthood and all that stuff that's not what she dressing and the oh no no she doesn't want to ... she's trying to spin this desperately I just think it's a weird she's so desperate to avoid talking about it that she blames the AG she blames Josh Hawley her Republican opponent\nThat's just dumb I mean can I just really Frank for a minute and I do not mean any disrespect to either Josh Hawley or James O'Keefe so do not look at it in that context but let's let's be real James O'Keefe as a barn burner\nThat's what he does Josh Hawley is a super serious lawyer\nJosh is ... is interested Josh Hawley and I don't I've never met him in person ever I've only ever spoken to him\nOn this program and then I had one phone call with him prior to him coming on this program um 'cause every now and then I'll do that I'll just just so I can hear a guess voice and just say you know thanks for coming on I Do this with some of my guests can can attest that is that I have never spoken to him outside of that\nEver ever\nIf you were if something were to happen and you subpoena my phone records and you look at all my tax and everything I haven't never spoken to this dude ever\nSaid that one call before he first came on\nAnd that was like a couple of minutes and we mostly talked about you know when I moved from Missouri and then asked him you know about his family and then of course where did you go to high school because it's like a thing anyway but my whole point is that\nThe accusation that he was somehow involved in this is even dumb or when you look at the behavior of both because James is a barn burner and he will jump into the fray\nHolly is a very serious studious lawyer and I'll be real I think that I think that he is so\nHe is everything that a Democrat Claire McCaskill would fear\nJosh Hawley he Holly very much support the Trump Administration and he very much is is in line with the immigration with the tax reform with the trade manufacturing et cetera\nBut he is very uh he's law and order right he's super serious and I almost think that's a negative for him\nHe's just not shrill and over the top he's not he's he's you know pretty laid back I mean he'll he'll get bought when he needs to but he's just laid back and he wants to get it done\nAnd while people are running around waving their arms trying to distract from one identity politics tactic to the next he just gets it done and I almost kind of goes against him because a lot of people's view that as an mistakenly I think is a lack of charisma and it's not that he doesn't have charisma it's just that he is very serious\nAnd I'm not making the comparison either but I'm just saying no one would sit here and be like John Wayne isn't charismatic he just says no charisma because he's so serious no one would ever say that\nJust people have different demeanor is and that's his demeanor and I seriously doubt that he would have at all a had the time or be had been interested in participating in something like that get real to my knowledge I don't even think he even knows James's crew\nNow there are people in Missouri who do because Missouri back in the day when I Lived there was a the hotbed for activism [noise] uh but I think that was before Holly even came on the scene\nSo the I I think that was just a she lied that was a lie that she said she lied again and she's desperate\nSpin this as oh no this isn't so much an issue of me lying to voters about how moderate I Am and my staff telling voters that I'm going to I'm totally on board with impeaching Trump or if the house and Senate\nSomehow change hands to Democrat and we're just going to tell those moderate voters that supported me to get over it I mean that was literally the quote from her Stafford they have to get over it and her staffer said well she supports you ... a a ban on semi automatic rifles\nNow McCaskill what's weird when she was talking to that reporter she wasn't seen anything that was already not publicly known everyone knows that she said she supports an assault weapons ban\nBut here's the difference she kinda got caught\nBecause when you're talking about an assault weapons ban you and I both know that a lot of people on the left use that as the term coming all semi automatic rifles but they know that saying all semi automatic rifles will scare the crap out of you so they don't say all of a semi automatic rifles they say assault weapons",
