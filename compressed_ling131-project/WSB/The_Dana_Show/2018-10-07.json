to the head over to Facebook Like is that ... radio see some of the bloopers behind the scenes of some of the educational stuff\nYeah there's mostly bloopers [laughter] see what it's always somebody like that but you know\nUh the stuff that doesn't make the production is doubly does it is it worthy of making the production of it has a lot of there's a lot of fun to go watch his head over there like us on Facebook a check in with us if you ever in the academy you know of the studios of ... we've got a lot going on so excited to have you listen to us and\nWe're really making that big social media push to try to get the word out\nThat ... one of the things that we always talked about on Bowles embarrasses understand that the financial markets is not a game it's not a hobby\nIt uh it it can be a business they can pay you as a business you know early we're talking about trading for income trading as a business truly setting us up where you can receive monthly income where you can get the tax deduction where you can do this where you can build your business for you and your family that's what I Want to talk about I Want to talk about how someone can utilize the market and trade as a business\nWell let's talk about the American dream build a business land of opportunity is not the land of a secure job with benefits and the opportunity comes with people that take advantage of the free market and so there's a lot of ways to do that you can buy a franchise you could start a ground up is you run a restaurant I mean there's a lot of ways that you can own a business in America but think about this\nMost small businesses are not successful and the reason is because there's a lot of liability this cost this hard causes fix cars you know you have variable costs you also have employees and benefits in insurance an inventory to house and lines of credit\nAnd it can be overwhelming and for a lot of people it's basically what causes them not to have successes that they have to deal with all these day to day incidence of traditional business now imagine another business imagine if you could\nNot have to worry about inventory if every time you needed a customer you're just posted online something to sell no somebody there to buy it or if you need to buy something at a lower price at a wholesale price somebody was there to fulfill that over and sell it you never had a house inventory never had to deal with employees workers' comp liability ... building\nDidn't have to deal with employees that right there what's that worth\nThat's trading that setting up your trading and investing as a business you have all the tax benefits of a traditional business and yet you got a lot of the non traditional headaches taken out of your business when I saw that when I started trading as a business when I first got introduced to the financial markets [noise]\nIt was just amazing to see because I'd run small businesses for years and I had some success some failures lots of failures and when I began to realize that I could do the same thing as far as income and potential income without a lot of the daily daily grind and stress of running a small business\nFor every day when I'm Out on the highway or I'm driving down the road I always get behind that truck with letters on the top and I talked to that guy all the time here at bowls and bears radio and I always say there's a guy right now driving down the road with a bunch of letters on the top of his truck who's going from one job or the other is chasing my good employees that are trying to stiff him he's got people that are showing up for work he's got people that own money\nAnd my heart goes out to that guy 'cause I was that guy and then I found them financial markets and this as a business is the dream and one business owners get exposed to understanding how the financial markets can be treated like a business\nIt's a game changer an eye opener for them we see it all the time and so many of you you don't understand that the market can be treated like a business you have these dreams of owning a business\nSeriously Inquirer to looking at trading for a business because what's important is the long term results are still there but a lot of those traditional headaches that most visitors deal with you can get those out of the picture and guess what the sky becomes a limit\nWell and that's exactly it champion a lot of individuals out there that want to start their own business they don't know how to get started they would love to utilize it business from home and that's what the markets can do for you online training academy\nThe sponsor bulls and bears I teach a class specifically on training as a business now this is a five hundred dollar values taught right at the campus
