babies let's stop for one second girlfriend did not walk back claims girlfriend changed her whole story so\nAudio somebody twenty this is just is a bit of that interview that was a that was ridiculous listen to this\nAnd wondering if one of those people\nI\nCannot specifically say that he was one of the ones who assaulted me but before\nThis happened to me at that party I saw Brett Kavanaugh there I saw mark judge there and they were hanging about the area\nI started to feel disoriented and we're the room was and where the other boys were hanging out and laughing\n... so she is changing some of her story already um and there was even more of this because she was she started walking things back she started changing and things and it just [noise]\nIt just it didn't do her any favors at all whatsoever I'm audio soundbite um let's see if this is a yeah yeah yeah that's because I have so much a this is when she because remember she repeatedly talked about spiked punch listen to this one\nDid you say Brett Kavanaugh you know spiking the punch line I saw I saw him given red solo cups to quite a few girls during that time frame and their ... parties and\nWould not take one of those glasses fro mark habit why weren't catalogs gives me I saw him around the punch I won't say moles or the punch containers I don't know what he did but I saw him by them\n... what [noise] wait I'm Sorry what [noise] what\nI saw him by hand which is just like raping people and spike in their punch\nThat\nIs not in any way accurate that's not accurate\nThat's that's not that's not a ... that's not that's bad [laughter] I'm I'm I just what\nThat is a completely different because she said she actually said she saw him\nPreviously so how does this way I Will\nHow does this change how for real does is ... how do you change your story that much because we brought her claims when they first came out okay so um\n[noise]\nThere's more yet and there's more with the purchase of one slap chalk you get a bonus laptop for when you just want to solve the vegetables into pieces\nSo I assume so so much what yeah well there's yeah there's even more so as she was talking with MSNBC this Julie sweat neck oh by the way audio somebody tent Kate Snow was Kate Snow I don't know who she is NBC's Kate Snow again\nThis is when NBC was like well we couldn't corroborate a single thing and we reached out to people who say they've never even heard of this woman was\nOf those ten or ... what we want to do here is lay out all that she said her story our reporting we want to be very transparent because these are very serious allegations Kavanaugh\nHas called Julie sweat next story nonsense and as far as the president today questioned her credibility and NBC News for the record has not been able to independently verify her class there are things that she told us on camera\nThat differ from her written statement we've been trying to independently to reach out to anyone who remembers attending parties with Jewish sweating again Brett Kavanaugh and we've been asking her attorney for names so far we've not found anyone who remembers that\nYeah they haven't found anybody remembers literally anything [noise]\n[noise] yeah they they sat down with the accuser but they couldn't verify any of her claims wow I don't know why it is that people don't believe media wow Cain I don't I don't understand why people do not trust the media so shocked much while\nI mean how dare they how dare Brett Kavanaugh gets upset\nSmears that the media is pushing of him I mean how dare he do that the way he reacted to that made up story\nAnd his indignation well that just shows that he's unfit for the Supreme Court I mean\nYou should be able to calmly react to stories and that are made up about you and accusations that haven't been substantiated and have your family dragged through the mud and your daughters attacked with death and your wife threatened and you're good name ruined I mean come on out there you get mad\nNot very judicial to get mad when we're like making stuff up about you and then pushing on substance\nYou edit and uncorroborated claims I mean come on\nAnd you'll have generally uh what is the stigma sweating um her her lawyer of nodding yes he's claiming that his clients the guy who you are dirty ... come to life exactly cut their payments him trying to explain why is quite backtrack on the whole point oh this was my favorite ... yes yes listen to this is his employer imani\nA stated and the declaration I understand you are used different\nOne of her friend informed her\nOf what she just put in the declaration of what was a test of doing the declaration and last night at ten forty PM I had a telephone conversation with a woman who will go unnamed who lives in Florida who told me directly that mark judge\nAnd ... which by the porch with a grain alcohol and ...\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nI think I saw ... a a grand alcohol and\nCleveland open up for jethro tall back in the day you know I when I I don't know when debate tour opened with the stick next that's right yeah yeah exactly yeah drink that punch was the song um\nI just don't believe any of this and by the way when you're trying to seem super credible\nI just think when you're sitting down like how can I make it to where people can believe me you know let's go to this guy who's so far hasn't really had a lot of game and his clients a suit is getting tossed out of court his last client I feel like Michael ...\nI feel as though he actually exploits women rather than help women this is a guy who I mean can you be successful on his own or does he have to have a woman to exploit in order to to push out there and get his name out there so he can do press I mean that's ...\n... it's like he preys upon those situations and then exploits women to get his name out there\nThat's what it really seems like and anyone who disagrees with me as a sexist now I'm just to play his game but that's I mean it really it seems a lot like that right and well why can't you just do is you know do a thing on his own\nAnd then he goes on to say how ludicrous that has claimed that his client has no credibility what it's ludicrous\nYank ludicrous to think that someone who came to me Michael Evan id ... lacks credibility I and the most credible person in the United states of America that's ludicrous yeah and then we got to go to break because I Want to make sure we get quick then I've been I've been cheating everybody I heard\nIt's ludicrous for his first of all one lawsuit was filed it was almost immediately dismissed claims by her ex boyfriend I mean who doesn't have an ex boyfriend or an ex girlfriend of mine said bad things about um\nOh gosh I'm not going to make it there that's okay I really tried there's a difference between saying yeah she was kind of of that and yes she tried killing my kid she psycho and she threatened my wife and child\nThat's a huge difference huge difference apparently\nThere's a paper trail for oh OK let's let him I I just couldn't make it in stride again\nThis case was also immediately thrown out dismiss there was no education or determination relating to the validity of any of these clay\nI'm Sorry I got to this I got to come in again one more time the you're telling me that what has the the ex boyfriend of his client he claims she's nuts and tried to kill people or or threatened at least his wife and child he claimed she did something but that's not true but whatever the hell she claims totally true really\nI mean
