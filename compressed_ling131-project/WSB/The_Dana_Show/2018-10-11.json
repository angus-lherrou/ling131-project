Iraq was it fake conservative\nColumnist that rights at\nThe Washington Post because they can't hire a real conservative because you know come on a Jennifer Rubin never got so much attention as when she still try to maintain that she was a conservative while also blasting conservatives and conservative policy and anything that remotely even resembles conservative policy there was a lot of people who do that\nOr we could have that then of course they I mean I have a whole entire list here I went back because the ... never forget\nWhat about when I'm looking at some of the the\nThe cabinet coverage that they had was ridiculous I mean it was just ... their butt\nAnd looking at the way that they pre suppose Kavanaugh was guilty and the way that they approach their stories I mean do you want to have a discussion about documented false heads or what about the the Washington Post that hasn't endorsed a Republican for president since Nineteen fifty two even conceded that most newsrooms till liberal democratic\nAnd they're one of the day even admitted that uh let's see what about oh how they all freaked out during the ...\nIt could sit here and go on and on and on 'em or when oh the only time that they actually did something right was when they fact check Beto O'Rourke\nYeah\nSo oh when and when they were promoting how Trump killed Puerto Rico hurricane victims\nYeah they ran with that don't forget they ran with that so and not you know or how about when the they ran the editorial where they said quote Trump this complicit\nHis complicit in quote and Hurricane Florence is destruction and that's before it even made land this is the Washington Post the same Washington posted mad at USA Today for printing an editorial by the president of the United states have all the seats in the world have them\nSo that's that's the first thing everybody mad about then here let's see where and\nSpeaking of hurricanes we're watching hurricane Michael I'm as it has made landfall uh it it keeps tracking it keeps tracking each word it was headed right for\nUm Panama City and it's still the I think it's kind of over Panama City but it's also hitting Mexico beach in others it's

is an unprecedented event and there are no category for storms on record I have made landfall along the Florida Panhandle coast\nA hundred and forty five miles per hour sustained winds heavy rainfall twelve feet storm surges in parts of northwestern Florida\nUm and there has been a number of hurricanes that made landfall in the panhandle since Eighteen fifty one I'm In fact Philip clocks back has been doing a meteorologist as been did a really great job documenting that however when they hit land none of them were cat force none of them\nAre dead and none of them were kept words when they hit the Florida Panhandle so there was a that were mandatory evacuations Governor Scott said he was scared have he's scared to death for people who decided to stay and I hope people didn't leave their

had said verbatim how was he too biased in defending himself that's the craziest thing came to native questions\nIt's hard to understand where they're coming from because\nThey're trying to put the actual context of him being a judge and deciding between two people that aren't him right and whether or not bias is involved there but see this is him he was accusations towards\nHim and of course he would defend it with bias because it's him so this has no correlation with him is sitting as a judge wild deciding between two other parties where he is not involve\nRight so they're telling him well
