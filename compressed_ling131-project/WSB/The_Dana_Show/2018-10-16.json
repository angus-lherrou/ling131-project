Robert ... was a West Point grad he\nWas um well respected for his understanding of battle\nAnd I guess maybe they don't teach history and I don't know I saw a bunch of verified check marks everybody was freaking out all these media people they were saying that he was praising Roberts Lee what he was saying was that Ulysses Grant was better and it was this Ohio and that was better and that's you know what happened but\nThe fact that they tried to making like a racist I guess underscores the fact that these people either don't understand history because they weren't taught it or they're trying to be purposely ignorant\nBecause Robert he when he was asked he was given um a role of of a a general over the forces the union forces before the civil war\nAnd they tried to recruit him and he was actually Robert he wrote a bunch of stuff against slavery he was not for secession he was not for he was a\nVery much I very reluctant he took ... days to think about this the reason ultimately that he ended up working with the confederacy is because he did not want to bear arms against his home state of Virginia\nAnd you know a divided his family it was but they and then afterwards even he wrote a lot of stuff about unity and restoring the union et cetera et cetera he was very very reluctant\nAnd people I guess don't understand that portion of its history that no one wants to believe the secondary storyline or any nuance because it's\nAll a bunch of gotcha BS is what it is it's so stupid I'm this is I'm telling you what this is another example of all of this tribalism dumbing everybody down\nHow dumber you that you're wrong with that spin on this it was ... and it was everywhere oh my gosh you guys it was absolutely everywhere\nI've never seen such a thing I mean it let me read this ... this was a reporter was this oh this is one of the guys at CNN here are Trump's comments tonight calling the leader of the Confederate Army quote a great general multiple times\nWow wow [noise]\nThis is so ridiculous I'm the first off he was praising grant he was talking about\nHow ah\nThe point of the whole story was how Abraham Lincoln chose a guy from Ohio to beat Robert ... that was the whole point of his story\nThis is purposeful deception and it wasn't just the CNN\nDude a lot I got more and more examples is so many more examples frail it wasn't just this guy was there was a ton of um\nNBC new set of to watch President Trump says Robert he leaves a great general during Ohio rally calling the Confederate leader incredible what they leave out is that he was talking about how you listen to dance as grant was better and that's why he was recruited to beat him\nAnd again going back to history Robert really was a West Point grad you can recognize that he was a good general and not agree with the cause for which he fought just like you can write going back to pat and rumble pad and could recognize that Romney was a worthy", "show_name": "The Dana Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "16"}
