media group station [noise]\nTwenty four hour news weather and traffic five and am sent\nMe a lot of news\nNow [noise] it's three o'clock\nI'm Charlie over I live in the valley who has made twenty four hour news center top story this hour that go choose off the agenda for next Wednesday special cold that line of the city council meeting several US cities around that go waters tells us why not a city\nCouncilman Michael bunch tells me the newest proposal may see a lot of critics sticker shock of\nWhat I've been told and I'm waiting to see it in writing the most significant thing is that the

that would\nGive us at the public less than twenty four hours to review the proposal and I don't think anybody would want it so my hats off to the mayor\nUm after that guy went in after ... went in I just find it difficult to believe that he went rogue\nSo then you have to ask well then what made this what made him such an attractive target\nIt couldn't be just because he was saying things that hurt his feelings especially after he ran such a charm offensive why would the crown prince\nGambled his charm offensive that he has laid out for all of these months on this in broad daylight so that's the big question\nAnd that's why it people are saying well is it was there more than just the you know what what what made him so attractive and the New York times had this piece that they ran on the fourteenth where they said well he I mean he was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood and he was an Islamist and he had um\nYou know would speak it and use anti western rhetoric and and and things such as you know things like that and he had also apparently previously worked as an advisor and an unofficial spokesman for the royal family and I I'm also interested in what made him an attractive hired of the Washington Post\nWhy did the Washington Post tire that him um he he's pro Palestinian and Saudi Arabia meanwhile has expressed support for the state of Israel so they're at odds there there are at odds\nOver political Islam there at odds over a number of things and so he's taken out and\nSo we're going to talk to doctors eighty Jess or about this because I think it's just really stupid and narrow minded to say that investigating this further is somehow conducting a ... it's you're conducting a whisper campaign\nThis is again people don't want any research or any questions or any facts to come into play just like if\nSomeone is if someone is accused of of sexual harassment or assault well it's just the accusation that the evidence so it's more than that and then our third our Louie Gohmert is going to join us\nTo discuss this mob of migrants this caravan that is leaving Honduras and moving through I think what they're in Guatemala right now is that where they are the my the Caribbean\nYou can't use the kissing mob mob is bad you can't so we'll get into all of that and I'm In more uh additionally additionally I was just a\nBeta or you know they had the CNN town hall last night\nAnd it was just a beta Robert ... town hall and they had said\nThat they and they had invited Ted Cruz and Ted Cruz's people released our correspondents or the cruise campaign said well why don't you just turn this into a debate\nWould gladly you know ... why don't you turn this into a debate but seeing and didn't want to do that and so Christians like as senior town halls and not we're not doing enough I can tell you about their town halls\nAnd so it was him being weird\nAnd so he was asked also about and he pulled us up among my hair he was asked specifically\nAbout a impeaching Trump and you remember when the kids even before he started his you know the Senate campaign he had said that he would vote to impeach Trump and then at the last debate he said he would impeach Trump\nSo after he said he would work with him well now he was trying to go for he he wouldn't answer the question actually right away listen to this because he was asked about this again listen you've already said\nEven though that's not done that you would vote to impeach and so according to the constitution that means that the president has committed the crime of treason primer bribery or a high crime and misdemeanor [noise] which one of those do you think the president has committed\nI wouldn't like an impeachment twins are there there was enough there to proceed with the ... for a full voting of the facts\nAnd to make the best informed decision in the interest of this country and our future as you know under the constitution as a member of the Senate is a far different board that as a trial with more coal where we woke up effect so we're not seeing George the outcome of the world okay ...\nWell yeah what was the answer and she said to her credit pressed and kept moving ... kept pushing forward on it\nOr that's Dana Bash to her credit she was you know she caught him she was like well ... no he didn't actually answer the question she even reminded him she goes congressman or the question was about impeachment and you said in July the what is a member of the house right now go to impeach if you changed your mind\nAnd that's when he kept going on and then he 'cause he talked about he talked about Russia he talked about\nEverything but the actually answering the questions and then finally goes well but yes to answer your question or do you think there's enough there for impeachment and in fact I Would vote on it what do you mean enough there so he would he's he's\nBut he said he was neutral on a vote to remove but he would vote to impeach\nWhat isn't even mean because he actually said that\nWell I don't even know why he's not going to be removed yeah that was the whole point\nUh you can't there's hardly any of this works\nAnd I'm Glad that that are Dana Bash pin him down on us that was good uh because that he was all over the place with his answers I mean he just he's not a good candidate he's just simply not as a candidate by the way he also said that his\nMom is a lifelong Republican except she's not so Eli she's not a lifelong Republican\nShe's a Brock Obama donor she donated to Brock Obama and she's voted and Fifteen of the Seventeen a Fifteen of Seventeen democratic primaries\nOkay well I'm set\nWould make her not a lifelong Republican now how that works she's been not a lifelong Republican yeah I'd have somebody to love and this is what he tries to say about guns listen to this\nSong we support the second amendment or don't want to take yours or anyone else's guns that want to make sure that we the people of Texas where this extraordinary pro long tradition of responsible and safe gun ownership\nFor hunting for sport for collection for self defense that we use this prior to please and our knowledge and experience to leave the national conversation that this country has been waiting for when he was thirty thousand or fellow Americans every year it's not even accurate developed country even comes close a third\nOf that actually that's not true either because there are tons of countries that ... I mean for crying out loud France had more than the United states\nIn terms of what like math for ... sort of loose or develop a third of the other side is sort of that was suicide number one and they could they purposely include those numbers and to make it look like it's a bigger numbers that issue of us are yeah two thirds of that a suicide\nThey he purposely put set in their ticket\nTo make it look like the numbers are a lot worse but he's um he's lying because he again he's the line I don't know why he lives about this stuff [noise]\nUm he has said before when he talks about supporting assault weapons ban and again remember what I said about anyone who says that they support and assault weapons ban there these are people who ... who are for banning semi automatic rifles\nThat's\nI mean he's he's talked about that before um and that's not supportive of the second amendment I mean it's that he's talking about and he ... he he wants um a ban on what he calls high capacity magazines\nExcept there's\nNo such thing as a high capacity magazine I mean you know standard capacity he wants there to be a worthless you BCS\nWhich didn't work in Maryland and they didn't work in California and it was criminalized you know like my grandpa gave my son his first hunting rifle that would've been able to criminalize that I loved by the way the people who say well we're going to make private citizens have to undergo\nUm uh they're gonna have to have a a\nRun their all their stuff for the Knicks system but simultaneously we're not going to give them access to that system\nOkay what yeah ... yeah\nUh he opposes a carry reciprocity he doesn't think that there should be carry reciprocity he uh is he likes the he likes the banning of quote unquote assault weapons so yeah he's not for the second amendment\nI mean there's just I mean that's just the other is to it he's not that he's not a Second Amendment guy so I don't know what else to the main he's just not [noise] we

what happens\nYeah it is it's it's bad stuff uh but whenever you ask questions about it the media immediately assumes that you're somehow participating in a whisper campaign\nWith which has saved

he's also the founder on Dr ... thank you so much for joining us\nAnd it's great to be with you there thanks for having me\nGive us some perspective on this because I you know I I find it hard to believe that the crown prince of Saudi Arabia would decide to because he had hurt feelings over something that\nA ... you wrote about in his columns that he would carry out an assassination in broad daylight ah where his people in his inner circle would be caught on closed circuit TV entering the consulate\nAnd just over over the column I mean there seems to be a lot more here I'm ... is is that an accurate way to kind of situation\nAlthough certainly a lot more there and it is is just baffling to me to see the\nGyrations that the left media the legacy media is doing in this story which is all of a sudden they've taken a guy\nWho you know under any other planet or would be I'm surprised even had a resident visa ear and out of the Washington Post is lying I think him and making them into a hero and they haven't really looked at is writing then we'll get to that in a second but\nAre the Saudis are concerned they're ... they're they're Middle East dictatorship and and yet the President Trump was left with the\nObama disaster that had been so one sided to the Iranians that he's trying to resurrect\nSort of the twentieth century model of foreign policy which was a balance between Sunni and Shia so at the end of the day us are becoming unhinged about what happened to Mr ... is going to end up benefiting the Iranians the Qataris and the Turks now that doesn't mean that an ally has free will to assassinate a\nA columnist an activist but we should not be a glossy glassy eyes on exactly what this guy was all about and what was the about well I'll remind your three or four months ago the Saudis put into sort of an extension of the Ritz Carlton all of the the royal family that was involved with the Muslim Brotherhood\nSo they took basically a trillion dollars that had been used globally for the last fifty years were the Saudis had been funding Muslim Brotherhood operations around the planet the last six months they put a stop to that part of the lead of that was a lot of them will lead\nWho owns a center at Georgetown has owned a uh a center at Harvard et cetera which has been radicalized Muslims in the west well one of the close friends that will lead is ...\n... came to America a year ago there's no doubt that the princes folks want it to bring to show the end for interrogation and another thing so odds are that went sour odds are like many other dictatorships on my only knows the jury in one pretty well\nThey're pretty ruthless bugs and they may have just gone south but the bottom line is is this guy was part of the royal family that was pro Islamist pro Muslim Brotherhood anti American\nVery anti Israel the Saudis shifted than the last six months decided to become more pro Israel isn't real reforms is more pragmatic politics and this guy was standing in the way of that with a Twitter following up to three million was starting to write more and more critical against the Saudis and they probably wanted to contain him\nAll that and the and that would make sense for the New York times had a piece a just a few days ago where they wrote about his membership in the Muslim Brotherhood which is why I thought it was so weird that the Washington Post that it was\nConservatives that we're conducting a whisper campaign because I looked at the New York times piece and they said you know ... friends were even saying that\nWhenever they would talk with him he is very much expressed up anti western sentiments and he was very much into political Islam and he was very much more extreme than some of what was being promoted and the charm offensive by the Saudi crown prince and you just touched on on doctors Yasser you just touched on", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Dana Show", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "20"}
