I'm now on every weekday nine to noon right here on ws me [noise]\nAnd he has a shot in the ... and it's one of the few seats that the Republicans are actually on the off and so most of the places where the Republicans are running where on the defense because of the map that we have being in the majority but because of the retirement\nOf Carol Shea Porter it's an open seat Eddie Edwards has a great shot at winning that he's a different kind of can a he's a lawn a law and order kinda Kennedy he's a veteran and he is someone who connects very well with the people in New Hampshire\nBut he needs to raise money and he should increase it profile and needs to make sure that he is supporting the Trump agenda and if that happens the people in the actual will reward an incentive to Congress\nAnd just would that was bringing Eddie Edwards running for Congress in New Hampshire is first district against Chris Pappas or was it feel like you're currently would ask you who's from New Hampshire I knew corner like that\nI was always great to have a a fellow granted state are supporting a state of skills good and thank you so much for having me on the show\nSo oh why did you get into politics your guy who's been in the navy a small business owner former chief of police in over in South Hampton you know a graduate the FBI Academy why do you want to run for Congress\nWell because I actually worked in government to things happening to you I Believe you want to do more of that or you want to tell the people were really going on marketing transparency government that is what motivated me to get into a politics that's what motivated me to run for office I I Believe the citizens of this country\nNeeds to be back in charge of the government we need more moms and dads in charge of communities that we need more communities and charged with government not the other way around\nAnd you also want to be the first African American elected in this district right in the state\n[noise] well that's not that I Want to be a I have to tell you that are being African American\nMy opponent is a openly gay male those things are not important to the Granite State of what's important and moms and dads what you can do it for their families to make sure they're protected you know I've often said that uh I'm not special because I'm black my opponents not special because he's gay\nWhat makes you special is what you get back to your country your family or community that's what defines who as an American that's what makes you special skin color of your ethnicity or your sexual orientation\nYou know a lot of stuff do you see the chaos that's taking place especially around the cabin you Kevin stuff and he ... himself why do we want to go there what it won't want to go there where people are being shouted down for doing their job\nBecause we have to fight back we have to stand up as Americans and push back we have a small window that changed the course of this country\nAnd we have to bring it back around and I and I believe and I've always plays the Republican Party has always been a party to step\nForward to bring our country back and you're not in our country you know it's a couple of\nThings that we've always relied on that's the bill of rights\nIs the constitution that's our flag declaration\nOf independence our founding documents in our symbol of freedom and justice and liberty\nLeft what unites Americans and I think it's time that we bring our country together and the only way we can do that by rally around those things that we know from ... and legacies that brought us together\nSo why run I'm sure you must get blowback I hear from Ben Carson we hear from Jim Brown or there's a deal you're African American you whereas Republican all of a sudden you were a sell out I mean what made you go to the Republican Party lieutenant colonel Allen West to doesn't care about what anyone thinks in a good way yeah so how did you end up as a Republican\nWell because my grandmother play a role in my life uh taught me American values she taught me how the love of prey how this is how to be self reliant out to be independent and how to get back to your community and as I grew I learned those values and and those values a line for the Republican Party and you have to look at the\nLegacy of this party the Republican Party has always been the party other minorities\nHas always been a party of women and from the thirteenth fourteenth fifteenth and Nineteen to limit the problem is is that people will\nSay to you today whether the Republican Party is not the Republican Party\nOf eight fifty for what you couldn't be further from the truth the fact of the matter is the Republican Party is never guaranteed the government will provide for you as always guarantee the government they will fight to make sure all government didn't take for you\nThat's why in the slavery that is why fought so hard for minorities and women in this country of the matter is\nThat we don't tell the truth as Republicans we don't fight hard enough to get things we've allowed the liberals and now the socialist tell us or a vilify ah folks on her right that somehow we are not supportive of of immigration for instance we were stylish citizenship in this country the Republican Party establish citizenship\nSaid we don't care about voting rights of course we do\nWish Dallas volume like in this country so the fact of the matter is is any sensible person who looked at this country and he believes in the values of this country would find themselves leaning more towards that conservative way of life in fact that used to be the founding principles our country we weren't left government\nDidn't believe in dictatorship or or or change and now we will come to a place in our country was socialist are actually telling us\nThat if we don't support government programs if we don't support the government officials and somehow\nYou're not black enough you're not\nYou're not strong enough as a female or somehow you have to follow this line\nUh if I don't get on the gravy train of government\nThat I'm not I'm not a pure black ah I reject those type of silly notions\nAnd you know what you're putting your money where your mouth is you're running for Congress in New Hampshire is first district Eddie Edwards thanks so much already given

the state department's I look at the flight that she acknowledged already and her twenty Seventeen um financial disclosure report\nIt was set there were seven flights between New York DC and South Carolina\nAnd they say they're worth tens of thousands of dollars this crew group and they want to know whether um they're basically they want an investigation into it but that's nothing so that's not really that's not a thing either um she's not going to challenge the president um\nGrand ... see the the with their previous speculation as to whether or not ground would end up taking Sessions is spot if sessions leaves after midterms and grand steps into his eating and she could take a\nGram seat granted has always said that he'd have it has no interest in that he doesn't want to be a ...\nAnd to me it seems as though the ... the more obvious thing is that she was you know she's got kids and she wants to spend time with her kids and she also wants a little bit of a break because it's she's going pretty hard at it for for quite some time and so\nThat and and the way that the president by the way I'm ...\n... when he spoke of her at the press conference that they had just a little bit earlier I mean he was a few sit with his praise he said glowing things about her it it sounded as though that it was something that\nHad been I think plan for some time which would go into what I've been hearing that only like a tiny group of people including the president were aware but it definitely wasn't any kind of bad partying at all whatsoever so I think to have you know maybe it's an ... razor still sort of thing\nI mean she she\nLeaves with a reputation that has been improved she left on her own terms\nShe has maintained a great relationship with the president so I think maybe it might end and it could be you know maybe she is taking a break right now spending some time with her kids because she knows she'll be campaigning for ... coming up and then maybe twenty twenty four maybe she's gearing up and just taking some time right now before\nShe runs the nose or we're gonna I'm gonna ask Stephen it's about this coming up later on in the program he worked in the Bush White House and I'm I'm I'm I'm curious to see\nHow a I'm curious to see his reaction to this so that's a that's ... that's the top story she would have to primary ... oh my gosh this is really where we're going [noise]\nSo she resigns yesterday did you guys watch the official swearing in of a\nJustice Kavanaugh did you guys see the swearing in of justice Kavanaugh justice capital to go see that I watched it out of here oh did you\nI went to an October fest and had a beer I had a beer for Brett I'm Sorry justice Brett justice Mr justice Brett Kavanaugh I Know I'm not going to stop saying it I have um\nFirst off I'm sure that you also the protesters right everybody saw the everybody saw the footage of the protesters people or yeah imagine what they're going to do for the next appointment\nJust saying\nIf President Trump were to get another appointment I [noise]\nI don't want to say that there would be violence on the part of the last I really hope that they grow up a little bit and that some of their elders and butters kind of take a hold of the reins because these people are crazy just some of the protests that I've seen\nAre pretty amazing Corey Booker was out there saying that they they're looking they want to impeach cabinet and I thought are you working secretly with Republicans\nSeriously I'm just\nReal question are you seeking working because it seems like it seems like that's that's if\nIf you're trying to work with Republican Party and increase voter turnout\nAll day and that's the way to do it oh my word get everybody to think that if Democrats take control of the White House that you're going to impeach the guy that they all that was like one of the top reasons that people voted for drunk oh man that's just not the way to do it\nSo all the protests we had the uh really awesome ceremony yesterday the president when he and I ... I have a very with me I got a lot of things up here when the president\nWhen he uh when he actually uh when he spoke and was just and was was discussing a having a he apologized he said your what your family has gone through\nAny apologized for a campaign of political and personal destruction which is true\nUm that's absolutely true\nAh audio somebody tennis is well some of the president actually you know what let's I have a couple of soundbites let's start with ten because this was when he was a a actually sixteen I'm changing it I'm Sorry this place because this is this is that exact quote this is when the president apologized and before he introduced him for his remarks listen\nI Would like to begin to notice proceeding differently than perhaps and the other event of such magnitude on behalf of our nation\nTo apologize to breath\nFamily for the terrible pain and suffering you have been forced to endure those who stepped forward to serve our country deserves a fair and dignified evaluation\n... and it's true it's his his remarks are true uses it he's absolutely he's absolutely right and it was by the way Hillary Clinton responded to that she was livid\nOoh speaking of which I just saw this flyby represents a there she and bill are going on tour live nation actually tweeted a like a a little bit ago they're headlining an arena tour I don't know if it's me too movement but it is somewhat funny\nBut she criticized the swearing in ceremony she said what was done was a political rally that's what she said she was mad she said what was done was a political rally and she had said that I you know I don't and I have the auto hair she said it was a political rally\nAnd it undermines the image and integrity of the court it saddens me uh she I mean she was saying she didn't she didn't think that he should have been a I guess that he should have a policy I don't think that Trump should have had to apologize I think that Senate that the Democrats in the Senate should have had to apologize to be quite honest\nThey were the ones that that ran him through this they were the ones that did it audio soundbite Fifteen\nTrump again hit on you know you were you were he says you are proven innocent a lot of people went after this remark listen\nAnd with that I must say that you share under historic scrutiny were proven innocent thank you [noise]\n... yeah\nThis I don't know if he was he was never he was accused but he was never proven guilty I don't know if you can even be proven innocent if you were never proven guilty that's\nThe only thing I Would take it that I Would say I don't have I mean he wasn't wrong he was saying that he was\nInnocent and but I don't think that because he was never proven guilty so many times\nI hear well this was a job interview and it's not a trial and that's what Democrats say so that they can they don't have to meet the high bar of proving these baseless smearing accusations that the law but individuals\nWhenever they opposed their their ideology or whenever they just oppose them even if they're nominated by someone who's ideological status they oppose\nAnd that's what was obviously what was happening with the cabinet situation but for them to say well it wasn't a trial\nThere they're what they're saying as we can say whatever the hell we want we can smear him as being a pedophile or however a gang rape is that cetera and we don't have to prove anything because it's not a trial\nWell if it's not a trial and he refused to bring forth any evidence bye Felicia\nNow he's justice Brett Kavanaugh see that didn't really work out in their favor did it as smuggling smarmy as they said it\nSo now he's justice Cavanaugh I'm I have some of his excerpts from his remarks last night because they were great\nUh and coming up John mayor wants to create a new mail contract regarding masculinity I have your pop culture round up including Taylor Swift finally vows to the mob and speaks out on politics she says that she's a feminist and she can't stitched she doesn't want to support Marsha Blackburn but yet still support the guy\nWho actually was against a who actually us is against the gay marriage and also supported cabinet so\nI don't understand what her point is there will discuss all of that as well uh I watch you see over the weekend and I cannot believe what I thought we have to touch on that because dude and some people are getting some things right by the way about I'm a new magnum at all they're getting it completely wrong as to who started what so we're going to revisit that 'cause I was heated\nI was up on Twitter and I had these do too I Know babies I had been watching USC longer than some of you dude I don't even care I've been watching it and fall on it a hell of a lot longer than some of these posters that have been out there and they're like ... you don't sit down and shut up I could shut up\nLet you go make me a sandwich my gosh anyway so I was hot I was hot on that so we're going to come back we'll hit that as well as we get going whenever I Need to stock up on my liberties stash\nI always go ah to outdoor limited because I just I think that they have such a great selection\nAnd the other thing that I like is that they everything that they have listed on their website as in stock is literally and and stock\n... after a limited dot com has just the the biggest selection of ammo on line they also have some key accessories too like if you need some cleaning supplies you want to get some extra targets you need more magazines there this is not a drop shipping
