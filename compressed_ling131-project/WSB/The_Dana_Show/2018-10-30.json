too often\nIt works you can't you know\nWe all thought that as President Obama mocking the fact that people are concerned about the caravan it's storming its way\nThrough Mexico between four and seven thousand people a went right through the gate to Guatemala one right through of course emulated in Honduras many people think financed by Venezuela and there's this second Caribbean coming our direction\nBut he's mocking as if we're cowering in the corner because uh people are coming to the border Michael Wolff says you run for the sixth district here in Florida\nIs that the message that we're afraid\n[noise] you know the message is the messages that we're getting stuff done\nBrian I mean we whether it's on the economy whether it's on the environment whether it is a moving forward with helping our veterans heck even one of the issue and whether we want to continue doing that or we want to take a hard left turn\nOut one of the issues that critical and Florida school choice\nA I'm a product of magnet schools and charter schools uh Florida under Rick Scott contribute to over a billion annually to vouchers and to help in school choice and it's something that that Gillum opposes not so there are so many issues that affect everyday lives and you know it's which America do you want\nDo you want Nancy Pelosi's America I fought\nIn many veterans fought in the Cold War to the communism and socialism and now we have from the inside people wanting to take us that direction or they're promising look at OK geo Cortez they're promising\nFree a free housing free medical care free college tuition free a student loan debt relief and and it only takes a few minutes with a voter to make him realize and remind them\nNothing for free that's going to get passed on to you and taxes and pumping more money through a government agency ended a bureaucratic state\nIs not the answer for anybody who pushes for government run health care look at the VA it's actually doubled its budget and the last ten years twelve hundred hospitals and clinics being run by the government three hundred thousand employees and yet veterans still aren't getting the care\nThat they need President Trump comes in and says you know what if you've got to wait too long if you have to drive too far to get to a VA clinic you could take a car and go to your local provider get it done right yeah right I mean it's just common sense practical legislation and that's what people want\nRight and uh for you personally as a veteran green brave but also in a business so when you said you've already noticed in the break that nobody talks about the deregulation of said well what do you mean practically for your business you have a government contracts it took forever to get these contracts\nWe by the time you put all of the stuff that the government mandates in their these bids I mean just to do business with your local government or your federal government are five six seven hundred pages by the time you pay lawyers accounting I mean it just blows up these small businesses overhead\nAnd that's money that they can be putting into their employees are investing in products and and growing our economy\nHow many years in the military twenty two so that service right that's right so they end up with an active in the reserves and active in their lives and you cite is sort of local business that's right right so you with the federal contract you allowed to show that businesses that was right\nNo I absolutely we get we essentially go after bad guy money all over the world so when you hear about the Treasury Department putting sanctions in place or you hear about ISIS\nYou know these terrorist groups in particular preach like they're ... they run themselves like the mob there and human trafficking oil and gas counterfeiting cigarettes you name it we track the money down and shut it\nDown so you do that and they said I haven't done enough service after twenty two years I Want to go back yeah it's not for the money no guys this service for you\nThis is ... ... you know we can I tell people all the time yelling at the television posting things on Facebook\nThat don't count a ... step up and serve and whether it's running for office supporting someone's running for office working with your local community church to help others disaster relief\nWe need to get America back serving again the motto in my campaign surrogate leadership and that's coming as a Christian as well that's you know that is truly how we should sort of humbly but with strengths\nAnd uh and that's what I'm all about this is about this is about serving this great country I think in many ways we face as many internal threats now as we face external\nThreats and we need not only veterans combat veterans in the east coast and we bring the gosh we have trillions of dollars now or in our national budget and we have people that can't read a balance sheet of managing that money's the more business people the more veterans we get the better\nRight and you have a lot of business people there uh Michael Wolff who's running as is Nancy Soderberg to be the next Congress for a person from

I mean I don't know how people can think like this the guy was consumed with hatred that's the one thing I think to take away from that she was just absolutely consumed with hatred\nAnd this uh I mean it was just it it it led him his the fact that he was so consumed with it has led led to this so um [noise]\nI I Know there's we got another with other developments is while they're going to too but this ah has also\nSparked a huge discussion on security at synagogues and churches and it's further added fuel to the fire that we've had it on going in this nation about discussions with tone and et cetera et cetera let me let me\nLet me say this I'm thinking about how to put this because I don't believe that\nWords themselves are violent I Am a free speech purist I Do not believe that words themselves are violent I don't believe that speech is going to harm someone I don't believe\nThat uh you know I I don't just like I didn't I didn't say this when when the\nWho is that I'm not going to say his name the guy who went up and shot the ball field the congressional ball field I don't blame that on Bernie Sanders like I was a staffer for Bernie Sanders he worked for Bernie Sanders you as a ... like a lifelong Democrat I don't believe that Democrats are responsible for that in order I Believe Bernie Sanders was responsible for that that guy was in that job\nI think this guy's hate was responsible for what he did\nAnd he hated the president by the way for people who are saying that the president is some sort of big anti Semite well it really didn't work out I mean he must be a horrible anti Semite for having a\nYou know a Jewish advisor and a Jewish daughter and Jewish grandchildren I mean what a horrible anti Semite this guy is can we just stop trying to blame every I cannot stand when people seize upon horrible tragedies and they use it like ... petty Little Women little mean girls and they use it as ways to get political jabs at people\nI don't buy I don't buy your protest Asian I don't buy that you care about what happened if you seize upon it and you're immediately using that as a weapon\n... completely out of place to go after someone simply because you hate that person politically\nThis dude was consumed with hate and there are a lot of people in politics that are absolutely consumed with hate and that is a problem\n[noise] these are people who are so consumed with hate they just hate the fact that there exists someone who thinks differently from them and the fact that someone exist to think differently that to them as a personal offense at ... they believe that the existence of different thought is the same thing as the middle finger extended\nThey think that's how they look at it he was consumed with hate and I don't know I've always felt that big it's should be absolutely Sean and\nI don't like big it's I don't like anti Semite I don't like people who use people's beliefs and ethnicities as a mark against them I think it is the cheapest trashy is most back way of thinking\nIt really is it is the laziest form of thought it is the laziest form of thought\n\nAnd that I have a always felt\nThis way and this dude was consumed with\nHate absolutely consumed with hate\nThat's what that's the problem with this this is the fault of this now I saw and I'm going to get into some of the media stuff because the people out there who immediately went and were screaming at the president and talking about tell which I have no idea how to help people came to that conclusion quite frankly\nThey they were mad because they didn't like the the his expression of sympathy they were mad at you know something I mean it is it it it's it's awful every everybody is walking you to comment section essentially and that's what Twitter and I think some social media has become\nPeople didn't like they don't like they didn't they didn't like the trumps tone on the Caribbean and they're trying to when he was saying that people just can't enter the country illegally and somehow they're saying that that was where that kind of fuel this which again the guy who did this didn't like the president at all and even said so and his verified social media accounts which apparently\nStill exist on Twitter all of these people who were concerned about tone where the hell where these people when you have folks like Andrew Cuomo who made the declaration that people who who were Second Amendment or who were pro life for people who\nYou know that they had no place in New York or where I'm a a ... you had a bill de Blasio saying similar or or wrong Emanuel's saying that these people who believe in in in a Christian faith or cetera et cetera that they have no place in New York or no place in Chicago or\nYou know they they don't belong here they where where where people when when they were expressing that sort of\nThat sort of rhetoric and let me ask you this where the ever levine Haiti's where these people if they were so concerned about tone and they were so concerned and they're so upset at the administration if you're mad at the administration\nThen wouldn't you also it's just going down that same line wouldn't you also be infuriated over somebody like Louis Farrakhan calling the people who are Jewish calling them termites\nAnd that video is still available and Twitter wouldn't that also make you angry wouldn't it make you angry that this guy and his hatred has been mainstream wouldn't make you angry that he stood there on stage at a reader Franklin's funerals shoulder to shoulder with Bill Clinton or that the previous administration\nHe was he was a buddy buddy with the previous president I mean if you're going to go after this administration my point is is where where's your post protest stationed over this guy\nIf you cared so much about it why were you not up in arms that he had to verify to count and still does on certain platforms and he was sharing his hatred\nAnd that it\nWas mainstream D ... rub shoulders with celebrities the people that you see on cable news are his friends he is the advisor envy mentor of the people who founded the women's march who rushed to defend in protest him where are you up in arms over that\nIf you think that it was the administration's fault where is your consistency\nAnd furthermore what he said anything remotely close to what this guy has pleased by all means change my mind\nI have to touch on some of the media headlines about this coming up as well I'm also some of the inconsistencies and how one platform as being targeted and others are not I'm
