transparency is a bad thing I'm just saying he\nDoesn't have great political argument because that requires I think hyper smarts to do that and it was this one doesn't really have it either as she's proven by her troubling down on all of this nonsense still going off on Twitter and that but this is so much better than us if she would have run\nAs everyone thought she was going to last cycle I think she would have knocked Hillary out of contention and it would have been between those in foreign and Bernie Sanders\nI really think that because Warren has more support in the Democratic base and Hillary Clinton does and I would argue did at the time\nBecause ah the only reason that Hillary was still even\nUm at some point a contender was because Bill Clinton\nWas raising money and could raise a lot of money for Democrats and now they don't care because you know they're not they're not entertaining her anymore because she's not going to do anything but that's an Elizabeth Warren could have run that was before the Kamala Harris as it was before Cory\nBooker really became Spartacus that's it it's before the Swalwell it's before really all of those individuals kind of tried out crazy each other to take center stage and so you might ask well why in the world is she doing this because she's not up for re election right now\nIt's not a presidential cycle it's still a little bit early to be positioning yourself that much in a race that's still a couple of years off why is\nShe doing this and I think it's because people forgot she existed because she's she's on the Senate Judiciary committee and who were the people\nThat everybody was watching the last couple of weeks Senate Judiciary committee who are the people that were making headlines the Senate Judiciary committee over and over and over again who are the people that were you know questioning\nYou know the sessions is and who were the questioning the Kavanaugh is the first time around who are the people that question to Gorsuch all the Senate Judiciary committee and so these individuals have been in the news for a really long time\nAnd she was\nNot getting her headline she was not keeping her name out there because she's not on that committee so she had to think of something how in the world\nCan I maintain some relevancy get my name in the headlines and make it look like I Am ... I Am a contender and then I Am\nBetter than the Kamala Harris isn't the Spartacus says well I'll do this I Will I Will walk so far down this\nPath to a certain ... certain point and do this\nAnd I think also there's this perception amongst Democrats that whoever can go toe to toe with Trump and zinc wish him politically\nThat's the savior of the Democrat Party and I think they're all trying to audition for that in various ways and that's what I think all contributes to why Elizabeth Warren did what she did and with a stupid DNA test\nAnd that is I mean that's that's kind of\nThe that's the way of it so she was doing this because\nShe needed to get her name out there and she also wanted to be seen as the person who could think wish Trump\n\nBut it kind of backfired it totally backfires and it looked absolutely ridiculous I mean you have oh Cherokee Nation which cannot you have a bunch of ...\nThere was a Democrat socialist there had to call them out I don't remember where 'cause I don't care enough falling as they had a column about where they were criticizing her I'm not going to kill my brain cells reading some barely legible\nJust ... I'm not doing it about Democrats\nI'm not reading it because I better things to do and I just don't care that much there are certain things I just don't have enough energy to care that much about and that's one of them all you need to know some Democrats officials was criticizing her\nBecause they thought it was bad it was bad\nShe may have actually ticked off her on base you know her own base the
