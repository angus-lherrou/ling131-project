is that how was that sitting with these individuals now previously a\nI don't know that the the media is interested in this story not because they care about journalist I don't think being jailed otherwise they'd be all up on are the ones jock [noise] but I\nThink it's also has to do with again it goes back to a struggle between the balance of power in the region whether it's Saudi Arabia or whether it's Iran and if this individual was and he was according to New York times article just from a couple of months ago he was a member of Muslim Brotherhood he was a says he was he was very very pro Palestine who was\nVery very anti what Saudi Arabia's royal family was doing and as how they were positioning to being supportive towards Israel a very very unhappy with that which is where a lot of huge thrust of his discontent meant and criticism and his pieces came from\nUm and so it was maybe they just you know they didn't want that influence out there he was aligned with members of the royal family who were very very much more extremist than\nThe ones who are now going on the charm offensive at at this particular time and so that is I think that in order to discuss that story you just you have to you have to admit all of that stuff and put it in there you I mean you just you have to [noise] so we're going to continue following that story also did you go see what happened over the weekend with\nMitch McConnell to things that really fascinated\nMe about this story or Mitch McConnell if you I don't know where if you you know he was in a restaurant with his wife Elaine Chao who by the way you don't mess with her I don't know who these people think they are but there there are just you know there's some people\nThat you just don't mess with a lien is one of\nThose ladies you just don't mess with her do you remember how when they were stopped coming out of their house and Mitch McConnell calmly gets into the SUV and she ... she goes over transportation secretary she marches ride over to the other side of the vehicle and she's all up in these people's faces\nI mean tiger mom unleashed so they were at a restaurant and they were having dinner in Kentucky and some do sure decides\nTo get in their face\nAnd he grabs Mitch McConnell's doggy bag of food throws it outside\nAnd he was screaming at him why don't you get outta here why don't you leave the entire country and what gets me and I am going to play the video for you but what gets me is the woman who uh I don't know if it was the woman who shot the video ... someone\nActually had the wherewithal to go I'm going to sell this to TMZ I'm going to sell this footage to TMZ\n\nThinks like this instead of stopping\nYou know somebody from being completely ignorant you're thinking almost so this footage to TMZ my gosh we live in South\nPark this [noise]\nThis is where we are so this this guy decides to go full on Leroy Jenkins at Mitch McConnell and his restaurant right [laughter] and\nDecides to go along\nAnd can before\nAt before other customers smartly get out and and decide to uh put a stop to it because they were tired of it [noise]\nSo anyway I'm going to places where I Want you to listen to this video 'cause this is what was recorded a and a ultimately ended up on the Web or net this was Mitch McConnell getting screened bat in a restaurant [laughter]\n\n\nSo [laughter]\nThe woman I don't know if it was the woman recording the video of it with someone sitting at her table but I heard that ... that one person said\nDad which and then I see you guys remember\nChristopher walking in the continental enough and now you remember the ... you got to go watch it if go look for it go Google it if you've never seen it because this is one of my favorite character\nChristopher Walken ever played I watch this and I was in in school it was so good\nIt's ... he's talking to the camera and then the camera without stretching arm it was always something like chubby fingered arm with a glove on it\nAnyway right after somebody said the ... which I see somebody with the continental chubby hand grabbing a margarita and second it down and I'm like really anyway that really just stuck with me that and the fact that someone goes I'm On the sale ... sell it\nWho thinks like that but thankfully there was a table of people that decided to shut this guy out they were tired of it this guy was having an entire he he goes in there and nobody comes to his rescue\nHe's screaming at Mitch McConnell who's sitting there\nLike a father in law just looking chilling you know sip and his his sipping his cold drink very slowly and Elaine Chao just confront them I don't even know what it said but I see her head shaking so I Know it's like we're on full on level tiger mom mode here says she's not having it and the guy screaming and hollering\nHow sad are you in life that you decide that you're going to bust up in a restaurant and do this to somebody\nBy the way it's not free speech when you're on someone else's private property doing this crap because you believe in private property rights don't you or are you a communist because then that the business owner 'cause they get out scream all you want to but on somebody's private property they throw you out screw your free speech\nDid you hear the customers actually told and leave him alone yeah that was pretty cool yeah that and I'm so glad that they did that I'm so glad that they did that\nI I I'm [laughter] I'm\nI'm I was just shocked by all of this so we have that that happened over the weekend\nWas this guy screaming at Mitch McConnell and apparently this is I I'm not going to accept this is a new normal I'm I'm just not so in in Florida the New York post I Can't even play any of this I Can't play single bit of this
