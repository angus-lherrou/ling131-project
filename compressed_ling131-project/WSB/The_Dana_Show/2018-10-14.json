{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WSB", "content": "Miserable so ah\nIf you want you you certainly can I don't think much is going to come of it or they're going to do a bar investigation he's going to obviously have to defend themselves probably hire a lawyer or an expert in representing a representing a [laughter] that would represent their lawyers that represent lawyers in front of the bar\nAnd um you know I was ah oh and I I once had a complaint against me that was quite had a couple of complaints against these crazy crazy complaints ... a basic based on the handling the law the advice I give because some people it took me seriously I\nRelied on that so anyway but I had to ah you know I brought in a lawyer or who specialize in this the first time out ah when I was actually frightened nine now and her father so it's your call here called do I think\nAnything's going to come of it no why as I said because it wasn't a conflict it was the whites you were a notch\nUh being uh you were not a she was not being representative wasn't a divorce case where there was clearly a conflict so ah I just think the two of them got it on\nA daily rate there you are owed anyway yes\nUm um oh\nGod I hate these winds All right let's try it does but starting young\nWe just lost you know there shouldn't be technology\nOut there that overcomes this wouldn't you think by this day and age\nI mean we can send the guy to the moon that doesn't work anymore in the last time there was a guy on the moon was in the seventies\nSo that's kind of stupid so we're gonna be able to we can send a guide to Mars right at some point as well because ... calls back All right oh hello Chris welcome to handle on the law Chris oh yeah there's\nA new tax law that allows me to a man that tax return from Eighteen years ago it could get a refund of character paid on military severance pay back then I was married to someone that I cannot locate now are hiding from having to pay ... or\nSo I have no way of contacting her and I haven't heard from earn like sixteen years I don't know how to manage a tax return that would join with only one signature\nAh there there has to be a way of doing that because if the law allows someone to file\nAn amended return Twenty years later Eighteen years later a there's a a decent chance at the other partner their spouse or a ... he's not around either can't be found somewhere out there on remarried died whatever so I there there has to be a way within the rules of the IRS\nBecause the Irish is pretty good about issuing five thousand new rules every other minute so the trick is to find an accountant straight out accountant who understands these rules\nAnd now when you file your tax returns you have an accountant\nChris yeah yeah\nHave you asked your accountant about this\nYes and he wasn't curve anywhere you could do it then you have and I happen to have an appointment with the Iraq on friday\nAnd that is yeah that's the way\nI'm Glad you're asking me because of my vast expertise would not only this is tax law or this or tax returns and of course I you know when I have a complicated problem do you think I shouldn't researcher look it up now I go to Mike counting crash\nJust like you did not what you did is you went a step beyond and that is what I Would tell you if your account and doesn't know or several accountants you make an appointment with the IRS and you didn't\nMind it projected that I actually find it myself [noise] and um maybe no picnic or just magically appears\nNow now I I I don't know I don't know if I Would do that I don't know if I Would do that what I Would say to the IRS is\nDo I have to find her and uh then I Will then I'll go to extraordinary lengths to find her\nAnd that's when I go out that many grand behind the counter right that's another issue in there and they made this and you and and you may be able to get the whole thing okay\nBased on the child support order so I the magical signature ah she's she's still entitled to half of that\nYeah now there could be a way where and this happens all the time with child support the IRS holds off needle grab people's money\nAre cases in that that stayed right now we're ... supposed to be around her\nOkay so you're halfway there definitely time to talk to and IRS agent and and if the IRS agent doesn't know that rule specifically and it doesn't have any experience or or it doesn't really understand that you go to a supervisor and you ask for someone who understands what's going on because it's a pretty obscure stuff\nAnd it's not as if ah and I are ... who doesn't I understand this is incompetent in any way I mean if you ever look at the IRS code if you've ever look at the Internal Revenue code\nThese our phone books thick with hundreds of thousands of rules\nAnd you're not normally supposed to be able to amend after three years\nWell they've changed the law I Wonder if you want to ask me I would've said no but if they passed a law that is a different than we are in great shape\nIt's for military better yeah obviously hack on February ... yeah All right so is are any of 'em out there to get their return\nSo we're talking about a very narrow narrow description of a very narrow group of people and so you simply need someone who understands it and you're doing everything right man I'm there's nothing more I can give you other than you're doing everything right\nAlso let me tell you about life like here's something they do right and life lock protects your identity and of

a\nLate summer dog days if you will always tough tough bass fish and I get a little bit of a ... a lot of suspended fish they're hard to target and that went on forever because of the state so warm and get this extended suffer but now that this is ... we saw a change in last week they were ready to go but now\nThings are really starting to happen and that's the good news is energized bass fishing\nIf there's a downside to it or if there's a footnote to it the one drawback is we are at this time of year as official scatter out you have the new and all that you might have ten different patterns or versatility\nIt's called the bank king because it changes because you have to change you know now that front should start rolling in\nA weekly or every five days and that changes things

gesture ... by\n... ... ...\nYeah then you start and with the ... of ... fish will start seeing those are an area like now the water temperature is falling down into the seventies\nSo you got fish in a whole water column you can happen anywhere and you might\nCatch one with the Powell top brackets woman with a spoon and fifty five he\nAsked me my answers off of everything\nI had someone or during his fishing trip I just got back from was a marveling at uh the fact that he had this past summer he had called stripe or at a fifty feet\nAnd I didn't want to upstate gym but I said I said really ah when you go more you'll find out there are a lot deeper than that that's a nice time and he still look at the deep water [laughter] that's right we've got\nWe've got one two summers ago at Ninety seven feet in\nThe eight so you all about I remember that there's about ... uh-huh right shows you got to talk of the bell watch them and then the eight feet of water and fired brash great\nGot you got you got that memory down but it or I I watch people what should the next couple of weeks now if not hiring you are or another guide or whatever the fish the lake what would you tell the weekend fisherman do you do it with me or to get some good old spotted bass\nGreat question and all that activity or the bulk of the activity or is centering around lane like\nA ... okay so twenty five to thirty feet\nAnd there's a lot of ... people ... rush on these all these hot spot ... top water over him if you just want to catch fish and all the numbers your bass fishing or ... or drop shots will be hard to beat for numbers inconsistency you catch it\nBigger fish all the top water or if you get the patient ... around that rush you get the bigger bite maybe okay that fast that it looked for what did you look at the high spots in the creeks are all the main like twenty five thirty seat and actually a lot of the stripers are oriented to the same places if you're ... you're just relying alive hearing over those areas\nOr maybe putting winding down a little bit with a split shot and then cast stop or\nEven though you're the top of ... maybe twenty five feet you can pull ... water that they they just\nTold me that he can be aggressive guinea\nYeah she'll come and get it so that's the best the structure you on the key on it I think ah that'll plot a lot of lakes as well\nOkay let me ask you a question him by and large just as a general rule general observe observation would you use a bigger bait and be more successful with a bigger bite in the fall and spring\nLike so I think they'll feed on bigger base whether ... treatment bigger top waters and water storm enough right now we're still in the upper seventies so you've got stationed there pretty active they'll respond a bigger bite and they're willing to chase when you get in the spring and depending on what bar spring we're talking about water temperatures in the fifties\nAnd you'll probably find them respond a smaller banks better so yeah I think now bigger bikes are better\nI agree also I figure I'll ask her lawyer with the top ... station mhm mhm to South America always\nAlways enjoy your reports are and I hope you get some good reaction from it or have a seat seven seven zero to seven one oh wait five one\nMemory lacking health law and look like one to this morning [laughter]\nOh there was certainly

Facebook\nPage where we'll send over later my breath matter of fact thanks for calling back\nYes sir I have a great weekend on the water in the field and joy\nYou bet there you go hey uh let's see let's talk to a gym he's calling from Monroe, Georgia go more to Jim what do you say\nGood morning man I just wanted to say thank you very much professor old Neal what ... what you do portion how are you a certain value woke me up one morning when I was ...\nMax side on the couch and you should get out there and the wind and\nThis will be going on my six year and for the last five years what you said was very true all and now I've sort of crazy I guess now look for the windy days and even even study them more than I Do the other days but I still hunt pretty much but to eighty percent of the the hunting time and guns season so\nI just want to let people know that you really and truly feel Bush doesn't cost us a thing it will listen and pay attention that's all we got to do well thank\nYou very much that's a that's\nA confirmation coming from you that I value highly because I say at ad nauseam the more you know the more you understand the more successful you can be in the outdoors\n[noise] and we were at a lake in North Carolina a very good like and uh so we thought we'd go out there and give it a try a little bit because we were going to do a show so we need to test the waters out a little bit and the the the air temperature was twenty four it was late November\nThe surface temperature of the water at in the lake was forty two now I got to tell you uh\nTo me that combination of air temperature twenty four but more importantly the water do you have to you're forty two that's one of those days when you can look at your partner and say I think I got a bite\nBecause at forty two water temperature you're not going to get me so how did we do and why am I talking about this in this fashion we're back to that expertise that the you'll back cast and why a professional can use every airline when you should be using like\nTax maybe in that list we fish for two hours in this very special place day the and I did I was in the front of the boat and I was using a a a\nA mob Jake bulldog lures I think bulldog by a mob Jake and so was Davey same color\nIn two hours a week ... seven large mouth\nThat weighed thirty five pounds were it was fabulous\nI caught two from the front of a boat and Davey caught five from the back of the vote\n\nNow I think that's about truth Davey is at least two and a half times better than me\nAnd that's why a seasoned professional that goes fishing every single week\nYear round king case just as many with heavy tackle as you can with a lot to tackle but if you use light tackle you'll get more bites okay let's talk now to Larry is calling from Atlanta own oatmeal outside good morning ...\nLaws do good and hurting\nShared is in the middle and grab normal low yet to go ... well yeah\nWell he did he and he did go
