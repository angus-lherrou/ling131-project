here's Matt with the ramp fishy report go more to Mac good morning now are you good luck to you species getting good in\nAll this uh this cooler weather long overdue but didn't energized fish specially bass oh boy yeah it's got to move in a\nLate summer dog days if you will always tough tough for bashed vision I get a little bit of a ... a lot of suspended fish they're hard to target and that went on forever because of state so warm we got this extended summer but now that this is ... we saw a change in the last week they were ready to go but now\nThings are really starting to happen and that's the good news is energized bass fishing\nIf there's a downside to it or if there's a footnote to it the one drawback is we are at this time years official scatter out you have the new and all that you might have ten different patterns or versatility\nIt's called the bank king because it changes because you have to change you know now that front should start rolling in\nA weekly or every five days and that changes things are kind of get a weather change and then you got turned over to deal with but bottom line is the fishing responded well to the school in weather in here on the near particularly a standard gesture ... by\n... ... ...\nYeah then you start and with the trial of Schreiber shot looks her school issued will start seeing those are an area like the water temperatures are falling down into the seventies\nYou got fish in a whole water column you can have a meaning\nAnd whether a pow on top brackets on with a spoon and fifty [laughter]\nFinances off of everything I had someone or during his fishing trip I just got back from was a marveling at uh the fact that he had this past summer he had called stripe or at a fifty feet\nAnd I didn't want to upstate gym but I said I said really ah when you go more you'll find out there are a lot deeper than that that's a nice time and he's still look at the deep water [laughter] that's right we got we got one two summers ago at Ninety seven feet in\nNinety eight so you know the bottom I remember that there's about ... uh-huh right shows you like to talk of the bell watched bone and Ninety eight feet of water and fire rash great\nGot you got you got that memory down but it or I watch people what should the next couple of weeks now if not hiring you are or another guide or whatever the fish the lake what would you tell the weekend fisherman do you do it when they are to get some good old spotted bass\nGreat question and all the activities are the bulk of the activity or is centering around lane like\nA ... okay so twenty five to thirty feet\nAnd there's a lot of ... near ... ... ... ... and the ... top water over him if you just want to catch fish and all the numbers bashed fish in a row ... drop shots going to be hard to beat for numbers inconsistency\nYou catch it bigger fish all the top water or if you've got to pay ... around that rush you get the bigger bite my okay\n... ... it looked for look ... look at the high spots in the ... like twenty five thirty feet and actually a lot of the stripers are oriented to the same places if you're ... you're just relying alive here over those areas\nOr maybe you couldn't winding down a little bit with a split shot and then cast stop or\nEven though you're the top of ... about maybe twenty five feet you can pull ... out of water that they needed\nTo oh yeah he can be aggressive ...\nYeah she'll come and get it so that's a the ... the structure you on the key on and I think ah that'll plot a lot of like says well\nOkay let me ask you a question him by and large just as a general rule general observe observation will you use a bigger bait and be more successful with a bigger ... in the fall and spring\nLike so I think they'll feed on bigger base where there's lot Baker even bigger top waters and water storm enough right now we're still in the upper seventies so you got stationed there pretty active bill respond a bigger bite and they're willing to chase when you get in the spring and depending on what bar spring we're talking about water temperatures in the fifties\nAnd you'll probably find them respond a smaller bites better so yeah I think now bigger bikes are better\nI agree also a bigger faster and lawyers for the top ... station mhm mhm something match always\nAlways enjoy your reports are and I hope you get some good reaction from it or have a say seven seven zero to seven one oh wait five on\nMemory lacking health and and my and look light one to this morning [laughter]\nOh there was certainly a was in the ramp fishing report over will send it over your Facebook page later on this morning so people\nGet a neo hey great idea so the ramp fishing report will be on O'Neill outside Facebook page where you will send over later my friend matter of fact thanks for\nYes or by a great weekend on the water in the fields and joy\nYou bet there you go hey uh [noise] let's see let's talk to a gym he's calling from Monroe, Georgia go more to Jim what do you say\nGood morning and I just wanted to say thank you very much professor old Neal what up for what you do for ... how are you a tournament how you woke me up one morning when I was ...\nBack side on the couch and you should get out there and we ended\nUp with this will be going on my six year and for the last five years what you said was very true\n... and now ... crazy I guess now look to the windy days and even even study them more than I Do there are other days but I still hunt pretty much but to eighty percent of the the hunting time and go ... and so I just want to let people know that you really and truly\nFeel Bush doesn't cost us a thing will listen and pay attention that's all we got to do well thank\nYou very much that's a that's a confirmation coming from you that I value highly because I say at ad nauseam the more you know the more you understand the more successful you can be in the outdoors\nThe surface temperature of the water at in the lake was forty two now I got to tell you uh\nTo me that combination of air temperature of twenty four but more importantly the water to empty or forty two that's one of those days when you can look at your partner and say I think I got a bite because\nAt forty two water temperature you're not going to get me\nSo how did we do and why am I talking about this in this fashion we're back to that expertise that the you'll that cast and why a professional can use every airline when you should be using ... maybe\nIn that this we fish for two hours in this very special place Davy and I did I was in the front of the boat and I was using a\nA of a mob Jake bulldog lures I think both by a mob Jake and so was Davey same color in two hours a week ... seven large mouth\nThat weighed thirty five pounds were it was fabulous\nI caught two from the front of a boat and Davey caught five from the back of the boat\nNow I think that's about truth Davey is at least two and a half times better than me\nAnd that's why a seasoned professional that goes fishing every single week year round can't catch just as many with Eddie tackle as you can with a lot to tackle but if you use light tackle you'll get more bites\nOkay let's talk now to Larry is calling from Atlanta own oatmeal outside good morning layer\nLaws do good I had heard is ... million grandma below yet to go ... well yeah\nWell he did he and he did go he caught a limit every day a man which was not unusual\n\nThis week twenty four hour drive et cetera green thirty three and the glory and carrier WSBIU twenty four hour traveled to the red alert in effect bill in Clayton County ...\nWe're I Seventy five fifty eight all laying shut down traffic is now being diverted off on to choose for route exit fifty five and that's a good alternative to get around this but once you can't ... shutdown Clinton County\nI to any five westbound the interlude before I Seventy five exit fifty eight traffic all is all being diverted off on to choose for road exit fifty five I'm Mike shields W. S. B.\nAnglers Sherry patient\nPatients when you try to catch fish\nYes\nAll the time it's all night all college right [laughter]\nOh yeah those are those are the good days to\nBoil yeah chess or is\nThere [laughter] yeah you're not always worn out trying to real something in huh\nOh yeah you just some jobs that are leaving all checked to see they didn't have lived on this day\nI I Know that uh as you can well imagine uh people think all I Do is just go hunting and fishing and I I Am for the and that's not the case but I Am fortunate in that I Do get to go to a lot a lot and I get to go to some very very special places\nLike investor\nBut I Am but people will ask me watch the best day you've had lately on the water\nAnd it my answer usually is the day that I went that it didn't matter whether I caught anything or not [laughter] as\nNo camera in the boat client in the boat [laughter] I just sat there and look around and sell those are the best days and so you don't always have failed a boat if that's what made a lot to you then you should\nBut you don't always have to fill the boat\nDestroy water ... and the sun down to stay out there and get out there when they open a shelter that are more states so dark and ... that I made a lot of people\nThey are fisherman are are very gregarious group thanks for calling ...\n... ... yeah that's\nWhat hey All right you're a good
