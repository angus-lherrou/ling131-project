think Jerry cautionary says it without Jared Kushner this doesn't get done president promises he delivered it now people are going to pick it apart I guess but it's hard to see it as not improvement since it seemed to be so bent backwards for Canada as well as Mexico\nBut that was Twenty years ago and things have changed with this thing called the Internet now\nSo a lot going on and of course the number one story continues to be the investigation that started over the weekend almost immediately as the president said the FBI go investigate some of these allegations\nOn a cabinet or a bread cabinet and one of which got them speaking to Debbie remarriage she's on the New Yorker article a magazine article\nAnd then the other one they might and most likely will speak to Dr Ford but there are definitely going to speak to her best friend who does not see things the way he dead mark judge you'll definitely speak too but the other question is do you speak to the other woman who talked about having you know this these ... these\nGang rapes that they they they really claim I Believe that a break capital was drugging the punch in knocking women out I mean this is unbelievable but do you even do marginalize that\nOr do you just take that all and Judy listening in the story of queens\nHey Judy\nHi listen I Am actually in ... by an attorney in my twenties and here's what I have to say I don't know what it points that anything can be one way or the other but we\nHave to wait for that to play out and the FBI has to be able to have an open hand to be able to do all of the nation job in Chile important like daddy\nDied I watched every cat and I\nAnd a half an hour and ... and what bothers me about him it hit me hey here I understand the heat that accusation but he ... he had the ... yeah you can be hey\nDid you like his interview moss ...\nDid you like his interview with Martha ... did you like that temperament now because people said that was wouldn't and detached ...

allegations but they go back to high school he sees it all going by the boards he sees his parents over his right shoulder his children have to deal with that in school and he spoke from the heart he wrote it down I really thought it was effective\nI'm sure if you felt it was offensive but just put yourself in his shoes everything you've earned it obtained was thrown in the street by people you don't even know who had no food no plans to even vote for you anyway Here's Senator Jeff Flake cut one\nI don't think anybody expected to\nUm you know what happened on friday to happen and ah [noise]

[noise] elevator and watching it in committee and just thinking this since we're up in our country apart\nYeah well it is a but it's not your fault or Senator Jeff flake or is he he's a conservative judge with uh someone from high school who the ... who that judge never knew it claims that I Know and it's up to you to make that judgment but you've extended for a week and\nNow we know that it's only because you're retiring you would never have done it if you were not retiring really\nSo instead of watching from your moral compass you do you act as a political calculation some say is all about you running for president which would be a joke because you just don't have the popularity I think Jeff likes a great guy\nGreat person I think you are great in the country I think he's single

owes view of judge\nA Kevin Alice temperament my view is that he was treated very badly and had every right to do what he did he's going to be a great judge and he's got to be on the Supreme Court\nWell ... well he has to do with Lindsey Graham is if he does get on the Supreme Court he's probably done more than anybody else to get them there but what about the investigation itself what is the FBI actually doing are they going to hand over a bunch of their interviews and say do what you want with it and we know that politicians will\nAsher or Rob ... is a a former FBI special agent she's been through this before cut twenty two\nI don't know what their instructions are but if other people were to be referenced in interviews and those those could be potential lean that people who have additional information that could shed light on the underlying allegation that would absolutely be people that the FBI and the normal course of a background check like this would interview\nHe that's what I was bringing up because we are near as the New Yorker accuser says well I got friends they want to talk and now you have the former girlfriend mark judge the best with a former\nBest friend of judge Kavanaugh who says yeah I'd like to talk about mark judge and when he saw really I mean this is this is Jeff Flake out in mind\nHere's Andrew McCarthy cut Nineteen\nThis investigation is not a trial this investigation as an exercise of\nThe Senate constitutional advice and consent authority and typically what the FBI would do in a background check\nIs simply flag issues for the Senate and then it's up to the Senate to decide how relevant they are and the degree to which they go to the to the nominees character and professional actor human\nSo that's what the investigation is supposed to be about it's not a full blown criminal investigation and it's not preparation for a\nTrial [noise] going on I I mean I get to see you want to get all the information for thirty six years

improprieties decades ago against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh including apparently a woman who Christine Blasey Ford says attended the same Nineteen eighties party where says four and she was attacked by Kevin all also interviewed mark judge Dr\nChristine Blasey Ford has named him as the other person in the room watching his Brett Kavanaugh allegedly assaulted her\nA couple of times they made contact with mark and thought he may try to help me [noise] and she did not\nTonight his attorney releasing a statement which the judge has been interviewed by the FBI but his interview has not been completed ABC's peer\nDonnelly is because remember I had some pretty harsh words on friday for Joe Donnelly because Joe Donnelly was saying I just don't know if I can go and and support Kavanaugh cetera et cetera which is ... was completely opposite to what I was hearing from voters in my WABC market\nEverybody all over Indiana voters are pretty upset about it because if a state that Trump took ... you know heavily so he is that\nKind of and now donnelley's back on the fence he's waiting to see what the investigation turns out before he considers the nomination so they may get Joe Donnelly to support the non they may get him to support cabinet nominee Joe Manchin has signaled that he would be supportive of that Heidi Heitkamp a signal she would be supportive of it so you're stripping away\nSome of these more moderate Democrats into supporting the nominee which could be it it depends on how colored your perspective is if you remove emotion from it and you just look at it as a way of strategy what it does is it is it shuts them up and it and I'm\nGoing to argue destroy it shut them up and it opens it up to their true argument because they're already moving goalpost let me put this element let me open this up for you so Chris Murphy tweeted yes of course there should be an FBI investigation but whatever they find doesn't change the fact\nThat Kavanaugh especially after his performance is the most dangerous Supreme Court pick of our lifetimes he doesn't\nIt was never about one week that was just a bunch of hogwash it was never about one week that was such a lie it was\nEver ever about one week over\nAt this ... this it was never about that this was all about just stopping him period this is never about a week\nAnd then you have this piece in Politico this was a real headline I'm about to share with you in terms of moving goalpost now they say quote by the FBI should investigate boosting\nIt's a real you don't believe me I'll put it in flat so you can see what I'm Talking about I Swear to you\nSwear to you it's a real sea look that look at as a real headline I had a I had to convince cane that there was a real thing because that's how stupid it is yeah\nIt was never about one week so again I'm telling you there's two ways that you can look at this\nAt the at the at the Jeff Flake thing now this is the one way I'm going to tell you but the second way to look at it here in a minute the first week of look at it is\nHe's giving cover to these moderate Democrats hike camp Donnelly mansion and mention has already\nSignaled that he would be interested in supporting Kavanaugh it gives cover to the Murkowski isn't the columnist who come from kind of purple districts anyway it gives them cover to support this nominee and just you know bulldoze over opposition on the floor when it comes time to open debate for the nomination right\nSo that's one way to look at it and at the same time it also shows that it was never about the FBI investigation and it was never about one week\nSo you could look at it that way or you could look at at the other way what changes what changes\nWhat is it what is the seventh FBI investigation going to find that the six previous ones didn't what is another FBI investigation going to find particularly after he was nominated to the federal court years ago\nWhat does the seventh one gonna find\nI mean it it is it deflects retiring he can he's just worried about his legacy what is what is the ... what do they know the other one going to find\nThat's the other big question here's the thing\nI don't think that this is you could you you could think that Jeff Flake was is it is a total compromise run that he screwed over the geo pills so this is the second way to look at it\nBecause this whole entire thing priest opposes that Democrats are in any way acting in good faith\nThis whole thing another week of investigations priests opposes that they're approaching is from a a fixed point of good faith does it\nSeem after watching the last week unfold two weeks of old that anything these people dont have done it in any way indicative\nOf good faith withholding the name\nWithholding that the an accusation instead of if it was so serious why did they sit on it for six weeks\nIf you're acting in good faith do you sit on a serious allegation for six weeks\nAlmost two months do you keep it from your colleagues\nDo you do not refer it to the FBI for an actual investigation\nOr when you finally do send it over because you're you're staffers are bickering do reject enough portions of the letter that it's completely irrelevant including a name and a number of of of significant pieces of information\nIs that is that do you think that that's acting in good faith do you think that it's acting\nIn good faith that for two weeks people sit here and go well we need to have another FBI investigation we need to have the FBI look into this and then now that the FBI looked into this they're saying well there's they're not going to have to find anything in one week\nSo wait a minute it was important enough for you to say that\nAnd one of the better look into it but now your daddy and the FBI ability to actually look into it\nDoes that sound like that's in good faith you any of it because the none of that stuff sounds like it's in good faith to me\nAll of this it was serious enough only to bring it up now it wasn't serious enough to report it to the authorities when you've got the accusations it wasn't serious enough to bring up back in two thousand and six when he was first nominated to be a federal judge\nIs that it because that's not in good faith none of that is in good faith\n\nDo you think it's in good faith to leak it to the media\nBecause it doesn't sound like leaving it to the media is acting in good faith\nSo that's the other way to look at it you can look at it like flake compromised to a bunch of people who have no interest in acting in good faith that all whatsoever\nSo these are the two ways that you look at it I actually think it's a bit of both I think that they both can be true\nAnd maybe not equal parts but I think that they both can be true I think both of these things can coexist and both me to answer\n\nThat is um\nThat's I and I think that's the situation here\n\nBut the ... we had just this is this week we're going to probably hear even now everyone's focusing on the drinking which we are going to talk about a moment the goal posts are moving\nNow it's well you know really can't be because the investigation is only supposed to be limited to what is public and it's not supposed to last any more than one week Rosenstein apparently told like that it's going to completely the costs are going to get it done within a week\n\nOf course they will I had a question to that I had asked earlier and I haven't gotten a good enough to answer to it um I was I was curious as to whether or not um I was curious as to whether or not Dr Ford is going to release to the FBI her therapists notes that she's refused to release to the Senate Judiciary committee because\nSee this is what happened when the FBI investigate this isn't a criminal this is just back another background check if they find anything\nYesterday refer it to the Senate Judiciary committee\nSo why would you not share therapists notes which is the key part of what you claim is your ... the cooperation of your story to the Senate Judiciary committee how how can you have a full investigation when you're a therapist knows where you say you first told you first mentioned Brett Kavanaugh\nFrom back in ... well when you won't make those public when you won't make them available to the individuals that are investigating the situation and come into a determination based on the available evidence\nI Wonder how do you hope to have a fair and and real investigation when you're withholding pertinent\nEvidence I don't I think\nThere's I think the investigation is a sham until she gives up or therapists notes and the questions to the polygraph\n... if they were in good faith interested in a real investigation those things would have been made available to the Senate Judiciary committee immediately\nFirst and foremost the whole damn accusation would have been set on for two months all of that would have been available to the Senate Judiciary committee and the fact that it wasn't makes me question any good faith effort from this party and it undermines any credibility that anybody may have\n\nAnd that is not the fault of the Republicans it is not the fault of Grassley it is not the fault of of of of Lindsey Graham it is not the fault of Brett Kavanaugh it's not the fault of anyone in terms of how that was handled\nSo I think it's a bit of both with a lot of not good faith movements\nAnd then we have the Mitchell memo believe all women accept Rachel Mitchell were going to discuss that because Rachel Mitchell doubles down and says there's not enough evidence there even go to court with that there's not enough evidence air to substantiate even an investigation\nWe're going to talk about that as well coming up and can you expect\n... James Comey weighed in with an editorial yesterday do you expect a fair investigation\nI mean there's enough they're raise that question\nWe have a ... coming up Senator Ted Cruz is going to join us later on in the program uh and uh we'll talk with him about this as well we also have a Florida Man and today in stupidity and our regular weekly mid term update will have all of that for you in the meantime get ahead start before\nEverybody else head of the holidays because it's October so you actually you can you really if you actually have to start thinking about that now a this is the best time if you want to get your blinds you change your shutters your windows updated\nAnd it was ... by the Atlantic city council changes Confederate avenue to United avenue\nNational League west high breaker Dodgers beat the Rockies by two that means the Braves will play in LA Thursday for Dame won the national league division series game too will also be a Dodger Stadium game three and gain for if necessary back here at ... park\nBrewers take that actually central ... three to one over the cubs Chicago will host Colorado and the national league wildcard game at Wrigley Field on Tuesday\nThe American league wildcard game as Wednesday the AIDS traveling to New York to face the Yankees chiefs read the Broncos on Monday Night football twenty seven twenty three and a ...
