Wisconsin while campaigning for fellow Republicans called for cooling down political rhetoric\nThis I'm looking at more the also the Clintons the Clinton went through a male sorting facility so it doesn't actually go to their house\nBut it went to a sorting facility\nUh CNN was evacuated or some time ago the White House issued a statement saying we condemn the attempted violent attacks recently made against\nA former President Obama or Clinton Secretary Clinton and other public figures these terrorizing acts are despicable and anyone responsible\nWill be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law the United states Secret Service and other law enforcement agencies are investigating and we'll take all appropriate actions to protect anyone threatened by these cowards and then there was also\nLet's pull a this up as well\nUh there was a statement also from Mitch McConnell he issued\nOne a little earlier saying quote I stand with all Americans in condemning today's attempted acts of domestic terrorism and as we continue to learn more Americans are United in gratitude for the first responders the secret service the postal service and other law enforcement who protect our leaders in public figures from such unconscionable acts and quote\nSo this is the latest as we are kind of watching to see exactly what comes like ... is there anything else what else is there good grief\n[noise] um but I think you I think it's safe to if it's I think that was all organized um and to me that makes it terrorism\nThat makes it terrorism and apparently a so let me see New York is saying that\nThe Soros Clinton was Soros Clinton\nA Cuomo and I think the CNN one\nWas they that they are all linked I Would imagine all of them are like not just those I think those are just on the ones that they were able to confirm and apparently um wait there's more there was a letter I don't know if all of them received it but there was a letter containing a white substance\nA potential ... explosives so apparently there was a letter I mean all of this is coming in his work so we're juggling it as it's as it's coming and\nUh and that no no nothing was addressed to the White House a ... in New York uh NYPD has sent officers to a media outlets across the city\nYeah the packages lifted Wasserman Schultz is the return address which I think it's weird um and that's according to CBS local in New York they said that\nThe ones that were apparently sent to\nClinton Obama their uh their sorting centers\nBecause they smartly and I would imagine you know you kinda have to you have to have a facility that goes through Medicare habits into your house your former president ah that does those packages had Wasserman Schultz is the return address it's important because it shows a disorganized\nAnd then it's one individual or a one entity so\nThis is what we know the U.S now or that's far um and\nThis is I'm a scene in their their headquarters were evacuated um and a parent I mean anchors were pulled off air alarms going off in the building and so it's ... there's and so there is a lot for Secret Service an FBI to figure out\nA lot for them to figure out um\nAudio or do we play twenty three hundred and some are twenty three that's yeah that's what they said that they that they secured the device they take them to uh from what I understand they take them to\nA different facility correct to where they detonate them that's what I was like a robot that that ... they remove them from the premise fees and they take them somewhere and then I think they have a robot come in and detonate them or do whatever I like\nTo be as my on my TV shows are my only reference for that but I have that moment on CNN where the alarm went off live on the air if you wanted to hear how that went\nYeah yeah yeah you know what I mean 'cause I think it's kind of interesting like the rest of the joint terrorism task force is taking the lead on this investigation\nWas ... movies are no longer suspicious packages that we are you saying that they were rudimentary but functional that means they were explosive devices or to have projects\n[noise] scooter that feels like a fire alarm here will keep you posted on that but the projectiles that that is a a future you'll often see bombs\nWith terrorists you denounce where ISIS is usually early or doesn't lose whatever that's one of our guys are\nRight yeah yeah so it yeah very much just yeah very much so uh\nThis is a is\nVery um\n... I mean it's still a developing story and it is a uh my parents are just spoke about it a little bit earlier audio somebody twenty two I mean this was maybe twenty minutes ago listen to this\nOr districts no place in American\nI Want to assure you we for the full resources [noise] a VR the United states Secret Service they're working very closely with law enforcement\nOfficials will continue to monitor these investigations [noise] those responsible will be brought to justice\nYeah so I just uh to me it seems like this is a this is Tara it's a it's a it's a terror ah ... and it\nGets to solve terror now I Know that Pomona Blasio where we're getting into some politics with it um which I I just I think I don't know how you can do that right now because we're still determining what the heck is happening [noise] um I think that you have to make sure a people or say first be that you\nDo we even know are are all of them have all of them then a secured\nI mean are there more out there I think before people start\nPoliticizing the issue and blaming the administration\nAnd all of that maybe perhaps they should wait\nFor more information to come in there's nothing wrong with waiting to see what other information comes\nOut um\nI don't I mean there's there's never been anything there's no nothing wrong with that\nI mean there's been I mean for instance I remember back when there was a there was a run of a bomb threats on a a a whole bunch of Jewish centers after um the election and it was this a disturbed it was just in Israel and it was a disturbed teenager\nUh there there were the rice and letters that were sent in two thousand and fourteen to the New York city mayor and to the White House that was\nThat was a scorned lover trying to frame their husband so I think it's a very important that people just kind of way and makes and wait for more information to come in before they start rushing to politicize\nThings I mean that's you know that's that's that's just the nature of it and so this\nIs we're going to be this is what we're going to be we're going to be watching the story and getting developments uh from it as a as we as we get them then there's just a lot of information coming in right now with the White House statement McConnell statement will continue updating you as well to the uh the caravan that's still coming from through Mexico\nA swelled up to fourteen thousand um will also have making Kelly who is apologizing for a statement that she made an argument that she made yesterday on her NBC show\nUm there was additionally and I and I want to get going here but the um K.

S. N. B. C. contributor so that would that stupid [noise] um the other thing\nThat I'm\nLooking at is how the package that was sent for instance the one that was sent to John Brennan at CNN has six stamps on it and none of the stance have posted marks this wasn't mailed\nThis was hand delivered and is\nIt true that if you're ... if you're emailing if you're sending a package and it's like this heavy do you got to put it in a box or do you can you just put it and like the puppy out 'cause I'm getting both sides of that on on social media do does it have to go into a box or do you have to end the reason\nThat I'm because I'm at well but it's almost a moot at this point because it wasn't\nIt was it was it was handled it right it wasn't mailed\nI mean that's I Can't and I don't know if\nSixes enough is six stamps enough of this because this is steel parts on it this is a ... at this particular image that the picture that they showed on I ... that's what was in the package that has some heavy metal parts on it that is some steel parts on it so ah that seems like it would\nBe a little too heavy for just six\nStamps I don't I'm just me\nUm but we don't know how much it actually wait which I'm sure they'll let that no I you know they're gonna they're gonna be looking at every bit\nOf a closed circuit footage possible they're going to be looking at every bit of footage possible\nSo this is a no yeah that somebody had said yeah the great big ah video hunt begin that's true it does now but but\nI've never cause I've never gotten anything through any\nPostal service that didn't have markets all over it someone said well some of them are invisible marking no they're not they're not stop they're not they aren't\nI've had a couple of people who have message me just literally just since like we've been on breaking who worked in one retired and\nOne will not say that actively still and they and they had said that they would have marks on them if it was mailed and and and the one who still works are brought up the fact that it wasn't in a box so even if they had brought it and I thought they would not have mailed it being that heavy if it was a heavy metal item\nUnless it was in a box so that's why I bring that up\nWhich is sort of stamps actually covered it which we don't really know but the way you are not able to reuse stamps is because they put those markings on their friend you might not be able to see them with the naked eye but under black white or other environments you can see it as well you have to market so you don't reuse the\nAnd there's nothing on this so I and I I think that's you know it's important to ah the other thing with this is an ... is the\n... and I'm thankful that nothing detonated and I'm sure we're going to hear more information about uh about all of it nothing detonated and\nI'm just still I mean we're getting more and more developments in the president's apparently are going to be making some remarks about this and we'll take it live when it happens but and I'm looking here I see another\nI see another uh a picture of it of the device um I mean it's a pipe bomb I mean that's that I mean that's still that's yeah the the the\nIndividual that I was referring to the message me and said they still work with a post office and said if you're going to mail something if you know not pipeline if you're going to mail a heavy piece of metal like that\nThan it would be you would\nYou would have to put it in a box they're not going to just lay stuff in one of those little bubbly envelopes and and mail and and that's just not going to happen but I still say this is I Do think\nAh I Do think that this is absolutely I mean it's some sort\nOf um it is domestic terrorism I don't know how she put it it's domestic terrorism so very\nAnd I mean and it is a goodness so we're going to continue watching this\nThis uh this this story as it unfolds 'cause we're still getting development them and\nI don't want to engage in the speculation that bill de Blasio Andrew Cuomo engaged in an earlier when they were giving press their press conference I'm I'm I'm not going to engage in that kind of speculation that's ridiculous\nWe're not doing that um but this I'm telling you it is a it is ... ... yeah ...
