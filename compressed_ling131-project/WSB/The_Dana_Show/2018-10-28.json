I just had\nOne of those where it was a settlement that do we entered into my company entered into where we're going to get paid 'cause we dealt with people that didn't do such a good job who had insurance so we settled at\nAnd they have to pay within thirty days the insurance company ... they ended up paying within Seventy five days is how long it took us to get paid\nNo end to the point where our lawyer had to get in that's a lawyer who arranged the settlement had to come in and start screaming at the insurance companies we actually had to file a lawsuit\nFor breach before they paid okay so mark just get really aggressive or if they ... you probably fell through the cracks mark a if you're dealing with a major insurance company you weren't going to get paid more there's no question and that would turn around and see how much interest you're paying ... small claims court for the interest you lost\nThrough OK but you'll get paid more guy it's ... it that's world of insurance they're they grab your your your second and a half late on your auto insurance for your health insurance ear canceled\nSeventy five days late on a payment that was supposed to be made within thirty days just like Mark and that's typically what the payment to the timeline normally is\nGo figure huh bye hey Gary welcome to handle on law\n[noise] hey I'm I have a question for you my wife and I own a house in Ventura and it's a smaller track about uh thirty nine lot thirty nine home of we when we bought a house um where was given an excuse me a faith than are that are\nLimited what we could do a lot and what we can do with our home and one of the stipulations of the the the un are fed that each of the homes have to rebuild on a single a lot and um\nThat each of them had to be at least Seventy five feet wide there are other stipulation but what happened was a developer God for the city of Ventura or the city approved the flooding of the lot and now the developer is building two homes\nThat are in violation of that the sea and are in a number of\nDifferent way okay so I wanted to know what our records\nThe record on who you are you what you do is you get\nThe homeowners you get the H away\nAnd immediately file a lawsuit against them just because the city allows a certain type of building or the or the community that is the actual weight also can control and they can say no more than one lie or one home per ... now\nI then it becomes an interesting situation where the developer now comes back and saying you're violating liability\nOr to build housing of which ah I'm allowed to do based on the city but I think the winner here in my opinion would be the ACOA but you you it's time to get a lawyer you need a land use attorney Gary like right now\nIs that a real estate attorney\nOr it is a real estate attorney but it's a real estate attorney that specializes in land use and there are a attorneys out there and then in fact represent nothing but H always\nOkay so you can get go just go on the uh go on the Internet and got check them out because that is I Know developers going to roll over on this one uh there's no way in hell was especially if you're building additional homes that's big money for them\nAll right max\nHi good morning Carol for yes or buy insurance claim hours okay yes you have trouble with an insurance company yeah sure never heard that one before ever max and much of that yeah it\nWas her name is while asking [laughter] anyway ah anyway they shorted may based on the estimate based committed they shorted may eight hundred seven dollars yeah I called them a couple of times especially they told me to go pound it\nSaid that is anyway ah anyway when I get I filed in small claims court trade are there and maybe seven dollars and the way they came with a check for five hundred\nPound the verbiage on the checks in high tech check a that negates credit for the\nClaims right now I'm Wondering if I can check because I Know in ... in court if I take that check me gate to yeah\nYeah because that's part of the agreement the agreement is if you would sell is jak then I Will not go after you I waive all my rights absolute like so the only way you can go and kick their body is to say no thank you to the check and go ahead and file in small claims court and kick their butts\nOkay that's that's where I'm going to\nGo look and say here's the good news whenever you go in front of a judge small claims judge against an insurance company I don't know how that works normally they would kick it right up to superior court and so you're really not going to be in front of a a a judge\nA small claims judge which are usually not judge has a ... and this happens all the time with the companies they immediately make a a motion to kick it up and then you have to go out and hire a lawyer ostensibly however there isn't a judge in this world that has not been screwed by an insurance company\nSo you're coming in with an advantage dry cleaners never even go to small claims court ever because they know they're gonna lose walking in the door and they just write checks now the good news is they write checks for the amount of

... two summers ago at Ninety seven feet in\nThe ... so you know the bottom I remember that there's about ... uh-huh right shows you like to talk of the bill white spoon and then the eight feet of water and ... what are you\nGot you got that memory down but it or I watch people what should a the next couple of weeks now if not hiring you are or another guide or whatever to fix the lake what would you tell the weekend fisherman do you do it with me or to get some good old spotted bass\nRight question and all that activity or the bulk of the activity a is centering around lane like\nA ... okay well twenty five to thirty feet\nAnd there's a lot of elderly near most stereo like people ... rush on these all these hospice ... top water over them if you just want to catch fish and all the numbers bass fishing or ... or drop shots will be hard to beat for numbers inconsistency you catch a\nBigger fish will tap water or if you got the patient ... around that rush you get the bigger ... okay ... ... and look for what did you Matt will get the hot spots in the creeks are all the main like twenty five thirty seat and actually a lot of the stripers are oriented to the same places if you're ... you're just relying alive here you know where those areas\nOr maybe put him winding down a little bit with a split shot\nAnd then cash to stop or even though you're the top of ... maybe twenty five feet you can pull ... out of water that they\nNeeded to oh yeah he can be aggressive ... yeah she'll come and get it so that's a but that's the structure you all the key on and I think ah that'll plot a lot of lakes as well\nOkay let me ask you a question him by and large just as a general rule general observe observation will you use a bigger bait and be more successful with a bigger by in the fall and spring\nLike so I think they'll feed on bigger base where there's lot baked or even bigger top waters and the water's still warm enough right now we're still in the upper seventies so you got stationed there pretty active bill respond a bigger bite and they're willing to chase when you get in the spring and depending on what bar spring we're talking about water temperatures in the fifties\nAnd you'll probably find them respond to smaller bites better so yeah I think now bigger bite your better\nI agree also a bigger faster\nLawyer with the top ... station\nMm mhm to South

professor oatmeal what up for what you do for ... how are you a tournament gala you woke me up one morning when I was going to stay at home my\nBackside on the couch you should get out there and when the\n... this will be going on my six year and for the last five years what you said was very true\n... and now I've sort of crazy ideas now look to the windy days and even even study them more than I Do the other days but I still hunt pretty much about two eighty percent of the the hunting timing guns seized so I just want to let people know that you really and truly\nFeel Bush doesn't cost is the thing it will listen and pay attention that's all we got to do well thank\nYou very much that's a that's a confirmation coming from you that I value highly because I say at ad nauseam the more you know the more you understand the more successful you can be in the outdoors\nIs or it makes it a whole lot more pleasurable sometimes just sit there watch unfold what you've already told us but to actually see it in action just is is is like a missed implication\nNow I've got to tell you uh to me\nThat combination of air temperature you're twenty four but more importantly the water temperature forty two that's\nOne of those days when you can look at your partner and say I think I got a bite\nBecause at forty two water temperature you're not going to get many\nSo how did we do and why am I talking about this in this fashion we're back to that expertise that the you'll that cast and why a professional can use every airline when you should be using ... maybe\nIn that list we fish for two hours in this very special place\nDavy and I did I was in the front of the boat and I was using a a of a mob gee bulldog lures I think both by a mob Jake and so was Davey same color\nIn two hours a week ... seven large mouth\nThat weighed thirty five pounds rate was fabulous\nI caught two from the front of the boat and day he caught five from the back of the vote\n\nNow I think that's about truth Davey is at least two and a half times better than me\nAnd that's why a seasoned professional that goes fishing every single week year round king case just as many with heavy tackle as you can with a lot to tackle but if you use light tackle you'll get more bites\nOkay let's talk now to Larry is calling from Atlanta own oatmeal outside good morning layer\nLaws do good I had heard is
