election\nAnd that's what we need desperately because what we saw this past weekend\nAs the U.S Senate was confirming the vote for judge Kavanaugh and and the roll call was out there [noise] um I found it scary the\nThis deranged behavior these these militants\nIn in the gallery and\nYou see 'em unless unless you want our nation to be handed over to these ... these cycles\nThey're they're mentally disturbed [noise] I Know that the Democrat leadership would like to distance itself from them but that is what they have bread that is what they support that is their base that's who they

election day is the sixth of November tomorrow is the final day for you to register to vote so my question to you patriot because I'm blessed on this day\nTo to make this appeal to you your family like minded friends and family not only in your immediate circle of influence but across the nation\nFolks that you may have back in California in the mid west in many parts of the country had brothers and sisters and extended family who are like minded or conservative ... who would like to preserve our nation and would like to arrest this path we're on to make sure that those crazies those\nThose deranged site goes\nIn the gallery those individuals are shouting at the top of their lungs disrupting the vote in the U.S and they they can do absolutely nothing to end this vote\nAnd the folks who you know the ... the sergeant that arms the staff of security staff at the U.S and what you're talking about earning their keep\nOne after the other if you if you don't know what I'm Talking about this past Saturday afternoon and perhaps you picked up the headline that that judge Kavanaugh have been confirmed this justice to the U.S and uh but you did not listen to the actual roll call\nWhen vice president Pence and the clerks there they were calling out on each senator to say yay or nay there must have been I Would say\nSeven maybe eight individuals' went by security\nThey didn't have anything sharp on them they didn't have any posters on them and they just made it into the gallery sat themselves down but they strategically placed themselves so that every minute or so or with key senators let's say Senator Flake\nWhen he cast as well but they shouted at the top of their lives and interrupted the process just so that the American public would here\nI I don't know the the reason I I don't know what goes through the minds of\nOf these fools or how is it that they think that is going to win me over how is it they think that's going to win anyone over to their side this cycle path to Iran's behavior oh there's\nWailing at the top of their lives and as security was dragging these people away and vice president Pence was waiting for sergeant an arms to restore order a cigarette restore sergeant RV store order\n\nScreeching and howling and the screaming as they were being dragged away even in the halls and they kept on screaming and crying and ...\nMy wife and I were taking the vote and why was it was taking place and and she was she was screaming at the top of the\nLongest one charity you need to do something you know these people\nWere coming yeah I I didn't want to say anything I yes they knew these people were coming\nAnd it's our government it's their government\nThe government that's been voted in it governs over them it governs over us remind household them their household as well and they've got every right to go up there and said\nUnless they do something dangerous or try to hurt centers I think that gallery would stay open needs to stay open will stay open it's just that they're ... aggressive about\nExpressing their their twisted and wrong point of view\nAs they're being dragged away I I'm looking at my wife and until there was that sound like the the\nWay and scream it sounded to me like like defeated demons lives on something like the wailing and the gnashing of teeth they tortured soul those being dragged away\nThat's what it sounds to me they've lost and they can't get over my question to you from unless you wish the government be handed over the Democrats and I'll make it real simple\nDemocrats need to be voted out of office\nAll of the national level state level we must not reward this deranged behavior these protest the smear that they brought upon Brett Kavanaugh the destruction of his
