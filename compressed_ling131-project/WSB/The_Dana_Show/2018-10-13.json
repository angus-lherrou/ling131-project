I went from being somebody who was a normal person that would sit and have a face to face conversation with you and be engaged in in the world around me to someone who was staring at an iPhone all day long social media I even had the what I call the Twitter rage\nI diagnose myself with OCD obsessive compulsive disorder and I realized my helpless suffering my sanity was suffering I was having restless sleepless nights I was looking around at young people and I was thinking wow these young people I was a ... a former teacher academic team these young people don't know how to face to face conversations anymore\nThey're they're losing interpersonal skills they're losing whole skill sets because they're not communicating face to face they're doing everything from behind the filter of a phone\nBut it's not that long we haven't been doing this that long\nWell the smartphones blow it up in a different way because before that for it's not really what the laptop to be honest with you because when you got the laptop to work they cease to have an end and you were basically working all night long all day every day\nAnd then it turns into the cell phone which you know you get taxed and the blackberry but one social media hit you you would open your phone and you would have to address text messages emails from work emails from home Twitter Facebook Snapchat\nThere's no way that you can do all that and one day constantly maintained your Saturday So how does that play into this book right so what I decided was I needed to use social media and I needed to have tax thing I Need it to ... features in my life in some way\nBut I wanted to figure out a way to do it in a way that wasn't going to compromise my Saturday So I set up a ...

group station\n[noise] twenty four hour news weather and traffic five and am settled that they\nAsked me what is\nFree o'clock on Charlie ... twenty four hour news center top story this hour a mid town and a lot of women as worried about those popular electric scooters worried there are creating a fire hazard in her neighborhood channel who actually news Michael Seidman\nReports she says somebody's using car on the part of outlets to charge dozens of birds scooters at a time or at\nLeast the fourth grade and the problem began in September\nThere was a new a resident and they didn't hire a building and apparently has only job is to charge these heard\nDozens of electric scooters at least is calling this a major fire hazard depending my life at risk at least I said having\nThose things charging ...\nA spokeswoman for bird would not confirm or deny it this incident is under investigation\nSo Mitch McConnell they were trying to log jam it was what they were doing some Mitch McConnell got improve Chuck Schumer said I'm going to where he promised the Washington Post literally said that what Chuck Schumer was trying to do as a ransom because Schumer said I'm going to use every tool tactic available to make sure that this does not happen [noise]\nWell they got their freedom to GO Campaign so they're recess until mid term they got their freedom\nAnd Mitch got his Fifteen judicial lifetime judicial appointments their ... their votes on those ... uh Fifteen judicial nominees oh by the way a it was noted he didn't just settle for the judges Mitch\nYeah my friend had and if he did not just settle for the judges no no no no Mitch got two dozen sinister McConnell never met him\nAnd I ... by the way I'm going to start rolling back some of the criticism I hate them on his head like burning coal just saying he got two dozen other appointees confirmed at the same time [noise]\nSenate got Fifteen they confirmed Fifteen judicial nominees and then they confirmed Twenty one executive branch nominees by unanimous consent because they wanted to go and they they needed to go and they wanted a recess\nOoh mhm\nYep yep you're right that is that's a lot that's a lot [noise] so ah\nThey needed to desperately go and that's a huge win and this is why McConnell is really good at navigating the Senate he knows all the parliamentary rules he knows everything\nAnd he was well he said he was willing to hold senators in Washington through Christmas remember that and he said he do it again oh my heavens\nSo that is hugely significant and this is what was happening as everyone was screaming over kind yeah\n...\nYeah awesome just saying I'm just saying so this so you have a twelve lifetime circuit court judges Twenty one other executive nominees this is huge\nAnd ... similar some activists are mad because Democrats didn't fight enough and a\nWar and goes well I oppose the deal but she went ahead and did it because she wanted to go back and you know there's just they're willing to sell out for her to be able to get back home I mean let's let's be real is what this was they wanted to sell everybody out so they could go home\nSo that's good news right all of those I mean those are lifetime appointments wasn't that didn't you hear that by the way with\nWith um Kevin ... it's a lifetime appointment\nOkay yeah and it says us thanks guys [noise] is there a chain of um [noise]\nThis teen of them now as we switch over to Saudi Arabia because this story is really this is really insane\nUm and I I see this really awful media spin on this to a which is unfortunate but you know uh the situation with this is that a reporter who uh\nWas he had been critical previously of the new roller the new leadership and Saudi Arabia and\nHad written a a ... a bunch of uh Jamal\n... had written things about the crown prince the Saudi crown prince and he was a legal resident of the United states have lived in both ... and in London and so he was in Turkey and he was apparently visiting the Saudi uh\nThe uh embassy or consulate there he was visiting the consulate in in ... is simple and then he just disappeared\nOff base of the earth they just disappear\nAnd Turkish authorities say well he was murdered and they said they had recordings proving that he was murdered and there were some pretty gruesome rumors going around about how\nAnd they were blaming some Saudis that had entered turkey not long before uh Jamal ... disappeared and then they left and they think you know the Saudis say no it's not us we didn't do it so it's kind of going back and forth\nAnd\nSo this is the ... because this now could affect two different alliances actually three different alliances the U.S Saudi Arabian alliance the Turkish Saudi Arabia alliance and the United states in Turkish alliance\nWhich you know I don't I have my complaints about are the one particularly when he beat protestors so [noise] but ... the fact that this guy was a legal\nResident of the United states changes things\nAnd he apparently like the only thing that he did that would have invoked the Saudi crown princes ras is to have written about him\nAnd a negative light and so to Turkish officials said this is why he disappeared\nAnd so there you go so you have there are some senators that want a\nAn investigation and in fact we have some audio here because Heather Nauert was was asked about this\nDuring a a press conference and they don't really know a whole lot more than what you were reading in the press apparently and it's you know do you believe the Saudis do you believe turkey um and this is Heather Nauert was is the state department spokesman on this uh this is when she was asked about it\n[noise] twenty Seventeen\nThen earlier this week or the vice president has talked about that is the president has talked about this we are all concerned about his whereabouts we don't have any information on his whereabouts right now for what happened to him\nAs you can see anytime you turn on the news you open the newspaper there is a lot of speculation and there are a ton of rumors out there we're making determinations and watching this for facts we don't have the facts yet and so we're going to hold back on our comments until we have\nConcrete information that the U.S government can share\nWell which is and that is true so now there are some senators and it's a bipartisan group they want the Saudis sanctioned and because they believe that they are complicit in his disappearance Rand Paul wants to stop arms sales and military assistance to Saudi Arabia\nUm and in fact over at Brookings they noted that the royal Saudi air force is entirely dependent upon on American and British support for air fleet of us if teens Apache isn't tornado aircraft pieces of either Washington or London halted the flow of logistics the the royal ... Saudi air force it'd be grounded\nAnd this\nYou also have to take into consideration how Iran would benefit from this because it hasn't\nBeen one of the things and I think this is a really good point to make 'em that that Matthew Continetti over it Free Beacon noted and I hadn't thought about this previously but it said look what Iran it you know they haven't really been brought up in relation to ... as a hobby but\nIt's a factor because they're pressing up against the Saudis on multiple fronts they fostered share rebellion with the kingdom itself and in Bahrain\nThey've armed into bed at who the who have been going back and forth the Saudis ah and there are ... its proxies actually are on the cusp of victory in Syria basically control in Lebanon and they don't pay us in Iraq\nIran's European allies are attempting to create a financial lifeline that would provide relief from us sanctions\nAnd Saudi Arabia has been the lynchpin of America's Middle East strategy for close to a century\nBut that relationship has not been without costs Continetti note what would it cost the if the alliance fractured the Saudis would be imperiled in Yemen potentially endangering the free flow of traffic in the Gulf of Aden Iranian victory would extend as Shia crescent to the south\nAnd the company the one running through Iraq and Syria and Lebanon\nSo\nTrump said that Saudi Arabia with my two weeks of that American Sport\n\nAnd it says it and and Continetti no to the middle east and live on our already filled with examples of state failure is America prepared to risk another Saturday meltdown would deprive the United states of a counter terror ally it would royal energy markets and create pockets of instability and which do hottest an Iranian backed militias thrive\nAnd it would also make it bad for Israel to show they say to forestall such a disaster the Saudis like others before the my turn to Russia or China for support\nThat then would accelerate the waning of American influence in the middle east and boost the very autocracies we condemn\nSo\nYou have to weigh evidence and consider how you would punish them if it turns out they acted like Russia or China or North Korea or Syria or Iraq or Iran this is it's not as cut and dry\nThe new ones but nuances debt so for a lot of people it's black or white\nOne or the other one or two air be\nBut there are there's a lot to consider I'm not saying that it ... what ... isn't happening as an awful but for those who are saying well ours are through the stuff you need to realize what happens if you do a B or C and it
