{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WSB", "content": "Honestly it's the fact that in the immigration debate I wasn't seeing people like me reflected in the debate I'm someone who loves immigrants I have great experiences I grew up in an immigrant rich community\nBut I also believe we need a controlled and managed immigration system that serves the interests of American workers and the nation as a whole\nAnd that position just wasn't represented anywhere\nWell in a way you said melting pot that she used to happen when you came here legally ah hopefully legally but you're looking to be part of America not looking to take your culture and change America exactly\nThere's this feeling that this idea of a unifying melting pot the idea that ultimately we want to be integrated we want to be part of some greater whole that\nIdea has become almost fashionable with the elites they denounce that idea they prefer this idea of having a more fragmented racially divided society why because that's the way that politicians could with people up\nWell ah do you mean on both sides\nTo that yeah I think it's on both sides but I've got to say from my perspective what I find frustrating is that you have Democrats\nWho keep saying hey I'm not literally for open borders I'm just for all enforcement of our immigration laws and that doesn't engenders a lot of trust\nThen on the right you have a lot of people who have fundamentally good instincts they're saying we want a national interest policy we don't hate immigrants we want to include immigrants but we have to do it in terms that makes sense for the country long term but those voices get drowned out\nLottery that's another way of going in your random lottery to random countries where you get in\nAnd then you have chain migration that suddenly everybody's been educated on this and now do you have Democrats in the past to have said chain migration is crazy like Harry Reid and the lottery system other Democrats have said that also have Chuck Schumer on the record saying we have to put a barrier on our border well yes allusion to Harry Reid\nBecause of relative based immigration system in ... unfair [noise]\nHas been forced to adopt even more of certain majors to deal with the demands of people\nTo be any wonder that the American people think gardening immigration policies are a joke\nWhen we used to like forty thousand new am I going to say here\nThat Harry Reid Nineteen Ninety three\nThis is incredible even if you look in the two ... you look ten years ago you had Democrats are playing and singing an entirely different tune on immigration issues than they do now and the reason I Believe is the incredible radicalism of some of these activists to see on the left\nWho want to resist every compromise is completely nuts and then your folks like Tom Cotton offender from Arkansas horsing very simply look we just want a system that makes sense for all Americans we want a system that makes it easier to integrate immigrants into the melting pot that's what we need control\nHere's what I did here's where it just grew Tom Cotton he wants to live in ... uh he wants to get rid of you wants to limit legal immigration\nSecrets of no no we need people unemployment is under three percent there's a lot of people here want to come here we just want to be screened properly I think our country is the one of the few that growing Russia is dying Europe is dying they can't get anybody in their people want to come in here let's just give the quite put the criteria out there\nJust streamlined the system and get it done well\nI've got to say I personally think of is just me talking not Tom Cotton talking I think that if Tom Cotton felt like he had a partner on the other side of a debate to negotiate with he\nWould be open to saying okay let's keep the numbers where they are right now provided we screen people based on whether or not they're going to need Medicaid and snap and the earned income tax\nCredit all sorts of benefits all you're saying simply is that if you're not coming in as a refugee refugees are a different story if you're not coming in as a refugee you should be able to provide for yourself and your family that's not a crazy ask that's what immigrants in previous generations did but now we have a different economy\nSo wry and what was your parents' experience like when they came\nHere you know my parents they came in Seventy six or my mother came to a skilled worker visa brought my ah my two older sisters I was born a few years later in the New York city\nAnd uh you know they they work their tails off you know my parents both work two jobs and that's the experience of a lot of immigrants\nAnd you know one thing that helped me is that I grew up in a community with a lot of folks from a lot of different backgrounds so I felt like I was part of the melting pot from early on but when you get sometimes it's people who are in isolated ethnic enclaves where they're not necessarily mixing with us from different backgrounds\nAnd then do you order and that's what you're going places yeah I I get this one story is I got picked up in Pennsylvania to go do speaking event and the guy driving me says he's working so hard he's doing these things he goes why came to this country and I thought it would\nBe easier I go what about your kids goes well my one kid's horror my other one to West Point I go really why and what do they want to do well wants to be an engineer one wants to be a nuclear engineer one wants to be a um a tunnel and bridges type ... I go\nI hate to tell you but that's a story you work in you laid the foundation for the next generation that's just the way it is and that's where the pride comes from not seen he can't be rich but take pride in what you're what you're doing\nI think that's that's so true but here's the problem you have a lot of great immigrant stories real hard working hard Scrabble folks raise their kids and and you know kind of have a great experience but you have a lot of other folks who find themselves stuck on the bottom and their kids also really struggled to enter the middle class and here's what I'm afraid of\nWhat I'm afraid of is that some of those kids born here in the usa who are struggling to climb\nThey're the ones who are attracted by democratic\nSocialism they're attracted to this identity politics stuff and that to me is a very scary and when you don't feel like you were included in that melting pot in that mainstream that's\nWhere things can get dicey you want to read the games and make sure everybody's equal and that just started the way our system a is a bill to be successful it's all included in a a ... a book right ... it's called melting pot for civil war great perspective thanks so much thank\nYou for having me All right I'll go pick it up when we come back a lot more to talk about including this guy named Brett Kavanaugh it turns out he wants to be on the Supreme Court I had no idea [noise]\n\nThing that bring though I think that tracks is becoming the most important factor in Paris Boulder our responsibility is to ask the questions that are difficult tend to demand the answers of those people who are in power with the experience I've had\nIn working at the White House and I think I'm Better able to understand what's going on behind the scene I'm part of that machinery Fox News that worked so hard to make sure they do not just knowing that you know it correct\nOn Fox News channel real news real honest opinion\nOur\nNation coming up real big can be the personal\nBoxes you know Fox News rundown the weekly morning ... deep into the major and controversial stories of the day hosted by the anchors of Fox News radio inscribed now to your perspective of news you won't find anywhere around claiming that funky but just gone job\nWell there's not many things sadder than seeing your two wheeled dream circle align twisted underpaid what\nNeil bortz for my friends would steal horse law a law firm dedicated to protecting downed bikers rights Attorney George Ryan and his team will get you back on the road steel horse lock it helped turn those cold empty cylinders back into ... screaming\n... says there's no time at all get help or get your free riders advantage car to steal horse law dot com\nLong when you ask the Herman Cain is daily pure came perspective I Am going to build their dogs scripted shows fewer Cain I don't have to be politically\nEvery day lemon fifty six I'm not that was all\nFollowed by the U.S be expanded new moon but\nGoing to say about Herman Cain daily fear came perspective every weekday at eleven to to say on it limits news weather and traffic station is ... ... am seven fifty I guess the\nSelfless service says the guiding principle that drives Army National guard soldiers to be always ready whenever disaster strikes they are your next door neighbor and your colleagues in schools offices\nVia guard soldiers stand ready to survey the whole time\nTo learn more log on to the national guard dot com\nBubble contacted the Army National guard recruiter in your area sponsored by the Georgia Army National guard here by the George association of broadcasters and\nThis station that when you ask me about ... er Cox media group station\n[noise] twenty four hour news weather and traffic five AM seven fifty\nTwo\nGood morning it's three o'clock I marketing align live from the ws me twenty four hour news center\nA Republican who doesn't want Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court retired Justice John Paul Stevens for an appointment to the court Ninety eight years old says his support for capital vanished after as partisan rent during his confirmation hearing Stevens says it revealed so many biases Kavanaugh would have to recuse himself from too many cases\nI'll I'll have to share that way you were having massive technical bunches of course which is preventing me from actually accessing things and to share with you um so\nThis is this it looks like we're gonna have to vote on Saturday Night so far the white the FBI report the FBI report a finished in the Senate Judiciary committee members were able to get a look at it\nAnd they were able to uh that that would get a read on it and they ...

anything they found there was no corroboration and the claims they found no new evidence nothing and I I I wanted to share this city too so the lawyers\nFor ah\nThe lawyers for a a a Christine Blasey Ford they were they were just quite upset because they knew where this was going they knew what was going to be coming down the road right so they sent this letter to Chuck Grassley\nThey sent this letter to Chuck Grassley and they said quote a because remember yesterday I shared with you the letter that Chuck Grassley sent to her lawyers saying we kind of need your therapists notes especially considering that you're literally\nThis is your your this is your evidence for cooperation so it's kind of important you know if you're going to say we have to consider this as evidence\nTo support your claim then we need to see\nIt you know that's that's that's how it works right but hey Democrats were saying that this wasn't a trial okay well then tough tough means we're going to go ahead and hold the damn boat you know 'cause you said it wasn't a trial good on you for\nTaking that road so the lawyers for\nFord sent this to Grassley they say quote regarding the documents you've requested in your letter of October second twenty Eighteenth Dr Ford is prepared to provide those documents to the FBI\nWhen she has interviewed we have not yet heard from the FBI about scheduling an interview with her son Deborah cats and Lisa Banks here's what's so adorable about that\nIn the ever levine hell do you think that the FBI reports these findings to\nHey I'm going to give you a I'm going to make it multiple choice you guys ready who do you think that the FBI reports these findings to do you think it is to a the Academy of arts and sciences and motion pictures\n[noise] do you think it is be\nHillary Clinton or do you think it is the the Senate Judiciary committee if you had to pick\nOf those choices that to\nThe FBI reports its findings to and what the FBI gives the Senate Judiciary committee as or what what the ...\nOr how they're even going to come to this decision what do they do with the information that's given to them that's led to a decision your choice came I Would say the twenty when members of this year you are correct sir you win no prizes\nThat is absolutely correct absolutely absolutely correct so anything that the ... that the FBI were to get goes to the Senate Judiciary committee which is insane that they're saying well we can't\nWe can't give this to you we want to give this to the FBI when we sit down for an investigation\nIt's a stupid delay tactic by her lawyers it made zero sense Adel whatsoever to hold this from the committee considering what ever\nTo the committee because\nEr into this is a background check at the request of\nThe Senate Judiciary committee that's right class to it is to get the information so is she refuses to provide the evidence okay\nFelicia we're moving on\nWe're going to hold a vote that's how this works you can't say well I demand that you consider this evidence at as a way to corroborate my claim but I'm not going to show you this evidence okay by\nThis works none of this works this way there is a
