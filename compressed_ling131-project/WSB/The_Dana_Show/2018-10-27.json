however it didn't matter because the treaty of get was signed a and of course when I when I started researching the battle of New Orleans I still want it to do it but then when the evidence became so

I'm Still like why would you put stamp\nOn it is I don't know why would you put stamps on it if it was sent by a career I don't know thoughts image of I mean that's what came here over there\nI can hear it or whatever and just this is look again we've been doing this a long long time and I know you're not in the business speculating because that's not what the shows about but at least\nI can express that speculation on my part okay you go ahead and you 'cause you're speculating over there and that's exactly what it is because I was you don't have any proof and that's kind of how it's designed a up to this point because if you notice this will take a while before we really get all the answers on how this all happened in whatever\nMy guess is it will take longer than a fix for midterms to get here\nAnd this is an effort on the left with the coordination of the media to do this and this this is how I Believe no\nI'm only basing this on my experience on how the left acts up politically okay so your idea\nSo this was this was basically my speculation but let's say you're about yes you know you're supposed to be clear but I Can't help\nBut think that not only was this coordinated which is what you believe but it was coordinated in an effort to help the left as we enter intimate with less than two weeks out and they don't mind making a big hubbub about stuff like this they don't mind ruining the guy's life\nAre being appointed to the Supreme Court they don't mind doing any of that stuff that's how I feel about it and that's how I think this is\n... ...\nWell and so you have all these questions about jeeze why stamps used was wider wires and books and she was a really dumb and hope to see because of exactly how what I'm Talking about\nI definitely understand that\nThere is that there is that sentiment out there\nI still think it's too just like I think it's too early to be able to say yes that is absolutely the ISIS flag that on the\nAt least ... you know what I'm saying is I'm speculating and I'm being honest about the fact that I'm speculating that I don't really have\nAny tangible proof to back it just tobacco what I'm saying but it's just too coincidental for me to just sit back and believe all of a sudden less than two weeks out from mid term this is what happens but all of a sudden dumpster ... like\nThey've been way more violent before if someone truly was going to retaliate against the Democrats would've been way before now\nOr in regards to how they've acted since twenty six inches from Trump won the election so to me this is too convenient of timing I'm not swallowing the idea that it's anybody from the right doing the students and I'm not I'm I don't buy it\nWell I just don't well this ah\nI [noise]\nSomeone else made the observation it was an evil of it seems like it was not meant to go off\n[noise] I [noise] I don't know but I don't know what that showed it on him in a box may I Would never vote but a buff but not like a box is\nGonna be magical yeah I'd not going to be any more protective\nSo it just to me please we know that uh\nWe're all now going to be bomb experts where\nDoes the left pay for protest on both sides so that each side has you know some sort of either positive or negative view because we've seen how paid protesters\nFrom now ... now here's here's something else out so now a ...\nWho is an executive producer of written CNN says that the package that was sent to the building was built by courier they had previously reported that the package that was addressed to George Soros was put in the mailbox not mailed\nSo was it\nIf it was so hand delivered because remember how I literally like two minutes ago said they said hand delivered but they didn't say courier if it was just place in the mailbox and his staff person found it 'cause that's what happened it was a member of the staff had had had at first\nAnd then my ride is another felony for us and non mail delivered to put something in someone's mailbox no matter what you can't go into someone else's mailbox is like a ... well it's a federal law federal but yeah I\nWant to go to break real quick because the president's going to be speaking at some point soon at well that's why my friend Johnny Jones I messaged him because he's on Fox I was asking him 'cause he's a bomb tech expert\nSo uh yeah this is

everything here I sit there was the da da da da\nDa ... before we don't even know and I think I think it's so stupid to speculate\nIt is so incredibly stupid to speculate it really is a because we don't know anything at this point although I Will say I do think that there were a couple of things that stand out to me is as really bizarre the fact that you have\nThis this\nWhole thing that was\nThis package that was sent to Brennan misspelled his name was misspelled it was sent to CNN he's a contributor MSNBC\nI think a couple of the the state\nThings are ... there was a bunch of misspellings there's just a bunch of misspellings on us\nAnd this\nHad it had six stamps on it but it wasn't sit through postal service and it was handled over by a career but why would they why would they then\nUm\nWhy would they then put names on them if they're going to put give it to a courier does that mean that they had tried to send it and it didn't work I mean how is that it was at a changing method I don't understand I think that's important to know because you want to know the level\nOf um\nYou want to know the level of expertise but the person that you're working with I mean that's I think that's a legitimate question to ask if your if your is this person highly skilled and what they do meaning ... going to be harder to track maybe perhaps even more dangerous or are they total Boop\nThat's why I think it's important and other stuff because then you can determine or they're going to be more of these because if this person is highly skilled and they're going to escape\nFrom from being immediately caught then\nI think that would put the public and other individuals in greater danger so that's the reason why I'm asking these questions I mean if it was I mean it had Britain is misspelled name wrong network et cetera why the stamps change of method that doesn't sound like the actions of somebody who is who knows what they're doing and it's quite good at what they're doing that is not what it sounds like at all\nSo I don't know exactly\nThat that's what's weird with all of this so this sound the president obviously said that they are going to use all their resources to determine who just individual is et cetera\nUm but the media is\nAlready speculating they're working overtime to speculate none of this is helpful Cain has his own Cain has his own speculating too I'm stupid according to you I'm not saying that you're stupid I'm just saying that it's what I heard I'm just saying that I don't\nYou think that it's you I think it's all organized but in a different way than you do because I'm not I'm not just that's the only thing that I can I only have enough information to say yeah this is organized because but not motive but you do you think you have a motive my gosh\nI mean what are we seeing says twenty sixteen antifa and others blowing up buildings um assaulting people are being violent stopping traffic consulting people who dared\nDrive on the road I mean all this stuff is the left never condemns as a matter of fact they've actually said most recently that all that's different than what the violence on the ride is theirs is justified because they're\nThey're against you know Nazis and white support or whatever they decide as the justification so they've literally been violent all the way up to this point and now here we are less than two weeks out from midterms and all of a sudden the right\nDecides to be violent there's no there's no logical sense for me on this nobody from the right is going to be doing this any way as a matter of fact of the bombings that we know most recently how many of them were you know right leaning\nInsult anyway so\nI just don't buy it and I know that what we're doing here on the show today is just chasing facts and and that's exactly what we're supposed to be doing but I I just can't I'm not I don't buy it yet I'm Still convinced that this is this was a coordinated effort\nOn the political left along with the media because again CNN really\nYeah everyone knows what the ratings are no one cares about CNN but this is you know getting ... and guess what CNN is getting a ton of
