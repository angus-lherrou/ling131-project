don't tell me about this it seems like the team is so bad nobody knows where to start nobody knows how to fix\nYeah it's there's there's three hours or fire it's it's yeah there that day German food is there a new coach they they they got rid of Bush Jones which one you don't want a game and the SEC you got to go\nUm well that guy's been kicking around to the last year on or a but then he comes to the dolphins for a moment\nOr what's Jones I feel like he almost did anyway go ahead I'm so ... it was like Fifteen choice\nNobody wanted to do with the tendency job which is a little strange because the resources are there but they've got no player so it's hard to hard to think as a coach you're going to be able to recruit players when the when the university can't even recruit coaches yeah it could be a long way now I Would imagine that you if I could predict\nOkay how this goes there will be a piece of audio of coach Kirby Smart telling us how good Tennessee is\nThe perception out there's some people would Tennessee and say certain things\nOut to sea and so that's a really well coached harden those fundamental football than you and this is always a tough physical day it's always this cat always been close for years there's no question that they are creating identity and you can tell the way they're committed to the run each game they've gone up with a number of runs they've had\nThat's PC coach Kirby Smart we have non PC coach smart and tell us the the real deal to Tennessee\nTests they don't know how to chop wood [laughter] and uh we're going to obliterate them

entire as you say in fact I Do did they don't belong to you know your players could sleep walk through this and still with I could go to a high school and find a Jamie ... put it on the field and put them in our uniforms and they would kick the crap [laughter]\nRelegated out of the FCC column Appalachian State ... found that on the Appalachian State they're up in the mountains they know how to do that show up with a child who went all the time and what is the ah what's the what's the spread of escape\nThirty one and now\nYou know the way it is now you tell me about this the bulldogs are so good this year\nA but their schedule seems kind of light it's it's improving yeah\nLSU is on beaten Kentucky is now ranked okay it'd be Mississippi State so you've got and then you get all ...\nOkay offers the big one shuttle when now obviously this is the way the cause I'm Wondering what the way this a committee to start putting stuff together soon for the playoffs yes they're going to look at the schedule\nAnd I think that they're thinking ... went out to have a chance right\nCan't they can't stumble gets Auburn can they there's a lot of\nA lot of good strong teams out there and and some teams that are stronger than people expected going into the year so with the schedule I'm just trying to be real here it's it seems unlikely that Georgia and Alabama will both get a chance\nLast and people were kind of upset about that last year and you know they don't take criticism well of course um that that part seems unlikely so I went out the contingency is if you're not the SEC champs how'd you get in\nAnd then in a in a in a situation like this so that if the line is thirty one that they got to win by thirty two or more you start looking at that rate expectations how did you delivered our stone points involved yeah absolutely\nI Would I Would think so how about the the Braves how do we how what's the magic number to get home field\nThey both right now it's still for because they are tied with the Rockies or for that second spot and the Rockies have a one game lead over the Dodgers so how it's going to have to go is the Marines have to win the second spot outright because they would lose the tie breaker what's the Rockies and the doctors who three games left one of them all wouldn't hurt\nLet's say but J what do they really want home field advantage they played poorly it's on trust part for most of the season yes you still\nWant him to do I mean I my prediction if they get home field advantage I think that they will almost fill up the new stadium [laughter] yeah [laughter] that's just a little that's all that's just a little bit of good well joking\nThere's ten thousand less heat so that makes it easier but actually a first round tickets are almost a ... are sold out for game\nWell I think you know I Would say this about the Braves I think that we should it should just go on for the ride none none of us expected this this young man this is and it was kind of cliche but\nThey're happy to be there and and and and Braves fans should be happy and I think everything after this is gravy because no one expected this this early we thought it was going to
