what's your scoop well\nI'm I Am sixty five my fiance is sixty seven and we're both retired and we're getting married and congratulations\nThank you and we had a meeting last its financial planners to get help planning for our financial need during our retirement and to um [noise]\nWell looking at and that's in any state planning tax planning and that sort of thing and we want to make sure that you know either one of us at the net income in the end of our death and we don't want to be tried families and sell\nThem on what are they for if you're not going to be a burden on your family is\nActually right [laughter] um so that way you know we didn't pay it with\nUm [noise] you know the issue of long term care and insurance and it it's really expensive um and so we were just wondering if he might have any suggestions or um\nThat this is this a real problem because generally you have a segment of the population that doesn't need long term care and that's people who have a very large number of assets generally north of three million dollars okay\nAnd then people who don't need a long term care\nBecause they got nothing they don't own a home you know they're renters they have a very little money saved they've got no investments so there's this group of people in the middle that don't have millions of dollars in assets and do have\nSome things like maybe owning a home and other accounts they don't want to be impoverished by long term care and you mentioned not a burden on the family so if you're in that middle section\nAnd would you say that you and your fiance you're in that middle\nI Would say that we're in that middle\nYou you do have to think through what in the world are you going to do if one of you ended up needing assistance with what's known as life's daily activities needed long term care needed a assisted living for nurses skilled nursing home what do you do and [noise]\nThe market offers am perfect answers into the long term care insurance will generally pay for a three to five year period depending on what you buy it will have an inflation adjustment to deal with medical cost inflation over the years the premiums are not caring\nSee they can go up and even initially you're looking at several thousand dollars a year aren't you yes\nSo it is one of those things there is no good answer or their strategies people do where they go see an elder law attorney\nAnd title assets in a way that the assets are not at risk it's considered to be a um a a strategy that some people don't like the ethics of others are happy with or you um you buy the long term care insurance\nOkay [noise] um I read online ad out an option uh regarding in ... in community care\n\nIt's it I get the idea that it's basically investing in\nYou know community care facility where\nThe the life stages ones\nYeah you go in and independent living\nAnd then as your needs change you move from place to place but they they don't provide the care for free I mean you go into a state a facility that deals with the stages of aging you're still going to have to pay\nFor the care right so it doesn't leave the the cost burden so if you if the two of you want to make sure that you're not a burden to each other and you're not a burden to your kids and you're both healthy now\nAs much as it hurts to write a several thousand dollar check a year\nI Believe it or not I recommend it\nOkay\nBut I Want you to get a five year benefit if you can afford it and a decent inflation adjustment which will he usually be minimum three percent per year\nCovering inflation over the years because of benefit to you today is sixty five let's say you wouldn't need any kind of assistance to your eighty five right if you don't if you don't have\nInflation adjustment of benefit that looks good today will be useless Twenty years now but I Do have one other alternative\nOkay going back to age eighty five\nYou can buy something known as longevity insurance is anybody mentioned is not at all generally nobody mentions it because the commissions on it or not very good\nOkay so you can buy a policy that only pays a benefit if you make it to age eighty five and then at age eighty five it pays a very generous monthly benefit for the rest of your life\nAnd so it's money you can live on in the event you need any kind of long term care is therefore you die before age eighty five poof it goes up in smoke okay but it's a very affordable way for you to find much later in life\nWhen the odds would be higher that you would need care and so I'm like the longevity policies as an alternative you'll have to look around on your own you probably want to look for a fee only financial\nPlanner because commission oriented sales people won't want to talk to you about it\nAngel is

call\nWhy can't you can't side money for a nine year old a little bit each year and then by early twenties that child's a millionaire that's not going to happen but the idea is that if you start

come from everywhere\nThere's something out given ... example when I'm Talking to a school group something like that\nAs a way to really get their attention I say you know it was really easy when I was a kid not to have to eat vegetables all the time or eat fruit all the time because we only had fruits or vegetables when it was in\nSeason\nNow and they got really interested in that now because we live in a worldwide food market it seems that things are in season all the time that whatever fruit or vegetable you want is pretty much available\nTwelve months a year but that food chain we now have has come with the addict complexity that people can get sick\nThe source of the illness hard to track and keeping people safe has become so much more difficult so we'll have these outbreaks of a foodborne illness\nAnd you can have fatalities you can have illnesses they can go on for a significant period of time before the CDC or whoever else is the sleuth on the case can track down the source and shut it off you'll hear from time to time happened with lettuce or spinach or whatever\nWell the nation's largest grocer Walmart it will have a new system fully implemented in less than a year where with any food item sold in the store there will be full\nFarm distort tracking real time so if there's ever anything identified as a potential source\nOf illness it will be able to be tracked down a whole lot quicker\nAnd the recall will happen a whole lot faster and the danger to people will be greatly reduced we cannot make a food supply a hundred percent safe\nBut what Walmart is doing is great and any number of large players\nIn the food industry\nBoth manufacturers because it can also be I mean people get sick from things other than produce you know give me actual um\nCanned food or or processed food that can make people sick as well\nAnd so food manufacturers are part of this process also and John who is part of our Clark dot com crew recently was in a store with what were

bag of shouldn't that was on sale took it up and as the associates scan the shrimp or there was an abnormal sound or you know not the normal lip ah so I looked at the screen or the associate with looking at and it said a do not sell this item\nOr an it printed out a little ticket it said to attach this to the bag of shrimp and column manager or and so the manager came over and a U.S but you know what this could possibly be and she said we really don't know we all we looked at the expiration date or wasn't expired didn't expired so next year\nI'm In and I said well you know maybe there was some kind of recall\nA and the manager said you know that that's entirely possible or the you know at this point we don't know so I've looked since then to see if there was a recall on any kind of frozen shrimp in there hadn't been one and a couple of years I'm ... is that maybe there's a recall in process um and it just hasn't been announced yet but they would not let us buy that bag a

enough and your child is young enough that they can qualify for Social Security of course they were more politically correct and they said if you were Social Security age and they were a minor\nBut it didn't do anything to say what the amount would be so I made a phone call the Social Security and I said you know here's my scenario what do you think of it is the end result of that conversation was they said yes there's no reason your son wouldn't get fifty percent of your benefit\nWell that sounded exciting but I've learned that you don't trust people on the first phone call or customer service kind of people I've done that before I've listened\nTo the advice made a decision turned out they gave me the wrong information and it made the wrong decision so I thought I better double check this I made another phone call different day got a different person they basically said the same thing they brought in this idea of a maximum family benefit\nBut she said yeah you get fifty percent of what your benefit is though she called me a number that was why you love your\nShow now I'm left with wondering well what do I do like a another phone call too I Know\nI'm Wondering is ... I Want you to spend some money to see if it's right for you to do this now costs to forty dollars to do what I'd like you to do\nReady ready\nThere's a website I'd like you to go to called maximize my Social Security dot com\n\nIt's the most is Decatur tool that I've ever seen or heard of that will allow you to run the exact scenario of your exact situation\nAnd figure out if your answer is different than the the general answer the back of the envelope answer is always wait as long as you possibly can preferably days Seventy to take Social Security even though nobody seems to do that but\nIf you run the analysis\nPutting in you have a minor child and all that at maximize my Social Security you will get the answer that will be definitive for your exact situation and you'll be able to see the numbers laid out for you it's a forty dollar license\nAnd it will buy you the guidance for a year or so you can neutral way you can run different analyses and figure out the exact right moment between you being passed sixty two and a Seventy when to take\nCan I add one thing in sure\nI did go down to Social Security office and I felt more comfortable with somebody face to face and they did verify that and they quantified the amount of money to get the thing that was surprising was they said it would be fifty percent of my full retirement age and\nWhich is what you think it's fair to say say my six to sixty six years two months is that full retirement\nYes yeah\nAnd so when you compare that to what I'd be actually getting it's really a sixty four percent bump he would get and then my calculations based on what they print it out and gave me it means er an accumulation of additional Ninety five thousand dollars in the first seven years of taking my benefit\nSo really what my question and I will check that website as well to confirm this but this is what Social Security it's only one I'm Wondering is pushing let's break even point wears a Seventy is the winner if I push this down the road a little bit basically\nThe break even point for me would be at age eighty where without the child benefit a sixty sits starts to win but by adding another Ninety five thousand dollars in that break even point goes out to my eighty eighth birthday your opinion is that far enough down the road kicked the can say it's worth taking the money early on\nI mean by the scenario you painted yes you'd want to take the money early on rather than waiting but again we're we're still talking back the envelope and that's why I Want you to go run this full analysis where you're putting in the variables and you see exactly\nWhat that precision moment would be for you ... dollars is worth it oh\nYeah I mean we're talking about money like this and the time you'll take 'cause you're a very careful man you talked to two different people you went down in person you want I can hear it through and through can you want to get this right\nAnd I know of no better way again the maximize my

your mortgage tell me about that\nYeah that we currently pay a ... and ... on our mortgage what a pretty good at saving money and we put out a lot of money into that we were wondering if maybe we should make a really really large payment toward our home instead of putting investments like I\nYou know when you have an interest rate of four percent\nOver the long haul you're likely it out or in that in your investments\nSo I Would say that unless it say\nDesire on your part specifically to be mortgage debt free your money is probably best put in to investments than being diverted to the mortgage you have any other debts\nNot only now\nIf you have no doubt that will be done and you see if you have\nNo debts and you really would like to steadily pay down your mortgage\nIt's okay to do that you know it's not it four percent it's not highly advise but it wouldn't be an awful idea because the power of being completely debt free that how that feels is so great\nRight so I Would say that if you look just dollars and cents your best off continuing to be very very focused investors but if it would just make you feel\nThat special feeling of freedom paying off the mortgage if you want to do it go for it but I Would not re fi it\nOK okay fine\nWell best to you and a lot of mortgage outfits will send out solicitations to get you to try to get you to re fi and often there'll be a bait and switch to it offering you a rape that they just made even make up\nTo try to get the phone to ring or to get you to respond to an email and they're real rates are often quite different than what you get in those solicitations\nDavid with us on the Clark Howard show Hi David\nHi Clark thank you for taking my call and your show and what you do like a credit Senate vice my daughter and I
