stuck out in that report and I had a dilemma about what to do so\nOn my credit report is a credit card that my parents opened in Nineteen Seventy six and I wasn't born until Nineteen eighty five so you know\nThat was probably added to that credit card once upon a time as it authorized user you know teenage or something like that so my question is do I get my parents to reach me as an authorized user of that card or has that card actually been helping like credit over the years\nBut it may have helped at one time but at this point I mean here you are at a point that you are I'm thirty three years old that's correct\nAnd thirty three you've established your own life you of your own credit you have your own history\nAnd that being grabbing that card listed may be irrelevant and as long as your parents are good payers it may be a little bit to the good and mayor better prior time been really to the good\nWell that was what I was looking to understand you know it's got a twenty thousand dollar limit a average monthly spend on this card is about five ... and and it's been paid on time for years and years and years so it actually is in good standing\nThen I was ... I Would leave it be and you know right now I have a mortgage lender and the underwriting department said ooh Ryan you got too much available credit we're worried about that\nThat would be the point at which you would check with your parents see if you are in fact an authorized ... could also be an error and credit reporting venture listed\nAnd so that would be the only reason you would want to have

been booking with the hotel brands own website or reservations line itself\nSo there's this fight going on where the owner of an individual property or the manager of an individual property wants to get as much occupancy as they can and so they are\nAre offering bookings through these third party sites to fill rooms that might have gone empty otherwise hotel chains are trying to do everything they can to get them not\nTo want to accept bookings particularly from price line or hot wire\nAnd so now the hotel chains one by one are rolling out price match guarantees\nAnd so here's one I'm looking at veil and when\nYou find out what we are qualified praise for the same accommodation in terms at any point before your reservations made her up to twenty four hours after making your

unfortunately Hilton has one Astros to get one part to answer is that another and the reality is\nThat you're never going to be successful doing the price match it's a marketing thing\nAnd I recommend

going on and it was like four hundred Ninety seven dollars and so my daughter just automatically didn't know me\nAnd I was just kind of style of dead at how long are at work but I I've read on it and I mean like with the technology today that I really wanted to hear from Iraq a lot of friends from other states were asking about it and\nI wanted to ask yeah\nI'm I'm completely comfortable with using ... among family and friends yeah in\nThe area they even warn you about is don't use it as a way to pay somebody who you're buying stuff from sight unseen or anything like that because of money can take a one way trip to a crook but way out\nAmong known people it's wonderful\nWell I'm so glad to hear that I really am that that it's all a lot better because I I actually just seems like I stepped into it before I researched it but you know your\nTemperature daughters I mean think about it they they approach the world differently and they live in the midst of technology all day long and\nI Would trust him on that\n... is with us on the Clark Howard show and pat I'm really sorry to hear that you recently lost a loved one is that right\nYeah Sarah my husband passed away in ...\nI'm very very sorry I'm Sorry for your loss on edge I Hope that I can be a some service to you how how about how simply be of some help to you\n[noise] well my husband had a pretty nice term life insurance policy\nAnd of course I'm going to end the beneficiary on that and\nHonestly throughout our lives because we were we were in church ministry we never really had a whole lot of money to invest with ... I don't know anything about investments we of course didn't have any retirement or anything like that and so now have the opportunity to have some money to\nTo make sure that I have enough to live on that I don't have to do that so that it won't run out\nOf pat first of all again I wanted to express my sympathies to you and I have to ask you a question it's always difficult pattern a woman how old are you\nI'm sixty to write and are you continuing to work for years to come or would you like to stop working sometime soon\nNow I'm I really enjoy what I Do and I I don't have any definite plans for retirement or anything like that as far as a timeline ... is concerned I mean did help and I have a ... you know have a job that you know pretty much takes care of my my living age\nIs really money for down the road and you want to preserve it and have it grow for you as best they can for your rancher\nBecause I probably won't have any other name says you know income once I Do like higher quit my job\nAnd if you were to grade your knowledge of investing from let's say ten being extremely knowledgeable to one being knowing very very little or almost nothing about investing where would you put your\nOn that scale it would definitely be a wine [laughter]\nOkay so in that hey this isn't a unaccustomed to you Marge sum of money that that your husband made sure you would have in the event of his untimely passing by and you're correct you've got to be so careful\nAnd there are ... unfortunately there are people out there who will take advantage\nRight so I'm going to recommend a couple of things that might be ways that you could protect yourself and ... the first I Would like you to interview\nThree feet only financial planners [noise] the only\nRight these are people who get no commissions for anything that they would recommend and they are what is known under the law is if you do Sherry they legally must work for what's in your best interest\nYeah OK and there's a trade association where you can find based on your ZIP Code people near you who are\nThe only planners through a group called the national association of personal financial advisors you don't have to remember that I've got information on that ... on my Web site at Clark dot com\nOkay I think it would also be great if you sat down with somebody at a is an example fidelity investments\nMhm or Charles Schwab or maybe both of them\nOkay\nAnd then the other you won't sit down with somebody but I Would definitely talk to somebody is banned guard\nOK I'm giving you a part time job I Want you to talk with the independent financial people ride like you to talk with three of the big financial houses that I really trust\nRight\nNow vanguard if you were to use them will charge you roughly a third of a point per year to manage your money for you mhm and they're pretty much the lowest cost to do that\nAnd I typically the the only financial planners I'm Talking about will charge you one percent to do so each year\nAt the decide which one you wanted to go in and out of work hard at night right okay\nSo I Want you to talk to three of those type of people vanguard Schwab fidelity meet with all six\nOkay\nAnd vanguard again the meeting will be by phone the others wellbeing person\nMhm and then make your best decision for those six sources who would be where you would feel the most comfortable having somebody managed to this nest egg for you in again pat I'm really sorry about your loss\nJeff joins us on the Clark Howard show hello Jeff\nColored great to be on your show\nWell

science to his more art and the easiest way to do it unless you suddenly have gotten a big pay raise at work is I did actually oh congratulations\nSo your payroll office will tell you with your normal exemptions what you're going to end up with this check you in that check each pay period you increase your withholding so less money will be held back\nOkay so is it better than that do exist myself
