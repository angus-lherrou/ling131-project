I'm trying to convince my wife and she's kind of odd board it's just our experience with her she's a very good money manager if it's her money ... money it's different\nYeah the sky's the limit well first of all I'm Sorry about your loss of a loved one that we are talking about in ... oh I\nAppreciate that uh as far as your idea of course I'm going to love your idea 'cause that's what I did with my oldest daughter oh really\nYeah I sat down her and her fiance when they uh got engaged and I said here's money for you for your wedding whatever you spend is yours disband if you spend more that comes out of your pocket if you spend less\nYou have the money for a down payment on the house the too if you want\nAnd guess what they they cut every corner and saved every dollar they could and spent substantially less than what I had given them and that was fine with me because they then all the decisions of what really mattered were decisions they made\nAnd and that's exactly where I'm going with it I Know she can manage it uh but it's just you know they say about a down payment on a house or something like that that show shoes that rather than a destination away or something if she thinks you know it's a limited I I don't have unlimited funds\nAnd by the way on the stress something I taught about recently is that\nUm women are now spending much less money on wedding dresses than they used to a lot of wedding independent wedding shops are closing around the country\nBecause a lot of this generation of brides don't believe in spending big money on a dress that she may she may surprise you that way but again\nWhen you say it's almost like giving somebody a voucher and you say you stretch this voucher as much as you want\nAnd it's yours to stretches you wish and if you spend less than that voucher it's yours to keep it changes the whole psychology and the economics I support your idea completely of just giving her a lump sum\nWell thanks very much that's what I Want to sit here\nAnd by the way if she chooses and whoever are intended would be they choose to go get married at the courthouse or do it\nSimple quiet ceremony at their religious congregation and that's what they choose to do the rest of that money should still be there to do with what they want\nAnd I I agree and as I actually structure to make the decisions I just don't trust her if she thinks it's my money that she spent\nA hundred percent [laughter] we're talking the same thing here\n[laughter] okay All right well thank you very much for your call a year\nAnd John is with us on the Clark Howard show how John\n[noise] hey clerks creates you are the comedy I really appreciate you taking my call\nGreat to have you here you have a question that's been on a lot of inquiring minds about ways to watch TV hit me with it\nI'm I'm trying to see my parents a little bit of money on their TV bill it's upwards of two hundred dollars with all the ... stuff together here oh\nYeah that was the bottling with the whole the whole phone and then the Internet it's ... it's over two hundred bucks so they're kind of on a fixed budget and I'm just trying to see if I can help them out a little bit with that\nUm I was looking at a a major carriers a plan of of of limited data\nUm my parents do you watch a lot of TV uh so I'm just wondering if it's something like that would work with them as far as using the limited data on that kind of a plan for being able to watch a streaming streaming service\nYeah and a ... or either of your parents' past fifty five yes\nSo they're eligible for the fifty five plus plans that both the mobile and sprint offer that are Seventy dollars a month total with T Mobile I think it's a little higher was sprint\nAnd it's not just talk normally go ahead team all those the one that uh they were looking at yeah\nYeah so with T Mobile bay we're the pioneers even before I'm limited data that allowed unlimited streaming and so yeah the thing with the streaming though is if they're going to project from their phone to their television\nIt uh only streams at standard definition\nA survey and really into the high def pictures they're not going to have that\nUnless they pay for a more premium plan with T Mobile\n[noise] it goes it if I remember right it streams that four eighty pee on this standard fifty five plus unlimited plan but Seventy a month is so cheap maybe they could get used to the pictures not being as good on the TV\n[noise] yeah that's the thing they do watch uh you know my dad has limited mobility these days so he watches a lot of TV uh so yeah I was just wondering how that works at the end up watching a ton of myself I don't really show it wouldn't really be an issue but ah yeah it's got it got kind of got used to watching it\nHigh dash than I Do watch a lot of that\nShow you'd have to have them on a higher price plan with T Mobile they allow the streaming in high death and I and I think it's twenty dollars more a month a line so instead of being Seventy year would be one ten if I remember right\nOne can okay\nBut then they're able to watch in high def and in order to to watch the high def on the TV from their phone there these wireless devices you can buy now the cost I think about forty dollars\nThat will project what's on your phone straight to your TV\nOh really yeah I didn't know that\nSo uh chrome cast which is the way most people would do that probably cast is going to require a home why find network\nAnd I don't know if\nThey're going to have any home Internet any more when they make these changes\n[noise] yeah it's a typical thing where you know the uh the the local a monopoly you know cable place you know they just they Jack up the race to the Internet you know once you decide am I going to I'm not going to fall in love with you anymore\nYou know it's\nSo with T Mobile it'll be confusing at first but then it will become more clear what they offer with each of their unlimited bundles\nAnd there's an unlimited bundle that for whatever Web surfing they do gives you a four G. surfing up to a certain point on your laptop and then after that\nIt goes to three gee but it's limited to three gee they're not going to be able to watch video it'd probably be able to stream all the music they wanted but this is just for using the phone is a hot spot right or is watching TV that's on limited\nOh okay\nBut a gathering the picture from the phone up to the TV that's where you're gonna have to cross that bridge to help them and these new devices that don't require a home Internet connections what they're going to want\nBecause otherwise it has to be a hard cable from the H. T. M. I. T. V. to the port on the phone and that's a lot to ask somebody to go plug in every time\nThat is true well I appreciate al Clark\nAll right we'll have a great day and make you these choices are going to get easier and easier as\nMore and more people killed the bundle and go to streaming on their phones and all the rest and not even involving a home Internet service you're listening to the Clark

entrepreneur yes there that's all right good for you\nTo um I listen to your show or frequently and one of the shuttle and says I have a credit freeze so I had to an freeze my credit now all of a say expose I'm Wondering what I can do it how many like credit karma or something like that\nYeah I'm a credit card on credit sesame both while you're credits thought it would be great to register both of those\nAnd for example with credit karma us free credit monitoring and they'll be able to work you if there's any new account activity taking place under your identity completely free\nCredit sesame and credit karma both give you the ability to monitor how you're doing with your credit as you go about the process of trying to get financing for your business you're able to say hey I'm my scores blah blah blah I'm In good shape\nTo borrow that money\nWhat are your funding needs to be your business is a short term or is a long term do you need a huge amount of money a moderate amount of money\nOn this a moderate amount of money a short term but I don't have any business credit history um that the poet personal credit\nWould not have a gym I tell you I Do that any way you could be in your own business for Fifteen Years and they'll still\nPull your personal credit and they will also pierce what's known as the corporate veil and almost always require you to sign a personal guarantee so what I Would recommend to you is don't borrow money as a business borrow money as an individual\nThat you use for the business purposes you'll still be able to deduct the interest as a business expense where you could not personally but it's money that you're using for operating capital for your business\nAnd the terms and conditions you're under let's say as an example you use a personal credit card\nTo buy things for your business\nNews pay the bill through the business and you recognize the expense and the interest if you pay any interest on the cards as business expenses and that is a perfectly acceptable legitimate business purpose for you to do\nSo that's good advice what what about um how our that they can generate business credit history\nWell okay so when you refer to business credit history people usually referring to a DMV report\nDone and Brad street and that's based on trade lines how you pay the bills you have if somebody or you buy a product or service and they send you a bill ... tenor net thirty over time you may end up with a DMV\nAnd so that is the business equivalent of something like a credit score for a business and so that's how\nPeople might decide let's say you're buying from a supplier and they're trying to decide if they should be a willing to extend your net net Fifteen that thirty whatever and they may in fact go look\nAt a DMV report those have become much less important generally than they used to be because until you get real size of your business\nPeople are generally expecting you to pay on delivery or pay a ton of water\nSo I'm looking at phone services as well you have any recommendations for the Easter says\nYeah I'm packet eight is one that business owners are very happy with eight X. eight dot com\nIn addition to that that's that's strictly a business phone system that allows such flexibility it's mind blowing there's also whom for business\nWhich is a very popular business phone service now a low and may if you go to a low in may dot com and then you go to their business service and\nThose two are the ones that are best known as far as having a veal IP type business phone service\nGreat I appreciate your help\nOkay and best of luck to you with your business Sandra is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Sandra\nHello Clark how're you doing I'm great\nYou have a travel question that is one of the ones I loved that you're asking me before you try to do it\nYes [laughter] [noise] um my question is I Would like to fly to Europe and the origin of the flight is much cheaper from another town and that they have a stopover in my town so can I get on at the stopover\nYou cannot you can do half a loaf I'll tell you how to do half a loaf OK okay you have to do a carry on and what you can do is you can split the fair difference if you buy the more expensive fair from your home town to Europe\nAnd then on the return you do what's known as an open jaw you buy the return that comes through your home city going back to where the fair is a lot cheaper\nWhen you get off the plane in your home city and go through immigration and customs you have to ... I actually don't even have to do a carry on 'cause you you have to claim your bags go through immigration and customs and then re check your bag for the domestic flight you can keep going and go home\nSo let me explain how that works let's say the fair from your home city to Europe just argument's sake is seven hundred round trip and the special fair you see is four hundred round trip\n... if you do with the way I'm Talking about is an open jaw you would pay five fifty for your fair you wouldn't get the four hundred but you pay five Fifteen you wouldn't have to go through the inconvenience of going to the city and buying a ticket to the city where the cheapest fare actually starts from\nRight okay and what about the other way around like if you want to go in the direction of the cheaper city you can go\nThis how cheap is this cheap fair to Europe\nOh it's half\nOh it is half right so in the range or like three fifty round trip let's say\nA maybe five fifty\nFive fifty All right so you buy the five fifty\nAnd then you have to buy one way ticket from your home town to go to wear that five fifty starts from and domestic fares are so cheap that your idols save a substantial amount of money you get there you take the flight back right to where you started from connect to the flight to Europe\nWhen you come back you only needed a one way to go to the starting point because you can do what I said coming back you get to the city where you land back in the United states go through immigration and customs and instead of taking the connecting flight you go home\nRight okay\nSo you're not going to save the full five fifty but you'll say most of it because you might pay a hundred to get to the starting point right\nRight and so how do I do that like on line or do they call them how\nTo you know no no do you do all this on line so you buy one way ticket to be on anybody which by one way ticket best on the airline you're going to go international on right to where the cheap flights start is is one of the deals that's popping up out of Miami Fort Lauderdale or wherever yeah\nYes Miami All right so there's so many cheap fares to Miami from all around the country and Fort Lauderdale so\nYou just buy the one way down there then you start your international trip from Miami\nComeback doesn't even have to be going over through your home city just make sure the return is one that connects through your home city and you just got off the plane there and that's why you don't need light from Miami back to your home market\nRight okay that's ex that all makes sense yeah yeah I think it's so much\nSure have a great day you're listening to the Clark Howard show [noise]\nTwenty and the goal ray carrier ws be twenty four hour traffic center still slow in the south side perimeter to anybody's balance hula planes walk at Boulder crossroads of fifty one heading towards ... wrote expected for Fifteen minute delays going from six Seventy five to twenty into kept outing also seeing construction slow zones and\n...
