work out that you were able to pay it off and nine\nMore aggressive schedule I I kind of laid up playing\nA of getting it paid off in less than ten years because I did a lot of this you know over my

right and I need to\nContact me about that before ... am I correct\nExactly in ... you know has had a lot of spotlight on them for abuses in the student lending industry and so they especially or one that you want to be a hundred percent certain you have a prove that you have successfully paid off your student loans problem\nIn this area is that student loan lenders were granted extraordinary power by Congress I think in two thousand five where they don't even have to prove that you owe a debt\nThey're able to ah sees your bank accounts are able to seize your paycheck\nIt's unbelievably abusive what student loan lenders are allowed to do and that's why you've got to make sure you have every bit of documentation you can\nTo fight back if five ten Twenty years from now they come back

caps on a dairy farm\nAnd I'm I'm excited for him to for what he's gonna learn there but also he's making a nice wage for an eleven year old and and I was just wondering if using a Roth IRA wouldn't be as a savings account for him would be a doable strategy\nYeah so doing the raw for an eleven year old is beyond fantastic because you have to it has to be a custodial raw right ah all three of my kids\nHad Ross from the second they started working and so it allowed them as teenagers to start building up money for the long term and so you can open a Roth with any of my low cost companies I've got\nAnd find it a only up to the amount your eleven year old earns in a year okay and then that money can either grow tax free for the Next Fifty years\nAnd will grow into an amazingly large amount of money over fifty years\nOr your son when he reaches adulthood can pull out contributions that have gone in as he he's a young child through that and then through the teenage years\nHe can poll contributions out tax penalty free any earnings would need to stay in their till he is in fact at retirement age fifty years away\nOkay that was kind of my understanding is that maybe we need to if we do this we need to trap his contributions\nYeah and actually in the wind down the road the phone companies will do that for you now okay so that shouldn't be hard and how much money is your eleven year old gonna be earning there would be available to go into Iraq\n[laughter] well he's pulling down about eight dollars an hour\nThree days a week for about three hours a day [noise] um so it's a

about taking on student loans they're playing harder to get\nColleges are having a tougher time getting people to say yes and the result is that tuition costs after going up year after year or roughly three times the rate of inflation now aren't going up generally at all\nThe list price may be going up but in order to more students into their classrooms colleges are having to offer deals\nPrivate colleges had become really aggressive at offering deals and the actual cost of four year degrees\nIs not going anywhere for cause the increases we've had over recent years have all been because the ease of borrowing money and people unfortunately not realizing\nWhat can be lifelong implications and burns from taking on those student loans so the marketplace is now working\nAnd it's working because people are making better decisions and a lot of private colleges if you're going private instead of a a government colleges state college\nA lot of private colleges now are short if students

I. S. T. W. E. B. dot com okay\nAnd when you go there it's a clearinghouse for a zillion weirdo scholarships\nWhere somebody maybe went to such and such college and studied in the school of blah blah blah\nAnd they want to give a thousand dollars each year to somebody who's studying that same major\nOr whatever on there they are I don't know that they're called micro scholarships but a lot of the money for a kids' college you cobble together and if people are patient and you find\nThe scholarship opportunities that fit you as a student and you start submitting applications it's a lot of work\nBut I Know people whose kids have picked up you know two hundred and fifty dollars missed one twelve hundred from that won five hundred from this other one and after a while it it's real money to defray the cost of college\nSo this is different than when you think about somebody who let's say as a student athlete and gets a half ride or free ride or someone who is one of those very rare or kids who gets a full free ride because they're unbelievable academically no for most people it's\nGetting a piece of money here a piece of money they are a piece of money everywhere\nLine\nAnd by the way your um high school junior grandchild and the grandchild or the parents are going to start getting they're going to start getting solicitations to pay scholarships services\nOkay don't\nDo any of that that's

the blah blah blah foundation does this for people that are retired navy and this one does things for people who were enlisted personnel and the army for their kids or whatever and so that's why fast

one that she had one eighty thousand dollars and she had to send them eight hundred dollars\nOh the taxes and\nPlease ... on the eight hundred the chiefs and the eight hundred dollars\nOr five hundred I think now that said yes I did I called I texted there say my name was ... she said she saw my name it and they sent me back to us and I had won a hundred and twenty thousand dollars\nAnd that I was just send a thousand dollars to cover the FedEx ... as they were like five different things to cover for a thousand dollars\nDid you say you know like oh oh\nI was waiting for the punch line that you sent and I'm Sorry your friend sent money this is an absolute complete and total scam Ruth\nDon't have any more contact with them they probably got your contact information by breaking into your friend's email possibly this is totally bogus is totally a rotten scam Andy's with us on the Clark Howard show hello Andy\nHello how are you today I'm doing well you're so great\nThank you Andy how can I serve you today\nSo I have the question um my employer recently\nHere has started offering a wrong for one yeah and in addition to our traditional four one K. just wondering if that would be the right direction to go otherwise I was looking at opening and my own independent on prior\nNormally if an employer offers the option\nOf a raw four one K. the younger you are the more it becomes automatic you want to do the raw four one K. the older you are the more it becomes a question mark and then if you make huge money it\nGives a different answer potentially as well so can I ask you Andy where you are on the age spectrum\nI'm mid thirties\nMid thirties John you want to do the the raw four oh one K. unless you make a huge salary and the reason the reason you want to do that\nIs the value to you of the current tax deduction for a pre tax dollars going into the\nTo the regular four one K. is not worth enough with the time you have in your mid thirties for that money to grow tax\nFree and then be spent tax free\nAnd so that's why the raw four one K. is such a superior choice for you\nWhat do you recommend than that I kind of got it for more money in the law and justice but they're not just are not in the traditional just by a company match\nYour company match will happen even if you're doing the wrong their match goes in is a pre tax match and will ultimately be taxed\nYou know when you spend it down the road but you don't have to be in the traditional four one K. to trigger the company match it's the active putting money in the four oh one K. whether the Ross version of the regular that triggers the company match\nOkay well thank you very much\nSure and by the way do you know I pulled the terrible trick on you\nOkay yeah\nBecause if you keep putting the same amount of money in after tax ... percent of your pay is you're doing now pre tax I've gotten you to increase the amount of money you're saving for retirement by about a third\nNFL suffering

anyone ever rip you off [noise] I'm a scooter rider [noise] the little ones I I don't read [noise] time on\nAre fine but I have my own scooter\nAs you may recall [noise] about four months ago I fell off\nMy scooter and broke a tooth and got myself up pretty badly for that still ride it\nAnd I've learned from that experience better helmets really good idea as any hospital emergency room seeing people come in on the lines and the birds getting injured they'll tell you the helmet is really a nice thing to have but I never see anybody wearing a helmet\nThen you know you got the weather and all that so where these scooters all came from is from China all\nThe ones that pretty much the bird uses are from a company called mind by\nMets who makes the one that I ride and there are a couple of hundred dollars but also coming out of China not to the U.S that I've seen anywhere yet are ah whether protected middle for lack of a better term like micro cars\nToyota actually has one that I've seen in San Francisco it's a little teensy tiny\nElectric I'm almost car\nAnd so you're protected from the elements and all that the interesting thing is these things tend to St price out at about a thousand dollars so four times the cost of buying one of the little scooters but again you're protected from the elements\nAnd where we would put them in the United states because it's not an if

complete breakdown\nIn transportation in so many metro areas of the country and so many situations where public transit just isn't gonna make it work because cities that developed on the automobile\nDon't have enough natural population per square mile so easily make public transit work\nSo having micro vehicles that you're able to get around in for shorter distances you think about the Lyman bird scooters tend to be for rides a two miles or less\nBut having something that could handle rides up to five miles which believe it or not carries an enormous per cent of trips that people do better ultra short and being able to get more vehicles in the same space\nIs really an exciting possibility for us to expand on how mobility works in the U.S because\nMore pavement not going to happen and\n... besides when we do more pavement all we get is more congestion so\nI don't know if you've ever seen the picture of the three wheeled vehicle one person vehicle that I used to ride
