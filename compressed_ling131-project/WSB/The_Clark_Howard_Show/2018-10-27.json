going to be offering the option of walking out the door with an item and not having to pay anything at that time you were creating another obligation\nI don't even really like these when they're at zero percent interest\nSo even though the offers will be there\nI Want you to really think through cannot afford this is this really going to work with my budget just because they make it easy for you doesn't mean you should do it\nLady is with us on the Clark Howard show how are you doing\nGood how can I serve you\nWell thank you for taking my call I really think the show for a long time\nWell I'm Glad to have you here\nThink yeah so I'm twenty four years old and I don't have any that are there and I'm like ... or ... and I make about forty five a year and my question in regards to my brother he is autistic ...\nOr ... out of ... and goings fine to the future I pay tied up with anything like a happy than there is nothing guy he could fall back on like ... it had to have paid off\nAnd said the only way thinking about is how quickly at least in the house and have begun to lift off at ... out\nAnd said that was kind of one of my question is why it\nWow how interesting so if your parents were to pass away and they own a home free and clear and you're trying to come up with how are you going to have enough money to support your young brother\nYou are a real sweetheart to be more of trying to come up with the solutions for this good for you\nIn care so the idea of at time of your parents passing to turn the home into a rental property that I guess you would manage for the money hanging of benefit to your brother\nI think that that may be unduly complicating a situation where what I Would think would make more sense is to sell the home\nAt the time that your parents might pass away and besides we don't know unless your parents or an extreme failing health they could be with us for decades to come right\nRight so so that possibility of the home being a potential answer for your brother it's just too hard to say that right now\nSo I like the idea of better of your parents instructing in their will that if you are to be the executive tricks that the home be sold and the proceeds be put into a trust that you manage for the benefit of your brother\nWell okay\nAnd that way you you have no idea what's going to be going on in your life all the years later hopefully your parents are going to live a long long time and who knows what circumstances will be at the time they would no longer occupy the house no longer be on this earth\nAnd so there there's more flexibility if\nYou didn't have money that you then have available to see that the care of your brother\nOkay yeah we we can think about that and email it back to the you know it probably a straight guy down there and I guess I can stand it luckily thank you\nNow I have that as an option that ... it into she chaired by you know\nWhat you can do some things right now potentially for the advantage of your brother they can set up what's known as a um five twenty nine ABLE account\nAb Ali this is an account for children are dependents have special needs of some kind of cold and so it's an account to your parents can contribute fourteen thousand dollars maximum to each year\nAnd the money can then turn around and grow tax free\nFor your brother's benefit and then when the money is spent on his needs and care than the money is spent what's in it and all its earnings tax free\nOh these are new accounts and if your parents have looked at this stuff before they may not even be aware that this is a new opportunity for people to put money aside for a child who has a you know can be various types of special needs\nThat farm okay yeah we didn't know that that would that would make great\nDo you think you're a parent and afford to put aside that kinda money for your brother each year\nNo I don't I don't think they can\nOkay All right so let's talk about one other possibility either your mother your father or either both of them in good health\nYeah than X. not how\nSo another way that people funding needs for a child that they're worried about when they're gone is to buy a life insurance policy where the proceeds of that are paid into a trust for the benefit of your brother\nOkay\nAnd that is a relatively low cost way to take care of your brother's needs in the future\nAnd to keep it simple your parents would ah in the insurance policy that they would each by they would name you is the trustee and you would administer the trust\nBecause then it's a whole lot cheaper than if you hire a third party like a bank to handle but for others for your brother\n... well that sounds like a plan in Keystone line\nAnd if your parents are part of any association for autistic children if they are in any support group there'll be people in their who've done this stuff that we're talking about and we'll be able to be of some help to them like ...\nOkay all righty yeah they have to ... miles on it than that\nBut you got a lot going on in your own life but I'm so proud of him no debt and you own your own home at twenty four yeah\nIt's great that is wonderful how you're handling your finances Robert's with us on the Clark Howard show hello Robert\nClark thanks for taking my call\nSure you want to talk about life insurance\nI Do I Do I'm I'm sixty one years old Clark I've been paying on this policy until two which is roughly almost forty thousand dollars I'm at the air we have longevity in my family which ah if I go to nine feet one\nI'll have a total of about a hundred and twenty thousand dollars into a hundred and fifty thousand dollar life I'll see\nExcept for you not in a participating one where the actual cash value will rise overtime above the stated amount\nNo it will not rise above the standard amount\nNo really correct so you know hey over those decades\nA total and it would equal roughly Seventy five percent of the face amount of the policy\nThat's correct that's sounds like a pretty lousy policy yeah it [laughter] yes I Believe it is and that's really why that I met you know where you know we won't\nNeed those benefits we don't eat those benefits at this time we have resources that are you know more than a substantial pay for any journalist friendships so my question was does it come to the point where I cashed out to just

precision\nIf you should keep this policy dump it converted borrow against it cash\nIt out what would be the right move for you and it's pretty involved what they do so it costs a hundred and twenty

I tell you particularly the last decade when we had the banking scandals and the great recession immediately following when I Would give speeches I Would ask\nWho thinks their kids are going to have a better life and they had who thinks they're going to have a worse like well those were very pessimistic days but overwhelmingly people would say that their kids were going to have a worse life economical even they had\nAnd that is not how it's worked out overall in America\nKids continue generally have better economic success than their parents have had but there's a clear divide\nAnd it was also clear geographically\nGenerally in the southeast kids\nAre not doing as well as their parents\nIn the mid west kids are doing much better\nEconomically than their parents which is interesting if you think about the years that the Midwest was referred to as the rust belt and all that and lack of jobs and everything but what was clear looking around the country and I just gave two examples there\nThe dividing line was absolutely education that in areas of the country where there's a big emphasis on education kids do significantly better\nTheir parents have done economically in\nAreas the U.S in the southeast more than most anywhere else education is not valued as much and going to college not nearly as valued and college participation rates in a number of southern states or some of the lowest in the United states\nKids do not have the economic mobility or economic success of their parents\nCollege is not for everybody it's not even necessarily about college but it's about

have their best deals\nThank you for that post I appreciate that and the case of that color that individual ... wanted to know just for anywhere\nIn the country or even beyond that they were specifically interested in domestic\nHow to know the price patterns and so I can tell they narrow into a specific city or area that would be a step too far for them to start checking with local hotel operators versus the trains but I appreciate the suggestion\nClock you generally don't stink but on the pod cast you had to retire in color tell you that she's getting five hundred thousand dollars and it's in retirement and instead of having her take the lump sum investing in diversified mutual funds that she should net her five to ten percent that should matter of five to seven percent\nYou said she should take the new the payout which is much less an end with her death\nI couldn't believe my ears in my opinion this lady will be leaving thousands if not hundreds of thousands of dollars on the table\nBy taking what you called the simplest solution instead she should find a qualified investment person who can explain the options and get her invest it wisely so she can live off the interest each month and not crack the golden egg\nConfusing since this seems contrary to your normal advice so the reason\nI like for someone with a pension to not take the lump sum is that the biggest problem people face in retirement is that they outlived their money\nIn order to generate a kind of return that you suggested five to ten percent would require somebody to be way out on the risks meter in what they're choosing to invest in and many people tend to be\nSuch a mind that money would only go into CDs or savings accounts which will never generate the kind of money that you'll be able to generate from an ongoing payout\nFrom a pension rather than taking a lump sum all up front so it sounds incredibly conservative on my part but in reality my goal is to keep someone from being impoverished later on in their lives\nEvery day I listen to ... pi cast on my way home from work I'm applying to your temper Eighteenth show regarding flood insurance we're a family insurance agency specializing in flood insurance since Nineteen sixty eight\nWhat you said about FEMA and flood insurance stinks Lloyd's of London a three hundred and thirty two year old company rated a offers flood insurance for about thirty three percent less than what FEMA charges the better coverage woods of London has the same little premium\nWith or without elevation certificate assured also race it raided a offers flood insurance at a much lower premium than FEMA\nVets are perspective I've never heard from anyone and it's given by someone in the insurance industry so\nI'm never supposed to have the last word this individual says that they can quote you of lower affected premium than through floods smart talk of\nAnd if that's true\nI stand corrected but let the marketplace decide that if in fact that is valid information you should drawn\nGot a quote from an independent agents specializing in for the insurance as well as a quote from floods smart ... and then you'll be able to make the best decision for the insurance you buy for your family for your home\nClark as a regular listener I have one request of you sometimes you don't ask a collar some details that the rest of us would love to know it might be because you already know that is by the info that was given to you from your screener but we don't for example last week a woman called about buying a business franchise in the house at the same time\nYou advised her to wait on the house\nBut what was the franchise even just knowing that type of franchise if not the brand would be something it's like watching a suspenseful movie and having to cable having the cable cut out just before the mystery is solved thank you and you don't really stink [laughter]\nWell gosh I remember so many of the calls today usually it's like it's such a jumble\nSo when I took that call um\nNever asked what franchise because I Would have gone down a whole pretty quickly that I never would've addressed the house and the franchise issue that I talked about because with franchises I so strongly recommend somebody go work in a business for they ever buy a franchise\n'cause it's not as important to me what the franchise was I didn't have that information\nAnd if I had asked it and they said it than I Would have had to be careful how I Would have spoken about that specific company that specific enterprise and the advice may have sounded fuzzy at that point I made a decision not to\nAsk and maybe you're right maybe a lot of people were sitting there saying well what franchise what franchise and maybe I should have handled it differently\nClark love your advice keep it up I think you missed on the terrorist issue I support free trade the problem is that China restricts access to their markets and requires offset\nYou gave me an example of America strengthen the aircraft industry the fact is Boeing was only allowed to sell their aircraft in China after they agree to a technology transfer and to move the assembly of the seven thirty seven to China you give an example of Google\nFact is Google was only allowed to enter the Chinese market after they agree to filters that met Chinese propaganda standards Google was given an ultimatum agreed the propaganda filters or China will steal their search technology build their own search engine that would be used exclusively in China and then they will become a competitor throughout the world\nYou said that apple has no rival many people would say that Samsung is very much a rival Simpson is South Korean but has to build their phones in China simply put Chinese trade barriers distort the markets terrorists twist it back to where it should be\nI Want to thank you for that post and time will tell if the tariffs which are taxes on the goods we buy are going to be effective as a way to deal with\nSome of the behavior of some of the practices in China there's no doubt that China is an economy\nManaged by the Communist Party and there are manipulations there are restrictions on what foreign companies us European and other Asian companies what they're actually able to do\nIn their operations in China and those are true market distortions\nAnd so this is not\nAn easy one that easily fits a simple solution tariffs on the other hand or a blunt instrument to try to deal with the disputes we have with China and it's my feeling that tariffs hurt the American people\nJust like they may or may not hurt the Chinese people but much more likely to hurt us than anybody else\nClark has a stinky dietitian\n... terribly I fully agree

where it's all about you in that wallet or yours you to learn ideas me so you can keep more of what you make I Want to talk about what you make so as you may be aware\nI have I was always a very eager student of economics and undergraduate and graduate school and I have long been skeptical of minimum wage laws\nAnd they have enormous popularity with voters and whether a state is a Republican oriented state or democratic oriented state or where they call that purple and mixed state\nNo matter when there's a citizen vote citizens vote overwhelmingly of all political persuasion to raise the minimum wage\nAnd again I have never\nThought the minimum wage was good economic policy\nAnd I've always held to believe that if you raise the minimum wage too much that you create unemployment is employers look to automate functions that people may have done at the lower end of the wage scale I even cited to you last year\nA study done at the University of Washington\nThey put out a paper showing that an increase in minimum wage in Seattle had been disastrous for employment and of course what's known as confirmation bias I saw that and I share that with you\nSo today I eat crow because the researchers at University of Washington and a year later have said oops we were wrong\nAnd in fact the increase in minimum wage improve\nThe lives of people who had been earning the minimum wage and did not decrease their unemployment\nSo that\nWas something that I was not prepared for first I Want to give the researchers props for being willing to revisit the research and acknowledge professionally\nThat they were wrong and that under further examination the minimum wage increase did not destroy employment\nAnd\nIn fact it did lead to net fat or pay checks for people because\nI'd always held to the theory\nThat you would reduce hours that people would be scheduled for work Andy would reduce the total amount of employment\nAt lower end jobs and on both scores it turns out I'm wrong at least according to this is deep dive research done at University of Washington normally when you have\nResearch that points to a different direction than prior research it's the methodology
