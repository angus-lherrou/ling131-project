there's a big push coming out of Washington to require drug manufacturers in these crazy TV ads they do for\nDrugs to disclose in the ads what a prescription actually cost for the drugs and the pharmaceutical companies are going crazy like what in the world are you thinking why would we ever want to tell anybody\nThat those beautiful models running through a beautiful setting with the backdrop of magnificent mountains are lakes or oceans or whatever they're smiling year to year well their commentator says\nMay cause your right arm to fall off or may cause you to have really sad suicidal thoughts or whatever\nDavid Lazarus of the Los Angeles times\nHas written recently about the proposal from Washington vet pharmaceutical companies post prices and what's your perspective on this\nAbout having to disclose that those smiling people are taking a drug that would cost you two thousand dollars a month or whatever\nWell first cargo let's get a little credit to the president for at least\nLighting drug prices as something that he's concerned about and indeed since the campaign he has repeatedly return to this and even that drug companies are getting away with murder when it comes to pricing but that said he has offered no\nSignificant maneuver or rule whatsoever to lean in drug pricing and what we got out of the administration last week\nOr simply a proposal that along with all those crazy side effects that get listed what we see ads for prescription Mets on TV the drug company also has to include the list price of the drug and the intent here let me administration says\nIs to shame of the companies to bring these prices down because so many of these places are in fact indefensible oh there's a bunch of problems to this first of all what price would they put in the list price which nobody pays the actual price of the wholesale price\nThat clear but the bigger problem is the drug industry to look at that said now we don't think\nSo and then they turned out the first amendment and said you can't compel us to say things we don't lawns and I put out so called to some constitutional lawyers to say what was that true I mean they've got a list on the side effects kept they also be forced to list the price\nAnd the lawyer saying you know it looks like you can make a case from the government's point of view to coerce speech if they were the public interest\nOr public health or safety involved and that's why you do get the requirement for all the side effects but it would be very difficult for the government to argue that there is a public interest in simply shaming these guys with the scarlet letter of having to publicize their prices and so the lawyers are saying you know what the drug industry is going to take this all the way to the Supreme Court\nWhere they will probably win in a citizens\nUnited environment where drugs or\nBusiness has never had more rights and more power and the upshot of this is first of all this is a fight there for the government is a way to win and second of all if the drug industry has forced to litigate yes what they'll just pass those costs on us\nAll right so let's go to the core or something and

you if this is your starting point of saving for retirement you want to do is as much as you possibly can stomach financially so in the four one K. did they offer a match where you've gone to work\nThey start off at six percent and then they build from there I think you I Can't remember right now what the top out is but I Know they start off at six percent of whatever you could\nWrite so you want to put in as much money as you can to pick up all the free money they're going to give you write\nAnd do you know are you offered the option of doing what's known as a raw four one K. or as

going to show a rough four O. one K. ...\nYeah yeah yeah so I I it thirty six I Would go a raw four one K. money the employers matching will be a put down the traditional side\nThat money you contribute goes on the wrong side and if they keep raising what they'll match based on how much you put in\nI Want you to go as far as you can putting money into that raw four one K. so you pick up every single dollar the employer will throw at you and if overtime they'll throw more money at you you increase what you contribute\nAnd in the plan there will be if I'm gathering investing is new for you is that right\nYeah I had just basically started with a ... program before I transferred into my new job so I've only ... you know I'm only doubled within just a little bit or I you know the

S. for apartments\nCondos are hotels have already become much more efficient we need to do that was single family homes so that once again the ability for a family to buy a home as a first time homebuyer is restored\nJanet joins us on the Clark Howard show hello Janet\nHi clerical for everything you do certainly how're you doing\nI'm fine thanks good how may I serve you\nWell I have an older car about fourteen years that I've pretty much the kid at ground [laughter]\nYou are so to ... brilliant that [laughter]\n'cause you know are there was a guy who used to do personal finance stuff who ran the numbers and figured out that if you will keep the cars that you drive the vehicles you drive on average if you buy a new one keep it ten years or longer\nChanging nothing else in your life that that one thing of of keeping vehicles a long time allows you to retire five years sooner\nI hadn't heard that like I Am I I'm\nNot even close to\nThe point I Believe [laughter] try saving and all that stuff\nBut think about the whole you would have buried yourself if you got new vehicles like so many people do every three or four or five years\nRight I don't either fighting what little lion happen now [laughter]\nAnd you said this one is Thirteen or fourteen years old right wow well you have you have earned the right if this one's breaking down to jump in and get something else you don't feel about that however\nWe are hoping to have it for my daughter but ... the transmission have gone and we replaced it with an older and a couple of years ago [noise] so I'm Wondering how we can still get any money out of it\nWithout putting another transmission on their chest care salad\nSo what would it cost to replace the transmission\nI who were fingering even for it with an old used one that would probably end up around eight to get it out\nAnd do you know if you looked up to see approximately what the vehicles worth your was worrying because there aren't that one show\nUm I had thought about it but I have done it yet I thought maybe it might have spent might have great I'm poking around three thousand\nSo this is gonna sound weird to you but if you can fix the transmission for somewhere a little less around two thousand dollars and it truly would be worth three thousand\nI Know this is nuts but the math says it would be worth fixing it and then having your daughter drive it\nOkay maybe downloading aren't getting on right on\nYeah I wouldn't do that and you got so little for it because the reason is is that and this is this is something I'll tell you my formula I'll tell you what Consumer Reports says my formulas ban when the value of a vehicle\nIs such that the cost of a repair exceeds fifty percent of its remaining value so in the example you gave if it really is worth three thousand dollars and it costs you more than Fifteen hundred\nTo put a new transmission transmission I'd say dumping the Consumer Reports ran the numbers and they said that's ridiculous\nThat if you can repair a vehicle\nAnd even add again the costs of the repair its bless the remaining value so anything less than three thousand you're better off repairing it and driving it you know even if you get just several months out of it you're still ahead of the game\nOkay\nNow as far as the way you would do for yourself whether you choose to repair it or not and there are two things you've got to find out before you do at first what would really cost to replace that transmission and then second what's it really worth it you may decide even if those numbers still\nLike you should repair it you're just done with it after fourteen years that's fine ... many times there will be a shop that will buy it from you because they're getting a vehicle for a deal and then they put in a transmission that their cost and then they've got instant transportation or good price\n[noise] well that one rather question why is you know would would there be a chance for a long time telling it or not hurting\nYes certainly there are all somebody in the business because they wouldn't make sense for anybody other than somebody who knew how to do that kind of work and could do everything on the cheap\nYeah and they if you were to sell it on repaired they may be your best potential customer it'd be worth much more than donating\nOK okay but as far as raising it what are you thinking would you go brand new or would you buy a mid age used vehicle or what would you you think would be hard as you said you're actually\nLooking at a at a ten year old upper level car that haven't that life expectancy [laughter]\nSo you in my producer Joe or probably related and don't realize that [laughter] because that's how he buys vehicles\nWell it's kind of necessity where it's not in a position came much house\nBut what's great if you buy a vehicle that ten years old they are very little market value left but potentially have a great deal of mileage still\nTo run that for her\nAnd so uh if you don't have mechanical knowledge yourself even though you have to lay out money to do it if you're looking at a vehicle ten years old try to keep it one that's got a hundred and twenty five thousand miles on it somewhere in that range\nFrom eighty five eighty five thousand miles\nThat's wonderful as long as they check this out by a mechanic if we're choosing that sounds like a very smart use of your money\nOkay and I hope that it gives you many years of reliable transportation moving forward\nPete is with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Pete hey call Eli I'm great thanks I Hope everything's wonderful in your life\nBecause a lot of calls ... ... ... uh well in my case it still like credit in in in ... as the logo on it and law they are so low class we\nYeah calling the trash fake visa\n[laughter] yeah I just wonder what was the case so it ... it would fail a ... a ... to ... about it\nWell is there is no such thing because the protection zero afforded with a piece of trash bake these are fake MasterCard which is a visa and MasterCard debit card that attacks your checking account or the credit union your equivalent to share draft account the problem is is that federal law\nDoes not give you the same protections so it was an example of the one place you never want to use a debit card is buying anything on line or anything you're gonna get later\nBecause if they don't deliver it your bank or in your case your credit Hughes says that's just too bad Pete because you know that was like a check you wrote and it doesn't matter they didn't deliver your out your money\nWhere the credit card you're protected for failure to deliver goods or services\nIn the event that somebody compromises your number or your card\nWith a credit card generally your liability is zero but in any circumstance is maxed it fifty dollars with a debit card your liability under federal law is generally five hundred dollars minimum up to a maximum of every penny that's in your account\nNow a number of visa and MasterCard issuers have said they are are following an administrative rule where your liability is kept it either zero or fifty dollars for a debit card but they don't have to do that\nOver the wall is not there to protect you you're depending on the kindness of the financial institution to do that\nAnd then the other thing is if somebody steals your account number you're in possession your card even they steal your card whatever where they credit card no money leaves your hands\nAnd they're worried that one of them they will name or kill its

when are we going to be there when are we going to be there\nYou know you give them an Internet connection there'll be way we are saying the car longer I Need more time with this\nBut I think about all these things are good and bad right the advantage for people on the go on the road to be able to stay connected if you're traveling is great I remember for ever ago\nWhen the first mobile unit
