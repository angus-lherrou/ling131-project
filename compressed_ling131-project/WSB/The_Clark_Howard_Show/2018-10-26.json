Ciau right um so\nThat's kind of where I Am is I Want to just take some loss if it might be worth it initially just to get that mortgage ... out of there\nAgain that is a fascinating scenario you're painting to me and one that that no one has ever posed to me like you did because you're talking about um your faith\nWell you having to uproot twice and a couple of years but if you wanted more certainty that is what you can do you could keep this property\nYou move somewhere else as a renter you lock in that ultra low interest rate you have at three in a corner\nMy only real concern with that scenario is that you then are in a position where you're going to be living in Tennessee with a rental property in Texas and that is very difficult\nTo manage from so many miles away\nEither you do you have any experience with dealing with better the uncle chocolate agencies or whatever they might be called a of a play date\nWith what was that expression use I'm Sorry\nA is a property management\nOh yeah property man I use a property manager to manage a rental property for me that I have that's three hundred miles away that I just could not adequately properly manage it and so it depends on local conditions but in my case I pay half\nOf the first month's rent is commission and then after that I pay a much lower\nCommission re moving forward so I tend to attract long term tenants\nAnd so I've got a big hit up front and then small where after that the disadvantage to me is that anytime something breaks when I'm build for it for repair maintenance something like that seems like it's not the most generous bill ever\nBefore a Senate does tend to be fairly high 'cause I mean they are providing a service to me overseeing the property and managing it so you have a significant rake off in your net revenue for cause of the commission's you're having to pay and the ongoing expenses you pay\nSo I I don't know even with that very attractive mortgage rate\nI don't know that you fit the scenario somebody who would keep that\nProperty as a rental going forward and so in that case I Would say why don't you keep it simple for you and your family lived there until a it looks like you're ready to move to Tennessee\nAnd then put it on the market at that time you'll have the benefit of maybe a couple more years of your mortgage based on that three in a corner\nAnd then at that time you sell it and you move on there are no perfect crystal ball but that's what I Would do\nJudy joins us on the Clark Howard show hello Judy\nClarke how you doing I'm\nI've been a big fan of your show for so many years and now we're retired in Daytona Beach\nWell how do you like living at the beach\nOh love it love it I live in paradise oh that's great\n[laughter] and Clark my questions about auto insurance\n[noise] ah we have a what a major company is calling in non castle oh see I ... if it actually what does that mean a no matter how many a wreck or accidents I have that are my fall well I still the towers but\nAt what a at what cost\nYou you just laid out better than I ever could [laughter] you know this is a gimmick with the non ... auto insurance policies because unless it also includes a cap on how much your premiums can rise overtime\nUh-huh then I don't see any great virtue and somebody saying\nNo matter what you can be the wars driver and the world\nWe're still going to insure you but if it doesn't say at what cost that promise means nothing\nOkay you know I've been talking to some other companies and I'm thinking gosh do I want to lose that and that's it but um you just to sell my problem\nHow long have you been with this ensure\nOh gosh forty years\nAll right so let me tell you somebody about your insurer they are one of the ones that uses what's known as loyalty index scoring\nWhich is a new would definitely be high on the loyalty index score having been with them more than forty years said a charge you higher rates because you've shown yourself to be so extremely loyal\nAnd they know that a certain percent of their customers tend not to comparison shop tend to just remain intensely oil and so your reward for that is higher rates\nUh-huh so you're finding a significant difference and what they quote you and what others are quoting you that's why they're charging you above general market rates what kind of difference have you found so far\nOh not a not a huge amount a a like an old are and not so I'm not carrying a lot of the coverage on it um you know like God is for every six months probably a couple of hundred dollars\nWell you know a couple of hundred is less than I Would expect you to tell me is the difference\nI and uh make sure the coverage is you're getting quoted are the same and they you can make a call whether in your life four or five hundred dollars a year\nIs money really a better in your pocket or if you prefer since you've shown yourself to be such a royal kind of person if you'd rather pay them more money and stay with who you're with\nBut as far as that guarantee from them that guarantee unless it also covers premiums is worthless\n[noise] W.

great so far up and learn a lot for sure\nThank you so just got married\nYes yeah so we got married um and we're in the process of combining all our finances all that kinda stuff and so I was just got older and\nUm we're both on the same financial standing uh she's got a little bit of a school that I've got a little bit of credit card that we both like salmon a lot of money [noise] um so as far as combining finances go as water you know there's a lot of best practices stuff like that 'cause\nI was trying to read on the line and there's all sorts of information all over the place\nWhere one of the factors I look at is how will both of you are\nOkay uh we're both in our mid thirties\nSo at that point when you get married after you've lived independently for a long time don't rush combining everything okay\nBecause you've each develop to your own habits no matter how much it feels like you're on the same wavelength you're not going to be exactly on the same wavelength having been in a position where each of you had made all the decisions with everything involved with money\nAnd it can cause tension specially I'm In the first couple of years of a marriage if you just all of a sudden\nCombine everything so a joke or it's\nDifferent for people who get married in their early twenties which not as many people do any more but getting married in your mid thirties which is more common now\nI like for you to have his money her money their money and by that I mean having a joint household account that both of you share and you have money that you eat to contribute to that each month for rent slash\nMortgage other household expenses that you figure out and then you still have some money that shares in an account and she has money that's hers in accounting\nOkay and then we'll credit cards I don't want you to combine those for a few years\nAll right so credit cards for a few years yeah that was actually going to be my next question because as far as you know combining it to a joint account that's a checking account I Know you don't like debit cards\nUh so I was reading you know there's a thing like with credit cards especially for groceries things like that you can make her like at a cow holder a under my credit card or I'm a joint credit card something like that is there anything as far as that goes with the credit cards\nSo for spending that you're going to do that fits under the house account category like groceries you're gonna both eat 'em your cell phone bills have you combine a cell phone plan any of the stuff you're doing is a combined activity it's great for you to have like a house account credit card\nThat you pay in full each month that has some kind of rewards attached to it\nThat is your first joint credited account but for things like when she's going to buy clothes or you are she's going to get her hair done or whatever because you're each approaching it from years of making individual decisions those things are best at least for now\nLeft as individual charges on ... on individual cards rather than on one that's joint\nOkay and so we can do like a joint credit card I didn't realize that was the thing\nYeah you can be co owners of a cart\nOr she can add you for a house account she can add you as an authorized user you can add her isn't authorize user to wonder if yours for the things that fit under house expenditures the concept is that you know over time you'll find how best you're spending merges is your wife\nOr goes on together but doing it all at once can cause tension\nYou didn't even know could be there and

prominent Democrats and others a postal service inspector says the agency six hundred thousand employees are on high alert\nHow could it get worse than that well so many people change jobs you lose a job you quit a job company lacy off the company sold and then you've got to go somewhere else or whatever\nAnd then that loan you have that you owe is\nImmediately do almost nobody can then come up with a lump sum and that creates a premature withdraw from your four one K. then will generate tax and penalties for the typical person somewhere between thirty five and forty five percent\nOf the money\nAnd think about if you don't have the money at that point you're going to have a big tax smell due to the IRS for fan of money you don't\nHave All right so can you tell\nWhen somebody calls and asked me about borrowing from a four one K. I. like tightened up when I'm answering the question 'cause I'm hoping there's no reason I'll ever green light them borrowing from the four one K. because the if then the consequences so the situation has to be completely desperate\nBefore I always say do this and why why am I talking about this again\nI got\nA email from a friend of my wife\nWho was asking specifically about\n\nTaking money out of a four one K. to pay off credit card debt which is probably the most common reason people do it and I was able to explain to a point that she was comfortable that she shouldn't do the money withdraw from the four oh one K. to pay off the credit card debt\nAnd you know the most important reason not to do that if you use\nMoney from a four O. one K. to pay off credit card debt in most situations people will end up having the credit cards charge backup within a year and a half of when that withdrawals taken\nPlace so please I Know it's easy\nTo do the ... four one K. borrowing but don't do it unless the situation is dire Amy is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Amy\nHi I Am great thank you you want to talk about hitting the bulls eye on the retirement\nTarget\nI looking at the proper you or a retirement and I mean how strongly kind of forces that have ... percent a year and ethnic retirement fund target retirement fund or [noise] [noise]\nWell I wouldn't say a hundred percent or not and but the idea is that if you let's say you're building\nA portfolio and a four one K. or you're building one and a Roth IRA or traditional i._r._a. the idea is that if you're if where people aren't aware of what we're talking about a target retirement fund is where you pick a year\nKind of in the ballpark of when you expect to retire and they tend to be an five year increments like year twenty thirty twenty forty five whatever every five years\nThat you're messing up the whole purpose of the target retirement fund if you put money into it and then still put money into other things in your retirement plan a retirement account\n[noise]\nIt's not like it's something you shouldn't do it's just suggested that if the whole idea is to try to get the right mix of stuff that you were invested in\nThat it really is only effective if you go all in on the target retirement fund where are you in your head with this and how does it affect you\nWell I had an aunt Shirley I'm In my ...\nBut I have to take it off with ... and um I just had this at heart of it and I'm hearing that a or a every turn that I Would expect they are they on average about ... percent lash\nOut at high work at all and that target retirement I\nYou know I I Can't speak to whether you would have an overall lower return over the years by diversifying out from it the idea that target retirement fund is really for a different purpose it's to put you in a position where you have the proper level of risk\nAt different stages of your work life and then as you get closer to retirement\nSo there's nothing that says the you taking some of your money in your four one K. and putting another choices is going to get you a lower return it's even possible that could get you a higher returns but it also might involve over the years potentially more risk to you\nIn law says you could suffer at various points of your work life sure okay\nIf anybody says oh putting forty percent and the target retiring\nTo find and putting the other sixty percent and other things is going to get you a lower return that's not an accurate statement\nOkay I Am from him and I have a great day and can't really tell\nWhat's amazing with the target retirement funds is that any of a number of providers of those in a IRA Ross IRA or four one K. are offering extremely low costs on them and others offering very high costs\nOn the target retirement fund portfolio vanguard which is generally considered to be the gold standard\nCharges typically like point one five of one percent to point to oh of one percent\nWhere other providers may charges much is more than one percent\nFor having money in a target retirement fund that difference decimate eventually how much money you'll have to live on in retirement those expenses really matter overtime\nFred is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Fred\n... thanks for you do for us we get a lotta information from you you're sure do cart or I've been contacted by Fran regarding a multi level marketing company that are promoting a digital coin and I'm not really familiar with what digital coins are\nAnd they're talking about going public and they're not register with their safety and it looks like a ... game to me but I was wondering if you had any information regarding digital coin\nAll right so when people refer to digital coin that's generally a generic term for that one brand name that did establish itself in the marketplace called bitcoin\nAnd bitcoin is an alternative way for people to pay for things around the world and it is what's generally referred to as a crypto currency is not a government backed money it is one is that is accepted based\nOn a daily value that people who are willing to buy and sell bitcoins are willing to take that value what you're calling about is not bitcoin somebody who's trying to trade on that basically what is it that you would do if you were to get involved\nIn this ... business\nAre supposedly don't have to do anything if you buy it invested a certain amount of money anywhere from a hundred and fifty to I don't know four five thousand dollars\nAnd and the coin is like is worth like two or three cents now and they keep posing to rise above the leaves gonna rise and\nThey're going to start a company where you can use your going\nOkay so I Would not go anywhere close to that because first of all when somebody any of us could say today we're going to have Fred money are we going to have Clark money\nAnd I want to buy Fred money because it's going to go through the roof and I'm In a safe red money is worth so much money today but I can tell you in the future you're going to make a fortune on Fred money\nYeah\nFor Clarke money so I Would tell you that having alternative payment forms is going to be part of the future but they're not designed to\nBe an investment they're designed to be a payment platform just another way to buy and sell things and somebody's promising that you're getting in on the ground floor of a get rich quick thing I Would not get involved with anything like that\nThey're they're ... you were eligible for if you do this and get other people to buy them or anything like that\nYeah you can get a commission if you can bring out of the land that's what my antenna\nUh and how much commission like if you got me to buy you said a hundred and fifty dollars worth if you get me to buy a hundred and fifty dollars worth of this this electronic Coyne how much do you get to the commission\nI get a ten percent\nTo ... get Fifteen dollars and then whoever's paying this together gets the hundred and thirty five\n... uh evidently\nAnd the whole product is this supposed money that you're supposed to trust in that doesn't actually exist yet to be used to buy
