it's just the Generation Z in me but how do people burn CDs like how do you get a blank CD and just put songs on it\nAnd the Internet went crazy like how did that ever where did the blank CDs come from first of all I'm very impressed that she tweeted the like she didn't take it out she put like like how do you do this like so that she is a a\nGeneration Z or which they were born from the mid nineties to them in two thousand Ninety seven is the the starting point you are crow is it what is it is it two thousand five two thousand seven then uh and tell where it ends is two thousand ... okay

made CDs and he's been down in the studio and things like\nThat but then it may it got me thinking about other things that millennials and\nGuaranteed generations ears are not going to understand or ever use correct one of the first things that I think would be is is interesting and my son is experiencing this right now\nIs television commercials my son watches everything on your trip right he doesn't know what cable television is it's all YouTube but then we hook up the ... and we're gonna watch Sunday Night Football and it goes to a commercial and he's like what's going on here so we just

if he does see a commercial that only Fifteen seconds yes there is and a half minute commercial there is a skipped right once he watches five seconds of it\nRight I'm In fact when I was at my sister's
