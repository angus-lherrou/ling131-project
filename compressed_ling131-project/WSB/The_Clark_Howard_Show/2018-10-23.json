resilience of our nation\nOr can do spirit seeing\nNew York so alive and so dynamic is it is all over the city in fact if you go to the what they refer to as the outer boroughs\nThe vitality of Brooklyn now the Seventeen years ago Brooklyn was still a backwater\nAnd it's so alive and then there's this area called Long Island city in Queens which was a industrial kinds of slum area and now they're all these gleaming towers they're probably thirty high rises there and that area's become a hip kind of area\nAnd you see what is so fantastic about our nation and that is the spirit we haven't had time as we approach the terms\nThat we in one respect\nHave lost our way and something that's so frustrating for me and that's that those among us that are part isn't that our political\nLook at those they disagree with is their enemies in ... ah dehumanize them and act like they're a lower form of life for the people of either perspective look at the other left or right look at the other is if they're not good Americans I mean this is nuts\nBecause we are all privileged as Americans to live in a land where we are able to disagree and we need to remember the thing that Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill one Republican one Democrat\nSo eloquently stated so many different ways so many different times the concept of disagreeing without being disagreeable I saw\nWith my own eyes\nIn a visit I did to the Pentagon or a few years ago to give a speech in ... you may not know this but I worked in the Pentagon is a civilian employee at the end of the Vietnam War and then I was back to speak at an event at the Pentagon and\nIn between of course in all those years there was the attack on the Pentagon as well on September eleventh and I saw there that the people more than their losses rebuilt and\nThe Pentagon is there as it was before to provide for our nation's defense and security I mean what what I Want you to really reflect on\nIs what a great country we have the\nPrivilege of being part of and how we as Americans\nAnd as a people\nShowed that we would not be defeated by those who wish to rain evil upon us and death and destruction upon us we lost thousands of our fellow Americans that day\nWhat we found afterwards was our strength as a nation and our ability to move forward and succeed in spite of others who\nWanted to bring us nothing but failure we showed in a time of at first to be what we were made of and that makes me so proud to be an American Martin is with us on the ...\nOur ... our show oh Martin\nWell clock how are you today\nGreat thank you Martin if you've been to New York in recent years\nNot in recent years no sir I was there when they were first constructing the towers back in the I guess late sixties early seventies whenever that was on a family vacation\nWell if you went back you would see a completely different New York was interesting when you were in New York New York was as a city was flat on its back crime was out of control nothing seemed to work\nAnd today in New York is and amazingly I provide better term user friendly place things just seemed to work there\nWell that's that's kinda know tells into my question let's say I wanted to go to New York just to see that but I didn't care who wins and there's lots of other places I'd like to go you're in Florida for instance I Want to see them all always well let's see um but I don't care when when I Do but I Want to do with the least expensive time\nAnd I was searching the Internet age is difficult to find a\nIf you don't care when you go how do you find when is the cheapest on but yeah\nSo you got different tracks here so ... in a case of hotels depending on the city you can figure out that pattern really easily it's like I had this question from someone who wanted to go to Las Vegas with his girlfriend and I was talking through\nHow you can go to these price calendars for the big casino hotels and you can see week by week month by month when they're at their cheapest\nRight and you can do that same kind of thing with um any city in America not as easily as you can do it in Vegas well\nBut you can you can go to let's say you go to trip advisor and you put in a city you're interested in going to and you put in um whatever level of hotel you're interested in three four or five star whatever it is right that your level\nYou put on you put it and and then you can put in the dates and put in try different dates over the course of many minds and you'll see the prices move up and down like crazy\nOh I Know over

there's no we're quibbling with hotel so you have\nTo be that's a shame that it will be more methodical is\nNice places to visit and I don't care when I just you know over the next six months you know if you've got the vacation time that you choose when which I think most people get to choose when they go well if they don't care when they go\nLet's go at the least expensive time and no Clark some of us don't have time to go through a week or so much trying days to see a lot\nCheaper specially if you're you know if you don't care went over the next year let's say right and that's another thing European overseas travel it'd be nice there 'cause you you know of course know when the when the off season is in all these places well I have I mean I'm In Pensacola I Know one of the off season is here\nBut I Can't tell you ... years ago I didn't even know what else he's also the state of Florida any different than a year [laughter]\nWhat what you could do is one strategy that might work if you sign up for the hotel specials at a there aren't that many big hotel chains anymore if you did it at Mary odds website Hilton this website and higher ups site\nYes I've seen that and they send you those that would be a way that would be in a work who prices are really low right now to blah blah blah on the air fare yeah inch and patterns so the cheapest time to travel\nTo Europe is November to march except during Christmas\nRight as far as the cheapest time to travel anywhere in the United states\nIt is the first two weeks of December right after the Thanksgiving holiday closes out except for New York city everywhere else on the orient those are the cheapest two weeks of the year so\nI was traveling too but I'm I'm Still looking at driving you know a couple of states away to a town a lawyer you know just for a few days and that's what it's frustrating to find the cheapest time together\nAnd and there is nobody doing that yeah maybe someone listening I'll think think ooh that's a new bargain thing to do\nIs have the technology where you could shop hotels defined the cheapest season nobody's done anything like that for hotels like is done with airlines and maybe there's a business there for someone maybe is a business for you Martin\nIn that spare time you come up with the software code they would allow people to search the cycles for the cheapest time to stay in

Lowery says his neighbor called police seconds later it was like the cavalry had arrived another neighbor Eric Freeman\nIs one of the effects of it I guess and the\nReality is that students are so used to\nGiving up personal information that they think nothing of it but has it really come to that if you think about it what has been true in the virtual world\nThat you get stuff for free in return for giving up your information is now the case in the physical world that free cup of coffee\nYou're paying just not money Sherrie is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Sherrie\nHow are you great thank you Sherry you want to talk about the sun\nIdea and it's a beautiful day here in Abington Virginia effort that perfect day to talk about solar power\nAnd I had been to Abington Virginia oh really yeah great\n[laughter] yeah we're next door neighbor Lynchburg and I'm so most people when they're in this and that the nation it's normally not having tenets Lynchburg next door\nYeah don't even remember why I was there but um I used to spend a great deal of time in Virginia because I went to American University in Washington\n... okay great so let's talk about son\nYes we have a house that the back side of it is to print money enough that I mean it actually kind of been in our first jak\nHardly get to go to a composite just because of the Senate side there so I started thinking what is the great if we could use solar power because we know that it's very sunny side of the house it would need to get back in the house so you know when you have to be on the front panels on the roof\nAnd certainly didn't get a quote and had a couple of questions they can't turn the guy with giving us that he said that there's currently federal tax credit\nThirty percent but\nWhat kind of OK quote did you get for installing solar before the tax credits\nUm would've been about twenty eight ... almost twenty nine thousand dollars\nOr you must have a pretty big house\nWell we have about three thousand square feet but it's a ... in that is that three stories to get there and say so that that believe it or not that one that's covered the whole ... I'm trying to remember how many pounds I mean I think I was just six panel\nAll right I think you've got to do some more work and get some more quotes that sounds way\nToo high\nOkay All right so what would you say for let's say if he was telling me six panels what would be a good All right\nWell you don't really look at that because the system's supposed to be engineered based on what your power demands or and somewhat translated from your square footage\nAnd it it would not be unusual for you like we have a sore install was thirty two panels\nOkay who wouldn't be unusual that you might need somewhere twenty four to thirty two for your house and even that many panels would be surprising if it costs that kinda money\nSo you only have one quote so far\nYeah\nThat would be where I'd really concentrate what's your current monthly power bill average as best you can guess\nProbably around two hundred and thirty a month\nRight so if you're spending a so let's just rounded off let's say you're spending three thousand dollars a year on power you're not going to go every thousand to zero\nIf you ... twenty eight thousand on panels to get the thirty percent federal tax credit so he's going to drop you to let's say Nineteen five\nRight [laughter] I don't know that would take for ever to get paid back on yeah for the camera can act yeah\nSo that does not on the face of it the numbers don't add up to me and that's why you gotta go get more quotes\nOkay I\nWant to be able to get a pay back net of credits in less than a decade\nOkay they said after ten years my pillow out of pocket would be under five thousand house that\nIt is the way that they said you know the monthly installment I'm certain that would be a hundred and forty three and then the installment minus the energy saving energy production what were the it's like you know in a year to do that and that's made about sixty dollars a month\nOkay All right let me tell you when you're running numbers never take their assumptions based on installment payments or anything like that look at it from the raw numbers of what you pay for a system minus thirty percent credit\nTake your three thousand dollars a year power bill figure out how much of that you're likely to say let's say you cut it in half\nSo you say Fifteen hundred dollars a year\nHow long would it take you to make up that Nineteen five plus interest\nYou're looking at for ever and the day and that's why a need for you to go get more quotes and see where the numbers really would flesh out they this is sort of somebody who is a strong strong so we're advocate\nFor Sherry I Need for this to work for you financially not be something you do and you're like why did we do this why did we sign this contract we have to pay all this money and where's the savings Robby is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Robbie how are you doing\nOh I'm doing great car thanks for taking my call waiting for the wonderful things that you do to a educate thousands of people\nWell thank you you've that\nWhat's going on with you\nWell I have a credit card account with one banking institution it is a little bit it's pride about Fifteen thousand dollars I have money saved up which which I could actually pay it off\nBut that would exhaust my um emergency savings I don't want to do that I have another institution it's a credit union and they currently have a promotion going on where you can do the balance transfer and it's at two point nine nine percent for twelve month\nSo I was thinking about doing that\nAnd and doing that I was planning to close out the other account\nThat has the sixteen or right over Fifteen thousand dollars in it but I've been hearing I've heard often as they gave him from during your ah show do not close the account keep it open and use it periodically\nWill you don't have to use it I'm constantly but if you use it even twice a year for very small purchases it will keep it in your credit mix and that's very valuable for you to do you don't want to have just a single credit card\nYou want to have I always call it the Noah's Ark rule you want to have at least two credit cards\nOkay\nAnd the reason is is that the available credit that you have\nOn the two cards added together versus the amount you have charged on cards figures directly into what makes up your credit score okay and so you want to have substantial available I'm use credit\nYou also want to have multiple lines of credit that you can be graded on essentially in your credit report and your credit score\nWell see I'm also her well actually I've been through this before are probably about Twenty years ago I'm retired military\nThank you so much for your service\nAnd thank you so you bet you bet and uh years ago my wife and I were purchasing a fan and we were told at the time we had too much available credit\nRight so we had to do so that a mixed message right yes I'm telling you keep credit open and then it's unusual with a vehicle alone they tell you have too much available credit but where you'll hear that the most often is when you're applying for a mortgage\nBut at the same time when you're applying for that mortgage if you don't have multiple lines of credit it makes your credit score lower and then people may not make you the the home loan or they may charge you a higher interest rate so okay wait until something happens if somebody says no we don't like all that available credit\nAnd then you choose maybe their clothes something but otherwise leave the lines open because if you look at what makes up a credit score is\nAnd the two major areas of a credit score it pays for you to keep that old line open\nBeth is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Beth\nHi there how are you oh
