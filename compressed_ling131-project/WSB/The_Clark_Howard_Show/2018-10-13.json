Debbie\nHi there how are you oh I'm pretty good you're thinking of doing some real estate investing is that right the scandal roundabout way [laughter] what are you liking of doing well\nWhat it is I had on on that money and um and my mother just showed um her home\nAnd she\nSaid you take out so I had heard about this on on on the radio site\nUm that's the same channel that I hear you on [laughter] and they were advertising and it's a vast and ... and then it's a whole bunch of people together and then they enemy is big names like stores and things like that that have actually credit and then now\nI Know it kind of tired I never I never shy about All right so\nThis is a private placement real estate deal where you go in with other people and you own a shopping centers or store locations or restaurant locations or whatever and you own the real estate but if not what's known as a publicly traded\nInvestment it's a form of\nWhat's referred to as a real estate investment trust and Ari IT\nOkay in with these what happens in a rate is the idea of them is that a bunch of people go together putting their money together and they can own a number of different pieces of real estate or types of real estate\nRight what's different in this case and this is somebody has been a more and more popular is that these are like private gatherers the money so you can't go to\nA stockbroker and say you know I don't want to own that read anymore and then ten minutes later you don't own it anymore when a by and you own the big concern I have with any of the private offerings are the fees that you have to pay 'em okay\nAnd the fees to get in or usually high enough like somebody's got to pay for that marketing the hurt on the radio station\n... fees may make it not a good decision to go into I mean you got you got the two things one once you're in you can't just hop out okay and to you got to look at the expenses\nSo my preference in this what we're talking about here\nIs almost certainly not a scam but I think there are better ways to do what you're interested in and that is buying what's known as a ... index fine\nWhere you own little pieces of many many different owners of real estate that might on shopping centers office buildings hotels you know full office parks whatever and so I like that more where your money is really spread out\nAcross the country and across lots of different places and you can buy and sell those instantly and you can own it it almost no cost for the management of the real estate\nOh OK engaged and I get that answer some each month has\nSo what happens with depends on if you go in a retreat or wheat index fine so if you buy an actual publicly traded real estate investment trust they pay you back over time\nThe uh the money you've invested and potentially any earnings they're having\nIf you own\nI'm a ... index like I'm I just pulled went up while we're talking and like here's one that twelve percent of it is and medical buildings six cents and hotels I'm six percent is an industrial buildings\nFourteen percent is in office buildings sixteen percent isn't apartments I mean that's you know and that's where they do they divide out all different buildings all different types\nAnd that way you're not subject to the risk of any one industry\nOkay and\nThere are many of these available you can buy I mean a throw another term as you besides ... which is Ari IT up all the other is ATF exchange traded fund\nThat's how you would buy one of these you can many I mean by for free you know no commission going in and no commission going out and then just very very low management expenses each and every month\nOkay and that kind of have compared to stock market [laughter]\nWell it it is a just a different form of investing you know real estate if you ask somebody an oath fiber of real estate was safe everybody would tell you it was the greatest bio nine people would say it's a nightmare right\nRight and so it's all about diversifying what you do this stock market is only risky in the short term not in the long term owning real estate is risky and the short term but not necessarily in the long term catch so going into a private\nPlacement you know a a private\nVenture where you own different buildings that's a lot riskier than owning a wide real estate investment trust to read because the money is not is diversified and\nYou're stuck with them if you want to be done with them and that makes me very uncomfortable with one that's not publicly traded mates with us on the Clark Howard show how are you doing Nate\nGood how are your car great thank you you want to talk about your child's what's the story\nYeah it said on the other day after listen to your show and I was going to freeze my child's credit but got gears turning and wondered if it would be a good thing to open a credit card in their name before doing that and the reason that data a idea came up is when I was young getting my first\nCar loan I had no credit just like everybody else does so I thought maybe I could use the credit card in their name responsibly so then when they got of the age to need credit it can sort of hit the ground running with already having a a good history\nSo I just kind of wondered what you thought about that\nWell I liked the idea especially if your kid doesn't have possession of the card how old is your child\nI have a nine year old a seven year old a four year old so no they won't be using the car\nYeah I wouldn't I wouldn't worry about it yet they're too young to even to worry about establishing credit and the way establishing credit will work and let's say a decade\nCould be very different than it is today there's a lot of computer modeling that's being tested\nWhere the ability to grant credit will no longer necessarily be based on somebody having credit it can be based on things like how somebody does paying apartment rent or like the cell phones we were just talking about how somebody does paying a cell phone bill that there's behavioral\nAnalysis that is far more sophisticated\nAnd is considered to be potentially a much better predictor of how people will handle debt than what we use right now with traditional credit scores so with your kids as young as they are\nI think it would be at this point over thinking at you know I thought you were gonna tell me you have a child who was like sixteen\nAnd that way I see a good time to start something like that it under today I don't I'm not a yes around eight I just remember when I\nTried to tried to start this when I was young is\nYou know you start with no credit and it was just kind of frustrating 'cause nobody would even look at you with exactly well that's why it just kinda and they told me back then the best way to get credit was to use a credit card responsibly and then go from there\nAnd that advice is still is sound when you were told it then is it is today but by the time your kids are older I'm not sure that will be the advice\nOh also freezing their credit today you've got a lot of paperwork to do to freeze the child's credit but it sure is peace of mind for them because children are so much more likely to have their identities stolen than an adult\nWall it never even crossed my mind until you said you know somebody could use it without you even knowing it which is totally true I just thought well you know they'll assume that it's a nine year old child or done by a car but you for it at all so\nWell I I'm Sorry about that I Wish that the credit reporting industry did a better job and didn't make it so easy for people to steal the identity of a child\nBut it would cost the industry more money for the software that would that would actually prevent all the children's in any theft insist that doesn't really hurt them it just hurts you and your kids\nThey're not putting any effort into that\nSo that is why doing their child credit freeze is such a great idea and the better solution would be if the credit bureaus did their jobs more thoroughly\nThe death toll at Seventeen right now including an eleven year old girl in southwest Georgia that number is expected to rise

to have many more conversations about what I have always called being a Mac saver and that's what it used to be called\nAnd the idea of being a Mac saver is not about a magical date like age thirty that you're able to just bag work forever and I that's an oversimplification\nOf what any financial independence movement should be about and so I Will make sure that I deal in the new ones that you address there\nGoing forward and the idea of people\nHitting aged thirty having a million dollars never working and the other day in their lives that's not really what this financial independence movement should be about and I will continue to deal with the layers involved in it\nBut as for click bait hey that is so much\nPart of how the Internet operates because you're dealing with people's very busy lives and you think about all the things that people post with the click bait kind of headlines in every topic area\nJust to try to get people to click on something so the FIRE movement is no more guilty of that than any other part of the Internet\nClark it sounds like you're when you're out shopping on Thanksgiving instead of watching NFL football what happened to the Clark we know and

tablets\nAnd you bring up a point that is very important involving T Mobile more than any other carrier as well as metro buy T Mobile and that is\nHow important it is with the changes they've made in their network likely to have the new frequencies that run it's six hundred megahertz and seven hundred megahertz because the coverage you get now blankets the country T Mobile used to have had a full

us that experience had expose our credit freeze PIN numbers which could be a pain if someone got it and thought out credit\nHis advice is to log in and change the pen\nClearly Clark has not done this himself as is not possible experience offers no mechanism to reset a pin or even contact them to reset of Penn I even tried calling customer service but couldn't get past the robots so in the end I've had to file a complaint with the CSP began to try and get experience to change my PIN\nI Know this is more of an experience thanks but Clarke should have at least research the process before recommending refunding the Penn thanks Todd\nTried I appreciate that I'm really sorry about my lack of clarity with the Experian pen vulnerability and the problem with it is that even if you've gone through the process of freezing your credit\nThere is the potential that are criminal would be able to do all your credit behind your back without even realizing buying things is if they are you or getting credit as if they are you\nAnd experience process is trouble prone obviously you can't reach people they're the best thing to do this is a suggestion that has come from others in the identity protection or what do we call it advocacy\nArea is that you go ahead and actually kill\nYour credit freeze\nWith Experian remove it you can do that on line then go back on line and start over and set up a new\nCredit freeze with Experian and then you won't have to worry about whether or not you can reach someone or get it done online you can kill it and then\nMake it live again starting over and you can do that bam bam much ... more easily than trying to talk with a human that customer know service\nAnd I appreciate all your post and just wait till next week if there's something that's really
