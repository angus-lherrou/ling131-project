me that a grave injustice but they Christine Blasey Ford has no regrets and she said what you believe was the right thing and are civic duty as\nWow that is the most wonderful feeling when\nBut clock it's really backwards when I share with you I have no retirement set up at all whatsoever I didn't use any I don't have a Roth IRA\nAnd also in the middle of transitioning to a job so I'm unemployed no retirement but my house would be paid off in too much in a couple of months\nAnd can I ask how old you are Dave fifty five fifty five so you got some work to do in front of you\nYes I Do cook I Need to get some help I really do and that's why I was asking is it makes sense to continue paying Fifteen hundred and eighty one dollars a year and home insurance what I rarely fail I don't really need it\nOkay so they're different issues so when your house is paid off\nTake your homeowner's insurance deductible as high as you can whatever your insurer will allow\nAnd that will have the potential cutting your premiums by a meaningful amount and Peter home insured because the purpose of having especially when you own your home free and clear is if you had a real catastrophic loss you know it burns to the ground or something\nYou want to know that insurance is there to rebuild it passed that the doctor bull you don't want to take on the full risk of that after you've worked so hard to pay at all\nI knew you were going to say that clock\nRight let's talk about let's talk about what you've got to do now at fifty five you're going to be mortgage debt free how much was your monthly mortgage payment\nOnes out there to charity and how much of that one thousand fifty was taxes and insurance\nThree hundred thirty seven sound correct\nThree thirty seven for taxes and insurance yeah yeah\nOkay that's why we are doing that religion I'm asking that is that means you're gonna have seven hundred dollars a month\nThat you can start putting towards retirement\nAs soon as you are in a position\nTo be employed again at your new job you start throwing money into retirement you're fifty five so you're allowed to do sixty five hundred dollars each year into a Roth IRA correct and you want to do that so the first sixty five hundred of that you would throw into a raw\nAnd then are you single or married\nOr getting married and by the end of this year\nWell congratulations so they know your your soon to be spouse can do a raw as well and even if she is not working she can do what's known as a spouse or raw\nAnd put money into it\nOkay is that sixty five out at all\nSo yes it is if she's over fist she is correct\nYeah so you can start building up meaning savings right away and have you seen I've got a simple step by step guide to setting up a raw\nHey if I had I went up to that site I almost did it but I um I got involved with something else uh I have a non profit that they don't want a lot of money at the clock I got to stop it okay my passion is taken away my finances\nGot you got to build up or you'll be working forever right\nAnd you've done a great thing paying off that mortgage now it's time to build up your nest egg for your future so you don't have to work forever and a day\nKatie's with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Katie hey there how are you doing\nGood thank you for having me\nSure you are trying to figure out if a Roth IRA is a good path for you or a type of insurance\nActually yeah I ... I went off and we're not supposed to find a five or not for a financial advisor she hadn't told and I we are talking about stuff like\nAnd in our little crime that I've never heard of that fact that we're getting\nNice that we're talking about an index universal life policy is that what you mean I ... yes okay so I Am not an unbiased person to ask okay I Need to lay that out for you\nI hate universal life policies of all flavors\nI hate that so it's going to be hard for me to give you a balance dancer here so why did I tell you why I hate them and wild love Ross and just take it as one piece of information that you can use to make a decision okay\nOkay so we're the Roth IRA let me first say your why a lot of it and we'll compare back and forth so with a Roth the money that it earns is tax free\nIt's not some kind of odd ball way to maybe get a tax advantages tax free Ross IRAs if you go with a low cost company will have an all an expense often about or less than one\nTenth of one percent per year for the money you have in a raw okay the universal life products will tend to have an annual expense of one and a half to two and a half percent so\nThey will be many many times more expensive and over the years the difference between\nThose expense ratios is a difference between you going to work for years more or being retired because you end up with a incredibly larger amount of money\nIn a low cost investment versus a moderate or in the case of a universal like policy it's considered to be a a high to ultra high cost\nInvestment now as far as the universal like products like an index when they're promising is that you earn a percent of the gain of the stock market in years that gains but that you don't suffer a loss in the years that it has lost his\nRight so do you know that's a complete and total lie\nNow\nTotally it's it is\nI mean it's like if I were to tell you the moon is made of Swiss cheese I mean it it really is and it's really yummy nutritious as better tasting than the Swiss cheese on earth\nI mean that's about as equally true is somebody telling you that that's what an index universal life policy does that you get the upside no downside\nRight okay\nLet me tell you why that's a big fat lie\nRight first you're only given a tiny portion of the actual gained the stock market has a year and you don't get what in most years is the most important part of gains in stocks which is the evidence insurance company doesn't give you any of those\nAnd then the downside protection so remember you only get a little portion of the up the downside protection requires that you meet dozens of pages of conditions\nIn the index universal like policy before you are able to have what what would be referred to as the safe harbor of no loss on your money\nBut it get worse than that with the universal like policy\nIf they failed or perform\nAs the illustration you're given says you can get hit with what's known as the capital call where in order to keep the policy from exploding and being hit with a massive tax bill you have to put in more money at a time in your life you may not be able to\nOK okay the\nOnly people who ever make out from any universal life policy is the agent who sells it and the company that agent works for\n...\nI I mean I mean I get upset when I talk about universal life insurance because I Need to tell you Katie I'm has so many people call me over the years who bought one and they get one of those capital call notice is there like what do I do\nThey want another like fourteen thousand dollars for me I have to pay it wound within thirty days or else I mean it's just\nRotten arrow oh gosh\nBy so then I'll tell you the last worst part of it ... the illustration that the insurance agent shows you telling me showing you how the money is going to grow\nAnd not just this guy is going to grow through the galaxy and you're gonna have wealth beyond your wildest dreams they're allowed to make up the numbers on there in both states so they can sit down at the computer and\nPut in what ever rosy scenario they want and then it'll say at the bottom in mice type for illustration purposes only\nTime other than that you can tell I loved them right [laughter]\nRoth I always on the other hand are very simple product you can buy them commission free\nAnd I've got a list of companies that sell commission free Ross the money grows tax free spent tax free they're ultra simple to set up ultra simple to have an ultra simple to spend the money from\nOkay and I think that I explained to me as a long term insurance is that\nHouse Collins and Republican Senator Flake announcing today they'll vote in favor of Kevin ... democratic senator mentioned will also vote yes it's a simple president

wall of yours I Want you to learn ideas to me so you can\nKeep more of what you may [noise] there was a study done\nBy professor at the University of Texas Arlington and was reported on and one of those pointy headed journals about\nPublic health they found that when you live in a suburban sprawl county that you are going to live just under three years less than somebody who lives in a crowded urban core\nI this is something that doesn't surprise me at all I always thought it was because of the time people spend commuting\nAt that time when you're sitting on your rear end in a car going back and forth being sedentary is what leads to the shorter lifespan that turned out to be only one\nOf the three factors that lead to a shorter life\nAnd that is a significant thing though is that is your commute is a time suck\nYou have cut out of your life free time that you might have used to walk or bike or go to the gym or whatever and so again that's one factor another\nIs that if you're doing a lot of suburban driving\nAnd you're more likely to be in an accident 'cause you're driving more miles but your accent is likely to be at higher speed than someone who's in an accident and of course urban area in the U.S the chance of injury or fatality is significantly higher\nAnd then the third factor blows my mind I remember this one research study\nSo there'll probably be another one later the disagrees with some of the conclusions of the author of this but the third factor is that because of all the driving in a sprawling suburban area\nThere's a higher pollution than there isn't a core of a metro area\nI always thought that the corps was where the air was really dirty but it turns out that that's not the case and the dirty air is what can lead to shorter life spans as well so\nThat long commute can be costing your health and costing you three years of your life\nLarry's with us on the Clark Howard show hello Larry how are you doing\nClark thanks for taking my call\nSure you got a credit freeze question for me\nI Do I cook your advice to help protect from identity theft and froze my credit and I'm In the process of thinking about applying for another credit card\nAnd the IRS is so used to this and the state taxing authority so used to it they they all have procedures where somebody does file a return is if there you can get say fake refund there ... there are things you do in order to process your return later manually\nBut your refund is months delayed by\nThe fact that somebody filed a return is if they are you\nOkay so you've prevented the first in most common problems simply by having credit freeze and\nThat's what I Would strongly advise you to recommend your neighbor to your neighbors and they do freeze their credit but the second part the tax thing you just gotta wait and see and what I Would do is do you work at a traditional job even though your wife is self employed\nYeah I Would reduce your withholding at work so that you're more likely not to get a refund next year\nOkay that's the most important thing to do because then if somebody does file a return as if they're you and it slows down your paperwork process thing if you're not waiting for any meaningful refund who cares if it takes months and months and months to generate it you're listening to the Clark Howard show\nTook away carrier W.

neglect mentioned another option and that stinks modular homes\nThese are not manufactured a mobile homes and they are as well belt if not better as thick belt towns they also have many advantages to stick built construction including the bill Thomas considerably less estimated costs are usually much closer to actual costs\nAnd they're constructed indoors and factory and not subject to the to get to the weather during the construction\nAnd number four they're generally tighter and more efficient finally they're generally less expensive to build but they can be customized rack up considerable costs just like any new construction Chris from South Texas\nChris I Am one hundred percent with you on this and we are one of the few developed countries in the world that is not heavily moved to\nHomes that are built in pods that are then taken to the build site now in commercial construction we in the United states are moving steadily that direction\nAnd a lot of apartment complexes now are being built the way you describe the uh time needed to construct is greatly reduced the cost is reduced usually about twenty percent and the quality construction\nWhen a homes or apartments or office buildings are built\nA forgot hotels built and modular units taken to the site\nThe homes tend to be built a lot better because they're being built away from the elements and they're being built and there's certain ... his way on an assembly line\nHey clerk I have come to the conclusion that the trucking industry topics might be one of the subjects you'd rather not broach unless you're trying to prove the age old max and everyone has a right to be wrong in this case you are not wrong as much as you were hypocritical\nDuring one of your monologues you were last march he gleefully

scores\nThe same technology that you were praising only months ago is precisely what large truck low carriers are relying upon as they strive to hire inexperienced cheap and unqualified drivers to keep from having to do the unthinkable pay wages consistent with supply and demand\nAs for being read relegated to the far right lane to lumber along we do that already there called freight trains\nArc speed limits are and should be set using the eighty fifth ... percent percentile rule and to minimize the differentiation between average speeds of vehicles your chances of an incursion rise significantly when you're passing\nAn inconvenience for the guy whiskey about in his Model S I'm sure this illusion of buying stuff Mike in Wisconsin with two point five million accident free miles\nMike ... is fantastic two and a half million miles without any accidents that all that is unreal\nI'll tell you you are on the road all the time and you see how many people and passenger vehicles and trucks shouldn't be on those roads driving and you are a very dedicated individual experience when you're very careful\nAnd obviously the two and a half million accent free miles\nBut the reality is the danger\nFrom the weight and size of trucks on the road and the speed involved is why I Believe in adopting the system used in so many other places in the world of highly restricted speeds on trucks and drivers being paid per hour they work\nRather than being paid for quick delivery that we've created unsafe conditions were drivers are pushed to go too fast and create dangerous situations and I know most of the problems on the road are caused by people and passenger cars\nNot truckers I accept that automation I Believe though we'll save a lot of lives\nClarke you don't think that you miss giving a caller who was unhappy with Amazon a possible shipping option each of the three big shippers UPS us PS instead acts have options to hold items at the local delivery point\nAmazon always gets tracking numbers with that in hand you can go on line and either delayed divert or hold if you have your address registered with UPS for example you can even does do so

we divert them to either a FedEx where they're calling FedEx Office locations or a UPS Store and there are certain circumstances with UPS where they will charge you five dollars for a diversion\nBut if you do it right it'll cost you nothing and they don't have to worry about being there to sign for anything don't have to worry about somebody being stolen and you just go pick it up at a staff location and most of them are pretty convenient to us\nIn response to ask Clark you said that cell phone monitoring apps were pretty involved and didn't come cheap\nWell Clark I've got some for brief
