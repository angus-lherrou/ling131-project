Clark\nGreat thank you Becky how can I be of service to you\nWell I Am in the process of purchasing a new home it's a little bit more expensive than the initial home that I mean in ... and my family has some concerns as do I honestly if something should happen\nTo me ... yes because that would be covered by life insurance that if I become debilitated little counter at ... am and can't make my pain that's what happens to my home and I was\nTold that there is a mortgage protection insurance available but I talked to my insurance company and they said it that's not typically gun anymore so I was wondering what your thoughts are and\nThat kind of any of that ad because I'll keep this clean and I won't use the word they usually use it in the industry but it's junk insurance\nOkay so let me tell you this the background in the industry they refer to this stuff is crow can choke\nSo crow can choke crow paying the if you die choke being you're disabled and so they ... talk about it behind our backs because it's an intensely profitable\nInsurance product like the mortgage life there's a there used to be a blended product mortgage life and disability\nBut the thing is is that what's more important than you set it right yourself\nYou said well I don't need mortgage life insurance because I have\nWhat'd you say you had\nLife insurance exactly it's your insurance that you name a beneficiary for and that been a fishery can then use the money as they wish it would be the most appropriate which may not be paying off a mortgage\nBut the big thing is that the mortgage life insurance this pedaled so heavily costs roughly ten times what a individually purchase life insurance policy would cost\nBut the life insurance has only get if I ...\nLet's say a word choke so which do\nYou have ... you should have more concerns then if if you became disabled and you were unable to work than just what's gonna happen with your mortgage because there are so many bills of life that continue to go on if you're not able to work and that's why\nHaving your own disability insurance policy for disability insurance policy through where you work is fantastic to have and it's something almost nobody buys\nBut is a very valuable piece because during\nIf someone's working lifetime there three times more likely to become disabled than to die\nBut\nPeople will even though not enough people by life insurance almost nobody by ... by disability so\nI Do have short and long term disability three of my work then then you're good okay you're good\nAnd uh how how much would you say you're a wife or with where you're working\n[noise] um I think it's three hundred\nNo no I mean how [laughter] I guess I didn't raise that in English so how likely you are you to stay at this place of employment for the rest of your working career\nI'd say it's highly likely that in the field that I mean it's all so common that people do new federal company to company so\nIf your health is really solid I think it'd be worth it you getting a quote owning your own disability policy [noise] okay rather than one through your employer because if you own one through an employer and you switch employers let's say you're not in health\nAt that time to get the disability policy owning your own becomes portable just like having your own life insurance policy\nIs adding a term life insurance benefits so for me as well animals that they so\nYeah so I Love the term life insurance and having that to provide for the remaining cycle of your working lifetime depending on your family circumstances like do you have minor children\nNo I'm Single\nOkay so the purpose of having that insurance is principal you to provide for survivors that depend on you for income if you don't have anyone that depends on you for income there's likely not a big reason for you to have\nMore life insurance but the disability that you would own would be very valuable\nOK okay that get very good

Le Pen years\nNothing that old should be on her credit items only stay on your credit seven years okay\nAnd so I when's the last time that that if you've talked about this together when's the last time she looked at her credit report\nUm our credit report I'm not sure I Know she's got credit karma so I Know she's monitoring it and she's trying to rebuild um so I don't know as far as our credit report that's a good a good idea to deal with\nSoil like credit harmony hearing on the credit card machines see her reports to and what she should look for is any items that are not what's called H. properly because of her problems with credit go back a decade\nThose things should not be present on her report so she should essentially have\nA no file almost versus a bad file for things from long ago it's not unusual for a collection agency to do what's called refreshed the date to try to keep something active and somebody's mix that shouldn't be\nAnd then what she would do is if something's

year ... Nineteen thousand dollars in coverage and then at work you get it just for breathing or you pay a premium\nOh let's get a breathing\nSo you keep the one that you get just for breathing the policy that's worth a payout of Nineteen thousand that's not enough coverage to really be of value to you\nAnd they are afraid to\nIt so much better if you were to think about taking money and putting it every month towards a term life policy at twenty four years old you buy a let's say a thirty year old level term\nYou're going to be able to get a massive policy for not much more than what you're paying right now for Nineteen thousand dollar face amount policy\nI mean you may be able to easily get like half a million dollar policy without breaking a sweat it not really any significant amount more than what you're paying now\nFor the new it'd be hard for for like injecting a feature careful for free\nWell you know if it were worth a lot more money I Would take you through a pretty complicated process of having an independent evaluation down to the policy at the size is\n[noise] you know it may have some amount of cash value you can borrow against that cash value and that might be the best thing to do or you could take the cash value do you know how much value it has\nNo issue just started to talk to me about it I haven't seen that paperwork yet\nI don't spend a lot of time telling you your mom thanks for this but I'm going to dump it [laughter]\nYeah yeah [noise]\nBut I think that all the likelihood is really great that you would want to\nDo that okay your health is good\nYeah I don't smoke no votes well\nAll right so you can probably get a a big time policy without it much difficulty whatsoever I have some suggestions of places to go to to get quotes to see what you were talking about at Clark dot com\nOkay and\nI Would check those out I've got some now that\nI use an algorithm where you don't even have to go through a health screening and you get real insurance on like the stuff they put on those TV ads that say no medical exams required and you can look at the other services that I have and get thirty year level term quotes from them as well\nAnd congratulations to you Derek on your marriage\nJohnny joins us on the Clark Howard show Hi Johnny\nHey how's it every day on calls homeland as yours how you doing today is a\nGreat thank you I understand you want to talk about money that is not us money not British money not European money not anybody's\nNodding [laughter] talk about bit coins and the number one is called loose on my list\nAbout it and he was telling me about this subject I've never heard of before but he said it it's a tall currency and I said well let me let me get it out you know 'cause I I I'm I Know there's all kinds of schemes are there and I just wanted to get some information\nShe bitcoin is not as a team bitcoin is an alternative way of paying for things and is heavily used by people that are into illegal activities and people who were trying to move money from one country to another\nSo as a way to move money from one country to another it's a very efficient way to do it\nAnd it's also a very efficient way for people engaged in criminal activity to hide their their tracks by buying things and receiving funds through bitcoin 'cause it's virtually untraceable\nSo that's why it's very popular with people that do illegal activity\nBut there's a third group of people that are into bitcoin Johnny and it may be what your friend is into their people believe they can make money just buying ...\nCoins and holding them right right right so let me tell you about that it goes up and down like a yoyo\nBitcoin being used as a spec holding is not an investment it so it was extremely high risk things for your friend he's got to be the kind of person who likes to go to Vegas and throw the dice 'cause that's what you do if you own bitcoin as a quote unquote investment\nFor the other activities well I'll leave that to people that want to use them to pay for things in foreign countries or or doing stuff they're not supposed to be doing\nNancy's with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Nancy Hi there how are you great thank you you are helping your husband's save for retirement is that right that is correct well how can I be of service to you being of service to him\nWell he is probably on my ... so we were all\nSet for him and why that that that but I also heard how can you expand\nYes for people that are self employed no employees who the hot ticket right now is what's known as a solo four one K.

and your wallet and what you learn ideas me so you can save more and spend less and don't let anyone ever rip you off\nI Am just on a slow burn on a particular topic that is eating at me\nWe in the United states have an all volunteer military if you're a longtime listener you know I Believe we should have mandatory national service that people have to do when they turn Eighteen\nEither in the U.S military or in some kind of public service for two years I think it's a something we're missing in society now is the sense of common purpose\nAnd I don't like the fact that military service is not a shared sacrifice in the United states anymore we have the same small number of people being called upon to deploy again and again and again\nIt's sacrifice potentially of loss of life\nHealth or family because the continuous separation is not something that's healthy for most marriages\nAnd we as a country of made certain promises to people who serve in the military one is that they have in return for the sacrifices they make that they have certain rights involved with doing business with banks that the rest of us don't have\nWent on active duty what can happen with interest rates whether you can be evicted whether you can be a foreclosed on whether your car can be repossessed or any of a number of protections under the law that are being ignored\nAnd when they're annoyed by banks the rules aren't being enforced this is wrong wrong wrong\nI appreciate so much that when people see folks in uniform that they applaud that there thanks for their service but let's put more meat behind that and much really do things to serve the people who are serving us\nAnother example of this one came out of Georgia there's a there's a system set up in place that when the spouse of a military person\nIs transferred you know the military person transferred to another state the spouse is then given a waiver of normal professional licensing boards in that state if they're in a profession that requires a state license\nRecently a lawyer in Georgia whose husband was transferred to the military post at Fort Benning was refused the right to practice law even though she was already a member of the bar\nNo doubt that this was all about simply\nProtecting the lawyers already in place and preventing someone from coming in as potential competition I have to say no doubt and guess because the legal board it's supposed to issue the waiver not only refused issue it didn't say why\nThat is completely outrageous and unacceptable\nNo we need to do more than talk a good game we need to support our military personnel and we as a country really need to think long and hard about what I Believe so strongly through and through\nThat all of us could benefit and our nation would benefit enormously if there was a shared sense of service in our country\nWith mandatory service as part of the game I Believe the strong division in public life in the United states is because very few people that served\nIn elected office have any military background at all where you meet people from every walk of life and it doesn't matter who you are where you're from what your religion is
