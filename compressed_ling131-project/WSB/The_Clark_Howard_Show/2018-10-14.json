nationally recognized certified financial planner professional\nAndy Smith with just a couple of minutes away from this week's portfolio review first we have a question for me I was calling from Massachusetts hello any\nLaw so my question is forty eight years old um my husband\nAnd I make I said I think thousand dollars a year I only have about eight thousand tonight thousand dollars on a rock IRA and I would like to watch the football effectively\nMaybe when I looked at it like question\nOkay great question um so you know kind of the easy answer is I usually tell people save as much as you can for as long as you can\nAnd so we kind of on top of that then you've said All right so if you're forty eight you want to work until you're Seventy you've got about twenty two years and so that's a good amount of time\nTo get a fair amount of money uh you know socked away\nOr inside the raw ... here's what you can keep in mind so with your Ross IRA\nUm and then you know the same could go for your husband as well so with your author raise each of you can contribute up to fifty five hundred dollars a year\nBefore your age fifty maybe before you turn fifty so you're forty eight how old is your husband\nDo any sex\nOK so each of you can contribute fifty five hundred dollars a year now once you turn fifty you can actually save you can save an additional thousand so you can save sixty five hundred dollars a year\nWent on the you know when you're fifty so here in a couple of years you can start saving sixty five hundred so what I Would do is just kind of have in your mind you know for these next however many years however longer working you plan on saving fifty five hundred dollars a year before age fifty\nAnd then sixty five hundred dollars a year for that twenty year period of time between age fifty in Seventy\nNow when you when you retire so you want to work until you're Seventy the other thing I Want\nTo do that but at this point choice because I thought\nOkay you know and I would say that you know I'm you've you've got the savings you're going to be working one of the things that we've found that that is most helpful for people's um you know to to find help them find success with their retirement is just working longer\nSo the fact that you want to work until I Seventy yeah might not be the thing that you thought was going to be the best thing in the whole world but it really is going to help you because the longer you work\nThe the less you have to pull from your investments or you don't have to claim Social Security uh you know for a you know for anything for that so when you retire at Seventy you're going to have Social Security and then you're going to have your investments to live off of\nUm do you have any debt right now\nNo I pay off all my\nPerfect All right so no debt um any other short term cash need that you see here in the next twelve to twenty four months\nYou know okay I I I don't want a house I'm going to face Fifteen fucking when it went right now okay so I feel like um I used to own a house before my luggage was twelve hundred dollar fucking run it out as a mortgage same okay\nI'm I'm putting money away for something for our\nPerfect perfect and if you're paying you know fourteen Fifteen hundred dollars a month in rent now the mortgage earlier was less than that you you can that's just budgeting um when that when that comes into play 'em so really what I Would have you do right now is you know for twenty two years\nOr however long it is you know that you're going to be a working you know plan on saving that fifty five hundred bucks or sixty five hundred bucks into that Ross IRA now or do you have access to email\nOkay um when you are in a position to send me some more information about the Ross I can put some more ideas into an email for you just send me an email to ask Andy\nAt investing cents dot com but the the things that take away from the call right now you're going to save fifty

Andy at investing cents dot com right portfolio review in the subject line um but really just get me that email ask Andy at investing cents dot com and\nThis week's portfolio was sent to us from Henry and Henry writes I all of my retirement money at the bank in an IRA CD I'm sixty eight and a half\nAnd still working and I don't have any plans to retire I've been collecting Social Security for a few years and I just put the money in savings even if I wasn't working I could be about the same financially what if any other suggestions would you have for me\nWell I'm first of all I'm really glad that you reached out here a Henry we talk a lot about risk on investing sense and a lotta times it's from the perspective of a the potential of losing my okay but you might actually be exposing your heart and savings to some overlooked risks\nAre namely longevity and inflation K but set set those aside here for for a moment I think what this comes down to is that you might not be taking enough risk with these with the savings will\nHenry wrote that he's sixty eight and still working and then said I don't have any plans to retire that's a lot different than the other sixty eight year old and it sounds like that those are a couple of signs that may be in good health and and could live for a good while longer\nBut don't don't say nice things like that or look at the real risks that are out there in the world and so you know good\nGood for the fact for being realistic\nTalk about how you are looking at the at the midterms right now and what you're tracking versus maybe what we see you know in in in other in other outlets\nUm typically in the terms and you can go back many many many many years and look at the historical record our lives it's quite clear\nIt seems that with the economy is strong or weak with the president was popular or unpopular what tends to happen is whatever party does not control the White House makes big gains in the house is okay\nAnd that appears to be a pattern that is just part of the American soul and or maybe it's part of the human soul except the American system a little unique but the so we see it here but for most people politics is like the Olympics\nWere were you get interested in sports once every four years right or at least you get interested in things like gymnastics less every [laughter] so the ah\nThe people who will get interested in it just two years later yeah or the people who are really angry about the way it turned out two years ago okay and this time around as a crafts four years ago it was a Republican\nWon one more question before we leave you know one of the interest most interesting things that you wrote about the China us negotiation is something that I mean is is completely unique I haven't seen it anywhere else but it makes total sense\nYou said one of the biggest concerns is what happens from a social construct with China\nIf they continue to push or if they pushing the wrong ways as ... as as negotiations continue um you know especially as it relates to any sort of pressure\nThat China would bring to bear on foreign businesses doing business in China ... remind listeners what you were talking about because this is so important and when they share it with people you see the light bulb go on and it's just like of course I mean they do not want to risk is what is this social risk\nThat China faces that the U.S does not\nAs we continue to move through these trade negotiations\nThe ... ... a couple of different dimensions all working together against China one is that the modern China or the China and out of subsistence farms and rural poverty but of glittering cities are full of\nWorking class people it's never experienced a recession so it's ... we do not know how the Chinese population will react under anything but full employment of the highest unemployment rate to try and experience the last three years four quake three percent in this country we considered for three percent a boom you know they they call that\nThings are not going so well so what would happen if they got six Seventy seven percent you know now you would and this is across the very very large population so he's percentage point ... represents many more millions of people that it does here [noise]\nUh it at a China is a police state where a you've got to you know disarmed sheep like public being monitored every street corner by cameras are official thicken recognition software [noise] so\nThe problem with all police states is a problem of leverage is often actual originally was a\nRather says it's political leverage by which I mean in any prison police environment\nYou've got hundreds and hundreds of people\nThat wanna guard yeah that one guard has one guy and that one good has twelve cartridges and one of the ... and that's it and so if something goes terribly terribly wrong\nUh you got what half of the Soviet Union in Nineteen eighty nine where a couple of people swarmed with the Berlin Wall them for some reason the atmosphere was such that they made the decision about the machine guns and the next twenty five people ran across the wall and that six weeks later\nThe evil empire of the Soviet Union had broken up into that you can separate countries right six weeks later and nobody that all the great the good the wives of Henry Kissinger is of the world's predicted anything like that\nAnd it just happened to six weeks and so\nWhat could happen in a nation of one point four billion people where you've got you know half of them on minimum wage living in cities half I'm Still a subsistence farmers\nAre there enough right believes that is president Xi Jinping's I Know that's where the pressure hits\nThat was ... he's the chief investment

down in the market and you take the brunt of that because you're just write it down because you only know how to make money one direction when things go up\nAnd you know how to protect against loss of preserve capital you\nRun out of time because you have to try to recover from the last and it takes years to get back to where you were and now you will you wherever you ten years older\nAnd that's not the plan because you're never gonna hit the number the goal to walk away number if you will that nest egg number if you don't learn how to protect against loss and the scary thing is that um and you see it all the time\nPeople have gone through it twice already and just people in in the the baby boomer generation and and people in their thirties and forties they've already gone through it in

position in the market in other words I could own stock her own and exchange traded fund which is very similar to a mutual fund\nI got to have an option as insurance of the market collapse as I can

their own money and six to ten hours a month\nThey're protected in the collapse if the market and the S. and P. and the dog goes down dramatically they're going to walk away almost unscathed they'll take a small laws but they've got protected positions on and most importantly\nThey're able to participate in the upside in other words they get the returns of the market when it's happening in the way they needed to and if it goes against our starts to fall or collapse they walk away virtually unscathed because they have a protective position\nCapital preservation is not a complex process it's

anybody\nIs to make some money whether or not you need a daily basis or an annual basis you're trying to grow the account let's take a moment let's talk about the guy out there or the lady out there be some of the best traders I Know are women let's talk about what is it looked like for someone to trade for income if they want this to be their income and quit their job what does that look\nLike well it's realistic if you go through a learning curve and obviously like any skill set what I Love about on like treat academy to sponsor bulls and bears is that they used to constantly speak of

markets\nIt opens the door to everybody if they're willing to learn the skill and start the process of putting the system to gather\nAbsolutely and the key part is what you're saying champion learn the skill learn the skill learn the skill if you think about it no matter what your profession you hit this earlier\nEverybody has a skill set everybody understands what a checklist is er recipe is
