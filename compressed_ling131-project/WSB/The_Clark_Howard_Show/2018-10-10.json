Michael\n... are you great thank you Michael you need a a magnifying glass\nTo see the interest you're earning on your savings right now is that accurate\nThat's absolutely right I'm looking at what we get from our our credit union ah it's innocent tests civil\nWhat's your credit union paying on savings\nA point two five\nOkay fed still [laughter] I'd still like five times with the big bang bang on savings but it's pitiful compared to what you can earn now in the marketplace\nLife I wanted to know what what we should do with a with the ... we have a we have two accounts both of them are administered by a financial planner or on a ... fish\nAnd uh\nBut we have some money that we want to have on hand that we can get a hold of yet not yet ... don't want to just let it sit there less\nSo in that day\nToday savings rates are steadily rising\nAnd the rates you can earn in the country now are pretty much a at or above two percent and they're headed\nSteadily higher towards three percent so versus one quarter of one percent would I Would do is I Would link your checking account at the credit union\nTo a savings account at one of the online banks and start earning two percent or so\nAnd there there are now a bunch of FDIC insured accounts that you're covered up to a quarter million dollars that you can open with one of the online banks\nAnd I'm looking right now like one that heavily advertisers right now Marcus it's paying one point nine percent American Express paying one point nine capital one one point eight five percent I'm One that I'm not familiar with is\nCalled I I go banking is paying to in a corner another one called bank purely is paying two and a quarter\nSo you got the idea that it's pretty easy you just go if you want to see a list of all these different people go to bank radio dot com click on savings rates and then with a lot of these you can just click and open an account right they're\n\nAll right and Lincoln your existing account fund it right away and bam your days of order earning a quarter percent are over and earning round two percent or so we'll get\nAnd John is with us on the Clark Howard show John you got a question about your mortgage let's see if I can be of help\nYes my wife and I will be set free probably within the next\nSix to twelve months and I didn't know what to do with some of that extra money that will have [noise] and our our dilemma this or the fork in the road is should we poor as much as we can extra into our mortgage or knowing that we may move in the next\nOr so um stable little make so simple home improvements\nAllow our house to sell either quickly or for what it should be worth\nSo let me understand you're going to be that free except for the mortgage that if you watch right what's your mortgage interest right\nIt is three point six\nNo rush to don't don't a rush to pay on the mortgage and having some rainy day money is always good to be all in the case you mentioned to be able to do repairs or improvements to the home when you're going to market it or just for who knows what unexpected things happen in life\nBut then I have a different question for you\nAre you doing you're married yes are you and your wife both funding Ross IRAs\nUm I currently and um she is she ... she has lapsed out her um the ts eighth or work\nWill go to her so out so I Would say that I Would take the surplus money when you have a loan is inexpensive as you do and I would ah put your efforts and they're both Mac sing out Roth IRAs\nOkay because what you want to do when you when you start having a good problem you're having where you have access money is you want to create steadily more cushion for the future\n... and she's already doing max into the threat of savings plan was just the best retirement plan anybody's gotten the country\nAnd then a refresh my memory how're you saving\nA lot so on at school I got\nEleven or so for sending that I got a lot of gray and uh hopefully it and since then that was\nFantastic I thank you for your listeners thank you for your service to our country so you could each increase the tea SPs up to the max permitted or you could keep putting more money into the Ross either would be a great path\nAnd with you on a trend line of such an inexpensive mortgage there is no priority for you to rush on that three point six\nTo ...\nSo continued

bank operating systems way beyond\nJust trying to take over in individual account at the bank but in fact to disable\nTheir computer systems at the bank\n... nobody's saying but you can just\nAssume that it's a state actor who we try to completely disabled the computer operation at a bank even according to federal officials maybe even to wipe the data clean on all account holders\nThese warnings coming from listen to his office there isn't the federal government I saw this on Wall Street Journal dispatch about this there's an office of critical infrastructure protection and compliance policy\nThat the Treasury Department that's mouthful isn't it\nIt's very very freaked out about what's going on right now you know you know certainly assume it's the Russians or another foreign power

don't\nGet how rotten terrible the Russians are\nUnder ... anyway I digress\nSo think of two things one\nIf a bank's database gets completely wiped out it is long term no real problem short term there are potential hassles plus the long term one of the things that has been implemented I don't remember how many years ago this was\nBanks and credit unions work under a buddy system where they all have and nobody really talks about this 'cause it's doomed to the doomsday scenario what kinds of stuff but there is a companion bank\nA competitor that has a database backup that's never more than twenty four hours old from their competitor and in the event that something happens where foreign actors able to completely disable\nThe computer operations at a bank or credit union\nPeople will still be able to use their accounts with the other financial institution acting is host\nAnd for you and me after a cut over\nIt should be somewhat pretty much business as usual I guess records would be there'd be like a twenty four hour window of a missing data potentially\nSo which again is not normally the end of the world but two things come to mind with us if we were to receive a serious

numbers to Social Security number should only be given for what's referred to by the overall\nPhysique kind of term ... business reason or purpose and using the example with Robin Hood\nThey're required when they open an account for somebody to know who you are and so they take your Social Security number so they can run 'em and electronic background check on you that I don't know how much

you go\nYeah not only that but also if ah if they also allow how best to categorize\nThan keeping receipt some piles and piles of er seats that there's some ... either more efficient or a better way to go about that\nSure so there are any of a number of apps for both the iPhone and Android most of which are free they give you the ability to track your expenses\nAnd I use one called smart receipts it's not necessarily better or worse than any other it's just the one I like to use\nAnd the way it works is when I have a receipt I take a picture of it with my phone\nAnd then it basically categorizes and if it doesn't know how to categorize as they'll ask me and I put it into the category it will do the driving reports if you're trying to track your driving and get reimbursement per mile\nAnd there are many of these ... and expensive by is both a if I remember as a website and an app that allows you to track your expenses there's not any one that is like the category killer and this is the absolute\nBest for it but if you were to if you were to just put in as a Google or bing or whatever search but an expense account apps and work through the various reviews 'cause there are a number\nOf online reviews of different ones these expense account apps and you can see which one does best what your needs are for expense account tracking it's been great for me 'cause I don't know if you notice I Am a complete\nFlight [laughter] into and believe that at all\nIt's completely true I'll be on a trip and I'll ever see for this a receipt for that receive for the other and then I'll get back it's like what did I Do with that receipt were not do with that one and so now second I get the receipt I take a picture of it\nAnd then I have it and it's categorized and essentially it helps me with expense report accounting on its own for each trip\nAnd she got the date the trip started ended all that and that's why these things are so wonderful is a way to track those expenses specially when you're any kind of independent contractor a sales person where you have to keep really good expense tracking\nJim is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Jim\nHi Clark how're you doing well\nHow do I fear on good that we're trying to get out of a time shares my wife's time to time shares wanted which just bird to the ground and the fires no and oh\nYeah um it's it's as bad forest fires we had that there's an advertiser on your show that promises they'd be able to ... cell types chairs and I've tried to research them with no success\nI wouldn't have that are all at you with me I wouldn't believe that at all okay\nSo the time share resale business is one that is not something you can trust and normally\nIt happens in that business is they'll promise you that they're going to be able to find a buyer for you and all that or that they'll get you out of your obligation on the time share but you have to pay them\nUp front how much should these people want up front\nWe haven't gone that far yet\nDon't go any further that if you've got as far as I Want you to not anywhere with them\nWell we're very bad on your show before and you're just wanted to make sure we listen to your advertisers and wanting to make sure that there wasn't anything special about these people\nKnow and and you may have missed a segment I did recently on the show that I don't even know who's advertising on the show\nOr the way ads are served on the show I don't even have any idea so it's news to me that somebody was advertising that they can catch at a time shares so you've heard me on the show Jim that when you have a time share your stock is stuck could be right\nI Believe that's the case\nYeah and that has not changed in my overriding advice for you is when they finally get the place rebuilt that you just you'll have a brand new place to go to you just enjoy it\nVaried and any way that you can think of with the thing the burnt down that we have any\n... that is a question go to the website time share users' group\nCan do that as a surge time share users' group and go look for your fellow owners on this time share that burned to the ground and see how other people are handling it\nAnd there may be that there may be because of the special circumstances of the time share not actually existing right now\nThat people have figured out a way to eliminate their obligation to it and this is a case where the strength comes from communicating with others that own the same place you do\nWill definitely look into that and again\nThe website is time share users' group it's where timeshare owners guide and help each other Scott's with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Scott\nHow are you doing great thank you Scott\nWell hey I'm enjoying fall asleep you every night with
