Ah yes yes it was and so I thought you know what\nI'm just going to reach out the clock and get a feel for what he thinks I'm about the concepts and principles behind it\nWell I've called and it's not just a term that originated with me or before the concept of the FIRE movement came along I called him Mac savers and ... and again that term didn't originate with me the idea that if you can live on half of what you make\nAnd coming right out of school if you learn to live on every other check it changes the entire trajectory of your life\nAnd generally by your early forties if you live on half of what you make you will have saved enough money and lived a lifestyle that will make it possible for you at that point to be\nCompletely independent financially and if you don't want to work again you're likely won't have to but really it's more about you being totally in charge of the choices you make in your life you know somebody who works hard enough and sacrifices hard enough\nTo be able to um live on half of what they make isn't doing it so that they never have to work again it's usually so that they have the choice to do what they want to do the rest of their lives\nSo bad to have you been living on a fraction of what you make since you\nStarted listening or since you got out of school or what's your track record of Ben ...\nYeah I'd say since I've been out of school probably early on about a forty percent\nThe savings rate and right now probably more up to like sixty Seventy\nWhile oh wow I Would\nPut myself definitely in the Mac savers category and and like you said it for me it's not so much of a one on never work again in my life I mean I don't want the option to do that but really I I see more of the road to freedom to do whatever you choose\nExactly which means you get there\nAnd ah you know the people who and I don't want to get into a tit for tat with Suzie Ormond but the ... she's not the only one who really has has been um\nNot supportive of what's now coin just FIRE movement which is financial independence retire early\nAnd it's ... it's a cute phrase you know a cute idea a but it's a real idea of where the real stuff behind it whatever you call it whether you call it max saver whether you call it fire or whether you just talk about the financial independence side of fire\nThat the idea is that instead of\nFeeling a prisoner to your bills and wherever you work you're in charge and you make the choices you choose to make and so are you by saving now sixty Seventy percent of what you may\nYou are in a position to be able to make the choice is you're going to make in your life and is she pile up more and more money it gives you increasing amounts of freedom to make the decisions you want to make\nSo I'm totally supportive of you are you doing anything though that others would look at it and say man bans having no fun in life because\nHe won't even fill in the blank [laughter]\nUh no honestly I feel like I was a great life as it is over the years with my life has been to Hawaii probably four or five times [laughter] I'm not married nine years so\nUm we travel quite a bit and we definitely don't think we deprive ourselves although we definitely could spend more money you know by fancier house or cars but choose not to do that\nExactly and you know you mentioned the two areas\nDead end up eating up people's budgets more than any other than that housing and cars\nThat those two things are what become a brutal expenses and they're going to be a philosophy in the U.S that you wanted to reach on our house and by the biggest fanciest house you could qualify for\nI think now there's more of an understanding that that's not where it's at because that monthly payment the overhead of it the property taxes become an albatross instead of a benefit overtime so keep doing what you're doing\nFeel good how\nCan I ask you can I ask you a related question of course\nOkay so a part of this idea is to be able to reduce your monthly expenses and right now I have a Fifteen here on line I home mortgage\nAnd I already know max out my four oh one K. and my wife's IRA my IRA things of that nature so we we don't have more to go there and I know you you typically discourage people from ever paint on their mortgage but um at some point\nFor me to to really at this level where\nI don't have to work anymore I'm it would be awesome to have a mortgage young so at what point here philosophy would you say yeah paying down extra on your mortgage would get rid of that obligation use an okay thing to do\nNow you're talking to somebody who's mortgage debt free and despises mortgages and I carry that at all\nAnd you know if you looked at it strictly from priorities there would be people particularly and financial planning would say no you should actually put more money and investment accounts but let's talk about the practicality\nOf having a roof over your head that you don't have a monthly mortgage for the value of that particularly as you hit that threshold where you've saved enough money that you would not have to work again unless you wanted to\nIf you want to now that you've maxed out every form of savings that the tax codes favorable to if you want to just concentrate on zeroing out that mortgage go ahead\nAll right sounds great\nAnd be completely one hundred percent debt free which makes everything you've put before now even\nEasier to make work for you so I I Know there are those listening to you and me ban that are like these two men are crazy\nI mean I I'm having trouble just pay my bills every month and they're talking about saving fifty sixty Seventy percent of their pay\nAnd it's got to be something you do from the ground up and the decisions you make over time and there are people who make so little money that this is not a realistic conversation but if you're making a moderate salary to above\nYou can in many cases make financial independence part of your life\nYou're

Florida that got hit so badly by the hurricane recently that\nThere were there were there was like nothing left at all at this beach community in Mexico Beach Florida in one house was sitting there almost completely intact\nAnd it's so start well I Want to tell you that\nWe have the ability\nTo build tougher homes and the shocking thing isn't beach areas the real cost is not in the structure put on a property is the land that the property sets on that the structure sits on and\nThe cost of construction\nDoesn't have to be a huge amount higher I'm going to go way back in history to Nineteen Ninety two I guess it was\nWhen South Florida got hit very hard by Hurricane Andrew I'm testing my memory from way back but what I Want to talk about is something that shows how important are thought process about how we build is\nTo how uh how survives a storm of various types whether it's a tornado hurricane a earthquake standards there are so many different situations where how you choose to build\nMakes all the difference and doesn't necessarily have to cost a lot more because in Andrew\nThere was an area where the entire neighborhood was flat and just like the pictures\nThat you may have seen from Mexico beach and there were some homes that were sitting there looking absolutely fine and those homes happened to be habitat homes\nThat were built with volunteer labor built way beyond what was the building code at the time and employed technologies that costs virtually nothing like a little thing assignments technology so little thing called the hurricane clip\nThat a lot of habitat affiliates around the country and areas subject to tornadoes uh build with hurricane clips which helps support and reinforce the structure of a home and add to the cost of a home somewhere around a hundred and twenty dollars\nAnd make a home much more robust\nAnd\nThe case in Florida we\nWere you a part time and a beach community in Florida and our next door neighbor as well as about oh about a dozen homes in our area are built using a new construction method\nWhere the homes are built like and I think this is the one in Mexico beach was the same kind of idea built with concrete and know sheet rock at it\nAnd the homes are built to withstand a cat five hurricane plus\nAnd the windows may not survive they may blow out the home itself is a hundred percent structurally sound\nAnd all that has to be done is its host out there is no issue with mold and so the reason I bring this up is we in America face an increasing problem with flooding\nFrom population growth um increase rainfall is we're in a cycle of that\nAnd much of the United states and there are so many techniques that can be used\nThat will make homes and people in them safer make the structures more solid I

B.\nAnd think about if you don't have the money at that point you're going to have a big tax smell due to the IRS for fan of money you don't\nHave All right so can you tell\nWhen somebody calls and asked me about borrowing from a four one K. I. like tightened up when I'm answering the question because I'm hoping there's no reason I'll ever a green light them borrowing from the four one K. because the if then the consequences so the situation has to be completely desperate\nBefore I Would say do this and why why am I talking about this again\nI got a email from a friend of my wife\nWho was asking specifically about\nTaking money out of a four one K. to pay off credit card debt which is probably the most common reason people do it and I was able to explain to a point that she was comfortable that she shouldn't do\nThe money withdraw from the four oh one K. to pay off the credit card debt and you know the most important reason not to do that if you use\nMoney from a four O. one K. to pay off credit card debt in most situations people will end up having the credit cards charge backup within a year and a half of when that withdrawal is taking place so\nPlease I Know it's easy to do the ... four one K. borrowing but don't do it unless the situation is dire Amy is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Amy\nHi I Am great thank you you want to talk about hitting the bulls eye on the retirement target\nI looking at the proper you or a retirement and I and I mean how strong the forces that have ... percent a year and ethnic and retirement fund target retirement Ryan or [laughter] yeah\n[laughter] well I wouldn't say a hundred percent or not and but the idea is that if let's say you're building a portfolio and a four one K. or you're building one and a Roth IRA or traditional i._r._a. the idea is that if you're\nFor people aren't aware of what we're talking about a target retirement fund is where you pick a year\nKind of in the ballpark of when you expect to retire and they tend to be an five year increments like year twenty thirty twenty forty five whatever every five years\nThat you're messing up the whole purpose of the target retirement fund if you put money into it and then still put money into other things in your retirement plan a retirement account\n[laughter] [noise]\nIt's not like it's something you shouldn't do it's just suggested that if the whole idea is to try to get the right mix of stuff that you're invested in\nThat it really is only effective if you go all in on the target retirement fund where are you in your head with this and how does it affect you\nWell I had an aunt Shirley I'm In my legs but\nI have to take it off with ... and um I just had this as part of it and I'm hearing that or a every turn that I Would expect when they are they\nOn average about paper lash out at high work at all and the target retirement side\nYou know I I Can't speak to whether you would have an overall lower return over the years by diversifying out from it the idea of the target retirement fund is really for a different purpose it's to put you in a position where you have the proper level of risk\nAt different stages of your work life\nAnd then as you get closer to retirement so there's nothing that says the you taking some of your money in your four one K. and putting it in other choices is going to get you a lower return it's even possible that could get you a higher returns but it also might involve\nOver the years potentially more risk to you\nIn law says you could suffer at various points of your work life\nSure okay if anybody says oh putting forty percent and the target retirement fund and putting the other sixty percent and other things is going to get you a lower return that's not an accurate statement\nOK okay have a great day and can't really tell\nWhat's amazing with the target retirement funds is that any of a number of providers of those in a IRA Ross IRA or four one K. are offering extremely low costs on them and others offering very high costs\nOn the target retirement fund portfolio vanguard which is generally considered\nTo be the gold standard charges typically like point one five of one percent to point to oh of one percent where other providers may charges much is more than one percent\nFor having money in a target retirement fund that difference decimate eventually how much money you'll have to live on in retirement those expenses really mad or overtime\nFred is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Fred\n... thanks for you do for us we get a lotta information from you your shirt do cart or I've been contacted by Fran regarding a multi level marketing company that are promoting a digital coin and I'm not really familiar with what digital coins are\nAnd they're talking about going public and they're not register with their safety and it looks like a ... game to me but I was wondering if you had any information regarding digital coin\nAll right so when people refer to digital coin that's generally a generic term for that one brand name that did establish itself in the marketplace called bitcoin\nAnd bitcoin is an alternative way for people to pay for things around the world and it is what's generally referred to as a crypto currency is not a government backed money\nIt is one that that is accepted based on a daily value the people who are willing to buy and sell bitcoins are willing to take that value what you're calling about is not bitcoin somebody who's trying to\nTrade on that basically what is it that you would do\nIf you were to get involved in this\nCoin business\nAre supposedly don't have to do anything if you buy it investors certain amount of money anywhere from a hundred and fifty to I don't know four five thousand dollars and then the coin is like is worth like two or three cents now and it keeps the\nPosing to rise that pose it leaves gonna rise and they're going to start a company where you can use your going\nOkay so I Would not go anywhere close to that because first of all when somebody any of us could say today we're going to have Fred money or we're going to have Clark money\nAnd I want to buy Fred money because it's going to go through the roof and I'm In a safe red money is worth so much money today but I can tell you in the future you're going to make a fortune on Fred money\nYeah\nOr Clark money so I Would tell you that\nHaving alternative payment forms is going to be part of the future but they're not designed to be an investment they're designed to be a payment platform just another way to buy and sell things in somebody's promising that you're getting in on the ground floor of a get rich quick thing\nI Would not get involved with anything like that\nThey're they're ... you were eligible for if you do this and get other people to buy them or anything like that\nYeah you can get a commission if you can bring other people and that's what my antenna\nAre and how much commission like if you get me to buy you said a hundred and fifty dollars worth if you get me to buy a hundred and fifty dollars worth\nOf this this electronic Coyne how much do you get to the commission again at ten percent\nSo he's got Fifteen dollars and then whoever is putting this together gets the hundred and thirty five\n... uh evidently\nIn the whole product is this supposed that money that you're supposed to trust in that doesn't actually exist yet to be used to buy and sell things\nThat's that's the story\nOkay how would tell you don't even think about getting involved in that because that is there is no true product or service is being sold if\nIt's just speculation that at some point people will be able to use these electronic coins and that sounds to me like that could very dangerously end up being an illegal pyramid\nAn illegal game of chance so\nUnless you are somebody who really loves the whole idea of gambling you love to gamble\n[laughter] [laughter] I Do a little bit\nAuthorities in Macon filed

at the moment and in many cases in the United states with the three full fare alliance American United and delta\nThey do a lot of what are known is signaling fairs where they're mad at let's say Americans mad at delta for something and they don't like something delta did and one of their we're known as fortresses\nWe're fortresses their main ones Dallas and ah Charlotte is their most profitable for tourists and airlines have these kinds of things United in Chicago and San Francisco and stuff dealt in Atlanta Detroit Minneapolis so Americans mad at delta\nThey may put an ultra cheap fare on a route\nLeaving out of Atlanta Detroit or Minneapolis to try to send a signal to delta you want to mess with us we're going to mess with you\nDelta wanting to send the signal to United might put an ultra special deal out of Chicago\nAnd so that will create these incredibly cheap fares\nIn addition to any of a number of reasons why airlines competing with each other will offer deal
