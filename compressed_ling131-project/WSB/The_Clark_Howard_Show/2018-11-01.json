Mets were supposed to debate Sunday afternoon at the journal to action you studios but that was canceled once can't pulled out\nThe stand alongside President Trump for a rally in making and you offer from channel to for Monday Night was accepted by camp and that's what turned down by Abrams so no debate reaction from WFDD political analyst Phil Crane\nAnd setting the debate is genetic and because most folks that voted perhaps let's say and most everyone has already made up their mind that good for I get stuck with us be\nLast week from someone who had a notice that they had to use the card by a certain date or they'd be shut down that's a little friendlier\nBut the point is issue where's had become nervous and if you have not used to card at all which usually referred to as a backup wallet card you want to strategically use those I've recommended in the past they use a card twice a year\nJust so that as far as the issue or system is concern that's an active in use card because you don't want to have out of the blue in issue or shut down a card because that affects your credit score potentially in a big way by reducing the total amount of your available credit\nThe other thing that's been happening is people are suddenly finding their credit limits\nDrastically reduced so if you have a credit limit of let's say five thousand dollars you may get a notice it's being cut to eight hundred\nOr twelve hundred or whatever that also dramatically affects your overall credit score and standing with issue we're starting to pull in the rain some here's my recommendations in addition\nTo remembering to use cards that you have forgotten that you even have\nThe next thing I Want you to do is if you have very few pieces of plastic\nOne or two in particular\nAbsolutely if you have only one credit card I Want you to apply and get a second one you don't want to be in a position where if the ... the only car do you have dumps you you then have no credit trying to get new credit if you have two cards\nI like you to go to the safety of having a third one with the potential of insurers dialing back wanting customers\nSo you want to create more breathing room in your credit wife to protect yourself and remember this with the credit card issuers getting nervous\nMissing a payment for any reason just cause\nOr for God or oh I was travelling or you know

Thanksgiving through New Years just as the patterns are so abnormal in their regular during summer time\nChristie's with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Christie\nHi Claire how's it going Christie great\nChristie you got a question for me about how to make sure you have money before you run out of years\n[laughter] yeah thank you so much for taking my question\nAnd I are best sorry don't be nervous were just having fun here\n[laughter] I've been listening there forever so it's like it's a real honor to talk to 'em but I was wondering if you had an alternative to what we share the for for central as far as the spend down and retirement\nWell I I Love the four percent rule and let me explain what that is so that others do with that is mathematically\nYou're very likely never are the odds are very low you'd ever run out of all your money if you never spent more than four percent of what you've saved in any year and retirement now there is an alternative that I can tell you that I have\nAh been really interested in in recent years because of the fact that we don't know there's no crystal ball says exactly how long we're going to live and the big concern is if we're blessed with exceedingly long life that our money may not stretch as long as our years might\nSo there's something called longevity insurance\nHave you ever heard that term before yeah I've heard you talk about that\nLongevity insurance works generally I'm most commonly where you just try to make your money last 'til age eighty five and then early in retirement you buy\nIt was a pretty cheap policy\nThat provides a big monthly benefit every month that you live beyond age eighty five they're counting on the fact that most people's life spans won't go that long and they just get to keep the premiums from those who don't live that long and then if somebody does\nGet lucky and the longevity department there okay money wise because from their eighty fifth birthday forward for as long as they live they get a huge check every month that will cover\nPretty much anything you'd want to spend money on unless you like I'm buying gold jewelry all the time are flying or whatever\n[laughter] 'cause I always you always hear about four percent role was not touching the egg and I was just wondering for people who don't have children or don't have anyone younger than ... you know to leave the egg kale if you're not worried about that what kind of numbers should we be thinking\nAll right so that's the beauty of the longevity insurance is that you spend all your money that you have\nEvery last sent you have the day you turn eighty five you got nothing basically and then the insurance takes should the rest of the way but in your family tree how long do people tend to whip\nIt has has varied it's kind of all over the place so so people have it with an end to the nineties some people just into the early seventies\nSo I you know in my family it the ranges much wider than that\nOh how how young people die and I'm getting close to my expiration date is a male and my family tree already so who knows what I've got in front of me but ...\nUm I play on where I'm OK moving forward and in my case I Do have\nFamily that it's going to be behind me so the question I asked often if you're worried about uh you know living to frugal life and you hit a point where you've got all this money left over is there any charitable organization that really means a lot to you\n[noise] oh yeah and I I don't think it's a matter of having too much [laughter] but\nHaving and just you know probably more like ... for the oil and the present\nBecause there is an angle on a charitable giving where you can give money to an organization and then they in turn essentially set up the equivalent of a penchant for you\nAnd as long as you're living they send you or a company that they've contracted with sends you a check every month for the rest of your life and then at the time you do pass away they're done paying you and they have the benefit of the money you donate it\nYeah okay\nAnd so that would be an alternative but I'm the four percent rule\nMakes sense and that later in life if you do end up with longer life like one of your family members that lives in their nineties\nThey intend to have more medical expenses later you may need help from you may need somebody assisting you you know I'm with living\nIn that case you've got the money and what you preserved to provide for the care you might need later in life even if you decided not to buy a longevity insurance policy\nRyan's with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Ryan\nHow are you doing\nGreat thank you Ryan\nYou have an impossible question for me pretty much\n[laughter] I was hoping that it was not impossible hit me with it um I was wondering what the the best way to get the best price on all these for a vehicle\nGetting a good deal on a lease is really really hard because in a way east it's so easy for a profit to be hidden and the deal and God chose to be hidden and the mice tight\nSo leases are generally pushed on people that are interested in what the cost is per month and that's really where they focus\nAnd it becomes so hard to know whether or not you're getting a deal the only exception to that\nAnd it's the only one I Know is if a manufacturer is promoting in their ads a specific manufacturing leaf steel and this

their phone on a screen and do you know\nThat there's a changing attitude about screens wherever we go and all the rest Facebook just reported results that we're really not good for them at all and people are starting to say well wait a minute\nWith all this technology and all this time on screens because we know as adults how we can really be addicted to our phones and I notice everywhere I go now\nBecause I travel a lot and so I'm Out and about in airports in public spaces and people have this stoop\nAnd it looks like they were going to get a full caveman stoop overtime\nOr as humans is we continually are looking down and the addiction is real but no one is more affected by it than children\nAnd I saw a story and the New York times that I thought was really really\nImportant for you to think about and that is that people who work in the technology field are very anti their children being around screens that people who work in Silicon valley\nHad banned screens from their kids and one of the moves in school systems in the Silicon Valley is no computers no tablets\nObviously no phones that kids learn the old fashioned way with books and paper and truck ports\nAnd no screens at all there is even referred to as a digital divide that people who work in the digital field don't want anybody in their family to be on screens because they work with it every day they're the ones that are trying to get\nYou and me addicted but think about a kid and then think about\nYoung children really young children I don't know if you saw this but there was a study that was done at the University of Michigan they found that Ninety five percent of apps that are geared towards the all important preschool market\nOn tablets that Ninety five percent of the Arabs have ads on them and their kids don't have a sense of the difference between an ad in fact\n... well a lot of adults don't either but anyway kids don't have that reasoning power till they're like in the fourth or fifth grade that an ad is looked at as real and the kid will say\nI Want that I Want that I Want that I Want that\nAnd\nSo you can have this problem with kids wanting to do in app purchases at three years old you better not on your tablet have any payment form stored with apple or with Google\nWhere kids suddenly can be clicking buying stuff and then you as a parent you're the one who had the payment set up\nWith the apple or with Google but more important that time spent on screens now our producer Joe is\nIs someone who has a child who's five and a child who's two or\nThree three and gosh time flies and your kids you and your wife have very strict rules on\nAny screen time at all even including television\nYeah so we try to limit television consumption to forty minutes a day which have been ... honestly seems like a lot especially the way they respond when we turn the TV off\nBut definitely the zero cellphone dime and zero I pat or any sort of tablet time or no apps or anything like that I I it just in my opinion for our kids at least a disorder stimulus if they get from a lot of those apps it makes some of the more mundane things in life\nFeel even more mundane like it's really hard to adapt to the high color high touch I'm super fast world of playing games and an app and then kind of come back to normal life and just have to eat dinner with the family um it's just tough for

dependable forecast is coming up\nBeing compromised and you're the one who ends up with the hassle if you don't do the good work up front\nOf checking the vehicle title\nAnd having a mechanic check it out before it becomes your trouble\nMike is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Mike\nHey how you doing today great\nThank you you are someone who has a really nice person has a landlord but that's where it ends huh\nAll right so basically in rent for about a one thing about eight years now all I guess like I said I Do have a great relationship with my lab or however we definitely need air oh I'm Wondering what the best way I feel about I guess getting earth out she's actually in another state\nWho and she doesn't use a property manager right so what I recommend\nIf there are things that are nagging that need repairing she probably doesn't want to deal with them and it may even be just the hassle\nEven more than the cost\nShe doesn't want to lose a tenant so what I Would recommend is that you send her pictures of what needs repairing and say you know the you know she's across she's not nearby and there's a hassle for her\nThat you are willing to oversee the repairs and you'll even pay for them and just a duck the costs from your rent moving forward\nOr places before so out of that that I guess\nBecause I'm saying that you'll go a step further and you'll pay for repairs and oversee them that way she's not laying out the money you're deducting from your future rent for those repairs\nSo you're making sure you're there to watch the contractor make sure he or she does a good job you're paying for it but you're only laying out the money in advance that you're getting back with the offset of rent\nI think\nThat his work so well for so many people not every landlords gonna agree to it\nBut if she somewhere else in the country all she wants from that place she wants to check\nRight so if you're in a position where she can't handle the things that need to be handled\nThe rich she faces is that you say you know I really like you but I got to move\nAnd then her rent income coming in goes to zero and before she can rent to somebody else she's going to probably have to do the repairs anyway since she's got no money coming in and she's having to lay out money for the repairs\nA Shia All right well I appreciate the information there\nAnd you know what if she blows you off on doing it where you take the burden off of her what does that tell you\n\nThat Israel right Ernie is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Ernie\n[noise] hello how are you\nGreat thank you Ernie you want to go to the what they call this the happiest place on earth is that what they call the magic kingdom\nYeah among other things are clock I Love deals too so I'm hoping you going to come to the rescue\nOh boy Disney and deals don't go together\nYeah that's what I found um I made my wife and our votes fifty five or both postal workers and we're looking to take two of our oldest grandkids to Florida and it's just\nAn average ticket\nIs anywhere from three to three fifty a person and you know that's not even including universal and I'm just wondering do you know of any kind of budget spending I can we can do to kind of like it or two oldest grandkids to Florida\nSo the thing with Disney and universal is that you can only save money on the things around your trip like where you stay where you eat\nBut you will find it extremely frustrating trying to save money on the actual admissions okay\nAnd that's just the way it is a there is something that you may have heard and that's that\nDisney and universal now we're using variable pricing or what is often referred to as dynamic demand pricing were what you pay\nTo get into the parks is based on demand either historical demand for the day you want to go or rolling demand for the day you want to go to the price is no longer necessarily the price\nDisney is now set rates where you can go look at a calendar and see what it costs for each day at the park and Disney isn't using a huge number of prices yet\nBut that's one way you can save a little bit of money if you take the grand kids at a time that Disney's charging its lowest prices per day\nHere we were actually looking to November caution and nobody wants to go to Florida in June July and August [noise] uh we're actually looking at November with which you know my wife's big into the Christmas decorations and we'll figure that you know she could get a lot of satisfaction out of that it wouldn't be as hot so\nWe found that some of the prices during that time of year is a little relaxed and the crowds are not as bad either for what we are here\nExactly you have the cheapest two weeks historically of the year or actually in early December right after the the\nIt's giving holiday in so I don't know if that's the time that you have a kid\n... postal workers early December is kind of like a boom here so it's kind of\nSuffering that off or to get off\nThe November show help you also the housing should be a fair amount cheaper than have you ever heard me talk about Maus savers dot com no\nGo check out that site that's for people who just love everything about Walt Disney and at the same time they are really into saving money and\nThey post a continuous stream of updated deals every single day okay also trip advisor\nDoesn't do as good a job is mal savers but has enormous information about Orlando central Florida all the various attractions and may be a way to improve your trip and maybe save you a little bit of money to\nOkay now I Do have one more quick question said something about you got to roll call for Thirteen dollars a day now I Know that's a real accomplished probably salute you when you walk in the door and say okay we got to give him the best deal possible but how did you do that Thirteen dollars a day\nNobody nobody's giving me a special deal because I Walk out because I thought my car rental specials ahead of time\nOkay and I do a number of things to look for deals I always start at Expedia dot com because Expedia does a great survey of all the car rental companies\nOkay and so you can see the prevailing rate that everybody has and that'll give me what I Need to know to then go to price line dot com and bid on her car rental\nOkay you know most of the really cheap car rentals I get are from ...\n[noise] you know I've never used ... cars but I have used them several times for hotels and I've never really follow that for that is a good idea\nIn addition to doing that I have information at ... dot com about how not to get taken at the car rental counter 'cause I get so many complaints about people getting taken advantage of on the car rentals\nYeah I heard some of your advice that you were talking about surcharges that might be added in when you turn the Korean or even in the contract sometimes as you started at ...\n... so you're up to date on that one other thing is that you would be wise to book a car rental early\nAnd then re shop at me and once you do a price on bed if they accept it you can't do this step but if you haven't booked price I just spoke to a regular car rental from wherever the week before you go re shop your car rental and I'd say at least eighty percent of the time\nCar rental rates have dropped from when I booked early on to very light car rentals there is no fee for canceling a rental except again price line which is completely non refundable\nOkay well that helps a lot that's certainly does well check out the mouth favors dot com\nAnd I hope you have a great time and you know I I was smiling thinking about something with you being a postal worker is everybody assumed that the Internet was going to destroy the postal service and instead it's given the postal service a whole new lease on life\nIn a whole new reason to exist with all the massive package volume the postal service now has\nYeah it is quite massive and

the same time confusing\nPeople are more aware now of what their credit scores are than they used to be and I say scores plural because each of us have many different scores based on what data's being crimes from what credit bureau and what scoring method is being used\nBut the market for credit scoring is dominated by a company called psycho used to be known in the marketplaces fair Isaac now just referred to his fight go because what people refer to as the psycho score\nWill psycho\nHas come up with a new scoring method that goes into effect and just a couple of months where if a lender uses it\nAnd your traditional credit score\nDoesn't have enough to it your credit report is than there's not enough and foe there to be able to make with good confidence\nA decision on whether or not you would be a worthy borrower a good customer for a cell phone plan satellite service whatever\nThe lender or\nThe company will be able to request an ultra psycho score\nThe altar psycho score is based on how you handle money outside of credit\nSo it accounts for things like how you pay regular bills how do you handle your checking account things like that and this is becoming something more common when I talk about alternatives to traditional ways of establishing credit\nThey are using new algorithms are using new formula so using new ways to crunch who you are to decide whether you're somebody who should be lent to and not being used yet in the United states but heavily overseas\nBelieve it or not lending decisions are being made based on your what's referred to his social media score the way you engage with other people in your life\nOutside of the traditional methods and there's a belief that based on your interactions with other people\nThese alternative scoring models\n... the people who do these believe they can predict when near certainty who's going to pay back alone and who's not based on how you engage with other people in your daily life\nIt is one that fight goes doing doesn't go that outside the box but it will consider things about how you handle money just generally and not necessarily with loans it will be up though to each lender\nIn each company you want to do business with if they subscribed to ultra psycho\nOr not\nMike is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Mike\nHey Clark our ... it's a great pleasure to speak with you\nWell great to have you
