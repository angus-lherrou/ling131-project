yesterday [laughter] amazingly delicious food yes get the Greek salad ... into the mess out I've ever had\nBut every single time they ask you if you would like to tip the person that is just standing there at the register\nSo because of ... era I developed the seven foot ... what's that if you have to go farther than seven feet I Will tip you\nBut if you don't [laughter] I Am probably not going to do that if you're just taking my credit card right my apple pay my Samson pay a farmer's market I bought spinach pasta\nWas twelve dollars for one thing of pasta and they asked they asked for a tip on the app\nThat you tip of course not okay so\nMy hair stylist lovely lovely young woman named Nicole\nAnd you know like a lot of hair stylist she she rents her station right\nAnd so this is pretty much her business well it is for it and what I Love about in the coal is she treats her\nStation like it is a business so she's professional she's on time if I say I need to get my hair done this afternoon show part the water or she'll make it happen in in for somebody her age to have this type of business that came in at something she uses square\nAnd to you know when you pay and so you don't go to the front desk or anything anymore and so I was talking to her and she had it set up that if after you get your hair done and you can tip ten percent Fifteen Percent or twenty percent\nSo I told her I said you know I said you've got this all rock and she's like what are you me and I said you know research has shown that whatever you put in the middle that's what people are going to tap and there'll be a certain percentage\nThat will that you can guilt them into going to you know this third call which is the goal of all businesses that people have more money Seinfeld explained to her I said so\nYou know you're married you got a two and a half year old and a ten month old little pictures up there the kids you know and the you know and they're trying to get a they need new you know they're getting ready for college you know in their cheekbones looking really hungry whatever it may be\nI said seriously research has shown so instead of doing ten Fifteen twenty percent or just do an experiment for me do twenty twenty five percent and thirty percent\nSee if anybody says anything so I get my hair done every six weeks right I'd go back six weeks later and I should so out of work out she goes oh my gosh everybody's tipping twenty five percent and\nSome people are going like thirty percent\n[noise] but see the isn't that different though because of that industry has a naturally of gratuity\nBut it's the psychological aspect of the way that it gets presented on the screen so when you're at the narrow do you tip\nYeah really\nI Do that or why they keep asking because people like you keep tipping okay but here's the reason\nWhy gay many many moons ago I worked at ... which is a bar like Houston right and\nForty five foot and behind that you have your hot rod\nYeah well we have a twenty five foot trailer that we all her car\nAnd which is a\nUm an eighty to ... an oath to core but\nOkay so you get over this way everybody has the picture and um I I thought you guys were coming back to Phoenix I heard\nYeah we are or right after Thanksgiving we're heading that way we are in our last month and a half year\nAnd so what what has been like a really great thing that has happened the last year that you guys been RV\nWell great things I mean every day's in adventure and what we're doing but I guess one of the highlights a has been for us this year when we got to Wisconsin this year as you know we have from it and you don't know we have a full size a refrigerator\nAirbus and if your guest decided to die when we got to Wisconsin\nThat I have to understand we're up in northern Wisconsin and the RV places are few and far between up there\nSo we didn't get systems to take care of this thing was a quite a challenge and of course we went online and um we got some help from our forum [noise] friends that are out there kind of doing the same thing we're doing\nUm the the question was going to be if we're going to replace this how do we get this thing out of the bus I mean this thing is huge so uh the last we heard or was that we have to take out the side when does it take off\nAnd have a pick up outside and basically toss it out the window [laughter] um [laughter] short generally that didn't happen because some very smart person on the Internet said you should check your\nMother board in the refrigerator while it's very possible that if you change the mother board you'd be back in business and sure enough that's what we did\nAnd that was that that was it ... it was\nIt was it was an ordeal et cetera and bought a an eight or eight inch pedestal and of course of the things quite heavy so getting it out and even doing the repair it was a challenge but I'm rather interesting but I'm thankful that we've got the Internet in places where we can get some good information\nYou know if you just take your wife out to dinner where you wouldn't need such a big refrigerator [laughter]\nGosh we go out to dinner practically every week\n[laughter] I [laughter] All right so Andrew but ... I Want you to listen up because how has a technical question that I bet you're you will have input on so how does that question\nYeah basically what happened is we had a bunch of super great movies back from the old days watching the kids go up and some of my early day adventures which I don't know if I Want everybody to see but we had those digital lives and we're now in possession of\nA stiff obviously that's got this information on it we're looking for an F. G. P. site which is a file transfer sight of that we can get out for our kids to be able to jump on there and dragged back\nTwenty two gig radio uh back on to their own computers so that was the best person that we know that knows about all things digital uh we decided to call the gym commandos show so here you don't\nAnd so so what the thought is Andrew is that they use like a drop box or something like that right ... wanting to gig cats huge it's really a huge huge\nHuge and so unless you could you know you can break it out into individual videos right and then you too might be the best place that's what I was thinking too is that you just put it up there and then it can play and then if somebody wants to download it they can download if they want to\nBut then you can delete it\nYou want to you or you can protect it yeah you can protect and put in on a you know with a um a private you are oh\nOh okay so that if somebody is searching for you know how big adventure which we all do\nI mean right that they do that how big adventures doesn't quite come up well I totally miss you guys\n[laughter] well we wish you do it's a very much for pleasure glad to talk to you today\nYeah he really break up the files put it up on YouTube and when you guys come back out we're going to do years three of Hal in Jackie on the road because if you're an RV or\nThey have a lot of lessons that mother board story that they can pass along and they're really really great good godly people and I love them dearly thank you my good friends they weren't where you are more coming up here on the came commando show [noise]\nNow I don't know about you but someone has been telling me how to brush my teeth all my life\nParents teachers dentists and only the different technique up and down sideways my dentist says to make sure that however I Do it I should do it for a full two minutes of course Ninety percent of us don't and most of the shoes worn out toothbrushes to boot\nSo Romney introduces you to quit quit the rhetoric it's small light and sleek\nThere's a built in two minute timer that pulses every thirty seconds to remind you to switch sides with quip new brush heads are automatically delivered justice dentist recommend every three months for just five dollars\nTry clip and see why it's backed by more than twenty thousand dental professionals quip starts to just twenty five dollars that's it\nDoes it get quip dot com slash came right now and get your first refill pack for free with any quip electric toothbrush your first refill package free at G.
