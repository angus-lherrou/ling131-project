correct should I take that versus should I Do that ... what I can versus the thank\nYou so are you still working for the company or you already retired\nAlready retired a strict\nAnd are you of an age yet that you're receiving a pension payment every month or is it just sitting there\nIt's a set of sixty three ... quite there yet okay so yeah so yeah so\nWho's telling you that you have no right to

federal\nMarshals that protects the employees on the uptake her\nYeah so what happens there's a there's a ... federal agency that as far as I'm concerned as federal agency called the pension benefit guarantee corporation\nWhen a company goes bust that has pension obligations if they can't honor their obligations they become an obligation of the pension benefit guarantee corporation if you are someone who was working at a moderate\nModerately paid job than the formula that the pension benefit guarantee corporation uses will usually give you pretty much the same pension as you would have had from the former employer if they hadn't gone broke\nIf you on the other hand made big money there and that was the basis for your pension then usually the PG see will reduce your pension benefit below what it would have been otherwise\nEyes were you making a moderate money or big money\nIt's a six figure\nAll right so so I see why you're concerned because at the level of pension benefit you may well of iron they may um do what they are the terms terrible but cram down your pension check to a smaller amount than it would have been\nOther law is or is that what you've been told\nYes or ... or

was\nThere because it is a little sickle cell ... so that's that's what I wanted to make sure I understood\nIt where you are off lake calm for somebody who may see your pension eroded right before you got to give you credit for that and this is when I talked to someone about their pensions sprint and people will call me who are leaving a job and they'll ask me\nWhether they should take a lump sum or be paid out over time\nI say that normally you want to be paid out over time unless there's a reason that you're worried about the strain the how strong the employer is and the chances that they are not going to be\nSuccessful over the long term and that's like looking in\nA a crystal ball that may be cloudy and your case your past that and I'd love it if you let me know if you later are in fact issued deer lump sum amount or if you've got to suffering wait for the PG seed do its thing\nOr list is with us on the Clark Howard show how ... how are you\nAre you good thank you how can I be of service to you\nYeah I'm quite with a fake company for twenty four years and they offer a long time insurance and I'm not sure if I should take it because I'm only forty six years old\n[noise] um if your health is good I Would pass if you have health issues that hold you back some I Would go ahead and take the plan to offer through the company because the advantage the company\nIs anyone is eligible regardless of preexisting medical conditions where later on if you decide to try to buy a long term care policy on your own\nYou have to go through medical underwriting and if you've got something that's troublesome they may not insure you or they may charge you extra to insure you go to the pre existing but you're awfully young Joan Long term care insurance\nYeah I don't have any with the help the problem with that at this level\nThen then I Would say you can't know everything is going to happen in your life\nAnd it's possible that you could get hit with a tough turn later and have\nA medical problem that would make it tough to ensure we there are no certainties in life yeah but I Would say of the options and choices available to you in life\nBuying long term care at forty

I think is the way you pronounce [laughter]\nI don't know good budget but I did talk about envelopes awhile back and they operate they did operate on a premium business model let me see if they still do where you could have the basic version for free yeah so you still have the basic version for free\nAnd then there's a a more expensive one that gives you some more capabilities but most people would be likely happy with what you get with the base free version\nThey have a really fancy when for people who feel out of control\nAnd it's where they coach you actively and how you're handling your money but if you're just trying to organize yourself and do it in an easier way electronically I think envelopes would be a good way to do it now so here's the thing with giving up the information you have to give up\nCharles any time\nYou give a connection to your accounts to an app a website whenever there's always risk\nBut the risk of level is a possibility where the benefit level is a certainty so I think in a case like this\nI feel comfortable with you using this and giving them the information that they have to have in order to help you actively envelope your life\nRight yeah that's what I Want to know it just scared when I'm given out too much information on the Internet especially to something that the\nWriter you then you know just not that secure banking system that I'm used to\nWell the the banking system we hope is secure\nBecause of the reality today is that the way the Internet is built and put together it's a constant cat and mouse game with people providing services of any kind\nWorking as hard as they can to keep their system secure and then the the bad folks out there trying to hack in and break yeah there's never going to be anything with today's Internet that is absolutely certain unsafe so there is no perfection here\nYou just hope that the people you're doing business with had put up really good burglar alarms\nYeah well thank you very much should try to help me out and get me started on trying to get my finances vulgar\nWell good best he would that also have you looked at meant M I n T\nI started to read about that today\nArticles that I was reading in the ... website\nSo look it meant compare it to envelopes the other one you mentioned may be absolutely great I just don't know that one and see if one or the other does more radical job maybe you get different things that you'd want to use both\nTo have a better sense of what's going on with your finances\nKate is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Kate Clark how I Am great thank you you want to talk about protecting your finances from bad guys\n[laughter] you got it [laughter] I'm pretty conservative um developer funders that'd be a second just under ... and I'm Wondering how the guy I can go online to look at my four one K. counter my brokerage account\nAnd I thought about looking at the chrome book but my concern is that I'm tracked by having my dedicated to Malecon crowd or what do you like I didn't paranoid [laughter]\nNo not at all and I'm Glad you're asking about this because this is something that we addressed on the show because a techie brought this to the table and explain something I had not really thought about and he was so right\nBut if you follow my guidance and you get a separate computer chrome book\nTo pay your bills to access your brokerage account bank account anything like that\nThat if you tie it in with your regular Gmail account then you have not provided the level of security for your financial information that is the intention of doing so with the chrome book and\nWhat he suggested is such a brilliant idea and so simple aren't the best brilliant\nIdeas simple yes\nIs that you set up a separate Gmail account that is just for your bill pay computer or financial computer\nI Do that I still have that she mail account dedicated to the financial transactions that a person or a bad guy could follow\nIt doesn't try and rest of your life\nAh [noise] so compared to regular laptop and Gmail accounts more easily traceable than a regular laptop\nNo no I mean the the beauty of a ... chrome books have not had problems with viruses of\nAny kind like a windows PCs or Mac books ah so the idea that\nChrome book is because basically it's a Web surfing machine you are much less vulnerable with it then you are with a traditional computer this is such an important area to stay safe\nRight flick called offer some protection beyond what a regular laptop would\nCompletely okay 'cause there's no they stick your information is all Web based so there's nothing for someone to come and put a virus on your computer\nAnd access everything on the computer which is why chrome books are so much safer that's why school systems have adopted them so heavily\nNot just because they're cheaper to buy but there's so much cheaper to administer 'cause they don't have to worry about all the viruses and uh all the things that can play traditional computer either a windows or a Mac okay and if you haven't heard me say this if you were a business owner\nAnd you don't use a separate computer for your financial stuff\nPayroll anything like that you are really asking for it because you're failing under the uniform commercial code to show that you're taking do hair [noise]\nTo protect the financial security of your business and you can end up being held liable for all losses suffered financially through your bank account payroll or anything like that [noise] you're listening to the Clark Howard
