are\nGetting more clever I mean we just heard about a fishing scam with a check well what about if somebody called you and this happened listen to this\n... banks in a small Portland credit union last week he got a call on a cell from it from an eight hundred number that matched the number that his credit union uses actually got three calls from his credit union the same number in rapid succession\nHe didn't answer the first to just let him go to voicemail but then the third time they called these like oh well this was really be important I should answer it\nSo he was greeted by a female voice to explain that his credit union had blocked too phony looking chargers in ... in Ohio made to his debit ATM card [noise] she then read him the last four digits of the credit card that was in his wallet\nIt checked out\nHere we told the lady listen I any replacement card immediately about travel out of state California well the woman on the line said oh don't worry about you keep that card we are just going to simply block any future charges that weren't going to be made in\nOregon or California or those the only two states you're going to be and he said yeah I'm just going to California and she said oh not a problem any charges that you make in Oregon or California will be fine\n\nWhere to freeze the card everywhere else he said well that's a little strange but he figured well you know what she's probably do me a favor she didn't said you know it just to make sure that everything is on the up and up I just want you to feel comfortable is this your home address because this is where we're going to send the new card when you're done with your trip\nHe says I guess that's my home address including my apartment number everything's perfect should is this your mother's maiden name and he said uh yeah she said this is the correct spelling of your mother's me he said yeah yeah absolutely\nShe said can you please verify I Need to verify\nThe three digit code printed on the back of the card in your wallet\nIs this number these three numbers on the back of the credit card that's in your wallet and he said yeah uh yes so at this point everything seemed ... pretty legit right\nThen she says so that I can apply the same PIN number to your credit card but I'm mailing out to you I can you give me your PIN number so this way you don't go to the bank everything's all just going to work uh and so that your PIN number will be the same PIN number that you have right now\nAnd he said oh okay well you know here's my four digit pin the card\nThat he hangs up and then he was saying as account\nThere were two fraudulent charges on account from the day earlier totally three thousand four hundred dollars there was a twenty nine hundred dollar charge from a Kroger near Atlanta there was a five hundred dollar cash withdrawals from an ATM after everything was said and done\nYeah just three hundred dollars in his account so what this scammer had was every single thing about him\nExcept for the pin\nAnd so by her going through all these gyrations with the car and they were able to duplicate the card obviously they hadn't duplicate the card she had the number she had everything in front of her but she didn't have the PIN number so by going through every step she had the PIN number isn't that shady Andrew isn't that\nWhat would they get all the information that is
