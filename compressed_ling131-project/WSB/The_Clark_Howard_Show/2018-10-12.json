kind of journey if you've been on with that how ... then\nUm I Would I Would say it's been pretty rough of tried to focus pretty heavily on trying to get those paid off as soon as possible um but it has taken a lot of um a lot of work to do so and I had to make sacrifices but we're nearing the end so I'm pretty excited about it\nWell that is great news how much do you have left burdening you [noise] I'd\nJust over sixty one hundred at the moment oh that's fantastic because\nYou know when I hear from people calling me about student loans usually it will be in the tens of thousands or or probably one in five times there will be more than a hundred thousand dollars in student loans that someone is asking me about\nYeah I started at the right at about thirty two I'm a couple of years ago and so on and area and so it's a very great showing that\nWonderful well how can I be of service in this quest to be done with the student loan lenders\nSo the question I have is so I've got just over the sixty one hundred and ... and it's a right at four percent four point zero one percent interest on that\n[noise] ah have a a little bit over seven thousand built up and just individual savings and so I mean I'm just I'm questioning do I just go ahead and erase the student loan and be done with it\nOr just continue it out and I'm looking at potentially making your last payment\nAnd march or April next year\nSo that it even if you did not um kill off your savings you'd still be done in another half here\nYes that's correct [noise] All right so that means you're a very determined savor your very careful with your money\nI Would go ahead and blow out the student loans and extend in early Christmas gift to yourself [laughter] okay because you're on that kind of trend line where you're paying five hundred or so a month towards this balance you're going to replenish her savings pretty quickly\nAnd getting to that goal\nAnd of getting rid of the student loans is so worth it with the slog you've been through reward yourself and wipe it out\nOkay yeah I appreciate that because I was the kind of the same thing same thought process I had as if I go at it and remove this now that just benefits in the long term 'cause I could put all that extra money back into savings and the Cornish that that he thought it back up\nAnd pretty quickly to one thing though that I Want to make sure you're aware that record keeping by the student loan servicers is pitiful and you need to keep the documents showing that you have successfully paid off your student loans for guess how long\n[noise] forever [laughter] that is right\nFor the rest of your life you need to keep the proof because over the years it's been so disturbing to me when I hear from someone who's being hassled by a student loan collector on loans they long since paid off even decades before\nAnd they have no way of proving they actually pay them off and Congress and its wisdom gave student loan collectors extreme powers where they don't even have to prove the validity of a debt\nAnd that's why having your proof of pay off is so key\n[noise] yeah I I I appreciate you reminded me on that I'll definitely make sure I I get a um when I Do get a clear it out\nAnd congratulations to you and your early Christmas gift to yourself\nThank you very much I I appreciative I\nCertainly and Sam is with us on the

and uh I Am a I have some money that he had received some monetary gift from family and friends and deaths have close to a thousand dollars for him and uh I'm considering either\nStarting a yeah five twenty nine or ... or for him or a a lot I write for my wife uh and just use that money\nTo fund that and hopefully if I live in the future as that money that I would've I look at it to five twenty nine and then engage in Egypt for college we can go ahead and make that what ...\nWhat are you can only would draw your contributions you can't withdraw any earnings from the raw without causing problems for yourself or or your wife for herself but yes that's actually\nA very smart strategy and less anybody who gave gifts to your young baby would really be mad at you for doing this I'm like what you're thinking of doing that you take the money to open a raw for your wife if the money's never needed\nFor your ah newborns college than the money continues to grow for your wife's retirement and so I think that's a great when it's the rock is tax free growth all through the years it's tax free and retirement but if\nYou're um infant and I didn't even ask you what's your instance name\nOr his name is Adam\nWell for Adam if Adam needs money for college then at least that nearly a thousand people donated she's able to take it out and use it for college costs and it has no implications at all for financial aid for\nTax or anything\nYeah I'd I did want to mention that uh we do plan to keep that money for him maybe even if we use that and the rough for my wife or at least we'll\nTake out whatever we contribute as well off and make sure that money goes to him a lot I also read that or I could withdraw that earning a penalty free as long as it's used for college\nNo no you can withdraw the um I don't want you to do that only pull out the contributions because then it can be done for any purpose\nWe had to leave the earnings in there\nFor your wife's benefit for all through the decades and for Adam\nIf let's say Eighteen years now and I'm going to college and you don't need to draw on the money from the raw battery yeah\nAnd you use ah you do mental accounting where you remember when we got to come up with at least nine hundred dollars 'cause that's what went in to my ... brought back long ago\nSo I'm a strategy and with a thousand bucks you can open pretty much any of the low cost Ross out there\nThat he has no minimum ban guards a thousand a Schwab is trying to remember with them I think their minimum ... thousand for an adult so but a thousand is kind of a key

month on time and second the credit you have don't use a lot of it\nAnd that weird thing about that somebody gives you credit and then I'm telling you don't use a lot of it but that's the key that's the core to having a good score because the more of your credit you use\nHistorically mathematically it's clear\nThat the higher your soon as utilization of the credit available to you is the more likely you are to go delinquent or to default so that's why those two factors are two thirds of what makes up your credit profile that lenders look at\nTony is with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Tony\nHello Clark or how are you today\nGreat thank you Tony help your life is good\nIt is good very good three or\nFour so I Want to thank you and your staff for all that you do for us because uh you know the information that we get from years is priceless [laughter]\nWell you are kind to say that thank you and and I get way too much of the credit because I'm the voice you hear mostly but the real work is done by people you don't see or hear and I'm grateful to all of them for what they do to help empower consumers well\nMy wife would probably say that you and I are brothers from different mothers because a lot of the things that you teach them for each on the air or things that are already do so but I I have a question for you I almost would like to play at the Joel role and do an ask Clark but [laughter]\nGo right ahead\nWell I recently retired from a company I worked thirty five years for them and have substantial amount of money and my former companies for one case yesterday I was about to be retired they began to offer a\nRough four one K. which I can obviously no longer contribute to but I learned today that they offer an option to transfer traditional four one K. money into their offer all and K\n... obviously you have to pay taxes on that district as if it was a regular income tax and uh and they will not pay that it's got to be paid out of your own money rice your own responsibility [noise]\nSo you know my income slashing requirement obviously and the consequences of taxes would be a lot lower so I was thinking about perhaps and moving money like only a year to year basis over into that raw four one K.\nWas kind of an eye on minimizing my out front taxes\nAnd giving me a greater flexibility and lie airs greater flexibility in the long term now the downside is back out to using my non retirement income and other signs to pay those taxes\nRight you know that that is the question if you in dribs and drabs each year move money from the traditional four one K. end of the raw and because your income slower you're lowering the tax\nAs long as it would not infringe on your lifestyle too much you could afford to do it with the funds you have and the money in the four oh one K. being money you may not need for a long time and retirement that is a very sound and wise strategy\nI appreciate that I I couldn't see any downside to it but I thought maybe I was missing something and are measuring\nSheer missing nothing as long as you live a lifestyle where you you can't afford the tax bill that would occur each year it's great because the flexibility it offers you when you turned Seventy and a half you have to start making mandatory withdrawals from that four one K.\nAnd do is you have less and less money in it as you've been able to migrate money of the Roth\nYou're reducing by a meaningful amount how much mandatory withdrawal you'd have to make this is important in your case because I can tell talking to you the way you handle money you have been a good steward of your funds and you're in a position\nTo pay for your lifestyle without really needing all the money they would come from a mandatory withdraw from the four one K. each year\nThat is actually the the problem I see in the future and the the higher tax rates that I think we're gonna have to we're going to see in the future as well\nI think that is because you live your life in a way that you have that flexibility\nI can never remember where I recommend it to a retiree to move money steadily from a four one K. to a raw but you're not everybody in your situation fits doing that perfectly Natalie with us on the Clark Howard show hello Natalie how are you doing\nHi good I'm doing ... things for taking my call\nSure you have a teenager who is tempted by something you want to run by me\n[noise] yeah I have a fourteen year old girl who is pretty introspective and has decided she want from modeling classes she wants to gain some confidence and some toys\nAnd she's been looking at a couple of local modeling agencies and it seems like a couple of places that you looked at have given her an audition and called her back and then at the call back\nDon't want to explain all the um in in Allen says well you need these classes and\nAnd they can and get the information about how we think it'd be great hair his ah his a rundown here all the classes here it will give you three photo shoots during the thirty we\nAre yeah I Am I'm ... nine hundred dollars plus he'll have to pay a couple a sixty dollar fees for copyright\nAnd then come down to kind\nOf hook line and almost saying that they um pay well and it'll be like two thousand dollars pennies classes\nRight is you're a teenager listening to us right now\nI'm ... school\nOkay 'cause I was going to play some fun bomber alert or whatever for her benefit\nOr do you only do that for you I'll I'll give you something about that [laughter]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise] this is a an old time scam\nOh and the one the one that I have to name a bit apparently she's been tempted by is completely one that I've had so many complaints about over the years and I can't believe they're still around stealing people's money\nGo on the website Yelp y yo pi yeah and look at what people have to say about the specific\nCompany that she's heard the pitch from recently with you uh-huh and you should see if people could be any more angry and the post they put about these crooks it would be impossible\nMy thought was you know if if I'm paying kind of a tuition can gain from classes that would be of value you know I'm not necessarily looking for my fourteen year old daughter to become a model\nYou know if if and I've had thought if they provide you know poison and confidence then it might be worth investing [noise] um they said they wish and money\nFor I got a much better option for you then 'cause I heard most at about your daughter can I give you a much better when Natalie\nYeah there's there's nothing that beats a child who would like to gain more confidence and be more outgoing than to do a theater school or theater camp okay\nAnd there are every summer all over the country local theaters do theater camps where they teach kids the fundamentals of acting on stage and the confidence that kids get and the interest they build up and not to mention how good that\nThat is is broadening\nYour daughter you know learning how to be a stage actor is a great thing and by the way those classes are ultra cheap\nOkay and so I think it which I think it would serve all those needs you expressed to me and keep her away from being scammed and you have in your wallet empty\nYou're listening to the Clark Howard show [noise]\nEleven twenty cool

bouncing around in the Congress to come up with regulation of fees the the airlines charge and I was opposed to that I Want airlines to be able to charge whatever fees they wish\nThe only thing that I had called for and it landed up on deaf ears I remember talking with their congressmen about this and it just I was not penetrating the congressman skull at all but my idea was reciprocity\nThat if you cancel a flight and then and delta American and you know I didn't want to charge you two hundred dollars\nTo change that flight or cancel it\nThat if the airline canceled a flight or it suffers a extreme delay they should pay you that same amount\nWas fair's fair\nBut the Congress chose to do nothing about fees and said silent on it another thing with a new change is women that are pregnant now are going to have priority in boarding\nAnd so they're not jostled about or anything like that one\nThing Congress chose not to do and I discussed it recently on the air because the prior\nLaw covered it and now it is no longer going to be part of the procedures going forward there is no requirement that airlines accommodate families of small children small children child not\nBe separated from their parents on a flight and I think that's outrageous in unconscionable and unacceptable and the irony here is that even the hard discount airlines spirit frontier in a legion specifically accommodate\nHaving families sit together southwest accommodate families sitting together the three full fare alliance American United and delta specifically don't\nAnd I think that's mean spirited and cruel\nOne thing that\nCame up not too long ago American Airlines\nWas introducing planes that had was under the seat pitch of twenty eight inches which if you're not familiar with what that means it means that even someone shorter than five three\nWould have their knees knocking into the seat in front of them on a flight\nThere was a a mutiny\nFrom American Airlines employees and the public in American backed off that but there is now going to be an investigation on safety grounds of whether or not there should be minimum seat requirements on planes so that people can evacuate safely under the\nSafety requirement which is to empty a plane and Ninety seconds or less\nThan as you put more and more bodies on the plane what United does is called ... where they're crowding more and more and more people in the same space or all those people going to be able to get out in time and that's why there's going to be an investigation of that\nBut here's one of the greatest weirdness as I can think of\nFrontier airlines one of the deep discount airlines has reduced its fee for changing cancellation and in fact if you book a ticket way ahead and you decide three months or more out that you're not going to go they charge you know the at all and give your money back\nSo\nIt's so weird that the three full affairs American United and delta\nCharge these massive change fees and even one of the hard discounters charges last or nothing\nBut goes without saying that if you want to avoid junk fees you only have one choice in the United states and that southwest two bags free every flight and no change fees", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Clark Howard Show", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "12"}
