I Want to say\nYeah that's fine that'd be a great decision and then you're completely diversified away from what you're doing and that companies stopped\nAnd then if you did a Roth IRA with money you sell after a year of that company stock plan you could put all that in a Roth IRA with vanguard in the same target retirement fund twenty fifty five so you'd have\nYour uh four one K. at work it would be ... times and then you have your raw there would be after tax money and that would be a beautiful combo\nSo sounds to me Brandon like you're doing a great job and you should know that ... saving money for retirement thirty three puts your head and most people don't really think about it until they have their fortieth birthday so you're not behind you're kind of a head of a lot of people\nMarlene with us on the car coward show hell of Marlin\nGood afternoon ... day going\nI'm having a great day and I hope you are to\nCertainly are um [noise] just a question of one question I've um state employees\nRetirement fund I've been a teacher too with my employer for about twelve years and I I'm ... too it's higher in order to draw the sun's out so I could do that\nUm and you take a lump sum would\nWould there be any other plans that you'd recommend take a I think it's a lady or it's about twelve thousand dollars which is a great song but should I call a life out what's another plan so\nYou said this is a state retirement plan\nCorrect although employees retirement plan\nAll right so you got this twelve grand and so your option would be to take it where they give you just a monthly check for the rest of your life or get that twelve grams\nSo and so like he sees me by receive that amount but it does not pay up all too I'm an air or um you can write\nThis depends on the state plan and uh my thing generally is like\nFor you to get the monthly check and the reason as you're not as likely to be able to generate as much money from that twelve thousand is the state will pay you every month\nAnd if there's somebody who's really depending on you I'm In the event that they outlive you ... you're married you have a wife who'd be depending on you yes\nSo what you can do if you're if you're a state plan just terminate set the time of your death and doesn't offer\nA survivor payment to your wife at that time you could do something pretty simple you could buy a term life insurance policy bit at the time of year death would pay a a\nBenefit to your wife and then regardless of where the sources of funds would be she would get a that amount of money in order to have to live on in the event that she outlived see\nI see so I couldn't buy a term life policy that would be like hey that for some time is that what you're\nNo the white term life works and you buy it for a period of time Fifteen Years Twenty years song is Thirty years\nAnd there's got to set premium for a set amount of coverage and in the event you do pass away and the Fifteen twenty Thirty years\nIt just pays a lump sum to your wife is your survivor and that way you don't have to worry what's gonna happen to her if you're not around um you know she'd be grieving over you but she wouldn't have to worry about money\nOkay now I Do have a term life there was a ... year plan which probably will expire in about another six years and I'm asked lady I'll probably outlive it so\nSo if you are a good health and you want to make sure she's protected for a many years to come you could buy a twenty thirty year policy\nAnd you could let the one with the six years remaining lapse if you wanted\nAnd place it with a new one or you could have both temporarily because if you were to die unexpectedly in six years\nShe might need more money to carry through her natural lifespan this pretty stuff we're talking about but um you know it's something I I Want people to think about and discuss is making sure that their loved ones\nAre taking care of financially and\nOn car dot com I have information

come out of our Web team is something they very much want me to talk about and there are so right that a problem that has appeared over and over again that we've noticed and is happening to so many people\nIn the country is you'll resolve you're going to set up a Roth IRA are you going to set up an IRA even put money into the account after you open it but you forget one more step\nAnd that is you've got to choose the investments the money's going to go yet\nSo many people's dollars are sitting in IRAs earning basically nothing in the default equivalent of like a money market account like a savings account inside an IRA or off\nYou're not even going to be able to keep up with inflation\nIt's absolutely essential but when you open a retirement account that you go to the next step that\nMay or may not be obvious when you open that account that with the money you put in\nYou choose what it will be invested in a lot of times people will be overwhelmed\nBy what psychologists refer to as the paradox of choice there are so many different funds there so many different options you just basically shut down you put the money in the account but you don't ever choose how it will be invested so\nKeep it very simple most places and if you go to any of the low cost places I recommend you are going to be able to put money into a target retirement fund\nAnd you put it in the target retirement fund for the year closest or when you're going to retire\nAnd just put all the money and that\nIf you whiter want to do things that are more involved in let's say you just said well I Want to put some money in\nEmerging markets that's the term for third world countries or I Want to put money in some form of bonds or I Want to put money in a European stocks or whatever it is I mean you want to do things more exotic have at it\nBut for so many people starting out with a Roth IRA or traditional i._r._a.\nJust picking a simple default choice to target retirement fund will get your money heavily diversified mean simply spread out in many different types of investments many types of stocks here and oversees\nAll in one find and so\nWhen you do find that IRA or raw\nMake sure you complete the deal and get your money invested and while we're at it really look at being a creature of habit where you automatically add money month after month after month\nYear Roth IRA or your traditional so that you are building up money for the long term and if you are a business owner or you have side income\nYou can do\nAlternative things like the south which takes like no paperwork to

equity line of credit\nThe percent of that you're using would also factor because a home equity line of credit many times is looked at as a personal line of credit like a personal loan or a credit card\n[laughter] personal and also get affected him to walk or just credit that's true of loving my\nCar usually it's rental and the credit in a home equity line that's a form of revolving credit so and in ... alone like a car loan\nUm mortgage alone would not be figured into the ratio for available credit\nThere's a clear correlation that the credit bureaus can demonstrate and particularly psycho can demonstrate that the ... percent of available credit someone's using a revolving credit\nIs a direct indicator\nAbout when somebody is going to be a risky person to win too\nAnd so at the way they the way the math works you pointed out to thirty percent thing they want to use is thirty percent\nOf available credit is considered to be a low risk or or somebody who uses ten percent of available credit is considered to be an\nExtremely low risk borrow where somebody is likely never to be an issue with the default on the other hand somebody who uses fifty percent of available credit is an extremely high risk of getting delinquent or defaulting on debt\nOkay because it used to be in the past\nYou had a lot of available credited look bad because they said that if she got into trouble you lack of a lot to get right now it's like it's gone and the other direction\nActually it hasn't and this is where it gets confusing Dorian is that when you're talking to a mortgage lending underwriter he or she hates the available credit because\nThey're worried just like you said so it's such a mixed message because qualifying for the best raid on a mortgage\nIs partially a factor of you having extremely low utilization of your revolving credit like credit cards and on the other hand that gets you the rate from the mortgage lender and then some underwriters will say yeah yeah yeah but\nI'm nervous you're going to take that visa card that you're using four percent of the available credit and you're going to go crazy going out and buying stuff\n[noise] correct\nThat so that's why it's it is a confusing message so my attitude and my advice is this\nLive your life using his widow of your available creditors you can\nAnd if you get to the end of the line and it's time to close on a mortgage and the underwriter throws up a roadblock at that time you may have to close ally and her credit or to to get the mortgage through\nBut the principle of having a very low utilization is the right answer and the right thing to do\nWell hold on to very much\nThank you and you have a great day Sabrina is with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Sabrina Hi how are you clock great thank you you are trying to help\nA relative what's going on\n[noise] well I got over his head and get\nOh I'm Sorry I think ... yeah well you know nothing about it he didn't come to ... feet\nAnd he even tactics four one K. to help pay off their credit card oh yeah exactly [laughter]\nSo what we did was we were going to come up with a plant that I got taken point\nWhat we would like to do is it's not too much I got to look at it papers and see how much that that is what could pay off his debt because his credit cards are twenty four percent we will obviously make can pay it back but it may be three percent\nOkay and they wait wait wait wait wait wait stop you right there because I hear your heart talking\nSo Sabrina somebody who has run up a lot of debt and as a family member and you\nDo a work out for them that's what it was cold you know work out where you pay off the high interest rate that you become the wind or for the lower interest rate cuts you said something right there that I got to throw the flag on you said and of course will make them pay it back\nThe the odds are that he may intend to pay you back but they're not high that it will actually happen\nSo when you if you were to do something like this you have to think of it in terms of you are you will call it alone to him you'll even have loan terms but psychologically in your own mind you have to be prepared that this may ultimately be a gift not alone\nOf course of course and knowing him the way I Do he well selling Oregon can pay back because it is a show and that's why he never came back he was\nKilled written over having run up and he didn't want to come to us\nAnd what kind it was a lifestyle things or did he have a medical problem or what caused the debt as best you can tell\nIt started with a car that died and he had to go out to buy a car\nAnd then from there we also think that he got himself into a credit card debt daddy started then maybe buying scratch off on that you know the answer is getting a lottery and then I think it's no but I don't know because he hasn't told us the whole story yet but\nHe used to send me pictures of his cell phone telling his credit rating of over a hundred so he's he's a great center in the past I think he just got in over his head on that\nOkay so let me tell you what I think needs to happen next and it's not you giving him alone\nOkay what he needs to do is if he's got the best of intentions and things got out of control won him\nHe needs to sit down with a budget counselor and there's a group called the national foundation for credit counseling have you ever heard me mention them by half he may have to hear it several times before he'll be willing to make an appointment and go in\nBut they'll take him to the root cause of 'cause everybody's always got a story about how they ended up where they did with that\nRight but it's a it's a plan\nAnd a map basically the gets you on to a new path and you just winning the money I don't think changes whatever it was that got him to where he is\nAnd that's why I think he needs the tough love of a budget counselor to help him see a path to better way of handling his money\nBecause even if you wait or choose to win and the money the things that brought him to where he is those have to change first\nOh I completely agree\nSo what I Would say is ... have you broach the subject with him of lending money\nNo we've had we were going to meet with him ah either tonight or sometime next week\nOh great 'cause I don't want that out there yet as a carrot or possibility\nRight I Would I Would go in with the idea that you want him to go sit down with somebody at the closest and FCC affiliate\nAnd you go in with the information for them if you go to an FCC dot org\nYou'll be able to find the closest affiliate and generally they sit down and do counseling with the most affiliates that's free or it's so cheap it's like in significant\nGreat that they can go with ... step if he's really boxed

completely out of pattern\nFor me completely abnormal I drive a very expensive car\nAnd before this I had never had any desire or ever wanted inexpensive car my car before now was before the electric vehicle thing became a thing was a Prius hybrid\nAnd I first had my very first hybrid\nAnd march of two thousand I got the original two seater hybrid which was called the Honda Insight that average to then I heard of fifty eight miles per gallon\nAnd then ultimately I had a Honda Civic hybrid and then a Prius so I've always been about having a fishing vehicles and those none of those three were expensive vehicles but now I drive\nA twenty Fifteen Tesla\nTotally out of character for me but I I Love the thing that drives great and all the rest and mine has auto pilot on it so when I take a road trip it drives for me I recently did a seven hour trip\nAnd the Tesla and it did all the driving except for maybe five miles of the entire drive\nAnd you just click a lab or twice and it does a a chime and there's two symbols on the ... what you know the vehicle is doing the driving\nAnd it works very well Consumer Reports just came out with a review and said not well enough\nIn fact they they liked the tests so system but they loved one from Cadillac that has a vehicle system that white Cadillac has done\nIs they have mapped\nMany many thousands of miles of freeway and four lane divided highway in the United states and you can only use the Cadillac system as soon as a ring fence system\nOn roads that they have recently fully mapped Cadillac has an a digital ice scanner that if you go to sleep\nIt will wake you up the Cadillac will wake you up because these systems are assist systems they are not fully autonomous driving and Cadillac doesn't want somebody falling asleep\nTesla went to a system that monitored whether you were awake after a highly circulated video made the rounds on the Web of a guy in a traffic jam\nIn Southern California who had fallen asleep with the window down is Tesla and you know ... unattractive look people have when they're sleeping on an airplane is that kind of look and the vehicles doing all the stop and go and slow and go well this guy is how cold\nIt was Tesla or every so often you have two graphs the steering wheel so it knows your with it that you're awake\nBecause these are not where the future is going to be which is fully autonomous vehicles that like the way motor vehicle but doesn't even have a steering wheel in it\nThat you just put the destination and it drives you there these are not that but I can tell you the difference in the tea guy have on a road trip with the car driving me to my destination\nAnd the Tesla system is not considered to be as good by Consumer Reports that the Cadillac one because they don't individually map roads they use a system where the electronics and the vehicle\nMonitor traffic and keep the vehicle in its lane automatically adjusting the speed even coming to a complete stop if necessary with um the movement of traffic around you I have now use the auto pilot\nFor probably Ninety percent of the forty thousand miles I have on the Tesla\nSo somewhere around thirty five or so thousand miles and it's not perfect but I found it to be a great tool and I and I look forward to the day when I'm old and my driving skills deteriorate\nAnd I won't have to have the keys taken away from me because by then vehicles will be available fully autonomous\nAnd how great is that going to be\nDaniels with us on the car coward show hello Daniel so how can I be of service do you\nYes so I
