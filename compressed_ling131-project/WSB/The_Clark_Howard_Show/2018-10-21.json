I'm only telling you what the New York post and the British newspapers are reporting on one Turkish newspaper\nIf you want to live when you come to Saudi Arabia beat quiet anyway return to Riyadh on Tuesday ahead of a plant search of his residence part of the official Turkish probe and took the show gave disappearance that is the the Saudi council he's back in Saudi Arabia\nMiddle East English

forensic physician doctor Salah ... body listening to music as he began to cut to show these body while he was still alive\nIn New York Post Turkish authorities believe show he was killed by a special team of Fifteen Saudi officials though\nThe kingdom the crown prince of Saudi Arabia denying that says these claims are baseless this report comes as Mike Pompeo met Wednesday\nAfter being in in Saudi Arabia now meeting with the Turkish president air do on and the Turkish foreign minister after ... rubber arriving from reality where he said the Saudis promised a thorough investigation\nMike Pompeo

according to a photo by the New York times Turkish officials have shared an audio recording with the U.S in Saudi Arabia that they say ... was murdered by Saudi operatives of except the president saying they didn't get any tape at this time\nThey have a pro government newspaper reporting that could show geese apple watch recorded the interrogation torturing killing\nWell I Would assume that watch exist in this happened and what we believe that he might have been taken out and body pieces not sure that they wouldn't take the watch at that point but before leaving reality Pompeo told reporters at the Saudi leaders made no exception on who they would hold accountable\nAnyway so now according to the British newspaper the St circus official Turkish officials have a recording of blah blah blah and that had to pack up and down the apple watch and you have some of the other people saying it's highly unlikely the show he could've broadcast the signal from his apple watches it was too far for Bluetooth connection\nYou know I think what's happened clearly as the Turks and the Saudi ... have they started counseling wired they have transmitters and the Turks don't trust any diplomatic that have been into most of the embassies most consulates in Turkey and they listen to what's going on\nAnd we'll find out in this case um my take I think it probably all happen but I don't think we should rush\nTo judgment because the truth is going to come out probably sooner rather than later joining us now Dr Sebastian Gorka\nFormer White House advisers brand new book is phenomenal by the way why we fight defending the feeding rather not defending defeating America's enemies with no apologies\nDana hop but Fox News contributors thirty or CIA op operations officer a doctor Gorka I assume you agree with me that all signs point to the Saudis assassinating murdering this guy in a a far Paraguay that's what I'm thinking\nYou know there's a ruin in warfare or report from the battlefield must be questions or I think this man is that\nWhether or not these audio tapes exist is another question but it's absolutely certain that this individual was caught between two nations that wants to dominate the Sunni Muslim world\nThat's the new often I'm an avid won regime of turkey and the price of Islam Saudi Arabia and this man was caught in the middle however however this isn't the fake

uh I think this man was murders and the most evil roof brutal way possible\nAnd I think that the president is wise knowing that we're going to get to the truth no there's no doubt we'll go and we're going to have the truth rushing to that point is not smart in my opinion\nI I agree with you uh look there's a lot of evidence that we have already we nailed it Fifteen Saudi traveled\nOn the Gulf

box assuming that I Believe that the Saudis are involved and whether it goes straight to the top I don't know the crown prince says denying it I'm kind of having a hard time buying that myself\nKnowing that there is a very different country but\nNow it gets complicated because also the Saudis the Egyptians Jordanians the Israelis the United states the Emirates they're all fighting against the Iranian had you had many in the region and their quest for nuclear weapons and the instability that would cause the entire world\nUm I Know everybody Dr Gorka would like to say that okay we're cutting off all ties with Saudi Arabia were done where this with that\nUm I think this will be consequences severe consequences the president said\nBut it gets a little rough or what do you do
