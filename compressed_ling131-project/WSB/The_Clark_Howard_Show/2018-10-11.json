you asked me about ... er Cox media group station\nOne is twenty four hour news weather and five and am sent\nMe a lot to me\nTen o'clock and Jennifer ... fly and they don't let us be twenty four hour news center we tell you at the top story this hour\nCan him today just shy of a category five hurricane Michael is the worst storm that the Florida Panhandle has ever seen governor Rick Scott telling residents crews will be out in force to restore power to the tens of thousands of customers and help reach people trapped by floodwaters are downed power lines and debris includes thousands have responders\nFor power restoration medical search and rescue law enforcement food and water distribution and every other critical resource\nABC speak tones as in Panama City beach with a trail of destruction\nA lot of street you're in Panama City beach are flooded and you don't know how deep that flooding\nUntil you actually drive into it I saw one car of SUV drive into this big big puddle of water along a route Ninety eight the vehicle made it through but barely it looked like it was about to stall out you see a lot of steam rising up from the engine compartments\nTo your left arm [noise] oh yeah yeah what did you what are the area I thought you meant on your body a geographic a Mexican ... beach [laughter] no Philadelphia, Pennsylvania ... of course oh\nOf all those September of Nineteen Ninety nine a hurricane Floyd worked its way up the coast and ... uh I walked out of my home and uh no significant wind had alive but I hear this\nLoud boom and I go out and this huge Norwegian L A tree in our front yard all across the street and crushed our neighbors jeep across the street or boy and\nI immediately call my neighbor and tell him about it and and what the assurance that I'm Will fully insured will get you covered a I later found out that it's really his insurance to cover is that a lot lying but\nIt didn't fall I guess the house it fell across the street fortunately and the windows and\nDownpour came an hour later and the crews were out cutting up the tree getting it out of the way a but then just a few years later we went down to Florida and experienced hurricane Ivan and hurricane Daniel\nAnd evacuated and came back ... to have not a scratch on our home and at a rental property\nSo so Philadelphia in my opinion is the most dangerous place to be in the event\nOf a hurricane or tornado Peter where are you calling from tonight I I'm In coming okay All right so what's it like out there what's the weather like there\nAre I I just came from South coming to know what's coming and and it's fine uh I was at a meeting earlier and people alive into that meeting said it was coming down in sheets off and on\nBut but that's far nothing and I just checked in to see what a school's what's happening what school systems that looks like everything still open until maybe oh what part three or four in the morning\nYeah I think with the exception of UGA I think they're delayed or opening at eleven AM is not my heart county schools I Believe I like one hour\nI'd have to check on that for sure uh before the court county kids are jumping up\nAnd down [laughter] yeah they ... the only one\nThing I Will say is when we were in Florida we would always evacuate either east or west and we had friends and Alabama and Georgia that would say ... stay with us right\nAnd and and we just said no ah because our experience has got to be over and a couple of hours hopefully and and it will bypass us but if we come stay with you the light of tornadoes\nRight you've got a follow up and ... and we\nHad on told a friends in Alabama and Georgia who ... who had trees fall on their holes or\nSo so in my opinion yeah you you go uh east or west you're clear and and ... we we lived why that motto and survived to this day\nWell we're glad you're still with us Peter thanks for calling but they came out of\nHere oh isn't thing they just make sure that it's okay well you know I made his whole call because my voice the sexier than yours\n[laughter] I doubt that for all for it yeah yeah well I don't you eat a judge cars now that we're talking about in the middle of hurricane mice oh now you want to hit Syria okay why don't\nYou start dealing with the phone number then we'll see if\nYou've never were there for eight seven to zero seven fifty or one eight hundred WSBIU time we'd love to hear from you your stories I loved one family members who have you heard from today um gosh I you know we just heard from someone who is literally living on the side of the road\nAnd uh you know hit a rough patch in life and can you guys imagine\nYou know we were trying to my daughter and I took the surface streets to get here tonight because I'm thinking I don't want to be on the interstate because we were under a tornado warning at the time that I left the house and I'm I'm thinking ahead like logistically where am I going to dart into for like immediate cover in the event I'm so just imagine\nBeing stranded on the side of the writer not having a home to to hunker down in where are you\nBetter off having a tree fall down on the on the surface street or on the interstate\nWell\nFine there although there wasn't really hauling down his lead waiting for dang the way we\nPicked up and hauling a before I think probably between now and to a um like the worst is supposed to be here ... and uh\nSo we will see the rain is going to start slashing off tomorrow in the morning until it's only a thirty percent chance in the afternoon and that was kinda deceiving today I mean we'd be go Muslim along in Conyers' at two o'clock sunshine and yeah\nI've been a nice day at three o'clock it was raining at four thirty in the sun was shining and right now those arms and I think it is a tornado moves or the tornadoes hurricanes yeah or\nThe or the arms getting closer to get a great\nPoint though what Peter just said like going east or west but not coming straight north because the storms are following you you know the tornadoes and what\nNot and I guess if I Lived in Florida I Would probably you know immediately had for someone in Georgia a but he's right because they do pass and then you want to be able to get back to your home and assess the damage if there's anything left you know to assess so\nYou know and and really not making light of it it is I cannot imagine what that's like too hard candies hole up you know art or the or own street on the news and your home is literally no longer there I mean that's yeah\nThe thing that would worry me and I would I mean I Can't speak for the people who did not get out the way yeah but I Would be worried about looters yes and there's already yeah comes already

up for an hour a beginning at eleven go till midnight that's right very good we're getting to know too so we'll see how those eighty yeah will lead Rahm there's\nOkay tell us about tell us the current skinny on hurricane Michael\nYes arcade Michael is a center now in South Georgia and it's been weakening over land and the last update we got from the hurricane center\nAt ten pm was the winds are now down to eighty miles an hour so it's a category one hurricane still um but not by much so it's not going to be logging maybe eleven o'clock\nIt's downgraded to a tropical storm or if it still holds onto hurricane strength through eleven it won't be long after that so bottom line is\nA Michael is weakening the winds are coming down I'm as anticipated this is really right on schedule and uh and we've got some some gusty winds in metro Atlanta but nothing that's causing any damage\nAnd areas of heavy rain um continue but those tropical storm force winds just state of our south and east\nWhen we have heavy winds here probably through tomorrow a little bit got stuck to\nYeah so tonight will have gosh we've already I've got to about thirty five miles an hour in Atlanta we're not going to see much more than that and I\nI Would could rely to forty mile in our guts but then after the sunrise tomorrow and the center of Michael starts pushing away from us the winds will gradually subside so tomorrow afternoon it'll be breezy gust twenty twenty five miles an hour or so that's not a problem and a clearing sky tomorrow\nIt's an extra club on a par three I'm sure you're aware of this right what does that would have I don't know is that what it's going to take for the for the storm to move a little bit as the sun to come back up and he come back\nAnd to know so what's happening as a cold front coming in from the west and I was going already turned and you may recall yesterday and even early this morning\nThe hurricane was moving to North through the Gulf of Mexico the approaching front from the west is turned it to the north east okay and it's picking a forward speed so it's moving almost twenty miles an hour now moving to the northeast um that call friends going to continue to push it away\nAnd drier air coming in behind the front and on the back side of the of what tomorrow will be a tropical storm um is going to cause the sunshine returning ultimately some beautiful weather coming our way\nWould eventually just be known tomorrow is a rain event\nYeah no it it it'll it'll keep its name and unlikely maintain tropical storm strength through the day tomorrow it's going to pretty quickly screwed across the Carolinas tomorrow afternoon and and back out I'm near a near the coast or perhaps just back out into the Atlantic by late tomorrow\nOne more quick question unless Monica has won this has been pretty quick I mean Sunday I wasn't even hardly a tropical depression by noon today your new today it was a category five now it's on the verge of being back into the tropical and then it's going to be a way is that normal or is that\nWell we we we ... we had what's called rapid intensification I mean they say this the hurricane was over the Gulf of Mexico\nThey the conditions in the atmosphere the lack of wind shear all those things were were really ideal and the water temperature in the Gulf still very warm in the mid eighties is though the heat content of the warm water that fuels the storm so\nWith police in here you know it's on scene for this state of the far right traveling is making your way toward the connector\nAlso getting word
