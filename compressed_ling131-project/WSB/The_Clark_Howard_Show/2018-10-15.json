question I had to do with a if any if you could recommend a website or a resource that folks in something like Consumer Reports for applications [noise] ah\nSo you are tired of downloading apps that promise and don't deliver as that what's happening\nYou that's part of it yeah or I I ended up using an app or using a program to accomplish the task I get done and I go there look they're an easier way to do that\nBy having an example okay we'd babysit our grandchildren for the summer on Tuesday Spanish so I thought it would be cool to make a little look at the end of the summer the shit here's what I Do to grandma's house on Tuesday for fact\nI ended up using Microsoft Word and importing a bunch of photos and putting in check it ended up being thirty five pages long about chipped keys to sixty photos but it was a short it was really hard you know what is what they're up publishing program that maybe could help me do that better\nWell you know unfortunately with close to one and a half million apps right now\nThere it's really difficult to find any type of authentic reviews site\nA there are sites like ours that will do round up some say you know here at ten great photo apps but we would only hit ten out of maybe two thousand or five thousand that could be available\nOr icy if you're looking for a particular app you can always read the reviews people are brutally honest about what they liked about it what they didn't like about it but Andrew a you used a particular site to put together a photo book did you not yes we use charter flight you shutter flies\nAnd because you know important fortunately Tom says it was a thirty five page word document that they use these but you know making photo books as a sense whether on Yahoo Photos Google Photos wherever it may be\nIn one of the great things was I misspelled the word in the book no yes and we got it and 'cause I ... a a birth story of my son and I misspelled the word bank called them up and they're like oh we'll just we'll just fix it and send you know and no charge\nAnd so you so before you look for a particular app\nThat only does one task is that you might want to look at okay uh what is it is John right out of work and work with photos maybe the photo sites will make a photo book because you're right putting it into Microsoft Word trying to form about those pages and getting that that\nThat's a complete nightmare but the other thing that might be kind of fun for you to do is Andrew what you did with the gentleman on fiber where you've created the animated book that that your kids really love\nYes and we I sent them real pictures they we communicated back and forth on five or ... I think it was in the end it was nine original illustrations based on photos and I mean I Know the websites called fire but it's still only ended up costing like a hundred and sixty dollars for someone to ... to take months to make those animation\nAnd so so and so the next time you have a task foot in front of you Tom\nYes uh-huh call us\nOkay okay okay I mean that's why we're here and or drop me a note through the website\nAnd I know this sounds crazy and and a lot of people don't believe me but I Do I read every single know that you send me through the website\nAnd I've got a system I've done it for many years and when you send me your question things that you want to accomplish we will use that as content\nAt for a tip or a cool site or an app review or whatever it may be over a commander dot com or you could just call it give us a call to the show and if you're a Kim's club member by the way you always get priority calling and you can join ... club right now\nAt get Kim Dotcom stay right where you are big security alert I Need to tell you about what the Web cams that's spreading like crazy across the United states you're on the Kim commando show\nWith more and more of our lives are moving on line intrusions to our privacy can have devastating consequences one great way to secure your privacy so you can have their freedom to be anonymous and untraceable online is to use what's called a VPN it stands for virtual private network\nWhen choosing a VPN you really need to trust the company running it\nAnd I recommend F secure freedom VPN F secure as a publicly listed company they have this Thirty Years' spotless track record of protecting its customer security and privacy it's so easy to use and it's really easy to set up\nYou'll be up and running in just a few minutes\nF secure even let you try for free for five days no sign up no credit card details required\nYou can trust as the cure to protect your privacy and to keep you anonymous and untraceable online or to your freedom VPN now and get twenty percent off when you use discount ...

question right here um my question it's a ... to ... all along reputation management I guess my first thought would be like well with me the best ... that I can find full small medical office\nAnd also what I was looking at it that was all or a I'm a software that you are just and then the field that search engine optimization have to go to all all\nAll right well let's talk a little bit too so what's going on with your business on line\n[noise] well the problem with them or if it's obviously what most businesses have as you know if you have as many good reviews that go on line to help you out of the battery balance it out but obviously it doesn't work that way you know the people have experience it's usually doesn't go on line at the post there the\nPositive experience as they have what you at your business [noise] so what am I here mostly the negative responses that are starting to add up more than than the positive responses to what I Need to do it by something someone to neutralize the negative responses that happened to my business all on\nOkay All right so here's the deal before I Would contract with any reputation type management farm okay\nIs I Would encourage you to do this yourself because\nYou may be able to do it more effectively and do exactly what they do ... and then you will further understand how this all works okay because as it as a small business owner and I'm a small business owner too\nIs that you know you it's one thing tell somebody do a job it's another thing tell somebody do the job when you've already done the job right\nBut and so what I Would do is it is are these on like Yelp or where where is it so I'm Glad for all the\nMedical or it's like ... grade the current okay all they need they use excel\nOkay so okay a couple of things you can do number one to mitigate the negative you have to accelerate the positive okay\nSo anybody who comes in they should be given a card from the gal the front desk that says we appreciate positive reviews so with their ... and on your receipt it says we appreciate positive reviews think of every touch point that you have with that client\nAnd tell them that you appreciate positive reviews okay but because I guarantee that if you start telling them that this is what you need this is what you want to switch you appreciate this is what you're thankful for\nYou know if they had a great time they're happy to do that\nAnd you know if somebody says gosh you know gosh doctor you just saved my life I mean I never looked and felt so great ever before you say you know can you up on line and\nJust trapped sum it up a note there and I think over time say four to six weeks you'll find that those positive reviews are now outweighing the negative reviews okay\nOkay so that's the ... the other thing you can get let me finish the other thing you can\nDo is with health grades is drop them a note and say I don't agree with this negative review I'd like to be able to respond to it\nAnd what I have heard is that when you do this then health grades will remove it health grades also has a program called recognize Dr status\nAnd that'll put you at the top and then it will also you'll have because now you're having more positive reviews you'll be able to get that recognition there hey I'm there are some sites and it's nothing other than an extortion scam I get I get it\nBut where if you pay them a certain fee\nThat they will spotlight your business\nYou'll have more tools available to you\nYou'll have other ways to say I want this review to be front and center and I don't want to be I don't want this review to be on the top anymore so\nSo in answer to your question instead of signing up with a service to do this and I haven't heard a lot of good positive feedback from people who have signed up for the service and that's why I'm encouraging you to be for you to do it yourself", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Clark Howard Show", "city": "Atlanta", "day":
