I thought well that'd be to see how it's supposed to get the money\nWell when I did that then is to ask me for my bank routing address and everything and I feel very uncomfortable with just with this situation especially with all the hacking that has taken place with Facebook and most recently as well\nYou know that's the thing to do with ah with the bigger players go find me and the smaller imitator the Facebook finding option or you have to give your checking account so they have the place to put your money and to\nWrite and I did uh did that go fund me as well that's what I have actually given any either one of all my banking information of course I was waiting to consult with you as a fall and you for years appreciate your it is\nAbsolutely so first things first I Hope that you get the insulin pump as quickly as possible\nAnd second with both of them go ahead and give them your checking account information because that's how you're going to get money the way it works is you don't get the money minus their credit card merchant processing fees that bell charge right\nSo what happened was go find me use to their business he used to be based on charging a percent\nTo

you\nFor their costs would the credit card companies and that's exactly what Facebook is doing also\nDid look very similar there um when I looked into the details of the F ... it was very compatible in what they were doing a most\nMore people like you said with a giant I felt a lot more comfortable with that shot of ah do find me a there's just so many people are using that successfully but I could not get any feedback at the time from Facebook's ... a fundraiser Programme I nut known anybody that had used it\nI'd never and our first person I've ever heard of who use [laughter]\nAnd I see

well\nI'm a a few years from a retirement I work for a non charity or a non profit and um\nI have a full three day and a traditional LA and a couple of other sources of income that will be available and I'm retired but I keep getting emails from an organization that uh\nIs is pushing something called an infinite banking concept when I Can't find out anything about it except that it looks like it's tied to a [noise] a vivid and paying whole life insurance\nYeah yeah like I got it and I ...\nThat for a you don't like the norm that for insurance and I I just didn't know it was a a viable thing\nFor retirement income I don't like this at all and it\nWas something that has been pitched so many different ways\nIn recent years I've had a lot of calls recently that people would refer to it as a seven oh two Jay ... and things like that where where the people pitching this stuff make it sound like it's magical that it's like a loophole in the tax code or whatever\nAnd life insurance does have a in certain circumstances\nSome tax advantage to it but the problem with using whole life insurance\nIs a vehicle to find some amount of retirement is that the expenses and commission so involved with the whole life insurance policy or soda gigantic\nThat the fish and sea of your money is not very good there's such a focus on if you do this you're going to avoid tax\nBut that's the whole big pitch but one thing you mentioned you said you were doing a regular IRA do you know what so superior\nTo this strategy that it's being pitched around whole life insurance\nAnd on any time somebody calls me and asked me about using whole life insurance as a way to pay for retirement and I'll ask where you fully finding a Roth IRA well here's a Roth IRA beats any life insurance policy\nThree hundred and sixty five days this year 'cause there's only three sixty five is not a leap year\nIt was a leap year beat at three hundred and sixty six days\nSo your darling you're doing good strategies the only modification I Would make\nIs instead of contributing to a regular IRA anymore I was instead contribute to a Roth IRA\nWell if if I only have like two years or so to retire lend is going to pay off\nWell I don't know how much money you would put into a whole life insurance policy\nRight well I'm not going to do that at all\nOkay but if you worry if you were considering it and you were thinking of doing that whatever money you would have potentially put into that put that instead into a raw you put that aside up to your past age fifty\nSo you put in up to sixty five hundred dollars max but you can put on whatever you can afford into a rock and the fact that you're approaching retirement\nDoesn't take away from the advantage of a raw because where a Roth is so great is its flexibility you put money in it you retire you're not working anymore but the money in their can continue to grow tax\nFree for years and years and years to come until maybe later in retirement when you need it and then you spend it tax free ... let's see so that's why the raw or were you so you're at right now and\nThat I could put in sixty five hundred a year in the traditional would you recommend that I'd just stop that if I can do the stuff that and put it in the last\nExactly okay exactly\n'cause you're already are doing that for three beep plan you're already doing a lot of pre tacky stuff mhm so I Want you to have some post tax money that will not be tax later and that's why doing the Ross IRA\nIn my mind would be preferable option to doing the traditional i._r._a. but anybody's pitches about how\nThe magic of whole life insurance is going to create this for a while for you and you're gonna cheat the government because you're gonna have to buy him any tax is

questions off the air if you go down\nA little car dot com you'll see the phone number or an hours available for free off the air advice on TALK about something that I had so many questions about\nDuring the great recession don't get as many questions about resumes as I used to and there's such a change and how particularly larger companies treat a resume\nCompared to how they were treated in the past also job applications that are filed electronically how they're treated by employers okay this is weird weird weird\nBigger companies that either except electronic applications written ones or resumes\nHave them scanned by software almost exclusively on at least the first round never reviewed by human\n'cause big companies that people know up and are aware of get zillions of applications\nAnd they don't want to spend the time or the labor looking through them so they have them scanned for key words based generally on the skill set of their job they're hiring for\nAnd so and you can find lots of this information online about how the key word should be position but you want to make sure you're using industry terminology if it relates to the job that you're applying for\nIf you're doing something in the IT field or tech\nWhatever a\nCertification initials you have whatever skills you have whatever training you've had that's gotta be prominently and clearly written on an electronic application a written one or a resume to be picked up by the scan to get through the first cut\nBut here's a dirty little secret you need to know particularly with larger employers\nFixes in most jobs are what's called wire the applicant they intend to hire for that job is already known before their job is posted\nYou are given false hope in most cases they're actually interested in you even if you make it through the electronic cuts may be a human review somebody calls you for a phone interview recalls un for an in person interview and you think wow this is great\nI'm On my way to working here and all on\nTheir playing you because they're just trying to meet the requirements that HR is laid out for them at these big companies\nThat they show that they had a diversity of applicants before they made their final hiring decision who's the person they intended to higher before the job was ever posted in any way\nThe key thing for you when you're looking for a job or a new opportunity people hire people\nForget the machines it is the rare exception that somebody makes it through the clutter to get a job when it was not a situation already wired you need to be the one that jobs wired for\nAnd\nThe most important thing when you're looking for work ignore the giant employers pay or slow growth entities many times actually reducing headcount overtime the larger company gets the west dynamic it becomes\nAnd the real growth in jobs the real opportunity comes with smaller generally potentially faster growing firms that nobody's ever heard of\nThat where you find the opportunity don't go to the big brand name company everybody's ever heard of\nGo look for opportunity where companies knowing is ever heard the name of ... generally companies businesses that sell the other businesses not to consumers are where the greatest opportunity lies not only for employment but for advancement as well\nDaniels' with us on the Clark Howard

Robyn\n[noise] good afternoon how are you [noise]\nOh well thank you how about yourself [noise] good good you want to talk about your mom [noise] yes my mother is Nineteen years young and she has decided to sell her home sign like so she has been lately on her own up to Ninety years of age\nUh killed just about eight months ago yes\nWow very impressive\n[noise] Ah yes very um so what she did she do with the proceeds from the home she got a purchase another home she's going to continue living with me\nAnd so the money will be for the purpose of living expenses for her\nA living expenses or I'm not saying the case she does need a care in a rehab or hospital or nursing how\nOkay All right so ah and then ultimately when your mom does pass away what are her wishes with these proceeds if they're not needed for medical care or things like that\nCan be divided among her four children\nOkay All right so\nI Would say that at her age you've got to just play it as simple as possible because you don't know at what point she might need a some medical care and may need to be in assisted living or whatever and this is gonna sound so unbelievably conservative\nBut I Would put the proceeds and to a simple savings account\nWally yeah because if you\nTold me that the proceeds from this she's really not going to need they're also going to be inherited by her children\nThan I Would recommend something completely different I Would recommend investing the money and wedding at our grow 'til the time of her passing that hopefully you're still a long way from now maybe she'll break the century Mart\nAnd all and then you'd be able to whoever it would be the executor would be able to distribute those proceeds but in a case where you don't know if the money's going to be needed for her care\nYou can't really invest it\nOK correct that that's what I was worried about\nAnd so that's why the proceeds need to go into is simple savings but not at a traditional bank it should be at an online bank where right now you can earn about two and a quarter percent\nOkay\nAnd then the monies available as it's needed and if it's not needed then ultimately I it would be distributed per her
