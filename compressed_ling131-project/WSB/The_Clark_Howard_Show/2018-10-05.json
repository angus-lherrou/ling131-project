home and start\nGetting the pitches for the mortgage life insurance it's total trash insurance\nSee again I was listening to your podcast and he was saying too good to be true and you got back to back people and they happen to be positive and I was like well I have to give it as have to give it a go I had to ask Clark so\nBetter I allowed I did let me tell you what's much more important than and I kind of cut you off there and I apologize you're getting the pitchers for the mortgage life you mentioned a mortgage disability policy is that right\nThat's correct\nAnd those are the two main areas that you've been getting the pitchers\nAbsolutely the thing is with that stuff\nIs that with anybody's pitch for a mortgage life mortgage disability one of the real guy chose is who you're insuring is the bank the bank is\nEssentially the beneficiary or maybe the name beneficiary\nOf the policies so the bank with the mortgage life it pays off the mortgage\nWith a disability it pays the monthly mortgage payment until and unless you're able to work again and so that is the idea of both of them is that you are in fact insuring the bank but\nThey're ready for the punchline of that I Am the premiums typically are as much as ten times what the premiums would be for the right kind of insurance which has insurance that you buy that is for the benefit of your survivors\nWho how many of you are there who is there that makes up your family group\nA total three okay so do you have life insurance yet I Do All right so you're doing the right thing there and do you have disability insurance I

insurance on top of everything else is a straight jacket because it's already decided who benefits the bank\nAnd it makes the decision for your survivors and that's a bad idea\nWell I I I thank you

retire how how old are you Cody\nOh twenty eight so twenty I Would say oh let's go oh we could go either to sixty we'd go to a twenty sixty or we can go to twenty fifty five either those were probably makes sense\nIs the target here and okay so how much money do you have in the Roth right now well\nI've only had it open for six or so as long as it's not about twenty dollars\nYou're fine once you have a thousand you can go and the target retirement fund so just call 'em up and ah at vanguard and tell them you don't know exactly how to make this change what you want the money to go and the

it for you over the phone they'll walk you through how to do it on line okay and you're able to get\nThe money into the right place than going forward you just keep putting the money into the target

speak of no no I get by four or five months something like that but but I'm I'm concerned about retirement\nFirst of all that you have four or five months save for a rainy day give yourself some props that's good that's a healthy chunk that very few Americans actually have but you said something else that I Would be more distressed about so you have no money right now save for retirement\nKnow that there is a good time I was retired from the army for Twenty years from Twenty years of service well\nThank you for your service\nThank you and thank you for you what you do for anybody that listens to

into her off each year\nNo certainly just not I like her to have her own\nOkay with her being forty five she's got more time to build up some money and that would be a priority how are you been able

correct I'm looking to have more and just wanted to know that the best option that I might be able to do\nMy employer automatically flies three percent to a four O. one K. rough account and I'd like to save even more than that when the brain if I should add more to that same account if I should open a gift for raw or if there is another\nSaving strategy that I should start to incorporate or or add too\nSo the three percent your employer throws in is that if you put in three percent or do you get it just for breathing\nJust from breathing\nWell that's a generous employer [laughter] yeah\nSo what percent of your pay are you putting in that Ross four one K. right now\nRight now I'm put in about three percent as well and then the employer you know automatic country so\nYou're saving essentially six cents on each dollar you make right yeah I got to get you to save more okay how old are you Travis thirty five or so\nHave you prior to this point what have you done to save\nI'm not really other than just this four one K. um through work\nAnd a prior to thirty five\nYou've always been doing just the three percent on yes\nOkay so I'm going to put you on a treadmill here and you're not going to like my treadmill but I'm going to get you physically fit okay okay so what I'd like you to do is right away\nWith the employer plan to raise it what you're contributing to four percent and not asking a lot right now just go up one percent alright sure six months from now want you to go up another one percent\nAnd you know I'm going to go with this six months after that I Want you to go up another ... percent again\nOkay and being thirty five the more money you can save today the more you create a path to financial comfort for you down the road because you've got roughly based on when people like to bag or you got Thirty years to get this done\nSo the more of your pay you can save and if you step it up bit by bit gradually\nYou won't miss a traditional one percent you put in\nBut if I can get you to step it up one percent every six months\nIn five years time you'll be saving effectively sixteen percent of your pay is right now you're six three and three and if you can do it every six months\nYou'll end up eventually where you're putting a lot of money aside for retirement which at thirty five you really need to be somewhere around Fifteen cents on each dollar you make\nOkay and I didn't get fame ... or the you know good use of that money and\nI think so because I'm not even asking you how expensive the Roth is in terms of management fees and all that because when I'm really into right now is getting you to save more money that you\nBecause if the employer automatically takes out of your check it eliminates you intending to do it it gets done so how far into this what I really be putting a herd on your wallet\nOr know it'd be OK yeah\nThen keep taking those little teeny bites the savings apple doing the one percent additional twice a year and you will really be so\nHappy where that leads you down the road\nOkay great sounds very hard I think you\nBest to you and I'm so glad you're asking now most people don't focus on saving for retirement till after their fortieth birthday\nSo we get it this way you're getting a five year head start on them Travis Nancy's with us on the Clark Howard show hello Nancy how are you doing\nOh I'm doing fine\nMan see you want me to tell you if something is a friend or foe the you're thinking of doing go ahead name the website or out if you don't mind\nOkay it's kind of ... advertising and I advertise that they gave me a credit score plus a lot more than ... other a site that can launch law\nWhile you're on credit karma [laughter]\nReally well they're both they're both really legit good things okay well\nWhat I Would like to know when you get on to the site that you have to give a lot of personal information it's okay to do it on your financial computer because that's how I use that computer for us to pay like they'll get on my banking sites that\nThat is a great question and I do my credit karma I Do it on my regular computer I use my financial computer only for going to banking brokerage and built pay\nOkay well that's kinda what I wanted to know 'cause I got to separate computer and how well what I was kind of about credit festival is because advertisers sound like a law that credit ... the ... that credit and if I get ... like if I could learn out its winery and maybe credit festival with a little bit more ... you\nKnow I don't think so they're giving you an experience score but if you look ... sesame it says free credit score monthly it does not safe I go okay\nBut the point with any of these scores the credit karma and the credit sesame is they're giving you a pretty good temperature of how you're doing you know I I look at it was like almost like are you getting in a level and credit or B. or C. or D. or and a half\nThat the it's not going to be the same score likely that a lender will be using whether it'll give you a clear indication how you're doing paying your bills how you're doing with your um credit\nUtilization and credit sesame it is not actually a vantage score it's called the Experian national equivalency score to yet another one that's not an actual psycho score\nOkay but as far as using credit sesame using credit karma they're great the credit sesame you're going to see how your experience works either credit karma you'll see Experian and trends union and the information the more you can get to this kind of stuff\nThe better Sean's
