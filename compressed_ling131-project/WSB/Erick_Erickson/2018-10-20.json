B.\nBefore we talk to libertarian gubernatorial candidate had met at the top of the hour just had a very lively discussion with\nSome callers to wear little taken aback by how hard we were heading Stacey Abrams but this stuff is new and nobody's talking about it and and the burden is on our shoulders\nI did not mean I'm\nThe kind of anybody's short but we did but one of the arguments that she made is that it\nStays he's working for the people and I I my argument my gut instinct my conclusion is that she's working for herself and she always has been\nShe got accepted to an incredibly elite program as a high school student and I think they really taught those uh that they're on the people who are in those programs how to how to pass\nSet the path of their lives and achieve those goals and I think so she was prepared as since a teenager and that's when she was doing this stuff with that the Rodney King riots and bring the flag on the Capitol Steps\nAnd she benefited from that immediately immediately so basically tell us how or did you have a clip for it I I Know you have a clip art but what are you got she\nGot a job shortly thereafter in the mayor's office she got a some sort of Ford Foundation grant where she ended up touring the country over the summer and I mean on top of that she also\nWorking for a campaign I Can't remember whose campaign was it was as a Democrat and I think the eleventh district um but while she was touring the country these people in the community who she claimed to be standing for\nDuring these protests are still complaining about the students to trash their yards who intimidated their store owners who looted their stores and these people in this group I'm an whoever was in this group they were saying that they represent\nThese community members the community members are talented entirely different story they're intimidated and afraid do we have how long has ... eight\nAnd the thing is a very long\nTime let's play a clip ain't about how this is the job she got immediately after she let those protests and and there was an article from back then if you don't want more protests let's you're clipping\nBathing mission where people are equal power I mean one of the reasons my experience it and I have led me to\n[noise] Nineteen running major program for the city of Atlanta [noise]\nHaving the ability through policy to engage to have the power of the city I when I was wholesome on his and needs to come to this meeting and they are my younger son out here they showed up because I was able to say how that happens it's either\nSo that was the position she got in the immediate aftermath of those ah\nOf her agitation I absolutely have to cut for this break and stay tuned because we're going to get nothing but positive any in the next hour without guess had met and then garlic ... this is Monica ...\nHigh boats as Monica ... appears in here for cats deal at home you never accept that can choice standard or mediocre you want to bet no waiting no short cuts no excuse and it's why you have\nTo ... deal to upgrade your heating system this month before the cold really sets him schedule today to get your news state of the arts system the next day\nPlus sale including up to twelve year industry leading warranty end of the sixteen hundred dollars a manufacturer rebates and did you know October is the best month to upgrade your home heating not only do you get cat feels that rebates warranted but you also will be ready for the cold snap the instead it happen\nThat deal highly trained experts tax will upgrade to comfort with a system that's due to home and your wallet that's more than great it's the best don't white cat feel schedule is building up that for the best service mission Monica when you've got seven seven zero cats deal or visit ... dot\nCom people saying things don't matter but that's not true the things you have from house to your family lives in to their belongings inside\nAre symbolic of the life you've worked so hard to them when the next flood comes don't let your hard work will be washed away\nProtect life you've dealt by investing in flood insurance calling your insurance agent or learn more and fled smart that gun lashed protect ... by FEMA and the national flood insurance program\n[noise] attention Medicare beneficiaries now is your chance to get a will care all in one Medicare Advantage plan designed to help you get and stay healthy getting zero dollars or low monthly premiums\nPlus great benefits like free over the counter items dental and vision coverage get exclusive access to our large network a provider pharmacies hospitals and specialists open enrollment in December seventh so don't wait let well care get news coverage and benefits\nYou deserve on your journey to a better view called welfare now to learn more about your options at eight seven seven to find a hero nine six two or visit well care for G.

S. plan with a Medicare contract\nEnrollment in our plant depends on contract renewal\nYou asked me about doorbell er Cox media group station\n[noise] the one who is twenty four hour news weather and Trump\nThat's absolutely correct okay great and then just those are not only ... but they're also accurate statements\nYes I totally agree yes so okay so why and how would you I kind of bring that to the governor's race and um you know and you're campaigning either [laughter]\nWell it's a hard question to answer in in in less than like three hours so let me start with saying basically the reason I'm learning is to end corruption\nTo help government you know to help the people hold government accountable and it's a lower taxes\nNow getting back to the voluntary consensual thing a lot of things the government does or not voluntary among not to the central government is run up lately of what would you know his wife with corruption of the corruption costs our tax dollars to be stuck by somebody else\nTrim ... nobody gets richer politics without being a crook\nYes I think that and that your point about ending corruption is very interesting and it's absolutely it's it's\nThe right answer because if you look at the constitution it seems to me that if you if you actually stuck to it and there were no corruption and that elected officials actually defended the constitution is supposed to\nWe live in a libertarian society that's what it was founded on so that's all it takes you have to pass new laws you just have to I I\nWant to watch the ones that are already well yes and ...\nSuch a you know such as a as the constitutional restrictions on passing a grants\nOr special privilege and we should all the time and that's how politicians froze ... themselves you know enriched themselves up the tax payer teach\nCan you explain that a expound on that\nA British special privileges in particular is some sort of a legislation they pass to give someone favorable treatment over someone else touched relief for special privileges or you know like like a like a slide on UPA regulation or something like that\nIt's quite often used in the context of taxes and the way I look at it as\nThey put this huge blanket over everybody completely stifling restrictive blanket and they cut air hold out for the people they like\nAnd it's like over if there weren't so many laws against taxi freedom there never would have been an opportunity for over to kind of blanket the earth they used those little holes in the fabric of politics because they happen to be more powerful\nTo take over a niece that was created by the restrictions that these um\nPrivileges you know that they that the government you like them and the ...\nBest beyond taxation is also regulations regulatory and compliance issues as well\nWhich is why the progressive era was started by the robber barons and not the other way around\nIt and you know and yet it continues and that's really\nWhere the let's just has picked up on on the way things work they picked up the cause\nThere's ... they're getting government or in a position to enrich themselves and their friends\nYes and and one thing that I Do I think is absolutely crazy is that with all the mania against Trump on the national level people don't turn to the tenth amendment and see the wisdom of it\nThat if we return of the power to the state then you would have power at the state level\nAnd we can really make a difference but I Would I also want to point out one thing is that this idea of voting for the lesser of two evils I got a tweet earlier which was interesting thought provoking saying well if if this person didn't agree with you on everything\nThen again it's a choice among evil and I would say it's not the corruption is the evil the pastor decision the exploitation of the laws\nThose are evil practices practice by most I Would say most of the elected officials in the major parties that that it's actually even if it's not perfect and everybody's interests aren't a hundred percent aligned\nI eliminating the corruption being honest and following your principles is not evil even ask people don't agree with all the positions that you come out or\nGet if you hold it down to the most basic concept of of of things that are consensual involuntary then eliminated a lot of the opportunities for corruption\nRight all of them I mean right now you can't it's coercion fraud that that leads toilet so what do you say to people who\nUh I got I got a tweet from um someone also named Monica saying the libertarians I it's exactly the libertarian vote will dilute the Republican vote please don't do it this is what [laughter] what do you think of that\nI was I was I was giving a presentation at some town hall meeting and basically it seems to me that the map as up as a libertarian vote girls were three of those because of the vote for the little return it it's a vote for the other parties\nYou know the vote for Democrats to vote for Republicans the thing is I'm I'm actually thirty percent of voters nationwide in our identify themselves with\nA well thirty percent of of people identified as Democrats or Republicans that means the majority of voters are really\nDizzy first choice because they don't have a third voice in Dover voice or reasonable logic voices like economic prosperity we have just two parties basically the ruling control the whole thing the government is there's only made up of Republicans and Democrats and when it comes down to every boat\nThat raises our taxes increases government increases the size and scope of government as well as regulations as always voted on by Republicans and Democrats because that's all of them so if we want to do something different we have to get a different voice into government\nThat's very good that is that math at you use because you could buy that argument or you can get the most votes\nIf you if you read invigorated the people who have given up on voting you could get more votes than any Democrat or Republican without stealing a single one of their votes\nOh I Know that very well that's why you're not seeing the in the media yet but the New York he happens to me in the newspapers are are are very very few and far between articles or that there is actually a bird\nDribbling ... or early lately because they don't want to upset their gravy train of the same old system where every you know the same two groups of people who are in power and if you look at it the corporation is behind ... especially ... equally to both parties because they always have a winner in the race\nWell at that point is well made when you think of how well a Ron Paul did in the Iowa caucus that year and was completely buried by the media and then you look at somebody like Trump\nWho supposedly spent nothing on his campaign and because of all the media coverage he he catapulted to the permanent position and ah wherever I Want to be around

excitement around\nUh Justin Fields and and ah well are they saying well I think\nThe excitement is nobody has been able to see these young men play and you mentioned Justin and there are a number of young men that have entered the program or early back in January so it was the first time to be able to see them\nIn a a game tongue firemen before Seventy thousand or whatever our number is going to be at the end of the day but\nUh we are spending some halftime or periods of time to really recognize our incoming freshman class which is as you mentioned is been highly rated but who knows in four years is when you really judge how these teams are doing but\nWe do know that is an important day for them is an important day for those young men that are looking maybe to attend the University of Georgia to see the amount of\nPassion and desire and all of the traits that make Georgia football so so cool and so popular now\nAnd to be in that environment it certainly made a huge difference two years ago when so many of the young men that are here now where here back in two thousand sixteen to to be a part of that so I Know that's part of the thrust here it's part of the the the lure of Georgia football is being able to walk in as you mentioned\nAh right before kickoff and see a packed house at Stanford Stadium so except for the west end zone and obviously that will be populated because the new school board and the new uh areas in that area so our our capacity to be ... will be reduced somewhat to to accommodate for\nThat area you're listening to a lens on business brought to buy him a university has was out of business school I'm Richard lands this week we're talking with a very special guest Greg McGarry director of athletics or University of Georgia and thank you for taking the time I Know you're you're getting crushed 'em\nSo now this is a business a show so last few like sort of business whether it's a lot of time just like the personal stories of which you're in Athens native right\nYou have you played for damage ... you write letters and when you were in the sports information right\nYou married or another ah Georgia grad right wrecked eventually you added up to Florida for a few years that enemy territory as well you got some secrets Iraq back\nAnd so you've been with us now now so I'm you know being the head of an athletic department the size of UGA comes with\nA lot of responsibility and in so many different teams have you have you first decide you want to be an athletic director or they're famous athletic director is your sparring to be like and you know how do you how do you pursue that\nI was so fortunate to have a very young age to uh have of a gentleman named day in the guild ah take me under his wing so to speak and he was so\nMulti dimensional back in the day he was a hit men's tennis coach he was the director the Georgia Bulldogs club and he was the publicity director so he or three or four hats and so me being in that environment\nAs a teenager and all through high school and all through college uh I knew I wanted to be involved in college athletics or a new at a very early age I wanted to be involved ...\nAsked me to come to his office back in Nineteen Seventy seven and asked me if I wanted to coach women's tennis\nAnd be the assistance force of ... absolutely and uh so that started the journey and then uh I did those things for three or four years and then permit Perry who was in an industry to roll left to go to all burning so that spot was open and\nA ... asked me if I wanted to move up into that administrative area and I said absolutely wow and so it's just a stepping stone and uh I mean I was so I'm so lucky to be surrounded by great mentors and great people who really believed in me and they allowed me to move up in the profession\nAnd in Ninety two had an opportunity to go to University of Florida and assume Jeremy Foley's oh role because he ascended to the athletic director position so I was able to uh to move into that spot and\nYou know I Would have been perfectly content or in any role in college athletics I mean I did not go insane I Want to be an athletic director that was a that was not a goal was it just happened and so I've always felt like that whatever roll your in be the best you can possibly be\nAnd then good things will happen to you and other people will notice that but um I've just been so fortunate to have mentors and people that have led me guided me a offered advice and where\nI hopefully they had been a good listener and a and a good steward of all of those pearls wisdom that I've been able to to gather but um I Would not be where I Would be today without just tremendous people that have pulled me along and it all out allowed me into their their world of college athletics\nWe we interviewed a lot of captains of industry so to speak on the show and they almost always have the story of a mentor who helped them so much because a lot of times it's not the school learning of apology stick was at a at University of Georgia but it is that experience ... air and having someone help guide you right\nNow a hundred and twenty three million dollar budget so many sports\nOr the constituency that's out there\nYou know a a governor of Georgia is probably a controversial position and probably second to that is in Georgia would be trying to be as successful as possible with these sports programs and especially George football which is so\nAh important to so many people across the state and outside the state and so\nYou know you could be most talented people like me are running companies they could probably be running a different company\nAnd what this is a company you know it's has a higher purpose here suffer but [noise] um they're not getting as much a blog ... you know the guy who's running a yes or I ... yeah it's cetera so how did you prepare for being actually a public figure\n... great question 'cause I I I think the only way you can prepare for it is to to study others that have been successful in that profession\nAnd I remember going to a um I call it a wannabe convention of those that were in a associate eighty roles and we were attending a conference in Dallas\nAnd one of the questions raised was uh uh who wants to be a great leader and everybody raise their hand and then the next question was how many of you study great leaders and very few hands went up and said that's the problem\nIs that you want to be a great leader and you say you won't too but you don't study other great leaders so very soon a list of probably a hundred books were provided to us on what you could read from you know good degrade and and all of the books that are out there and if you Google leadership book shift on you know millions of hits there so\nWe all have to start that leadership journey at some point in time and mine led to serve in leadership\nAnd uh I don't think there's I think you really have to sit in the chair to really understand all the complexities that are involved regardless of any corporation or anyone\nUm I Know we have met with fellow athletic director at the high school level uh obviously they don't have the resources we have but they have the same problems that could be with parents that are complaining about playing top of their young children that could be\nA a students that that have trouble that have challenges so\nThey're just so many things and and I think you don't have an appreciation for that until you actually sit in the chair and then you realize\nIf you didn't before how valuable your staff is and you better surround yourself with a lot of smart people that are able to walk into your office and say this is why are we doing this and be able to question\nThe right way and to challenge thought and provoke maybe new ideas in that area but\nUm it's a it's a tough journey it's not an easy journey a and nobody ever masters to begin with everybody's\nConsistently learning you're listening to lens on business presented by him or universities could set of business school I'm your host Richard lands you don't need to be in the right position to move in the right direction was that is bringing together people from all industries and backgrounds impact us for the better learn more at Emory adopted is slash go beyond\nWhen we come back we'll be talking more

E. N. Z. on business dot com\n\n\nWelcome back legs on business for several Emery University He said if there's one your host Richards less you don't need to be in the right position to move in the right direction is that it's bringing together from all industries and backgrounds to impact\nBusiness for the better learn more at Emory dot biz slash go beyond this week we're talking with Greg McGarry he oversees the Twenty one sport athletics programs supported by a budget of a hundred and twenty three million dollars\nA since becoming director of athletic CJ teams have won many SEC national championships including very a big one last year and a tournaments division titles are Eighteen different Georgia teams have been ranked in the nation's top twenty and ten in the top ten\nUh your standard bearer for academic achievement I'd like to hear more about that and ah you remain at the forefront of facility expansion renovation\nWhich is something it's like an operational thing that goes on in the background and maybe when you're watching the game on TV you don't know how important those efforts are and so maybe you can tell us about the west end zone project at Stanford Stadium people probably heard about and they probably don't know exactly\nThey're probably afraid you're closing off the bright light so what's really\nWell I think one thing that is unusual about this project it it it it is that bridge level and below so when you're driving by the stadium you'll obviously see the new school board and you'll see the new plaza but you will not see the locker room and the recruiting space so\nA severe expensive project is in a very tight work zones so the lay down area in the past it's been a football field we just had to reply it's grass last week so a lot of moving pieces here but uh this edition is sixty three million dollar addition uh\nThere's so many complexities involved it happened underneath the underneath ground level\nAs far as all the water the state I make of it get in the weeds here pretty quick ... but\nWhat it provides us as a new locker room or we will exit or the locker room out of the west stands which is the first time that's ever happened that won't happen for the day but it will be ready for two thousand Eighteen but it'll be a large gathering space above the locker room which can accommodate up to fifty a five hundred\nPeople at one time and then on top of that bridge level\nIs is a large plaza which will provide can activity from the bridge\nUnderneath the school board where the ticket taking process will take place and then people will be able to enter the stadium from the bridge area which did relieve a lot of the pressure in certain areas of the stadium but ah at ground level of this it's really going to be phenomenal for our fans in the stadium is a large plaza area\nNew concessions new restrooms I'm new areas to where there'll be a photo ops a along with the the Olympic Torch the the granted bulldog that has been located in the eastern zone we'll be relocated to the west end zone\nAnd that'll become a very popular a pitcher spot as well as other notifications through this area but it's just going to provide much more gathering space and those that have entered the stadium in the past from gate ten which is next to the middle of learning center next to the tape center\nThat parking area are going to be able to experience a abroad\nAre gathering area just like they will at the plaza area there will be at the bridge level so much more gathering spaces much more open space is a great upgrade and so I think fans will really be impressed uh before the season opener and Eighteen and what they'll see today is just a a completed\nA concrete structure in the west end zone but they will notice the new school board the video board scoreboard and the new sound system that will be a atop the the the video board but\nI think those will will give people an idea of what will be taking place in two thousand Eighteen during the season but\nWe're so excited to let everybody see what it looks like because nobody's seen it yet what's her yeah blow it is kind of a new and and so I think people will be excited anytime you're you're able to be a little bit larger and more technology advanced like we are going to be not only in the\nIn the uh I call it kind of forty television\nAs compared to what we had which was not old technology but we've got the newest and finest and the sound system should be as good as anyone in college football and and we hope better\nIt must be an interesting construction challenge ducked get walking here a little bit but\nYou know the stadium over great memories from back in the day right in some heartbreaks right of all kinds of probably a and the stadium is coming up on a hundred years old I think Ninety something and to come back to that old structure\nThat we love and tried to upgrade it there must have been some interesting challenges plus to get it done because you know the season ends and now you got to hustle", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Erick Erickson", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "20"}
