you're on the Sean Hannity show glad you called sir\nYes sir thank you for taking my call what's going on how are you a good good I have first of all want to thank you for your exposure of the left and liberal for you know who they really are and the reason I'm calling today is concerning a repeal and replace Obamacare\nA I Know other stories or you know kind of taking the lead now but we really don't share a whole bunch about a repeal\nAnd replace much anymore it was just wondering if you could give us an update about Republicans are doing\nIf we in two weeks to have a more Republican senators which I think is very very possible and\nVirginia being and plays huge if we can hold onto the house you know it doesn't matter what the margin we hold on which is far more difficult I'm worried more about the house races then the Senate races\nIf we can get those two victories I guarantee you that Obamacare will be repealed and replaced and then we're going to have by the way preexisting conditions of big lie that's being told all over the country or the Republican bill dealt with preexisting conditions nobody is going to be denied coverage because they have a preexisting condition but\nYou know innovative solutions like we've been talking about I've been able to get Dr Josh amber atlas MD in front of a lot of politicians that all love the paradigm he's created in

accident\nAnd you have the best concierge here you ever dreamed up twenty four hour access to a doctor\nOr your primary care doctor do you get your check ups every year you got great reduction and pharmaceuticals and if something really really bad happens you have the hospital care at a very reduced rate because it's it's catastrophic it's only for the worst case scenario and it's much less expensive so I think all of that health savings accounts there on the table and I'd love to see that for every American imagine\nConcierge blue ... medical treatment for every American we can do that but it's not going to happen top down from the government you know or if you block grant the money to the states where you have you know fifty states have been ...\nLet me tell you what's going to rise to the top those they're going to want to turn over every nickel in those states to make it work for the people in those states or they're not going to be in power and I think that is far more economically efficient so there are a lot of good ideas I was disappointed with the Republicans last time we know John McCain had a chance to to fix this and decided against it last minute\nBut does the president's not done the individual mandate is done thankfully thanks to the tax bill that was passed\nUm but we've got a lot more work to do on it absolutely\nJust like I Need to fund the border wall that's also something that'll get done if we hold the house and Senate in in twelve days are but I'm focused on these house races all say it again every single house race matters some more

S. B. talk\nOr right now although I Want to pivot from the bombs the fake bombs that now\nAppears to the border general or general secretary Mattis is ordering eight hundred soldiers to the border\nHe's ordering them to the border to secure the border and help deal with this caravan that has come in it's amazing how these these fake bombs have thrown coverage of the cure of an out of the news just as pulling\nWas beginning to show that it was having a negative impact on a democratic turnout on a positive impact on Republican drawer I shouldn't say wasn't suppressing Democrat so much is over amplifying Republican turnout um people who are sitting on the sidelines and it does appear to be having an effect on Republican voters turning out it is a big issue\nEven legal Hispanic voters citizen voters who are Hispanic in this country are opposed to the caravan\nAnd Democrats more and more are grumbling about it now the odds are still the Democrats take back the house of representatives that's not a sure thing it is possible for Republicans to keep the house it's just not probable um the reason is let me put this in perspective for you as to why\nIt is not probable but it's possible\nGiven the number of seats out there\nRepublicans essentially need to win four out of every five plus up seats\nDemocrats only need to win one out of every five toss up seat that that's that's a pretty big deal I guess actually I take that back into the bathroom Republicans he'd when I'm for it yeah Republicans he'd win four and five ... five basically um\nSo yes yeah that's right Republican they'd win four or five different as he went to had a five\nAnd this is the odds are for the Denver or they have an easier hill to climb that doesn't mean they're going to be able to do it and it's things like this a caravan that make it harder for the Democrats consider will hurt in Texas will hurt as a Republican congressmen and Texas has district went for Hillary Clinton\nHe is winning will hurt is winning because he established his own brand before President Trump and did not get his brand muddied by President Trump and on top of that his voters many of whom support Hillary Clinton the majority of whom support Hillary Clinton\nSupport him on this border issue he's taking a a firm stance on the border issue\nHe is soft on immigration he is very much in favor of amnesty in and weaker\nAnd the president but he's taken a very firm stand on we as a sovereign nation need to be able to secure our border and that's working with him with these voters\nAnd that's problematic for Democrats then you had the situation in to the seat Democrats thought they may be able to pick up Bob Corker seat in Tennessee uh with Phil Bredesen their former last democratic governor of Tennessee\nAnd now British that has come up to the convoys no big deal people should ignore it Marsha Blackburn is playing this up in the last two weeks of the campaign\nThat has a negative issue in Tennessee why I've seen the pulling into the sea immigration among independent and Republican voters in Tennessee is the number one issue a state that is not even close to the border it is the number one issue\nThis is it going to go over well in a place like that\nAre Republicans taking a hard line stance on this caravan is helping them in Missouri Claire McCaskill is floundering black Democrats I did not realize this until the last week or so talking to friends of mine in Missouri black Democrats in Missouri have always been very suspicious of Claire McCaskill\nIn one of the reasons is because during redistricting in two thousand ten\nRepublicans were more accommodating to black Democrats keeping their districts than the Democrats were in Claire McCaskill sided with the Democratic leadership in the state against black Democrats they have not liked her since then she's running her closing ad in Missouri and it's clear is not one of those crazy Democrats will\nBlack Democrats in Missouri are taking offense at this thinking she's talking about them and there is some suggestion out there that black Democrats in Missouri may actually be encouraging black voters to vote for Josh Hawley the Republican attorney general who they've had a good working relationship with\nBecause they don't like Claire McCaskill that's why Nate Silver over at five thirty he puts the Democrats she has an eighty five percent\nTaking back the a house of representatives but only Seventeen percent chance of taking back the Senate\nA Heidi Heitkamp we knew was toast or Claire McCaskill looks like she's toast looks like Martha ... going to win in Arizona and Joe Donnelly now may be hurting in in Indiana the the vote show that race tied which no one expected\nErick Erickson lemons evening news

S. B. twenty four hour news centerfold and President Carter as war he could be a target of the would be mailed bomber as a search or whoever sending these sinister packages is now centering on a death but at specific area our team coverage this hour begins with ABC's Aaron ... multiple\nSources told ABC News authorities are chasing promising leads pointing them to South Florida as a possible origin of at least some of the packages sent this week to prominent Democrats and others the un detonated devices were sent to the FBI lab where they were exploited for clues including DNA and fingerprints\nEssentially what you're doing is you're taking eighty percent of sales tax revenue from sporting goods stores and reserve it for this fund depriving the general fund of this money which ultimately means you're depriving other things of money that you don't necessarily need here\nThere are other ways to fund parks and these sources I mean for example there already conservation ...\nThey're already fees to get into Georgia State parks I I don't think this is necessary and all is going to do is deprive\nOther resources of money and create a slush fund here that you and I both know are going to be abused by legislators and bureaucrats I don't\nThink this is necessary however good intention is for something like this uh the second amendment you will um you confront is one I'm vehemently opposed to and I have a lot of friends who support\nIt uh you should see my text messages in the last week over the second amendment now the second amendment creates a state wide business court in it claims to lower costs enhance efficiency and promote predictable judicial outcome now\nWhat happens here in Georgia we have municipal courts we have state courts we have superior court we have a court of appeals and we have a Supreme Court\nAnd what this would do is create a whole new branch within ... the judiciary a state business cork\nAnd business disputes that are considered complex would go to this court\nAnd the reason they want to do it is basically because they think juries are dumb um and we they want essentially to have special courts with experts decide business issues I have a problem with this and I'll tell you why after we wrap\nThird admitting while WSBIU every over that Seventy five now but if I just wanted to be on our way there and all they have all been an editor back it was like apple\nAnd when he got the automatic three thirty five minutes to an ugly fifty minutes before\nMy problem with this amendment is that it creates a whole new bureaucracy we would create new judges they would need new space that would drive up costs as well um this is supposedly to lower costs is going to increase costs\nAnd frankly if you're worried about a jury not being smart enough to handle this well then we've got bigger problems in the state uh we have a court of appeals and we have a Supreme Court already\nThat a ... issue opinions that direct superior court how to steer these cases superior court need to be able to make the law understandable to an average citizen\nWhat we're essentially saying with this amendment\nIs that we have now created a branch of law business law then only experts in business can navigate that slowly but surely overtime will make business law more and more difficult for your average small businessman to understand\nAnd instead of having to go to a jury of peers that there's a small business issue ultimately are going to go to some experts who are going to railroad small businesses yes I Know the chamber of commerce doesn't talk about it like that\nThe legislators who supported it don't talk about like that but I think ultimately that's what happens you create an entire new bureaucracy an entire new judicial structure and entire new branch within the judiciary and the new complicate laws that ultimately only experts can deal with and the costs are relatively going to go up not go down\nAnytime you have a constitutional amendment like this promising to lower costs to run the other way\nAnd the third amendment is to encourage the conservation sustainability and longevity of George is working for us through tax sub classification in grants now what on earth would this do okay so there are tax classifications\nIn Georgia meaning certain things get tax certain ways uh let me read through this uh one of the things is legit amendment would do is provide that assistance gripped related to forest land conservation used property maybe increased by general all four or five year period\nEnded up to five percent of assistance grants may be deducted and retain by the state revenue commissioner to provide for certain state administrative costs and to provide for the sub classification of qualified your property for advice Lauren taxation purposes now what does all that means that's part of my problem here\nNo one's going to understand what this means number two I'm fairly confident this can be done with state law without having to amend the constitution and number three they should have done a better job of describing this for people or additionally I'm a little bit concerned with treating timberland property for ed Lauren tax purposes different from other property\nAnd which would this would do I realized there are some benefits to the grants but essentially you've got the\nUm you've got the business grant in the amendment number two you've got the farmer granted an amendment number three I Would vote against both of them the one that I have a lean towards supporting them ultimately going to oppose is amendment number four provide rights for victims of crime and the judicial process\nI'll just read this to you as it is\nShall the constitution of Georgia ... was to provide certain rights to victims against whom a crime has allegedly been perpetrated and allow victims to assert such rights\nSounds great it's already the law\nI have a philosophical objection to us amending the constitution to do with the existing law can already do the existing law in Georgia already does this would this would seek to do is put the existing law into the constitution\nNow there's a story behind this law there is a multi millionaire who's been going around the country building up grassroots support for these laws because his family was a victim of crime I Believe his sister was killed by someone if that's right a who was let out of jail and she had no knowledge about it it's a very sympathetic when I Would not shed a tear this past\nBut again it's already state law and philosophically I really don't think we need to amend the constitution to put laws into the constitution\nThat we can do without it because what if there is some unforeseen circumstance in this being part of the constitution\nYou know conservatives aren't always going to control George courts eventually you might get a liberal on there and what will they do with the victims Rights Amendment into the constitution that can't be fixed by future legislature without a two thirds vote of both houses of the legislature and voted the people\nI Would much rather keep this in the law\nThe last one authorizes fear allocation of sales tax proceeds to county and city school district I understand why they want to do this they want to make the the allegation tax allegation better\nNow but again I don't want to amend the constitution for this ah they should have thought of different ways to do this none of these need to be in the constitution there is no desperate need for any of these to be in the constitution\nThey have failed to make the case for all of these there is no major consensus or movement for any of these the business community has a grant the farm community has a grant you got another one with outside money building grassroots support I I just we don't need any of these amendments in the constitution\nWe should not be in a rush to amend our constitution ever\nAnd I think that's what they're trying in the situation I don't like that although I'm not opposed to the victims Rights Amendment I just don't think it's necessary and I'm voting no on all of them [noise]\nErick Erickson you may not always agree with him\nBut you know he's going to spend every day five to seven ... by five and seven you asked me [noise] I
