she had concerns but the sponsors\n... and her her concerns were responded to they were dressed in an amendment to the legislation she could have voted for the legislation every other member of the

so I'm not driving to the airport in tropical storm rain\nNonetheless a more on that in a bit but it so we had this thing with the Democrats know attacking ... let me let me lay out more specific for you\nThey say Brian ... was lax on a massage therapist the owner of a massage therapy group it was actually the regulators it wasn't Brian yup they're him shooting regulators to brand kept because it was the secretary of state's office and they're also misstated the facts you should do\nBut they got to go through a second degree they they got to go through other people to these people screwed up and it was brand keeps fault because they screwed up let me tell you what Stacey Abrams did\nThere is legislation in the state legislature to fight human trafficking in Georgia\n[noise] it would allow jail time for being you know a lot of times it's the women\nAre the ones who are punished in in oftentimes they're actually being held hostage I is this was the reason I ran for office you should understand when I ran for office got elected in two thousand seven and making it was because of all of the Asian the massage parlors in our county or did county at the time and\nI realize they weren't open in the day and they had crowds at night and started\nWondering why and discovered an activist it up in ... county who was having some real thing and and the Justice Department under the Clinton ministry should put out a report in flag a lot of these businesses as French for the Asian mafia conducting human trafficking often with kidnapped women\nWho are put into these places and told us that the Americans will punish them and if they tried to escape their families will be killed by the mob\nIt was terrific and I started working to pass legislation to crack down on human trafficking and Karen Handel in than brand killed were both very very helpful to me trying to make that happen and get that done\nMe why Albert reason the state legislature tried to do a legislative maneuver to actually up the punishments because it I said it was typically the women who are doing it or interest of the the people who are the front for the companies and in rounding up the women do they could walk off and so he passed legislation\nDrafted legislation to punish the traffickers and Stacey Abrams walked off the floor to avoid voting for it and she said it was because she didn't like the mandatory minimums in the legislation\nWill Bert Reeves work to address her concerns and she walked off the floor second time so she wouldn't have to look for it\nEvery other Democrat in the house of representatives in Georgia was willing to uphold are willing to support legislation to fight human trafficking\nAnd Stacey Abrams wouldn't that's not a two degrees way that's not somebody did something and therefore it's brown gives fault that Stacey Abrams herself\nOpposed legislation to fight human trafficking and she didn't want to be on record opposing it so she just conveniently walked off the floor of the state house when the vote was held and she did it twice\nOne time you could say she had some come up two times that's not a coincidence that is a pattern there she walked off the floor to avoid having to fight that and now here come the Democrats ... Brian ... is going to be the one bad for rape victims and survivors of sexual assault really he's the one who's going to be bad\nI think they may need to reconsider that in this whole talking point\nThat Brian Kemp she may just have something in his closet\nThat's what the Democrats were reduced to hear fear mongering rumor and smear they did it to Brett Kavanaugh\nThere are due to a brand camp and they're just ... every other Republican they can between now and November lying and smearing and making suggestions accusations in the form of suggestion that maybe he's done something to women really really gross\n[noise] Atlanta's evening news very Gary\nNews or militias accurate than be federal five day forecast for the same traffic every six minutes don't you ask me [noise]\nAnd my dining Doug Turnbull at a guy God they're going to divide down that Martin don't highway that grabbing quickly moved to the right shoulder and the mother of all you've done there about a five minute nobody was\nLaying down\nBut I don't drive memorial trying to find a shutdown that earlier what I found on it if I were going to be only about twenty five minutes or do any sort of normal maybe they don't know\nThe port in North on heavy delays from Glen ridge to Northridge and in ways that volume from McFarland parkway at one point when it coming and snow and try to personnel they called him four hundred South Bend you crashed there and had to drive in the right lane and that causes delays on the outside up toward um Northridge as well how's northwest my\n... degrees on peach tree street at five thirty one triple team traffic starts with Doug Trimble\nNobody was about seven minutes mowed down Lino memorial dreidel fire from the clock our\nNumber five you're running on the freeway\nMore than what we all know the University of north wrote\nTo him and he thought he spent you're on the branch makes its ... every memorial drive but not too bad only taking twenty eight minutes right now to make that Ryan how's the ...\nFamily's from Georgia four hundred overpass Roswell road and you came up again north side powers ferry two Seventy five about twenty five minutes if you travel to eighty vida southbound on the outer loop leading I Seventy five down to the west freeway tripled in traffic WSBIU\nPresident Trump to swear in Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh about Ninety minutes from now in Washington Here in Atlanta today these guys aren't open up the votes but they are fired up over Kavanaugh's confirmation\nSilent protest was born in a group chatter metro Atlanta high schoolers Mario ... says Georgia senators Isaacson in Perdue ignored the will of the people are senators wearing really listening to us and they didn't care that there is credible allegations made by Dr Ford fourteen year old Hannah an assault survivor dislikes what Brett Kavanaugh's Senate confirmation means\nIt sends a message from the legislators to young people and kill all survivors that do we do come forward even when we don't kind of Florida are stories don't matter at\nThe Georgia State capitals Veronica wanders ws\nWe've learned today that the limousine which wrecked killing twenty people in New York this weekend had failed inspection it shouldn't even have been on the road that's according to Governor Cuomo today W.
