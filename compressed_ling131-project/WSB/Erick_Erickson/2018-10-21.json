and it's probably lower than that in Georgia I mean we you know we're not known for our voter turnout I mean it's just describing a shame but yeah it is because you know just think about it if you

receive an all cash offer in your home and closing as little as Twenty one days hassle free\nNo showings no open houses no negotiations it's that simple you bypass the market you choose one you want to move things close with confidence\nHere that I just can't wait to dive into it is a actually two surveys one where people said how much do you think you pay in fees financially over your lifetime and people gave him an answer and then they actually drill down and found out what the answer really is\nAnd let me tell you what there is a vast difference between the two so we'll dive into that as well but Hey Chris market pull back over a thousand points from where we were at the beginning of the month\nAnd ah you were talking about it regularly that we are we're on borrowed time with this particular market it does pull back it did\nAnd this is the time when you hear a lot of people and financial shows talking about protection we do that on the show but then the word annuity comes up and then you get your annuity ... out there so why do why don't we take on right at the beginning of the show here\nYeah two weeks ago I'm listening to the radio and there's somebody who believes in self directive a portfolios and has an online trading system\nI'm all for that I Know nothing about it I think it's great if if somebody wants to learn how to trade themselves and get into that and they enjoy it and they're good at it go for it so I'm sure this person's very confident and um [noise]\nI don't know anything about their program but I Would hope they uh teach people well how to manage their own money and there's value in that\nThere is value in paying up front a fee for a course to learn and educate yourself on trading even if you don't use it you can hold your a broker or your advisor accountable but it's when they jump on products\nTo nudge people toward their way of managing money\nWe jump on different products all the time so I'm not saying that's that's not appropriate I'm not a big fan of mutual funds we said on the show all the time\nI'm not a big fan of bond funds right now at all but at least we are pretty diligent rainy I think in coming with fact behind the flaws inside of mutual funds and the risks of bond funds right now but I don't know why these other advisors and I'm assuming he's an advisor in licensed up\nDon't do the research on what a new what he's doing what they don't do I mean there are some clear things that I just have to\nBring to the audience in case they are hearing some of these things out there that are absolutely wrong me he says during the show you selling you what they have in their inventory meeting Wall Street will sell you a new new witty because they have it in inventory\nI don't have any annuities and in the story and we sell annuities I could sell zero\nThis year I could sell as many as the clients demand but we don't hold them an inventory we don't buy them and resell them so I don't understand what he's insinuating there he said you can create that same annuity\nThrough his online trading\nOf course well that's interesting you don't like annuities why would you want to create one but\nThen he [laughter] he drives a parallel to creating a bond fund is what he eventually says he says well you could create a bond fund that'll get you five to six percent return with very\nLow low low risk three low as well I jumped all over that if you pull up mourning stars report of bond funds let's take a look at long term bond funds\nThey're down by four point nine five percent for the year I don't call that low low low risk so\nAnd annuity a fixed indexed annuity you cannot lose your principal based on the market\nPeriod he's saying low low low I'm going to create an annuity for your through my course well that's not a fixed indexed annuity I mean in a variable annuity as sub accounts which I'm not a big fan of to begin with but that's in the market\nHe goes on and on annuities have high fees so he says you can do this without\nLoads or commissions well no client\nHas ever paid me a load or a commission on an annuity so I mean we can get annuities that are have zero fees Randy and they have income riders on them\nAnd they have home care writers on them so he goes on and on and on and I don't know if he's talking about older versions of annuities that haven't been around for a while or variable annuities\nBut folks when the market's getting this violent looked for products that have protection and income what has the most protection and the most income out there one of them\nTo research would certainly be a fixed indexed annuity with an income writer secure your income base protect your principal against any market losses\nAnd pull back a little bit from trying to get that hundred percent rate of return that we've been seeing from the Amazon and Netflix and some of those other individual stocks I don't understand why they're not doing their research or may be\nFixed index annuities are getting so much attention to the market's going to pull from who they're trying to market to I mean I don't want to say that the reason that he's pointing toward indexed annuity but he said\nHe's pointing not to buy an indexed annuity buddy saying I can build you want and you can't build the one he's selling you bond fund in a bond fund to lose money as interest rates go up\nWell one of the things that mom always said consider the source and ah you you know if\nYou consider the message and who the message is coming from and always tested under those means what advantage does that person have to say what they're saying to you and does it work to their advantage to push you away from one place to another and that's you know that's the whole fiduciary conversation that we've had many many times so\nUh at this time when the market starts doing funky things you're going to hear an awful lot of talk about protection and you're going to have people\nPreaching against it so they're usually Wall Street people who are preaching against it it's they hang in there it'll all be okay right\nYeah and I think look my message to our audience is always this the more good solid asset classes and approaches to managing your portfolio retirement the better I mean they don't want to get out of control you don't want high risk investments nearing or in retirement in that red zone\nBut if you want to trade some of your own money\nTo not have an annual advisory feet there's value in that we are going to talk about fees later in the show as you pointed out look if you're in engaged investor and you want to learn about it and you want to trade your own account and they have a great program I'm all for my clients and bracing that but\nWhen you wall yourself off to insurance products and say no way no life insurance no annuities we're not going to worry about long term care we're just going to trade around it and that's your hundred percent model\nLook I just disagree with it and I don't think it's very responsible for these guys to be throwing the scare tactics into their shows when they don't have the facts right that's the scary\nPart you should look at all the tools that are available out there and right now if you are a little confused because you looked at your account and it down and you're getting that much closer to retirement and you say I like this\nThat's a great place for you to start the conversation\nAnd you should question everything you should look at everything that's available and you should have more than one opinion so we're asking you to maybe take our opinion and compare it to where you are have whatever you are listening to right now give us a call and ask us for the retirement roadmap\nThis is what we offer you a radio list or this is going to give you a look at where you are right now it's going to give you kind of that that fly over where is your money where are you putting it\nHow

shows they're there for you you can also find out what Chris does on TV on Sunday Morning so an awful lot there on the website and make sure you're cruising around there at unleash your money dot com alright here's my\nMy great story of the week love this we've heard of the people at Harris the Harris Poll people so in June the Harris Poll people went out and they asked\nPeople on the street how much do you think you will pay in financial fees over your lifetime\nAnd so when you think about that ATM fees for when Kay fees IRAs a brokerage fees a savings account checking add it all up over your lifetime and the number that came back on the average people said oh a couple of thousand dollars two thousand\nTwo thousand two hundred dollars is what would the average answer was over a lifetime over a lifetime [laughter]\nOkay yeah you laugh okay so are these people at nerd wallet looked at that and said well\nWhy don't we find out exactly what that number is so they added up all those fees over a year and then put it over a lifetime and the number really is folks more like\nThree hundred and sixty nine thousand dollars mile and a lot of money that's a big difference there ... are you surprised that people said so low and the number is so high\nYeah if you if you take a look at the banking organizations investment banks advisors mutual funds I mean you have to know what your fees are and you need them to be up front on your statements you can look at it manually\nYou need them to be disclosed to you up front before you buy any of these products you know the day is a front end loads and back in ... should be over\nBut you don't want to have fees on top of the so when the investment world one of the biggest concerns that I have with the way a lot of people are managing their money that come to see me the first time is they're paying an advisory fate and then that advisor hands that money off to somebody else and they take a ... well who's managing the money here\nSo there's no reason and advisor can't manage your investments\nSpecifically pick the investments that worked best for you and your portfolio and your family needs and your risk profile\nAnd advise you on building the overall plan and that that world has to come together it can't be somebody may and just the money and get to see somebody managed to plan gets a fee\nAnd on and on and on so you want to ask what the fees are you want to be to be fully disclose do you want him to be simple and you want your advisor accountable you want to know that you're setting benchmarks for performance and that that\nAdvisor on the portfolio they've built enough they manage is exceeding meeting or exceeding the benchmarks that you've set for them that has to happen\nSo Chris their retirement road map that is one thing that you do I know that you do a four O. one K. analysis and you will take a look in there what are you paying for having vis a stock fund this index fund this bond fund this this annuity whatever it is within that four O. one K. or within that IRA what are those fees and what does it add up to\nYeah we'll do a really deep dive in and set out all the fees and I mean one of the easiest things for any investor to do is pull it up on any of the financial Web sites and look for something called an expense ratio now that's only part of the fees and mutual funds 'cause they're unstated fees out there which will give you an estimate on\nBut you can see whether you're paying a lot or a little right out of the gate and then you'll have four one K. management fees et cetera so we've got to take all of those things into effect they eat away at your portfolio I mean that type of three hundred and sixty nine thousand dollars\nThere is in sees what is that equate to in last opportunity as well and a million dollars over your lifetime yeah so that's not being re invested in compounded it's being put into somebody else's pocket and they get to use it to compound now you want your\nFinancial professionals to be paid they can't they don't work for free but you want to get something in return you want to be hitting your benchmarks are exceeding your benchmarks you want higher levels of performance when the market's going up and higher levels of performance when the market's going down those are critical\nWell one of the things that I've set in the past and I think it's really important to do and that's visualize your money as a pile of money on your kitchen table these are your assets that you've been saving your entire life if somebody comes in and grabs twenty thousand dollars you chase him out the door\nThe restores the poor blood flow causing you read e for more information does against wave bucket dot com\nThat gains wave bucket dot com or

for nine zero eight eight eight is our number if all of this is kinda got you bothered and you want to have a free look\nAt where you are right now and develop what we call a retirement roadmap give us a call or advisor on the line right now for all for nine zero\nEight eight eight where you can text the word road map to the same number for all for nine zero eight eight eight well we're trying to hang onto our money Chris but another\nConcern that a lot of people have is I Want to make sure my money last so here's this study that was done just recently mom and dad have put together some money and they want to pass it on to junior so what are the chances that junior will hold on to the money the chances are Seventy percent\nThen he'll go through all the money what about if it goes down to the grand kids the chances are Ninety percent\nThat that money will be gone by the time it gets to the grandkids a Christie you see this have you seen the money go away that that you know that that person you worked with really wanted to go down to the air's\nYeah unfortunately it does happen a lot and it mostly it's a mistake that's made with retirement assets meaning your IRA four O. one K. those those type of non tax up until you reach Seventy and a half\nAnd you've got to start taking distributions your kids get anxious and they make mistakes they'll pull the money out and park it's somewhere and start using it and realized hoops I've got a tax bill to pay because I've liquidated all of this\nAnd now I've got to pay taxes so you take a chunk and you spend it and then you've got to take another chunk and pay taxes on it and it where there is pretty quickly you know\nYou have to put some planning into this you have to have stretch IRAs you can do restricted beneficiary forms folks there aren't financial institutions out there that will allow you to distribute these assets without putting them in a trust or complicated it is state plan\nAnd pay it out to your ears over time\nYou know stretch IRAs with our indies things that you should look at or yes you can do the the other side which is you can poked put together a full estate planning with trust but then you've got to have a trusting and somebody's got to manage it and that's expensive at times where if it's a family member it's extremely hard on them I find\nTo manage that if you have kids that are a little anxious to get their hands on that money so\nIt is an important part of what we do for clients it's not just all about investments although those are important it is about the planning side and if you do want to leave a portion of ... of it to your heirs\nWe can start talking about those conversations as well I don't think that life insurance doesn't play a big part into it's extremely important to consider life insurance you know most people by their term insurance let it expire once the kids are grown and on their own\nWell that doesn't cover final expenses upon death it doesn't help the beneficiaries clean up the state\nAnd you might be forced to sell some of that IRA asset\nAnd then get taxed on it and it starts to spiral and we don't want to give the money to the government\nWe don't want to have the kids waste it on things that maybe they should buy over time versus all in one fell swoop so um we do a lot of that planning with clients and we engage some of the top tax attorneys out there to to help us whether\nIt's another version of protecting your money I mean we talk about protecting your money against the market against inflation against all these different things but this is another protecting your money against Uncle Sam and against you know bad decisions by your kids you know and and I mean then there's always here son here's the manila envelope\nIn case I Do I find this in the health and write and draw my desk at my father calls it the ... music or is well you know it was All right\nI'll tell you I'll give you an example of a high net worth

investing as managing your own money a lot of people out there the average guy who's working for corporate America or the lady who's you know\nWork it out by the corporate ladder you know they have four one K. is they have maybe some old four one K. they moved to ... raise the average person's not managing their own money and that's paramount when it comes to having long term success in the financial markets let's take a moment let's talk about what that means really to self directed self manage\nWell the problem is many people don't they they're sophisticated enough demand you're on Monday 'cause Wall Street has I'm convinced of that and they they think it's way too complicated and it's really not a hard process which you understand it\nThe key thing is is is if you don't learn how to control your own money then you're going to have money under management are going to pay exorbitant fees it's amazing that\nAnd the average four one K. people will pay over a hundred and fifty thousand dollars in fees over the course of a twenty five year four one K. think about that folks hundred and fifty grand goes to some Wall Street firms some entity\nGoldman Sachs citadel UPS CIA craft there those trust you have your phone K they they wrote the charter they wrote the prospect is\nAnd you pay them and you pay them whether you make money or not the only guaranteed return your phone case the fees that you pay here's the problem most you don't understand the fees 'cause you sign the paperwork with the lord you\nWith the match the company match so when you sign up for the four one K. they offered you the company match you went whoa that's free money chip it's not free money because now you're going to have to basically put your money into a position where somebody's going to manage it you got to pay a hundred and fifty thousand dollars or more in fees over twenty five years and you can only make money in one direction\nThink about that you bought that you you you were all in and the reality is is is those fees are going to crush your ... your long term profitability they're going to hurt you badly overtime and what we see is that when people learn the skills of self directly you take that bucket of money yourself\nAnd there's not a complicated process to do this you can learn the skills of self directing and you can profit regardless of direction and you don't have to pay those fees which long term gives you a much better chance of hitting those financial goals\nWell and that's the key it's long term being able to set up a plan that's going to be able to work for you now be able to work for you later and ultimately get you to where you want to be chipped there's a lot of people out there if you ask them one day when you want to retire and their answers now like well what are you doing now to get ready for retirement and the thing they're doing nothing there's this\nThere's working well the average American is way short financially I've ever been able to retire at their current standard of living see that's the real issue\nAnybody can retire but can you retire at the lifestyle that you currently live the lifestyle you want to live\nAnd the real problem is the biggest issue with the baby boomer generation is that they're worried about run out of money before they die so the system that you're in for one k.'s managed diaries has you worried about run out of money before you die now I have students at all I ... that's been six to ten hours a month managing their own nest egg they manage their own IRA\nAnd they make decisions in that and those decisions are built around trying to make one percent a month thinking about that if you can make one percent a month with a mock goes up to our side we can do that consistently over time you put that compound and calculator it gets powerful\nAnd the problem is is that many people can't make one percent among because the market goes down they don't profit they lose they needed to go up for them to profit and ultimately because of all of this turns in price of the marketing these fees they never hit the goals\nSelf directing learning the skills to take control that bucket is essential to long term success and more and more people we're seeing this Adam\nAre coming out of the woodwork saying I Need to learn how to control my own money because the mass of my account says I'm going to run out of money before I die the Math Doesn't work and I need to change the formula and you know that former means no chain that formula means\nSelf directing taking control that bucket and making the decision just self 'cause who cares more about your money then you you should be in control of it you should be making those decisions and ultimately you could add those long term goals if you get the consistency and that kind of ... mostly returned that we're focused on\nThat's key the long term goal that long term goals are gonna separate you from the masses online training academy
