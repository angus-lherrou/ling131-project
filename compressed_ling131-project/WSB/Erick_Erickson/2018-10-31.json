I haven't confirmed Oprah\nI'm Brock Obama for sure coming friday for Stacey Abrams in the metro Atlanta area and the vice president is campaigning with Brian Kemp as well that that is the story\nAs I Know it it is campaign up show\nI'm ready for the debate to be ready for the campaign to be over a that reminds me I've got early voting turnout a numbers and let me where is this yes I Am told by reliable third parties sources\nThat Republicans are not turning out at the strength they should be in early voting in the following counties whole Cherokee bar to Walton Brian which field in Camden county is a there is good Republican turnout\nBut it is not as high as it should be for comfortably patting the margins a whole Cherokee bar to Walton Brian would feel Camden county\nI suspect we're still going to see a um campaign with a definitive winter a new runoff\nA indebted will be Brian Kemp but they're trying their best to ensure no run off and that's basically what this is if Republicans don't show up at the rate they need to show up in early voting\nWe're probably going to have a runoff so particularly if you're in whole Cherokee bar to altered Brian wood field or Camden county you got to move things alone so that we don't have a runoff I really don't want to run off\nAnd I know that a musher performed very well during the election season so maybe I should want to run off so everybody's still listens but I don't I'm ready for this to be over I Am ready for it to be over just like many of you are probably ready for traffic to be done let's go check on it [noise]\nI think we are defined or do you know but you I mean we got only a lot of that ad got edited out on Monday morning all dropped off to the right they finally got to put in about an hour to get there\nAnd then all the way\nIt would if I\nWant to get about ... nobody extra twenty died over an hour to go around twenty five votes because they're below the airport in North of me like I\nGot a check from a

and they have\nAll day dodge balls tournament basically to celebrate reformation day now I hear that back in the early days of the school when it was very very heavily Protestant um they would have the papers and the anti papers just the ... teams but they abandoned that\nBefore my kids got their nonetheless okay\nSo we've got other new Stacey Abrams was actually supposed to be on uh the morning news yesterday for thirty minutes and had to cancel she has a scheduling conflict\nThe view asked her to come on and she decided she would go beyond the view well she made some news that is only just now really trickling out she not only wants to ban a are fifteens in Georgia but she wouldn't deny that she wants to confiscate them this is her conversation with Meghan McCain on the view\n... weapons of mass destruction like the air has came along civilian hand\n[noise]\nI shot in pain and I think you probably have hair and while it's an amazing amount of power it also is an amazing amount of destruction and ours is very little that can be dying hiring vulnerable communities when the air that\nAre present your honesty and I asked down pat by banning I Would be rounding up on top of\nAround ... percent of all you ... when they be rounding up from ... that\nWe we have had a ban on assault weapons the fourteen states and I think we should do it again I think there has to be a conversation about how it's accomplished because we have to recognize that this is a national conversation\nThere you have it\nSo if we're breaking this down a you've got Stacey Abrams saying that ... the most popular gun in the country is in a are Fifteen a hour does not stand for assault rifle country and what so many Democrats thinking stands for arm a light\nI'm a are fifteens or the most popular or guns in the country sixty percent of rifles in this country or a are fifteens or derivatives zero and you know what it was she says there's a lot of power they are Fifteen that's not actually true ask any hunter um about hunting\nAnd you will find that the IRR Fifteen isn't necessarily their favorite gun to go I mean for deer hunting in particular not their favorite got I've got an air fifty I've from being a fence I Love my are Fifteen\nAnd initial making McCain follows it up with a question of would you confiscate exist you know if you're going to ban them are you going to confiscating existing guns you will know she\nDid not say no she did not see yes but she did not say no\nShe wants a conversation\nAbout it well conversations or the way you you get around this without actually saying yes I Want to round up all the guns now it wouldn't happen I don't think the Democrats going to take the Georgia legislature but it'd be a big issue\nHere you have a Democrat and now it's exposing just how bad she says she tries to say I'm a I'm a Second Amendment supporter and my dad's a hunter and we got him uh we got him a gun\nCabinet and on and on and on she says the interview uh but that no one needs an air Fifteen but ... the thing that ... the thing that really gets me here is she calls it a weapon of mass destruction\nWeapons of mass destruction\nAny weapon in the hands of the wrong person can be a weapon of mass destruction airplanes were a weapon of mass destruction on September eleventh knives have been a weapon of mass destruction in various parts of Europe Eighteen wheelers had been weapons of mass destruction\nA hand guns had been a are Fifteen to have been all sorts of weapons and non weapons have been weapons of mass destruction\nI'm Stacey Abrams is a very nice person who is very\nVery very smart\nShe is you may not like her but don't discount or she's very polished she's very good on the stump\nOh she is a very nice person ... I still say she's one of the best interviews with anybody of either party I've done the past year self deprecating very smart um gave very good answers to questions but she's also very very progressive and this is another reminder of just how progressive she is she wants\nTo ban a are Fifteen and she won't\nDeny she was given the opportunity tonight and that's the important thing for those years she numbers as you want to do she was\nGiven the opportunity to deny it and she did not deny it she said she wants to have that conversation too radical to beat Georgia governor\nEric ... lemons evening news who is a guy I Love the information you need to use them and every night on Ninety five five AM seven especially Adler evening news is sponsored by ... business [noise] five aiming\nAre below the guy got to do like the guys are not many anyway near there probably Dr ... jump on my work and I wanted to know what am I wrote to anybody about it you're more\nLikely to get it all over the five out of the area and we go\nTo the gym out of the Sandy Springs heading toward Roswell four hundred north bound difficult transition through the ... find interchange clearing the springs Marta station heavy as you leave Roswell north of ... bridge wrote those delays continue to Peachtree parkway seeing delays flight delays approaching highway twenty incoming mark arum northwest shop\nOn Seventy five steel jam del grow down to ... five interchange ...

now go part of the really rough pretty much\nI don't want to start to patrol once again\nIt's things are just getting silly out there now I'm a let me give you an overview of where we are\nWith the campaigning as I told your democratic early voting is beginning to surge just starting to scare Republicans last week Democrats were very nervous and this week it's Republicans because the Democratic early voting numbers in Florida Georgia\nTexas although not significantly Texas or in Indiana Nevada in Arizona are beginning to surge significantly it's like somebody flipped the switch and all these people are now showing up at the polls\nAnd Republicans are freaking out and part of me wonders I it's two Machiavellian don't think anyone is two brilliant to pull this off but part of me is wondering\nIf Democrats kind of set back\nWanted to see what Republicans had and now that they monitor that for a week and I said okay here's what we gotta do let's let's get this going and they're going to do it this week one thing to keep in mind is there's a really bad weather planning on coming through tomorrow in friday so you're going to want to stick with us\nAnyway or for your weather in your traffic over the next forty eight hours but it it just it's it's interesting to see the way the turnout game as playing\nNow let's go see if we can turn down the trafficking get your home\nWe are trying to get in turn down buddy as I get ready for years they called it the I got one over the neighborhood and I'm getting out and about and that would be a reminder believe they're done Dr threatened to put it in the\nArea I just say they're just trying to protect people out there on if you're ready to go to many there are no\nNobody around I don't know about thirty to thirty five minutes or just wander around you know what\nI Do have to say I'm One area where Stacey Abrams a has actually been able to pull it off is in getting new voters to go vote she's done a fairly good competent job of getting a lot of newer voters out now ah\nHe even Bobbie who listens to the shows the earlier today sit me a link to something put on um\nSocial media that ... and the numbers fairly well match exactly uh what I'm seeing from other people one point six million people have voted I'm eating is I'm twenty three thousand three hundred forty six non voters voted that is people who are registered to vote but they never actually vote\nThey've been mobilized a Ninety three thousand three hundred eighty eight newly registered voters or have voted twenty nine thousand two hundred eighty seven\nA swing voters have voted and so you definitely have a large number he will turn out the other one is ed general only voters\nVoters who only vote in general elections they don't vote in primary so we have no idea\nHow these people lean that two hundred fifty nine thousand six hundred Seventy six um if you just take heart ours and heart disease\nA hardy as someone who votes Democrat all the time and a hard Republican someone who votes Republican all the time Democrats lead a four hundred and eighty nine thousand to Republican four hundred eighty thousand or roughly twenty has was but um you have solved ours and and here's the kicker\nWell the reason you have it so ... salt ours in ... solve these heavy mix record the trend Democrat\nUm they're only eighty one thousand of those here's the kicker for the Republicans you have a hundred sixty three thousand six hundred fifty one solved Republican voters for Brian Kemp right now no one why does that matter well because we're the ... campaign tried to get their vote\nOutside of Atlanta they're not writing off Atlanta but they know that is we're Stacey Abrams a base of operations is that is that the more liberal area of the state so they've gone down to\nMore rural and suburban areas of the state uh south divide twenty and then into very north Georgia and they're trying to boost those levels there are some of those counties\nThat Donald Trump won by eighty percent and they've already had more people vote early voting this go round then voted total in twenty sixteen think about that for a minute\nBut here's the kicker wire there's so many more saw Republicans than soft Democrats well in a lot of these south Georgia areas your local elections have Democrats so if you're voting for sheriff you've got to vote in the Democratic primary\nYou vote for district attorney you got to vote in the Democratic primary like Democrats it for the jury county often runners Republicans because the Republicans are so dominant down there will down in South Georgia\nOr Republicans often voted Democrat so if you want to vote for the Denver Republican you actually have the Democratic primary those are your soft Republicans that they've got a mixed record but the trend Republican they give money to Republicans\nSo we know they're Republicans but in primaries in presidential years for sheriff in in district attorney in in court clerk and whatnot they got to vote in the Democratic primary\nAnd the fact that there aren't that many salt Republicans turning out a is a clear indication that the camp strategy of turning out rural and suburban voters south of I twenty in in upper north northwest Georgia\nThen that's working um they still got to turn out more of their numbers are are slightly depressed now and we're seeing a huge democratic wave in the last week the the bomber last week\nAnd the church shooting really has inspired people in the Democratic side every Republican I've talked to a scene a dip in the polling after last week although most of them are starting to rebound by now um but it's a big issue and Republicans have to get out there and vote\nThey fundamentally do 'em right now what early voting shows me in Georgia is that this is a tight race\nAnd if there isn't it advantage I Do believe can't pass the advantage or while ... may have Oprah Winfrey and Brock Obama remember Brock Obama has a history of showing himself not to be able to turn out voters for someone else\nDonald Trump is not yet proven although there is some evidence she has a better time turning out his voters to vote for other people that Obama does turn out his voters should look for other people so you got the vice president and Oprah Winfrey all going to be around tomorrow campaigning for separate candidates the vice president in North Georgia Augusta in Savannah and then the president on\nSunday I think that probably helps skip enough mobilizing keep his base mobilized but we'll all find out on Tuesday I actually think I may try to broadcast my show from the kill a victory headquarters on Tuesday night we're trying to work that out that would be a lot of fun\n[noise] Atlanta's evening
