seventeenth was Seventy five thousand one hundred and five people\nNine thousand two hundred twenty four of these are pending because the person registered to vote before they're Eighteen and the secretary of state will roll him over to act to voters when they become Eighteen you can register to vote under George law when you're Seventeen and a half years old and then you become an active

Security number verification\nWas approved by the Obama administration and Eric Holder as a way to determine if someone was legitimate voter you what you have to what you can do in Georgia is you can

fourteen Stacey Abrams group New Georgia project registered\nEleven thousand twenty four people\nAnd they screwed up the paperwork including the Social Security number\nThat's not the secretary of state's fault that Stacey Abrams fault and they're trying to make it his fault that is the information has come today from the secretary of state's office they have concluded their investigation\nInto these is fifty three ... thousand people who were allegedly placed on the pending voter file and that's it's Seventy five percent of them do not exist twenty three percent of them came from Stacey

voters\nThe lawsuit specifically asked for Georgia to count all provisional ballots even if they were flagged as non citizens\nThat's pretty absurd but you know you you got to go back to the Associated Press report is the Associated Press reports at fifty three thousand and it turns out it's not fifty three thousand it's it's forty seven deaths\nAnd the ... the person the Associated Press cited as being a victim of this is a registered voter who's an active voter she's not even on the pending less\nDepending list I mean it just so you understand what the pending list is the pending
