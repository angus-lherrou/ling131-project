FBI Director says this week's events or no hoax no stake no political trick\nTwo one two girls in middle school in central Florida have been arrested at eleven year old and a twelve year old there were waiting in a bathroom plenty to overpower Fifteen elementary school students killed them with knives and drink their blood\nThey describe themselves as Satan worshipers they were going to drink the blood and eat the flush of the students they killed before committing suicide\nThey had been plotting it for a week CNN has the story right now I'm this in Florida\nUh the reason I bring up this story before I bring up the bombing his because we\nAre going to has a probably a week of handwringing in the media over the president's political rhetoric\nAnd the reality is we are a sick society right now with or without Donald Trump is president ah there are awful things happening we have an eleven and twelve year old girl in a middle school in Florida\nWho have declared themselves Satan worshipers and a smuggled into school knives and pizza cutters to uh do what they were planning on doing and\nA people want to worry about the president's rhetoric or\nGot to tell you this has become an increasing frustration over the last ah forty eight Seventy two hours of mine um I\nActually encountered a democratic political activists earlier today who had no idea who James Hodgkinson or ... or ... was the gentleman who went into the family Research Council Washington D. C.\nAnd decided he was going to gunned them all down and shoved their mouths full of chick fillet because he was gay rights activist and they were a anti gay according to the Southern Poverty Law Center\nFloyd James Hodgkinson of course a attempted masses as a nation of Republican members of Congress\nLast year after listening to Bernie Sanders speeches that Republicans ah we're going to kill millions of people but let's talk about the president's rhetoric or I I think it's ridiculous\nUh the fact is I have said on this program and elsewhere repeatedly I think the president\nProbably should reconsider the way he talks about some of these subjects but I Do not think the president is the cause of any of this we are a six society\nAnd this other story and what is it about Florida too it's a Florida Man who did this you got the for the girls doing this at a school\nIt's just ridiculous and the president of the United states spoke a just a short time ago leaving the White House and of course reporters are enraged right now by his comments listened to the president\nWell I think I'd been tone down you want to know that if I could really telling it up because as you know the media has been extremely unfair to me and\nThe Republican Party I think the media's been very very unfair in terms of the Republican Party and the way it's been covered and they understand that\nThey write articles about that many of them admit that but the media has been unbelievably unfair to Republican conservative and certainly to me but with all of that being said we're winning so I like that make you very much effect\nThat was the president deporting the White House was short time ago a on the south lawn of White House and he he may told up the rhetoric not toned down the rhetoric Nell let's go to some traffic rhetoric would do if you're\nTrying to get out but it's not the game right now by their hand do you ask me what you mean\nLike ... million by by the way down out of over forty

York\nThank you very much now Christopher Wray\nI'm Glad he said this at the press conference because you know we we went from ... until I got to say I've got some really good friends in and out of the media\nWho when the story broke immediately went to this is a false flag I mean very Alex Jones conspiracy the idea that these people who aren't very bright were somehow smart enough to concocted elaborate conspiracy\nWhere they targeted themselves or other progressive with explosives are fake bombs\nTo mobilize democratic ... the Democratic base\nUh I I have said since ... this this story broke two days ago now that it was more likely to be a a massively mentally unstable person\nOr a trickster from four channels on the Internet who are doing this as opposed to progressive doing it too progressive and the sad part of it honestly is I Know when you know that no matter what facts there are there are people who are going to believe\nThat this was some progressive activists doing this I've seen people this afternoon say oh well look at the wrapping on his on his band it's clearly two new he must have actually done this in the last forty eight hours\nTo prepare for this so he could make all conservatives look bad no I mean the problem with this defensiveness from people and making this excuses is you and I both through the media is looking for every excuse to blame conservatives\nAnd the president for these sorts of things as opposed to these um mentally whacked out people who do these things so I'm Glad that Christopher Wray\nSaid this in his press conference because of the ... the latest spin from folks who have been telling the falls like is it will these weren't really bombs uh this was all fake here's Christopher Reddy\nIdeas from Thirteen IDs for

not hoax devices [noise]\nThey're not hoax devices a they were devices capable of exploding\nLet's focus on the frustrating part though most of you listening or conservative I'm a conservative and it is I'm going to be on meet the press on Sunday and I expect it to um be a little more rock is the normal over this point\nThe media six seats on the president and the president's tone\nThey gave him three billion dollars in free coverage during the campaign they largely helped get President Trump elected by covering him as if he was the president including a live viewing of the landing of the Trump seven fifty seven everywhere he went\nAnd now they're upset with the guy all they have to do is stop covering his tweets\nBut they don't want to do that because the president targets them and he knows he can get free air time from the media and in fact I think the president a smart enough to understand that when he attacked the media the media goes nuts and helps the president prove his point about biased these in the media\nThere's a story out today that Michael ...\nHas um the potentially withheld information or altered information\nHe's been referred to the department of justice for criminal prosecution alone with Julie sweating if we'll get to the story but NBC News knew this three weeks ago and said nothing until Chuck Grassley announced it to the world and send it to the department of justice they did not correct the story\nThe president understands the way media bias works we did not have these conversations after James Hodgkinson tried to mass assassinate Republican members of Congress we did not have these conversations after Hillary Clinton said we can't be civil\nWe did not have these conversations after you're a colder said when Republicans go low kick them\nWe did not have these conversations after the mass rice and attacks last week done by a progressive activists targeting Republicans and members of the military we only have this conversation now because a a improvised explosive device\nWent to CNN to address to James Brennan\nInto a bunch of other progressive\nIf the media only wants to have these conversations when these things happen and they blame the president will then they're telling half of America that the attacks that happened on your side really do matter\nAnd how can they didn't blame that side for not trusting not believing in not wanting to be involved with the American media you got to do it when both sides do it there are crazies on both sides except you'd never know that from the media coverage\n[noise] Harry Carey

lot of these spirits really did want to get their kids out of harm's way\nAnd so while there may be thousands of people with ...\nHeaded this way there are some people in the caravans who really do just want to get their kids to the United states for a better life now you can say they shouldn't be here they should be rounded up they should go home those are all valid arguments but I Do think that this is a sign that the parents really\nLoved their children enough to want to abandon them into the United states to give them a better life uh that they couldn't give them in their home countries that are all third world clip talker sees a\n... I just [noise] it's sad but we've got these kids who need to be taking care of or they need to be deported and now we've got more people coming the president is sending eight hundred soldiers to the border he\nIs considering shutting down the border altogether no one will be allowed across except preexisting American citizens coming home or he will not allowing people seeking refuge she will be signing an executive order they need to force the issue you you realize I I Hope that one of the the reasons they're being incentivized to come\nIs because a liberal federal court judge\nAnd the Obama administration actually begin with the Clinton Administration and then the Obama administration ... retool do entered into a consent decree\nThat essentially requires that if people come across the border saying they want refuge in this country we have to take them there's a federal court order in Congress could deal with it but Congress has refused to deal with it\nAnd it sounds like the president's can Syrian executive order say in tough forget the consent decree and we're going to do this or\nThe vice president which New Mexico today and had some pretty strong words about this caravan or we will get to that but first let's get Doug Turnbull if\nThey weren't going to be damned area by your next well do you mean lame right at the current over five out of there but more of an ad for nobody was getting really thick as well\nOr through for him when he rode on the onus murder that's going to be about Seventeen and Eighteen minutes from the Seventy five twenty or twenty and then again for the national memorial\nThank you very much I'm a I'm going to play this audio from vice president Pence speaking earlier today in New Mexico about the caravan\nAs President Trump said earlier this week it is nothing short of an assault on our country\nAnd he said today and I say myself to those in the\nCaravan turn around we are not going to allow you to answer\nAim in I\nThink that the president needs to force the issue of this consent decree and perhaps his lawyers are telling him that if he forces through in ...\nTicket of order sing shut down the border no one's allowed in at all even claiming refugee status\nThat we can get this to the Supreme Court we need to figure out a way to get rid of this ... degree heat is what does he incentivizing these people coming into the United states again there's a consent decree that the Clinton Administration started the Obama administration expanded\nA in a lawsuit with the federal judge in California where in the basic parameters are that if someone comes across the southern border claiming refugee status we are required to take them in and process the refugee claim\nAnd of course a liberal administration was willing to do something like this and ... to\nHurt future administrations\n... because you know the new president or Congress can bind to future president if he's your Congress so one president cannot make an executive order and prohibit a future president from repealing it Obama could not sign an executive order and then make it so\nDonald Trump couldn't undo it down from ... to do any executive order does a President Obama did\nAh one Congress cannot pass a law and say the next Congress can't repeal that law you can't find it but so what the Clinton and the Obama administration's did is they went to federal court and they had a federal judge buying the president\nOne branch of government can bind another branch of government under the separation of powers and that's what they did\nAnd now these illegal aliens are taking advantage of this and by the way we now know the Washington Free beacon is reporting that the guy who helped organize this caravan is a man who is on record I forget his name he he's a he's a Central American political activists who\nBelieves that there should be no such thing as a border\nThat we're all one people and people should be able to migrate wherever they want to migrate and he's the guy who is organizing this the president needs to stop this caravan hideous fascinating to me\nHow with this ah improvised explosive device situation the media has all but a band in discussions of this caravan and the reason is because politically polling shows it as helping Republicans you want to know the latest polling that will blow your mind\nThe New Jersey Senate races now a toss up\nNow that actually has nothing to do with the caravan and has to do with Bob Menendez who's a crook a and New Jersey voters know it they're not sure they want to send him back\nUh but other races are more and more becoming less competitive for Democrats take Tennessee Phil Bredesen just the other day said that this caravan is no big deal\nThat we don't have to worry about the security and it's not a national security threat ah Marsha Blackburn is making sure everybody into this he knows about this and bill Bryson's campaign is collapsing\nIn Nevada it's helping Dean Heller the issue of this caravan what to do about it is helping Dean Heller in Missouri it's hurting Claire McCaskill in Indiana it's hurting Joe Donnelly even in West Virginia they're pulling that suggests this caravan and the immigration issue was starting to hurt Joe mansion\nAnd hurt Bill Nelson in Florida this is not an issue for the Democrats and here's the thing I Am really convinced\nThat\nThe people who helped organize this caravan thought it would hurt Donald Trump and the primary reason they thought it would hurt Donald Trump is because if you go back to may when the president started a separating kids from families that was the first time the president's popularity fell with Republican voters\nHe went down from eighty five percent to Seventy five percent popularity with Republicans his popularity opinion ratings in in the various public opinion polling fell below forty percent for the first time in his presidency\nAnd then they rebounded after the situation was resolved\nBut you know what's happening right now the president's popularity is growing up he was an all time high in public opinion polling his real clear politics average for the president's job approval rating is it an all time high is like forty five point seven percent which for this president is a really big deal\nAnd a lot of it has to do with the economy but a lot of it has to do with this caravan people like the fact is taking affirmed line on securing the American border you know among other people who like this\nHispanic and black voters think about that one
