just so firm is so strong and stuff in the next day the water when the war came in houses started floating in front of our home and stuff you know and so um and then once you've seen that didn't everything just went black I mean he couldn't see anything\nAnd the way you want to describe this is everybody gets you all know video games right you all know some like the idea of PowerPoints or maybe in the reverse if a bad guys got a power level and you're trying to beat him down to get that level down and down and down until eventually when you get to zero you've defeated the enemy right\nI Want you to think about your individual morals your individual like\nWhere is your individual\nPoint that if you get pushed past it you're willing to do something negative that's probably anywhere on a scale from zero to a hundred where one hundred\nAbsolutely not no way ever would you do something that was illegal immoral anything that would get you in trouble you wouldn't damage property wouldn't take away any one individual rights to life liberty property health you know\nAnd then it zero is yeah absolutely you don't have a problem going punching somebody blame because you think can be funny\nSo you've got that entire spectrum the way the mob works is when one or two or three individuals are so ginned up so emotional so willing because they have such a low tolerance to handle the motion any way\nThat they are willing to go forward and do the things that the majority of people in a normal civilized society would not do\nBut when they do it let's say your tolerance is out of five maybe you've had a bad life but you're not quite ready to start the mob but hey you have someone else throws rock you might be OK picking one up now that to someone else did it you'll do it\nAnd now you've ... you've set that baseline to maybe a five now anybody this is zero five Seventy feels like okay well they're doing it I'll do it\nBut it creeps up now you're if you're the six but if you're the eight what if you're the ten on that scale of one to a hundred all of a sudden it's like you feel you feel empowered the mob is getting away with acting in a way that you ordinarily by yourself wouldn't do\nWell listen you put a whole bunch of like minded people around you and all of us in that sense of logic and reason goes away I already had somebody say well you know called the Tea Party weren't they a mob didn't they gather\nThe problem is you got no real footage of Tea Party members visibly attacking people randomly on the streets because they happen to wear a hat that they didn't agree with or ... they didn't agree with that didn't randomly go start trying to a salt people at their homes or at gas stations when to talk more about that but we got to check it would

just over Seventy five is almost twenty minutes word around that takes twenty minutes later and got out of the student body of water and then after they almost an hour around the corner\nAnd I got to look the descriptor of the mob is the same thing you would use for herd mentality or the pack mentality\nIt's it's it's the gang mentality it's what causes people that belong to gangs to act in a way that individually they would probably not be pushed to do what they do but being part of the gang part of the group you lose your individual identity and take on the identity of the mob itself\nIt's always described as how influenced it can ... the mob itself how much of an influence can have on those in which encompasses\nIt's almost always emotional almost always irrational and it is almost always physical it results in something\nPhysical either damage to property damage to individuals a recklessness a complete carelessness for the rule of law UC mobs blocking streets lighting fires there doing damage the end and the mob mentality this could be from winning versus\nThe Superbowl we've seen hysterical fans go mopping the streets\nIt is an actual term and it is a term that basically describes what happens when a group of individuals sole ginned up on a motion\nActs out and is able to influence those around them until it spreads to where you who would probably ordinarily never find yourself calling at the doors of the Supreme Court suddenly you look at your reenacting a scene from the walking dead have you seen the video of the protesters after\nKavanaugh was confirmed sworn in and went to work\nYou see women and men trying to claw their way through the doors and I'm thinking I thought for a second somebody shared a clip from the the the upcoming season

and even in a life threatening in some areas\nSelf identified group of voters and Georgia Stacey Abrams has about a twenty point advantage a sector capital had among men by ten percentage points daycare parents had among women bought eleven percentage points that's down from fourteenth send the last fall\nThere does appear to be some ships predictable to the bump president who's also urged that's received an ... account on confirmation hearings and that's about a plus five or that the neutral down ballot races that are not necessarily known as part of that Jeff Duncan being the GOP nominee inspired to make on the Democratic side\nAre in that forty five forty five so we're looking at about nine percent of the electorate\nThere'll be making the final determination that's more heavily weighted with independents Brian Kemp is ahead\nAnd his best audience is strongest group of supporters besides rural Georgia and\nAre all Georgians over the edge of sixty five\nAnd they are the most likely to turn out that actually vote on election day I'll go ahead and forecasts were going to have something very unusual for a gubernatorial election and that is a heavy turnout and probably a long election night which we have an avid Georgia the fact that the two thousand election when Sonny Perdue late at night on the back of the metro Atlanta vote\nUpset Roy Barnes incumbent democratic governor and the party shift a cart from blue to red in Georgia\nRight we've got about a minute until I got to do a traffic break I Hope I can hold you after so we can at least to this whole section but let me ask you this it looks like Brian Kemp is winning in terms of voters saying that they're more confident him in bringing business but it seems to be nearly a tie between camp in ... when it comes to education can you shed any light on that\nWell the George association of educators a large group of teachers though that the teachers union um did endorse Stacey Abrams candid say they're also been some smaller groups and the education field and other associations that are leaning her way\nI'm secretary camp is not necessarily just being hustled education but it was something he was spending a lot of time on until the last few weeks he adds an out of school safety plan and a six hundred million dollar plan to get teachers at three percent pay raise a year\nDuring his first term as governor all of which are positive but may have come a little late in the game for him to a jet or as much support in the public school community Stacey Abrams is I'll spend a lot of money for ads and the ads that are from PACs aligned that supporting are indicating that he the charter school private school advocate\nAnd not a big supporter of public schools I'm not saying necessarily true but I Do think there's been some buy in to that message or among the elected\nHold that thought for a second bill I'm going to put you on hold we got to check in with Doug Turnbull see how the traffic

Seventy eight thirty nine guys\nAnd we're here with Bill crane he is the political analysts used often by WSBIU had a chance to interview bill multiple times over the last many times I've been here bill I have to ask you this way to play both parties now\nLet's say you're in the Stacey Abrams camp it is nearly tide is within the statistical margin of error what does Stacey Abrams need to do to try to win some of those undecided those independence the middle have not yet decided where they're going\nWhat she has been focused on that as far as ... or more or less middle of the road message even though her positions are more left of center she might try to paint the secretary and set of attacking him on the um massage parlor at some of the other things that have been up there\nI'm asked about his extremism on the religious liberty legislation which I think has some gain or significant support not only among the gay lesbian transgender community but also centrist and moderate voters to believe that issue is somewhat settled by the U.S Supreme Court\nAnd that the state doesn't need that law that Governor Nathan Deal each out when the legislature put forward to sessions\nAnd on the flip side if you are in the brain camp bandwagon or if you're on his side of the ... of the aisle there and you want to see Brian Kemp takeovers the new governor what does he need to do to try to lose some of those that real small percentage of undecided\nIt's the same issue and it's actually playing to the same voters in my opinion he already has the Christian conservative votes for kids say publicly\nI Will protect the rights of individuals to practice their faith and their business in their home and not to be at someone else's faith or or\nMore a forced upon them that said I Will not sign legislation that openly discriminatory and the bill two years ago actually had language in it that you could terminate unemployed for suspicion of them being homosexual which\nOn its face many would read as being a discriminatory before the fact um if he were to frame that discussion of what he would do versus what he won't feel I think you win some of those independence back\nLet me ask you this as we have just a couple of minutes left over here with a crane ws be political analysts\nAs ... right now and this is more anecdotal than anything I've seen a lot of social media of had a lot of folks that I follow say that it seems like Stacey Abrams is out buying the ad space of Brian Kemp but can that backfire if you start feeling like you're hitting the voters over the head nonstop or does that work\nWell we never had two nominees with this much money and I'm not just talking about\nTheir campaigns even the handle this off with a few months or year now ... years ago\nUm they had that kind of saturation in a congressional district but state wide the amount of money we're seeing span is historic and we haven't seen this kind of parity between the Republican and democratic nominee either in a lot I Would agree with you it doesn't appear that there may be smarter at fire\nOn the Democratic side because she does seem to pop up to his one often but the amount of money they both raised about same amount she's going through it faster heartburn rate is higher so the question is can she sustained level she that now particularly when it really matters in that closing week to debate about only a week out from that election\nAnd that's when when those final undecided but you're being cast that's when you really want to have momentum and daycare and cross the finish off\nAlright thirty seconds bill we heard a couple of stories that went around that are a lot of new voters have registered almost historic does that play a factor at all\nQuarter million new voters six point nine seven million registered what really matters this moment on his ground game and who's identifying literally at the household level and getting their votes in into the fall and I would
