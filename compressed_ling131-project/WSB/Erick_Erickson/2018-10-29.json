S. B. twenty four hour news so not accused of killing eleven people in a Pittsburgh synagogue makes his first appearance in federal court on WSBIU Pete combs in Pittsburgh and we'll check you there in a moment also in court today Cesar ... be accused cereal mail bomb senator\nHe cried at the sign of his sister\nBut otherwise so little as the judge said a bunch cheering for him for friday that story has moved to Atlanta today but discovery of a package addressed to the CNN Center ears WSBIU Chris can't\nPut a bomb squad was called the Atlanta post office on prior street and there was a manila envelope with six American flags in uh Debbie Wasserman Schultz return address the package addressed directly to CNN after Cesar ... was arrested last week authorities said it was possible more packages could be discovered\nTo take the majority of the house of representatives the average when for an out of power party in the mid term election is twenty five\nAnd the Democrats only need to pick up Thirteen take back the house of representatives I'm so ... and that's that's if we have a blank slate you know I'm so if the election were held today to Republicans\nGuaranteed to win that includes flipping to democratic seats\nIf the election were held today two hundred and five Democrats would win and that would include flipping one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve Thirteen fourteen Republicans ... some of them because of redistricting in Pennsylvania and others are leaving thirty seats now\nHere's probably what's going to happen Republicans\nMore and more feeling like the Democrats are going to take the house of representatives the latest polling analysis suggests they may take it by thirty five seats a which would be more\nThan the average but not as big as some Democrats are saying Seventy six but we still don't know I mean if the Republicans if something happens in the next week but keep in mind early voting has already going on a and the Republicans hold all of the seats well then they when\nThey they take back they keep the house of representatives again there are right now based on the polling averages around the country there are thirty tossup races [noise] if the GOP has a really bad night they have a really bad night\nThen you're going to see some of the lean Republican seats\nA drift away and there are couple in Georgia a George six that's Karen Handel uh Georgia seven that's rubber with all those seats may go to the Democrats if the GOP has a really bad night\nIf the Democrats have a really bad night uh they're going to see Republican inroads into New Jersey in California uh and parts of Virginia that the Democrats felt they have locked down\nThe real interesting story I think is not the house of representatives do it either Republicans or behind the scenes now in Washington we spring that it's over right now they're trying to mitigate damage by holding seats they're beginning to run ads in places like\nUh South Carolina's first congressional district that was a mark Sanford's district he was beaten in the primary Democrats think there's a play there when Republicans were having to spend money in seats like that you know they're in a defensive position they're trying to hold their own\nWhere Republicans are on all sense is the Senate\nIf the election were held today well I'll tell you but first let's go check dresses up\nLet's go to the five and we all knew pi there'd be no end up on your body by downloading I'm about forty five\nMinutes from nobody around memorial drive volume and the thing about forty five minutes and that you wouldn't find one hundred and one way or that area too many five\nOr ... or whatever they want to\nThank you very much so if the Republicans and the Democrats went to the polls today to vote forty four Democrats would go back to the Senate\nBut fifty Republicans would go back to the Senate based on polling fifty Republicans there\nWould be six twelve steps so even if the GOP loses every toss up race they still keep the Senate with the vice president breaking the tie fifty Republicans but but but let's dig into these tossup races what are the toss ups\nThe toss ups right now are not in there and not North Dakota North Dakota is a Democrat seat the Republicans are going to win Heidi Heitkamp is losing North Dakota and she is that the Democrats have already written off as race they stopped spending money there\nThe toss ups are Florida\nHeld by Democrat Bill Nelson Indiana held by Democrat Joe Donnelly Missouri held by Democrat Claire McCaskill\nMontana held by Democrat Jon Tester Arizona held by Republican Jeff Flake but it's an open seat in Nevada held by Republican Dean Heller there's only one open seat on the map Arizona\nNow waters the polls and the toss ups say well\nThey say that Florida is a tide race a slight advantage to the Democrats in Florida both in the gubernatorial race and in the Senate race the reason that the Democrats have a slight advantage in Florida is because of the devastation of hurricane Michael\nThe panhandle is the most Republican part of the state in the panhandle has been devastated by the hurricane there are people who can't get home and they're not all voting absentee some of them just aren't voting some of them are still stay with relatives that state\nOr that puts Rick Scott at a disadvantage and the Senate race in Rob the census at a disadvantage and the governor's race\nIndiana Joe Donnelly had been expected to win reelection to have a tough race but to win reelection the White House has said both the president and vice president to Indiana\nAnd after the ... situation and Joe Donnelly voting against Brett Kavanaugh suddenly the Republican is in the lead in Indiana\nIndiana you suddenly have a really aggressive race and the Republican uh Braun is ahead of Joe Donnelly in the polling average by point five percent but here's the kicker\nThe last two weeks of polling of likely voters have come back with brown up either for points or three points CBS has him up three points\nA Mason strategies for Indiana politics has him up for points and even the last survey usa ... which was done at the beginning of October only had Joe Donnelly up one point\nThe Republicans may very well pick up Indiana\nIn Missouri all of the late polling has um has\nJosh Holly ahead\nFox News pulled the race at the very end of September and it had a tight race uh Missouri polling has pulled it in the last a few weeks and they had it up for they had Holly afford\nI'm actually told by a number of of people who have done outside polling in this race that in a couple of doubles Josh Hawley is a double digits in some of the polls he's up in the eight to nine point area it sounds very much like Claire McCaskill is dose and the way she's campaigning ah\nSeems like she knows that Montana is an interesting one because there hasn't been very many polls there and Jon Tester ... was a head in Montana\nOr the problem with that is that he's routed all of his staff to Montana to become campaign staffers and you don't do that if you're comfortably winning this is going to be dog fight the White House ... ah the president and the vice president out there they're seeing signs that test or maybe beat ...\nArizona has a ... up\nUh in the polling averages she is ahead in the polling averages she should keep Jeff Flake seek Christian cinema is turned out to be a terrible candidate\nHas a lot of baggage Republicans have gotten highly energized out there and then there's Dean Heller he's ahead by a couple of points but that's never good because a couple of points in the ... in Nevada could still be a huge democratic turnout we saw that with Harry Reid against Sharron Angle but he's ahead in the polling\nIf you just took where people are ahead in the polls\nThe Republicans would be picking up a minimum of three seats in the Senate\nSo yes the toss ups are split fifty fifty the Republicans go up to fifty three seats in the Senate but the odds are that they go up to fifty four seats in the Senate\nThat's a very big deal for the GOP they may lose the house but they'll still be able to put judges on the federal bench so even if the Republicans lose a week from tomorrow in the house they're going to have a good night in the Senate but but but but that begs the question\nWhat about the governor's race is what about Brian yep I've seen the early voting numbers I'll tell you what I've seen when we come back\nNews whether it's W.

state's office does not actually clean voter rolls in election years because they know it looks bad\nSo they've they've asked this a further now you've got Jimmy Carter of course has come out he's been in a broom supporter anyway and he's come out and said that Brian ... should resign using the authority of Mr go in and ensure fair elections to try to help Stacey Abrams um there's clearly\nThey generated an entire story about this they generated an entire and and the reason they did it it's political jujitsu if you will turning your opponent street than to his weakness branch of has been a very good secretary of state\nHe in a year in two thousand sixteen where it can be very close in Georgia one way or the other he worked very hard on the integrity of the election despite a lot of criticisms from other people can't work very very hard to ensure that Russians couldn't interfere with our election that our database couldn't be hacked\nThere have been allegations that has happened it hasn't happened he's been a very good sectors state\nAnd what the Abrams campaign did is they decided to attack him on that\nWhich I think it's fair to say that the Republicans really didn't see coming uh her voter suppression her throwing people off the ... throwing people at the ballot that are that are are not off the ballot but also the the voter rolls\nOr the pinning voter issue the voting machine issue on and on and on a call into question his confidence a secular state was actually been a very good secretary state\nNo it was an interesting move and the national pundits to look at this seem to think it has helped her I'm just not sure that it actually has\nAnd by the way it is the the overwhelming consensus of people in the green room is that at best she's going to be able to get into a runoff but she still can't win 'em\nBut we'll see it depends on on voter turnout now before we get into the controversy we need to go to Doug Turnbull unchecked controversial\nYou know what you nailed it buddy thirty people ducked down on the outside they gonna marry controversial because we have all that all my blog for the last five minutes there's no ... on a five out\nOf one

I Want you to listen to this and and I want you to to understand before you hear this\nThat this exchange is getting Chuck Todd hate mail from progressive\nWho believe he should never have had me on meet the press listen to this\nIs it the first this stuff job is to educate Americans ... I think we all\nHave an obligation here I mean let me address conservatives for a minute the last week and a lot of people pushing the maybe this bomb or not\nWas lush Limbaugh was pushing it here I have a lot of people who are pushing this theory now you\nFact that they are now we know the facts and yet there are still people pushing this I got to tell you that from my perspective when we know all the facts all about the guy last week and you're still pushing this theory we're at war with the truth and if you're conservative who's at war with truth you're not really being conservative um the ... was questioning the stickers on the van\nAcross the board we saw a bunch of conservatives doing this now we know the facts the question is do they continue the problem is in the situation we have a lot of people who no longer trust the media they don't trust institutions they don't trust their neighbor or we're going inward a I unfortunately I Do think it's going to be an external threat that brings us together\nThere is nothing left to this country that unifies as as a whole we all have role in different media outlets we our social media outlets wherever people we engage with and they're not our next door neighbor anymore nobody has a sense of community says eleven people dying stop the tipping point well and it's on satellite what you guys are on the grand James Hodgkinson last year a mass assassination or something like ... and ...\nYes that has progressive outrage\nAnd they're outraged because they thought ... Todd should have yelled at me more for things I had said that the left doesn't like or that he should have forced me to condemn my brain Rush Limbaugh\nWhich I I was I was I going to condemn reasonable he and I looked at this incident last week we we saw it differently\nUm and bow and we do know the fact is I'm now we know the facts um ... it's just\nIt's astonishing to see people go out of their way to\nUh decide they can decide who should and should not be on TV and they should be able to regulate the other side ah Julia or the coffee I have no idea how you pronounce her last name she was on Jake Tapper yesterday while I was on meet the press she was on with Jake Tapper on CNN uh she had this to say listen to\nThe ... right ah a caricature of a Jew being shot execution style what the subject line Bangor Ontario and I you know I think it's interesting that now ... is the first lady is now you know her campaign has the best and I think as cyber bullying but when there was a clear example of cyber bullying she had while the victim provoked at the head of\nHair on me I have to have to agree with him on here I think you know this past that at one of the things that have really launched his presidential run on is talking about Islamic rattled radicalization and\nThis president has radicalized so many more people\nThan I says her dad I mean the way he talks the way he the way that is that just it it's hot the way the way that he uh allows the the the way he ... to these groups the way he says I Know I'm not supposed to say it but I'm a national asked\nThe way that he hands at ... when he has to not condemning these people and kind of quitting his task kinda set sign of hacking down as but then you know\nAnd I see not push back on\nThat you said it was about I mean it was found her to say the President's Day says radicalized more people that ISIS is irresponsible guy yeah OK and\nShe did apologize for you you should know she did apologize for it after it was over a but Jake Tapper is getting attacked for having her on his way Chuck Todd was you didn't attack for having me on the right against Jake Tapper the left against Chuck Todd\nUh and they were moderating roundtable discussions when you moderator roundtable discussion if you're a host on on TV you expect to the other side to chime in and disagree with sharpened\nWith this ah personally ... here's my thing\nI really like the she said that on TV no I don't agree with it\nI think it's refreshing to hear people will be that honest on TV that this is what she believes she really believes the president radicalize more people than ISIS which is an insane thing to say and we should be able to put her in the ... what the left is upset with Chuck Todd about\nIs that he he gave me a veneer of reasonable and this would they don't think I Am reasonable and they don't like the fact that I went on and said something saying that people agree with\nAnd the ... let me get away with say ... it's a very bizarre thing where the when the less decides and now some people in the right decide that you are an unreasonable nut\nYou're not allowed to be on TV you're not allowed to have someone else so you know what actually all the wrong this person's reasonable or at least have them on and give them their say she has exposed herself to I think Kevin in St beliefs but eh the the whole idea that\nConservatives should be able to say you can't have on this leftist\nOr leftist should be able to say you can't have on this conservative would you ultimately get to is that the euro not allowed to have anybody unless I agree with them and that didn't would mix for some very boring TV [noise]\nAtlanta's evening news very Gary breaking\nNews or militias accurate and the federal five day forecast for the same traffic every six minutes to do what do you want\nTo do that you cannot do it in a plane mark housekeeping here we just had only three open this traffic ... anybody out down the highway thirty more older more detail\nWhat did you were up north it's going\nUp and then after that that are getting a lot better than anybody will ever they want to know that they're going to\nDon't want nobody north of Fort\nWorth a normal eighty five out of the way and I have one or will tell you what North north of here and there are things that are\nIn early today how these sound easing but you're still selling for four hundred on and off overpass how we haven't yet but it only takes about a half an hour to make that ride west side to side more than ...
