W sort of woods they would throw into the system\n'cause my driver's licenses my state record or the voter registration information polls from your driver's license the reason is because you were driver's licenses updated far more often than your voter registration file\nSo they get an exact match off your driver's license the people who are being thrown out the fifty seven thousand people their voter registration information doesn't match their driver's license information\nWell one of the reasons it often doesn't match the driver's license formations because it's not the voter actually registering himself to vote it's a third party group like the nonprofit Stacey Abrams is run in the past to try to get people to vote that's what's happening here\nThey're saying that fifty seven thousand voters have been excluded know what's happened is that they've tried to fill out forms to get people registered to vote those people themselves have not filled out the forms\nThey're trying to scream and claimed this was discrimination from brand kept all these students complying with the law so or are they encouraging the secretary of state to break the law\nSo that sounds like they're encouraging Brian Kemp to break the law because the laws very clear voter registration information must match driver's license information you're given twenty six months twenty six months not weeks months twenty six months to correct the information\n\nAnd purely people don't want to correct it he's also being attacked you should know for throwing five hundred thousand people off the rolls that's a federal law he's complying with federal law see that there there are laws these laws have been passed by the state of the federal government brand campus complying with these laws a democratic secretary of state would have to comply with the law as well\nAnd the Democrats are attacking him for complying with the law essentially they want him to break the law that is what they what they want Brian give to have to break the law\nTo help Democrats the law doesn't work to the Democrats advantage so they what brand came to break the law\nThis is what we're seeing in the capital stuff as well the the Senate is a legitimate because the Senate nomination capital the Supreme Court is it legitimate because capitalism the Supreme Court the house representatives illegitimate because it's gerrymandered rankings illegitimate because he complies with all you got to break the law\nThe constitution is bad because the Senate ... doesn't represent the mob brand give is bad because he follows the law oldest is bad because of the law the Democrats what law breaking lawlessness\nAnd this is Stacey Abrams for God's sakes you walked out of the state house of representatives instead of voting to to crack down on human trafficking\nDo you want law and order or do you want lawlessness\nThe secretary state is Brian Kemp he is required by law to decline to register people to vote if the voter registration form and their driver's license do not match Democrats are attacking him for following the law\nBrand Cuba as the secretary of state he's required by federal law a federal law the help America vote act that the Democrats in the United States House and Senate drafted\nThat said they have to purge the voter file an act of voters at the state level to prevent voter fraud he complied with that law now they're attacking him for comply with the law the Democrats themselves drafted\nThat's what the Democrats are doing say I guess that's what they say we kick them when Republicans go alone brand came hasn't gone low against ... we're getting a male piece at our house every single day directed to my wife that Brian Kemp support sex predators there is going lo Brian Kemp if anything does out taking the high road pointing out his record\nPointing out he'd be good for business pointing out say she ever who would be bad for business which is true she wants to raise taxes\nJust insane that they're attacking him for this and here comes Eric Holder encouraging Democrats to get violent against Republicans the former attorney general encouraging Democrats get violent and doing so in Stacey Abrams office this is why we can't have ties thanks\nVery caring for the evening news who is a guy I Love the information you need and the demand every night and he was
