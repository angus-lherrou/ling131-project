so and then there's another group there's another group that's underperforming\nIs an interesting it is interesting the financial sector actually is that doing very well there's an article in the ... yeah and and it talks about if you actually bought stock in financial institutions you may be losing right now to erode price over the last fifty two weeks off fourteen percent\nBlack rocket down twenty percent Janice Henderson down thirty six percent and invest go down forty percent so\nThat's probably not the place to be for you right now and you wonder if the market's up and people are making money why wouldn't the financial institutions be doing well as far as their stock is concerned they asked that question on CNBC this is Gina Sanchez she gives you a very interesting answer\nBut that's really is a concern about the broader industry trend in that industry attendance and stopping anytime soon we don't agree with it and we actually think that right now is probably the ... active management that all the money seems to be flying past his managers and lower fees and that spells trouble for this and it's interesting\nChris so what's the problem here what are these financial institutions that are down they're not getting it already\nYeah so it's not just relevant for investors in those companies you know our listeners may be saying why don't those companies in my portfolio what's relevant is if you have your money managed by them\nThey are still stuck in that old model of active management and I disagree with her comment about being back in an active management role if you're going to chase individual equities if you're going to chase individual bonds and just keep buying and selling and buying and selling\nYou know they largely under perform and the problem is he get fees on top of it so it's costly and I've been saying it for years and sharing stats on the show that this type of active management doesn't beat the market\nIt simply takes a fee from the investors and and a donor performs mean\nSo what type of investments are we talking about we're talking about mutual funds so big box firms that we fight against all the time on our our message on this show\nAnd then you compound it by allowing them to put you in mutual funds that are supposedly actively managed so that their timing the market and they're gonna out perform and they don't mean year to date large cat mutual funds\nAre down compared to the S. and P. five hundred index by a hundred and Seventy basis points which is basically one point seven percent\nSo you are one point seven percent worse off\nBy being in actively managed these professionals that habit you know have all the tools available to them and should should know the market and be able to turn to market your down by one point seven percent on average versus just parking your money in the U.S and the five hundred and walking away gift with at one point seven percent mostly is I bet it's\nThe ... so the only people that are making any money off of active management are the active managers were not getting any benefit from that\nI'll give you a client example from last week a younger couple in their mid fifties come in they have outside assets that I'm managing and then they have two for one case he can roll his to a brokerage link which I can manage so we did that\nShe wasn't eligible for ... so we started going through all of her individual investments\nAnd it was eye opening for her to see a what they were invested in 'cause she really didn't have any deep knowledge into it so we pulled up the top ten holdings and every one of the a mutual funds that she was in and then we went through all the options insider her four oh one K. plant\nAnd expense ratios and fees I mean it just it was mind blowing to see her in bond funds underperforming equity funds and these are supposed to be highly managed highly productive Wall Street models and they simply aren't\nSo what you're saying is this person is paying a fee and they're not getting very much for their feet and this is one of the things that we just harp on every single week is if you have\nA financial advisor you need to know what you're paying for and what you're paying for is benefiting you you can't have somebody who you're paying a fee to and I got a bunch of mutual funds in there that are on auto pilot and you're not getting anything for your money and that's what you're saying\nYeah knowledge is power right so here's the question how many of our listeners truly understand what they're paying for compared to what they're getting right and right now especially in the last several years the market's been good new portfolios are up\nBut you you've never done the analysis or the majority of us haven't done the analysis to figure out whether they're getting the bang for their buck that they need to build that portfolio to basically not give it all back during the correction that eventually will come so\nYou know this is part of the process that we go through with clients it's understanding all the fees every one of them and having those in writing number two it's setting benchmarks for each one of these investments are asset classes so that we can measure their performance against it\nAnd then the third thing which is critical if you have to have somebody to talk to about it unless you're a very active investor very knowledgeable and you're diving in and doing the research yourself and if you are you can manage the majority of your funds as long as you don't get emotional about it\nBut for the rest of us out there for the rest of our listeners out there that don't want to be professional investors you have to talk to somebody and meet with somebody on a very regular basis to understand what you have to understand how it's performing and you make small two weeks and adjustments not this ripping chair\nSuper active management and it's not one of these while I'm just going to hand it off and trust these experts that are under performing the market by almost ... percent doesn't make any sense\nYou came to us a while back with a story of a guy who came to you and he was like a fifty million dollar guy very very wealthy person and you looked at his portfolio and you kind of go well what do you want me to do here you've got you've got a team of advisers and you want a second opinion what do you want to hear and the guy looks at you and says I Want to know if I'm up\nBecause the market is up or because my guys are good and I want you know he told me that\nAnd I think that you may not have fifty million dollars I imagine there's not a lot of people lifting chose right now to do but you need to ask that same question don't you\nYeah I mean if you don't have fifty million and you have five hundred thousand that makes it that much more important right to lose it and to grow it I mean you're racing against the clock right now you racing against the clock that the market may be coming to a top it may be the next year and maybe the year after but we've got to make sure we're maximizing not lowering the fees getting it\nTo where it's growing print proportion to the market into your risk profile\nAnd then adding layers of protection and everything else we've got to get working on this and I think you've got to eighty days to kind of get a second set of eyes on it before the holiday\nWe talked about this over the last couple of weeks in the time it's just slipping away on us we're in October and before you know it it'll be Thanksgiving and then it ... all the way to the end of the year and we would love to have the opportunity to sit down with you and talk about some of the very very important year and kind of decisions that you may want to make\nThat could be tax decision so they could be just re allocation decisions that could be you know what's going to happen next year with taxes with the Trump tax reform as or something I can do now before the end of the year that could put me in a better position\nThese are really good conversations you need to have a look at where you are right now are you getting for your money what you deserve do you really know what's your financial advisor is doing for you are you in a bunch of mutual funds that are just basically auto piloting that person isn't doing anything and you're paying that money to do it\nYou don't want that you want to get something for this fee that you're paying let us take a look at it\nThe retirement roadmap is what we offer you each week here on the radio show at the end of every segment we make available five of these retirement road maps give us a call right now it's for all for nine zero a date\nFor all for nine zero eight eight eight let's

celebrate it man I Want to know about it and\nIt's a good reminder ten years later a lot of people have shut down that reality in their own minds and in their portfolios and they're pressing all into the market\nWe mentioned this last week it all came came unglued in the mid part uh September when Lehman Brothers went down and the following couple of weeks we got very very acquainted with people like Henry Paulson and ... and too big to fail and if you are watching the financial news at that point listen to the panic in these people's voices\nTo stand with which we are watching the market just carry wet\nEssentially than by full size than we're down over sixteen percent without the same time had fallen about Eighteen percent the stock market is now down Twenty one percent were not about the story for saying\nOn Wall street you know you want to say they don't want a sixteen foot in the\nLive looked at the Dow Jones industrial board and six hundred point loss\nWho knows where this was going to end up I mean this was volatility we haven't seen of course so it was way before you were born even before grandparents you know Nineteen twenty nine\nWell they didn't have anything else to compare it to because there wasn't anything else that comparing to act like that so they were thinking about Nineteen twenty nine so the plunge went all the way until march of two thousand nine the dial had fallen from fourteen thousand to sixty five hundred a the S. and P. went down to fifty seven percent so\nChris and they've put a bunch of things in place since then and everybody thinks oh we could never go back there again has the idea on Wall street changed has Wall Street changed from then can this happen again\nOf course it can I mean I don't have any material things that I can point to that they have changed in the wall street models ...\nI mean they're operating the same way they take our assets in\nThey invested in stocks bonds and cash for cash equivalence and they move things around\nAnd and and nothing's changed as far as the way Wall Street ... aides they'll talk about circuit breakers and after the fact protectors but you've got an artificially propped up market with interest rates being depressed to zero and now they're starting to rise and they're trying to walk this tight rope\nOf getting numb interest rates backup which is going to be very hard to do without the market correcting in my opinion and if you look at your four O. one K. and your retirement plan what do you have in their\nStock ... mutual fund you learn what it is yeah thing has changed as far as the model and it's it's maddening and that's why we're on this show and we're talking about alternatives were talking about leveraging insurance products\nThe products are there to ... some of the products have changed that you can use inside your portfolio\nThey're available to the individual investor at a at a higher level today than they were ten years ago but Wall Street's not pitching it they're not bringing it to they don't want to lose that advisory the\nThey don't want to walking out the door and that cash flow it's one of the reasons that these companies are that we talked about earlier down thirty to forty percent is because that models under pressure\n'em to things like index funds so index funds with something new people are starting to embrace that but that's basically giving up and handing over the market as you said and just letting roll with it baby let it go up and let it go back down to me that's maddening\nThere are opportunities to build a

clients\nI'm concerned about the difference if the debt is so high\nThey're going to have to pay the bonds first where did they pulled the cash flow from well they're paying a ton and these dividends so what I worry about is when clients get overly invested in these higher yield stocks\nIf they start to stall or reduce which would be a pretty bold a thing for them to do as many years as they've raised their dividends and produced that\nThat can be pretty devastating when you've lost twelve percent for the year and now you're not getting the yield on the dividends side that you thought you were getting I think this is one of those\nTechnology plays that I Would stay away from right now from an investor bull asset standpoint I Know that David end is tempting but there are other ways to get that dividend\nAnd I think it's a little bit scary that you're getting five and a half six per cent dividends from a company that has a record high debt\nSo you've got people that are saying they should short their bonds\nWell there are people that I Know that are listening right now that worked for a TNT and they look in their four one K. and they probably invested in a TNT stock is a part of their four one K. and this could probably be a lesson to everyone\nWho has the opportunity to invest in their own company in their four O. one K. not to be overly exposed to your own company stock\nYeah and I think ... matches\nContributions and four one K. with the Eighteenth ... wow so\nYou don't want to get overly invested both with your career in a company that's facing some evolution issues and have your money tied up in it too I mean it it points to this is not a dot com company money stretch the imagination it's a huge cash rich\nCompany but it's taking on a lot of debt it's

ability of the issuing insurance companies bonus than it would remain clued higher surrender charges longer surrender charge periods lower cats higher spreads or other restrictions that are not included in similar annuity that don't offer\nPremium speech or read your contract restrictions limitations or penalties insurance products including annuities are offered the hop and financial group lessons and said oh [noise]\nUnderstand something folks a lot of people out there pitching annuities to you you need an annuity it's a fixed income product it's a pension is what it is essentially creating your own pension and that I knew that gives you a fixed rate of return for significant amount of time which is nice and a lot of people want that but here's the problem\nThe upfront cost the loads the commission on the front end a lot of times it anywhere from four to ten percent so if you put a hundred thousand dollar nudey anywhere from ... goes to that guy that woman that license professor who just sold you went to the unity understand that\nNow here's the other thing a lot of times there's a term in other words if you want to liquidate your money you get liquidity out of that position you can't because you have to pay a penalty you have to pay a surrender charge up front that takes money off the bottom line as well and then as early redemption fees and a lot of other things that come into play and I'm not\nSaying there's never a need for these I'm saying there oversold\nAnd it blows up is we believe that you can create that same annuity the exact same thing that that license personal going to say it because they're representing Wall Street because they have a license and there was sponsored by our institution so you're letting some institution manage your money and they're competing for the same way that you and are competing for there's a divergence of interest right there\nBut what happens is on Wall street firms not going to manage your money\nAnd the person who's actually making the decisions is Sonia what's in their inventory so for Newt he's in the image where they can sell it to you they get paid a large commission for that\nWe're supposed to tell you that you can create that same annuity that they're selling you yourself\nWith the same products that they use in the financial markets 'cause we can use those same products we have access to those do you realize you could create a bond fund in other words a fund that can give you a five or six protect returned with very low risk and not pay any load your upfront commissions and literally be able to create that yourself\nAnd get the same returns that you need to get out of an annuity without having to pay all those high fees and more importantly haven't full liquidity in your position needed cash out you can't\nThere's so many things out there and we're trying to separate ourselves because we don't want to manage your money is not what this is about this is about you learning to manage your own money you learn how to self direct your wealth and if you learn the skills it allows you to make better returns for less cost think of that\nAnd that's what we're really hear about and that's why if we don't tell you this no money made is going to tell you that you should put your money and self directed they got to tell you put it on a management with me with us course they are 'cause they have a vested interest in your participation\nBe careful folks you can learn the skills of self directing is not a complicated process you have to go through a learning curve but it's available and what I Love sponsor\nThey teach people how to do it more portly learning somewhere learn how to self directed make better decisions yourself because\nUltimately if you don't get the returns you want and you don't get those retirement goals and you have no say in the decision where are you that a lot of people are worried about run out of money that is a real risk in this country and that's the problem that a lot of people are facing well\nHave you know a lot of individuals they think they don't have enough time they don't think they're smart enough they think you know they don't have enough money that it's you know they should be focusing on it and people make reasons and they make excuses all the time on the don't manage our money and realistically you know how much time as they can take somebody six to ten hours a month I have students that I might trade academy that I personally coach to manage their wealth in six to ten hours a month\nThey don't have to where they get the same returns or better returns that all those products available out there and he has a beautiful thing they can make money when the market goes down to the problem with a lot of those money managers that they put you in some sort of a position where if the market was up to make money to mark goes down you give it back and if it doesn't go up dramatically enough\nThe fees that they're charging you take up the profitability that you do get so we've got a plan in place where you can make money regardless of direction more importantly\nYou'd have to pay all those fees and ultimately get those returns you want and what's great about that as the increase probability lowest cost that's a no brainer that's why self directing is becoming so prevalent in so many people

the behind the scenes\nContent some of the stuff that doesn't always make the show well and we have a video camera reading whenever we do the show so there's a lot of great content that comes through that which really is stuff that just is hysterical I mean we've this one of the fun of the hours and hours that I Am every lack the idea of just sitting here I got it so it is one of the best parts of the week up I was having a good time but you know what\nOne of the things that we need to talk about is there are individuals out there that are trying to figure out how to generate additional monthly income there are people out there that aren't financially where they want to be I mean husbands wives all the time they're like man if I could just make another five hundred or a thousand bucks a month\nThings would be so much better for me let's take a moment let's talk about how someone can utilize the market really and talking about trading for income how someone can do them\nWell most people being seen to coach run by trade academy traveled the world I've been all over the planet talking to be about trading and investing and what's universal is that people want to make income they want to generate additional income and the markets are a great way to do that and the problem is is that a lot of people when they were trader\nThey check out they think Wolf of Wall Street the movie Wall Street greed is good some guy suspenders sitting on Wall street overlook in Manhattan and that couldn't be further from the true some of the most successful traders that I Know people for income that generate an income in the markets on a daily or weekly basis\nOr people just like us that your blue collar white collar stay at home moms I mean pizza delivery people barbers I mean scientists we have a lot of surgeons that have had success in the markets so what's important is that it's a skill set that you learn over time but once you learn the skill set think of the benefits there's about forty million\nTrainee a couch in the United states you know eat trade Schwab Judy marriage rates got trade and most of those traitors based on our knowledge are not successful they love the sexiness of the opportunity of being able to sit at their home and speculate on price change in a marketplace they loved that but if they don't have a good system in place are good set of rules\nThey normally aren't successful and those are the stories you hear so people think the market's a casino and it's not if you understand\nHow to play the game it gives you a unique advantage and the problem is is that many people have this preconceived notion that the markets are nothing more than throwing your money and hope it works\nAnd it couldn't be further from the truth is ways to generate high probability low risk decisions\nAnd if you do that consistently it could turn into a compound and growth curve I've seen it personally I've seen people that have come through the process and learn the skills and transform their life with trading and they had no knowledge coming in they didn't understand the first day of the most the difference would have stock and bond\nAnd yet they learn the skill and what's great about that as it opens the door for people that have happened to get a second job punch a clock somewhere go wait on tables not that there's anything wrong with doing that I've done all of that\nBut what's important is if you could generate that income from your home you know in in your spare time that's the opportunity and many people don't get it because they have this preconceived idea what a trade or is it couldn't be further from the truth\nOne you know what a lot of people think that it requires a lot of time they think it requires this high IQ and it's just a skill it's like any skill you say it all the time he used to be a framer champ\nYou don't understand how to use the proper tools of professional grade broker dealer understand how to actually minimize risk increase probability just a checklist of things that keep you safe in the market and a lot of people think is just so out of reach that they can't do it and if not I mean I tell people you can drive a stick shift you can learn to be a successful trader because it's nothing more than learning the skill\nAnd repeating it over and over and over again one of the most important things I tell people is\nTrading and investing shouldn't be exciting if it's exciting you're doing it wrong it's just a decision\nAnd when you have the ability to make that decision what's great about that is the doors open anybody I mean I mean people that literally have very low capital I mean they might have a few hundred bucks to work with and they're able to go into the currency markets start to make money and make consistent money in a decent amount of money\nFutures markets such great opportunity to trade futures and in this country people don't understand the power of those assets we focus on stock stock stocks in this country futures a tremendous assets and sometimes that can use food as a trade stock\nAnd I can use reaches a trade stock indices like the S. and P.\nAnd make a bigger ... less capital on the same moving price there's so many opportunities out there and when people start to realize that they can generate an income in the financial markets it's a game changer for them and it has nothing to do with your I. Q. or where you went to school what your GPA is I tell everybody you don't have to be smart to be successful in the financial markets you'd have to be a teachable\nAnd this living proof in this studio of that\nExactly champion you know what a lot of people out there they don't realize that this is an opportunity for them there are people out there that are trying to figure out how to make extra money was I mean how many Hoover drivers you meet your there and executive during the day in their drive a New Britain I there's so many easier way to generate capital than doing all that stuff and trading for incomes one of them are sponsor online training academy\nThey know individuals' out there wants to generate additional income they also know that people don't know how to do it that's why they have a class specifically on trading for income from our sponsor online training academy\nThat allows an individual is brand new the market or been in the market for years but if you don't have that consistency\nTo have that income coming in on a monthly basis to pay your bills this is the opportunity for you this is a five hundred dollar class we have a few seats to give away or didn't take callers tend to twenty right now pick up the phone call eight four for five one trade a date for four five on trade for callers tend to twenty five hundred dollar class on trading for income\nFrom our sponsor online training academy that aid for four five one eight Seventy two thirty three eight for four or five one eight Seventy two thirty three propellers ten to twenty five hundred dollar class specifically", "show_name": "Erick Erickson", "year": "2018", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "07"}
