most comfortable shopping experience of any jeweler in town\nOur team of jewelry experts are so knowledgeable and they don't work on commission which is why everyone on Yelp says they're extremely

so you get real and lasting value shop around and then come to shame company where I Know you'll feel right at home\nThat's why our customers come back to our family year after year generation after generation now you have a friend and the jewelry business shame company in shank oh dot com\nOut right we're already seeing it so some of these mutual funds that you go back and look at the worst is now ten years later and their cycle so these numbers are jumping you know something that maybe is generated\nNine or ten or eleven percent last\nYear of or a ten year averages jumping up to Thirteen fourteen Fifteen Percent because you're getting rid of that big loss in two thousand nine so it looks like a much better fund that it might actually be yeah completely and that's the case so everything's done in testing over a ten year period of time and time you look at your financial analysis your back testing\nAny recommendations that you make\nAnd you're showing a ten year performance or you don't have to go back further than that\nSo two things one is yeah you want the ten year you want to know what it's done over an extended period of time but you have to ask your advisor to go back to two thousand nine hundred thousand and eight through two thousand and nine and stress tests that tell me exactly how the portfolio behaved back then\nAnd that will tell you your level of risk because I think we're seeing some I don't want to say it's a a banking melt down or mortgage backed securities or anything like that but the market's up\nThree hundred percent over a ten year period of time and that's a long period of time to grow a bull market and when that's correct It's not going to be just a ten percent correction we're doing that almost in two days in the market right it's going to be a Fifteen twenty twenty five thirty maybe even a fifty percent correction in the market\nYou're going to want to know how your portfolio is poised for that so it's kind of a strange thing but switch from looking at how much is this poised to grow if the market keeps going\nAnd balance that out with how much am I going to lose if this market turns ugly and it is interesting over the past several months\nThat is a focal point of the conversations that we're having but clients were having a stress test conversation we're talking about here's what your portfolio looks like if the S. and P. five hundred goes down twenty percent here's how much you have any risk bucket\nHere's how much you have in your safe bucket here's how much you have in your slow lane bucket that should be more diversified\nBut that conversation has to happen with your advisor\nAnd I got to tell you it's got to happen between now and the end of the year because October is not looking great ... and going into the election cycles that we're going to have and all the things that are leading up to the end of the year you don't want to be caught January first\nIn a down market losing ten Fifteen twenty percent then you may be stuck you may have to hold it through even a larger correction and wait for it to come back so act now and get with your advisor and do the stress tests\nListening to money unleashed with Chris often at the ... financial group and our number is ...\nOr nine nine zero eight eight eight we offered to use something called the retirement road map and that is really Chris job one of the retirement roadmap as an analysis of where you are right now\nAnd we we use the term I Want to know where I stand so you have a four O. one K. you have an IRA you have some real estate holdings or some reads you have property you have all these different things that are going to find your retirement you want to know how is it going to do in good markets in soft markets and in bad markets in right now\nIf you look at your statement you're probably not getting the really good clear complete picture because all of that two thousand eight stuff is running out is moving out of the picture it's now ten years ago\nSo you want to know that information get a stress test of your portfolio give us a call to get the retirement roadmap give us a call right now it's for all for nine zero eight eight eight\nYou can also taxed\nThe word road map to the same number and that'll get into one of our advisors will text your back\nAnd then we'll get a time when we can sit down and talk about it you can also go on line to our website with ... which is on a leash or money dot com hit the contact button there it opens up a field you can put in the question that you have in one of our advisors will get in touch with you there as well\nSo then the question that we have is what do we do with our money right now is there some sort of a strategy that we should be looking at well there was a conversation on\nFox Business between Maria barter Romo and an analyst and they were talking about hey interest rates are going up does that mean I should go to CDs should I start moving to listen to this\nI Want to change your strategy given the fact that interest rates are where they are that they can get almost three for ... years now\nFor you know that's a great question when you look at the two year to two Ninety the the ten years at three twenty and uh for us we're starting to think that bonds are starting to look attractive\nSay you would sell some ... ... and ... are starting\nTo look look at that um we may think it's a little bit early it's um you know we've been talking a lot about being the eighth inning of this rally are just getting some some level ground here we're we're folks are really taking a deeper dive back into well do I need to get more into fixed income\nIs this the time Chris to start looking at that well he he says that he says he's looking at it and he thinks we're in the eighth inning of this rally so he he didn't sound very confident in his recommendation if that was my financial advisor I'd say can you spit it out [laughter]\nI don't want to do I hear how we in the market out of the market and\nFixed income fixed income products are the interest rates are rising they're rising to slowly in my opinion and if they continue to rise in this kind of methodical pattern that the fed is increasing interest rates by small chunks\nIt puts pressure on your bond funds and it puts pressure on your bones so\nThere's nothing wrong with fixed income it's getting to a level where it could be attractive and I have a lot of conversations with clients currently about this\nPending correction whenever that happens whether it's a year whether it in the eighth inning or whether we're in the ninth inning of this bull market we're talking about fixed income\nYou know you can get five year products for over three percent three point seven percent there is a fixed annuity out there for four percent for a five year if you could lock in four percent for five years that's not so bad but\nYou're going to have to lock it in ... is the problem with the fixed income market and there are other instruments I think you can also consider that are more liquid then that\nThat maybe you are linking to the market still but you have some downside protection to it so yes it has to be part of the conversation but I Do I think it's too early to being fixed income yeah I Do actually you actually some do your crystal ball a little far [laughter]\nAnd I said my neck hurt [laughter]\nBrain's\nNot that far behind it but there are solutions to it OK name or not we're not at a dead end we are making recommendations to clients or how to manage this and there are there are some concrete ones that can deliver\n'em exactly what we're looking for I mean if you if you believe or late in the cycle mhm which I agree we're in the eighth or ninth inning of this bull market you can go with something that has complete protection\nComplete principle protection but you're going to limit the amount of gains you get going okay so\nI called the Swiss army knife we talk about it even at our seminars and you get principle of protection you get market grows up to a certain level and you also get to other benefits with it which are death benefit and long term care policy in kind of very unique product\nIf you want to stay in the market and you think we're in the seventh inning or little ... yeah a little bit more room to run then I Would rebound your equity portfolio to be a little bit more conservative consumer staples that sector of the ... five hundred\nIs out performing tech in October ... so they're up about two percent tech as in correction territory so we can move to dividend stocks so instead of fixed income at three percent let's build a portfolio of give it in stocks that produce the evidence of three percent\nAnd you get this market hopefully you get this market to run for the next year or so so there are options there but I don't think fixed income is where he want to be\nAll right well there is one way to find out and what those options are and what you might uh are how you might take advantage of some of them\nIs to give us a call for the retirement road map this is a financial plan and if you don't have one you should and if you want to take advantage of our radio offer which is getting one free give us a call right now for all for nine zero eight eight eight for all four\nNinety nine zero eight you

interest rate last war in the broad happy Halloween to one at all a little early and\nWe got a spooky market out there and we've been talking about that today if it's got you a little rattled well that might be a sign for you that might be some uh a reason for you to sit down and talked to a financial advisor and we have one right here in front of us Chris off the Hoffman financial group and our number is for all for\nNine zero eight eight eight so on the program we talk about this all the time you need a financial plan you need to have something that you can follow you have named it\nThe retirement roadmap so we're going to take this segment today to really drill down as to what the roadmap is so let's talk about it you talk about job one let's get an analysis of where you are right\nNow yeah current portfolio now says he got if you're going to build a road map to get to where you're going to get to know what you're starting point and so we're not just going to present you with our solution and the way we build things we want to take a look at what you have because it may fit very well with\nWhere you are in your retirement process it may be generating income for yeah we don't want to completely throw out things that you've done to this point so\nPart of it is taking what you have and doing a full assessment on it is the first step\nAnd that's what you just said this is not you come in and we completely redo what you have you may come in you may have it altogether correct\nI mean if you've got a strong equities portfolio you may have a bunch of capital gains in there that we can't sell mhm well you may say hey this is good check plus on that let's look at these other areas too much cash\nToo many bond funds those types of things go as a couple of things inside the current portfolio now certainly we are going to do a risk profile federal standard deviation which is a common financial measure of risk we're going to let you know what your exposure is to market corrections how much can you lose in a\nEconomic downturn in a market downturn and market correction so that's that stress tests that we were talking about earlier in the show that's right so you're not only get under normal circumstances how the market should behave and your portfolio will react\nBut under a kind of the Armageddon scenario the two thousand and eight the two thousand and two I remember the market goes up on an escalator and down on an elevator so when it happens it happens fast and we need to be prepared with what those results would look like got we're also going to give you an asset\nClass breakdown so we've got a comprehensive Morningstar report that we can generate for you that will basically break down all of the different asset classes that you have\nInternational domestic stocks bonds real estate commodities and show you actually what's in your portfolio because we are surprised at how many people come in\nAnd when they see that for the first time they said I didn't realize I had that much fixed income or I didn't ... I had that much real estate or commodities or even cash in my portfolio so we want to break down the ethics classes and give you a good solid look at that\nSee if you've got an e alternative investments in there and also do an insurance assessment for you\nObviously that morning star reports going to tell you the performance analysis okay how well you're doing yup and that's going to give us the past ten years of performance of those funds of the stocks of those fixed income instruments we have to take a look at the fact that two thousand and eight and\nTwo thousand a nine or dropping off and so it's going to have to take it back another year to make sure that we don't get a false reading there\nBut what can be surprising I understand you may think you're doing really well you're getting ten percent and you walk in with your chest all out and you're think I'm doing great but to find out that maybe twenty five percent of your portfolio is doing ten percent or Fifteen Percent and then some of your other things are dragging it back that would be good information and now\nYeah and that is absolutely more common than you would thing and it's not just fifty five percent of the time or sixty percent of the time it's about eighty percent of the time\nWere able to find some low hanging fruit ... some minor changes you can make even if you don't hire are firmer our advisors to do it we can give you some solid nuggets of information to go back to your current advisor or if you manage it yourself\nCome I don't give me that during the headlights look you know Georgia's distracted driving laws enforced but that doesn't mean you'll ever be stuck in traffic just download the app and keep your hands off your phone\nWith us we will seem traffic alert step on your phone your goals is to open up the before you begin your commute to drive like alerts or automatic look I'm right here phone loses enabled radio ...

back to money on land with Chris off my new there some comment [laughter]\nEvery Halloween [noise] uh right well it has been kind of an up and down market and has been kind of scary for a lot of people but there's somebody out there who is absolutely happy and in very much need of a financial advisor and there's somewhere in South Carolina [laughter]\nSomebody one the one point four billion dollar lawn really how 'bout that so a lot of money the lump sum on it I guess is around nine hundred\nMillion or two hundred million is going to go to federal taxes ... couple of hundred billion going to state taxes you're going to walk away with about a half a billion dollar little butts a couple of hundred million exactly why who cares about that\nAnd the thing is that I find interesting about this is you we look at this and see these stories of people who've lost it all and I I mean I've got one in front of me a hundred and Seventy million dollars guy named Jack Whittaker in West Virginia won the lottery he lost it all he said it just destroyed his life he\nWishing torn up the ticket really and there's plenty of people who have one twenty million thirty million forty million dollars and have lost it all so\nWhen you think you have nothing in common with this person you actually do have a lot in common with that person because whatever your fortune is your trying to protect it\nAnd you don't want to run out of money and it seems like nobody could run out of hundreds of millions of dollars but they do yeah so Chris what are some of the things I mean it's probably very uncommon for somebody to come to you would have a billion dollars yeah but it's not\nUncommon for somebody to come to you with an inheritance mom and dad just sent a house down to me some property down to me some cash down to me what do I do have\nMy honey of clients that have sold businesses for large sum\nAnd the gentleman who had a patent sold it to Novartis major amounts of money there a gentleman who sold a chateau in France major amounts of money they're like those are big events\nAnd they unfortunately face a lot of pressure from family members ... ... you know almost every case\nThat you know hey you've got ten million dollars you got twenty million dollars what's a hundred thousand dollars for me right and a hundred thousand and and you find them getting that pressure and without a financial plan and allocating it properly\nIt can go fast yeah he'll comes in if it fits in cash too long it can go out the door so it's the big advance in life now you could say well that's a great problem to have you sold the chateau and France or your soul to pat and then near a multi multi multi millionaire\nBut it presents a whole nother environment family and friends and how to manage through that\nNot to mention avoiding taxes and keeping his much of that money is humanly possible is a big component of what we do for clients that come into selling a business selling a piece of property inheriting a large inheritance we want to discuss how you keep that money going on for generations if it's that much\nWho knows me knows that I have a good friend is I call a millionaire Mike and millionaire my story is very very interesting but he uh he came into almost twenty million dollars she won a huge lawsuit for a huge company and he got a percentage of it\nSo he went out and be indulged himself for a little while but then he put himself on his salary and so basically he has a certain amount of money coming down to him every year and he lives on that\nAnd it's very sensible and this money is going to go on for a long time it's there's a trust set up for his daughter and he seems to be going about it in a very good way you gotta have some you've got to have a lawyer you got to have a CPA you got to have a financial advisor you gotta set up a trust you got to be smart about this yeah and that's why\nWe have all of that it's a holistic approach to financial planning we talk a lot about investments and I don't like mutual funds and bonds I'm not a big fan of in today's environment\nBut that's the tip of the iceberg yeah the rest of it is putting the whole thing together from a CPA perspective a tax attorney perspective to you need a trust or do you not need a trust I think sometimes trust her oversold mhm but you certainly need a plan around it as an example of a high net worth client of mind wants to leave\nAn income stream for their son right when they pass away\nAnd it's interesting how do you leave an income stream for your son\nThey're worried that he's going to take that money in a lump sum and low and slow it yeah okay\nSo there are products out there where you can have without a trustee you can have the financial institution hand equal chunks of this money out over a period of time so both the husband and wife put an investment of several hundred thousand dollars into this product\nAnd when they pass away it will go on and it will generate X amount of dollars for their son for a twenty year period of retirement\nAnd then there's another component and another component another component so it's about planning and I know it's painful for people to hear you have\nTo get going and you have to start working on it some people would rather go to the dentist and get a root canal then deal with their finances I Love to do it so just lean on us in our meetings we don't charge you to put together a financial plan\nWe get paid advisory fees\nSo if you choose to put the plan through us yes there's going to be an advisory feel know exactly what that is it will be on your fidelity statement very easy to read and know hidden fees\nBut yes we do get paid but we don't get paid for the planning side of it but a tax attorney to charge you want to get with your advisor for the vet all that stuff out and have it all organized before you get when you get the biggest they planned on\nWhether it's five hundred million dollars or it's five hundred thousand dollars we all want to make our money last\nI Know that if there's an inheritance in your future you know that there's somebody coming your way

a long time and we're expecting a significant sell off are expecting a dramatic move down in price\nAnd you can profit from that but you got to understand showed him a short selling and the great thing is is that anybody listening to us could get it and understand it it's just a matter of putting together what it looks like exactly in a lot of people get confused they think of short as something to do a time it has nothing to do a timing is everything you do a direction\nKeep it simple champ is making money in a downward move in the market the S. and P. the Russell the Dow the NASDAQ all these markets and the next whether it's the next couple of weeks months or years all these markets are going to take a major hit and if you know how to capitalize it can be a huge opportunity well the key in the market is to buy low and sell high we all know that\nBut what if something's already at a high price and it falls well shorting was short selling is a way for us to profit from that and I'm gonna give it a real world example here\nAnd look at a stock ... clack gets Kaylee ten core ticker symbol K. A. L. ac and they've been around a long time in ... near and dear to the heart of our light treat academy used to be a stock that a lot of people each do learn on and trade back a few years ago but clock as early as September ... September or early September\nAround a hundred and twenty dollars a share I so if you got to buy a hundred shares that'll cost you about twelve grand and so what's important to understand is that as the market started to fall and we started losing the technology sector because this stock sits in the technology sector there's been up to to make money when it fell\nAnd so short short selling would have been a really good opportunity for if you understood what to do and so clack Kaylee sea in early September trading at a hundred and twenty bucks you know here's the thing that a lot of people get confused on\nHow can I make money selling something if I don't already own it in other words how can I sell ... if I don't if you buy at the store with well that's a beautiful thing about the financial markets that are broken will allow us to sell shares of their inventory into the market before price falls\nWith the goal of us than buying it back and giving it back to the broker after prices fall so let me give an example on clack\nLet's just say in September eighth of cancer right around that time you decided to use the clock was going to fall in price and you went into the markets and you said I Want to sell a hundred she has a clock\nNow it's a hundred and twenty bucks a share so your broker would basically say okay we have inventory that you can sell and we'll let you utilize our fears of clock to sell into the market at a hundred and twenty bucks a share so what we're doing is we're going into our trading platform we're executing a short sale\nAnd what that does that sells a hundred shares of ... into the market at a hundred and twenty bucks a share on our behalf\nNow understand we don't own the stock broker owns the stock they're allowing us to utilize their shares to sell into the market at the market price which was a hundred and twenty so we do that now we're considered short the stock now here's what happens\nWe believe prices gonna fall well here seven weeks later class at Ninety and it's it's actually happen so we using a real world example at clock at Ninety you decide at nine you're going to bite back so when you go into the market and buy it back because you Ninety bucks this year to buy it back when you sold that you took it a hundred and twenty\nWhen you bought a back it cost you Ninety\nNow the moment you brought it back the shares that came out of your broke has it been toy originally now when you buy back immediately go back into your broke his inventory in other words they're made whole with their shares of clock they got their stock back\nNow what did you do well you sold at a hundred and twenty and several weeks later you bought it at Ninety think about that you bought low and sold high you just sit in reverse order that's a beautiful thing about the markets we can do that\nIt's a real strategy it's called shorting short selling and that's why we're talking about we banging the drum every week you need to understand how to make money regardless of direction and because of that you just made thirty bucks to share on the stock that fell that you've never own thinking about that\nSo in a hundred years you made three grand on a thousand Jews you make thirty grand\nThink about that folks that opportunity is real and exist and it happens all the time in the market and we get movement Dallek well she had a lot of lately this tremendous opportunity the market now imagine if the S P falls forty to fifty percent like a lot of people are calling for magic view is short that position\nWhat could that turned into your financial life see the beautiful thing about the markets is up is good and down is good once you realize that\nIt's a game changer well exactly and that's why online trading and kept me the sponsor bulls and bears they teach people how to short so\nThey teach people how to capitalize on a downward moving the market the average person knows it can happen they don't know how to do it\nAnd that's why they teach those classes a five hundred dollar class that they teach at the campus\nAnd we actually have a few seats for this class to give away the losers right now now if you have money out there in the market in the ... and the irate if you're concerned about a correction you want to capitalize on that direction this is the opportunity for you do not want to miss out on this is the

exactly\nDon't forget to check that out she had one of the things that you know it's key when you're trading investing as managing your own money a lot of people out there the average guy who's working for corporate America or the lady who's you know\nWorking out by the corporate ladder you know they have four one K. is they have maybe some old four one K. they moved to ... the average person's not managing their own money and that's paramount when it comes to having long term success in the financial markets let's take a moment let's talk about what that means really to self directed self manage\nWell the problem is many people don't they they're sophisticated enough demand your own money 'cause Wall Street has I'm convinced of that maybe they think it's way too complicated and it's really not a hard process which you understand it\nThe key thing is is is if you don't learn how to control your own money then you're going to have money into management you gonna pay exorbitant fees it's amazing that\nAnd the average four one K. people will pay over a hundred and fifty thousand dollars in fees over the course of a twenty five year four one K. think about that folks hundred and fifty grand goes to some Wall Street firms some entity\nGoldman Sachs citadel UPS CIA craft there those trust you have your phone K they they wrote the charter they wrote the prospect is\nAnd you pay them and you pay them whether you make money or not\nThe only guaranteed return on your phone cases the fees that you pay here's the problem most you don't understand the fees 'cause you sign the paperwork with the Lord's you\nWith the match the company match so when you sign up for the four one K. they offered you the company match you went whoa that's free money chip it's not free money because now you're gonna have to basically put your money into a position where somebody's going to manage it you've got to pay a hundred and fifty thousand dollars or more in fees over twenty five years and you can only make money one direction\nThink about that you bought that you ... you went all in and the reality is is is those fees are going to crush your ... your long term profitability they're going to hurt you badly overtime and what we see is that when people learn the skills of south right when you take that bucket of money yourself\nAnd there's not a complicated process to do this you can learn the skills of self directing and you can profit regardless of direction and you don't have to pay those fees which long term gives you a much better chance of hitting those financial goals\nWell and that's the key is long term being able to set up a plan that's going to be able to work for you now be able to work for you later and ultimately gets you to where you want to be chipped there's a lot of people out there if you ask them Wendy when do you want to retire and their answers now said well what are you doing now to get ready for retirement and the thing they're doing nothing there's just\nThere's working well the average American is way short financially of ever been able to retire at their current standard of living see that's the real issue\nAnybody can retire but can you retire at the lifestyle that you currently live the lifestyle you want to live\nAnd the real problem isn't the biggest issue with the baby boomer generation is that they're worried about run out of money before they die so the system that you're in for one k.'s manage diaries has you worried about run out of money before you die now I have students at all like to get him that's been six to ten hours a month managing their own nest egg they manage their own IRA\nAnd they make decisions in that and those decisions are built around trying to make one percent a month thinking about that if you can make one percent among one of them are goes up to our side we can do that consistently over time you put that a compound and calculator it gets powerful\nAnd the problem is is that many people can't make one percent of the market goes down they don't profit they lose they needed to go up for them to profit and ultimately because of all of this turns in price of the market and these fees they never hit the goals\nSelf directing a learning the skills to take control that bucket is essential to long term success and more and more people we're seeing this Adam\nAre coming out of the woodwork saying I Need to learn how to control my own money because the mass of my account says I'm going to run out of money before I die the Math Doesn't work and I need to change the formula and you know what that former means no chain that formula means\nSelf directing taking control that bucket and making the decision to self 'cause who cares more about your money then you you should be in control of it you should be making those decisions and ultimately you could hit those long term goals if you get the consistency and that kind of ... monthly return that we're focused on\nAnd that's key the long term goal that long term goals are gonna separate you from the masses online training academy they have a class specifically on self directing your brand new to the market or you maybe you've been in the market and you've never thought about managing your money yourself until now\nThey have a class specifically on at this is a five
