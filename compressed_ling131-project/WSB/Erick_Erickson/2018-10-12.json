C. school and I don't ... I I Can't imagine obviously they will have quite a fifty fifty take over the Georgia did at Notre Dame well there'll be a good pocket of Georgia fans I expect that but there's a hundred and two thousand seats in here and I don't I don't suspect LSU turn it over their tickets that easy\nYou know it's funny that was after the next thing I wanted to ask considering what happened last year it feels like fans are willing to travel a little bit more consistently and certainly for the big games and you would argue this is probably one of the biggest games on the schedule I don't think anyone thought it was going to be at the beginning of the season LSU sort of being a surprise coming out of the west\nSo in terms of fan base what does that do to help the Georgia team on the field is it not really matter once the game starts\nWell Kirby said that he doesn't really know how much of the fans are going to help us wants a begging in between the lines because they're just going to be so many LSU people here but the players know it Terry got one had mentioned earlier this week that it's you know it it is it is extremely nice to see pockets of red and black no matter where George she goes and this is\nEasily the toughest road game they'll have to play all season even though Kentucky's kinda boosted its atmosphere a little bit this is this is the one that that makes you break it year here this is the one that can prove that\nGeorgia is a legit national title contender again if you come into tiger stadium and get that scalp here on the road that solidifies Georgia's number two ranking for sure uh last lately doesn't in the season but it's certainly solidifies Georgia Jay if\nI Can't get you on hold for just a quick second undo traffic because I Want to come back and find out what our coverage plan is for tomorrow let's go check in first with just rainbow that got traffic\nOverwhelmed by the you know a barking dog or a beer baby by the WNBA jak you what do you do when you find out the forty five minutes\nIn the spring to go around us that still on to the south got Dr exit number Fifteen you also have\nI got older I started going all the way up to five starting around the airport nor nor do I want to go to our unproductive twenty seven forty miles around oil Dr Allen\nGeorge and number two LSU numbers Thirteen they're playing Saturday afternoon tiger stadium where here with WSBIU sport's director Jay Black who was there live in Louisiana and Jay the question is what what can fans expect what is the programming for W.

S. U.

didn't sign it he is the secretary of state he has to follow the law and that is the law that's like saying you know what I don't like the fact that stop signs actually mean stop and so we are

quiet the doubters and put a big scalp on his resume all the five and won tigers can't afford another lost if they want to win the rug and as these the west are tailgate show tomorrow starts at eleven thirty kickoff returning from Baton Rouge day likeable to estimate\nThat it there is some worker down in some some basement manually keen this stuff in and got a name wrong and it's the voter that's getting or the the the newly a ... you know send in voter registration applications who's being shafted\nThat's your responsibility and if you moved around two or three times and the last known registered ID that you have on file shows one city one state one address and you move to a different city different address\nThat's again up to you to fix that incorrect it\nThat is not up to the state to figure out where you are\nIt's up to you\nSo this is this is all a basically this is Stacey Abrams doing everything she can to play a game she's playing the voter disenfranchisement card is about time it came out because you know that's a ... attack a typical tactic that they use rank him has absolutely no way of avoiding the law you wanna you don't like the law fight\nTo change the law I got to go to get a phone call here Johnny from Dallas weighing in on this journey welcome\n[laughter] hey man I'm so I wanted to call about something my sister received in the mail today she lives up here in our little Georgia\nAnd she received in the mail today a letter from Stacey Abrams for a absentee ballot and it's actually gotten application or absentee ballot okay and it says\nA registration address is somewhere in Douglas bill but her current address her mailing address and then Carter's though and it's a name sort of similar to hers but it's an actual application for absentee ballot with her address as a mailing address\nAnd this other person whose name so\nWhat we are concerned about is if you know\nOh do we just lose you oh\nThere you go there you go we got you got your back hey Jenny let me let me get you to do this because I Want to make sure we don't miss this if I'm going to put you on hold real quick because we've got to do a quick look at traffic do that we've got ... we'll get back to Johnny from Dallas\nI Love over at a lot of vehicle crash on friday about six thirty no bigger than the spring of ... right after ... road exit\nFive or just after the freeway and we've got a vehicle that block so far what part of Oregon that they're going to a lot more delays running back to the artist and all the other part of it are in trouble if\nIt came out over an hour to go to ... watch out from under around to the airport duty five tour guide earlier trouble at night or or they're\nThere to got to you as you say is now under our like fifty to fifty five minutes from now what do you know Dr what's likely to defy already five and then the closer you are the triple the power to them and looks at me like there's a new problem I Would if I was told the forty eight Allen\nAll right let's get back to Johnny from Dallas who was talking about getting a male or his sister getting a male or that looked like a request for an absentee ballot but didn't have the correct information on it sent from the Abrams campaign so did your sister actually request an absentee ballot\nNegative negative um she goes to the polls just like I Do every time there's a chance to vote and and the the scary thing about this mailer as it came in with a legitimate application for absentee ballot with the information filled in an unnamed that's similar to my sister's\nUm but but not her name and basically if she was designed her name and mailed a thin if she was inclined to because she's a an Abrams voter or a Democrat or whatever she could potentially get this absentee ballot in under this\nThis this different name vote for Abrams on absentee ballot and they go to the polls and vote again and and to me this is if nothing else highly unethical\nWell even even uh even trying to incite voter fraud for her own gang why why is Stacey Abrams as a candidate allowed to send out absentee ballots to potential voters with information filled that\nWell it's strange when you said maybe you'll be getting a double vote but what if it's also a way to sort of either cancel a vote or negate a vote as being a showing two votes from one person trying to go for camp showing one for camp one for Abramson it negates the boat I don't know um exactly it's it's interesting journey appreciate your bringing that up and maybe you should bring that up to the Kemp campaign just all the way we are\nWe've called the ... campaign where we're gonna emailed us to them we're going to call the ethics committee or ... or whoever the ethics department as on Monday when they're open again because this to me screens voter fraud and in it and it it you know it just plays into all those Democrats tactics you always hear about\nYou know the other thing and trying to do is get somebody who would normally go to the polls say you know what they were convenient not pay attention fill it out ended up casting a vote for Abrams when they would have gone to the pole and cast a vote for camp yeah there's there's ... there's a lot of fishing is if that's what you're saying\nThat there's a lot of fishing has to this and and I feel like the the voters in Georgia and need to understand that this kind of thing is happening\n[noise] and and and we need to watch this because I Know this year in Georgia there has been an unusually high number of absentee ballot requests and and what if it's because of things like\nThat that's a good point hey Jenny I get to a couple of calls but thank you let us know if you find out anything more on that once you submitted to the campaign you know where we are here every weekday five to seven um it's very quickly see if I get to Josh calling in Josh welcome to Atlanta as evening news\nOr Alan how're you doing good we got about a minute and a half what's up\nOkay is this super quick callers that called right before the uh six o'clock or I guess about ... change to answer his question\nThe state legislator would have to introduce a new bill to the floor would have to be voted upon in the law would then be changed if they've got an a vote you learned it in your basic civics class which is why the state of Georgia and they used to bring civics classes that\nOkay and I don't I maybe I misheard them I thought he was saying whose responsibility is to let people know about the law and I'm like I don't think the ... campaign has\nTo do although they should but yeah absolutely if you don't like the law where you got to get a legislator to bring up a bill get it on the floor debate it go through the house go through the Senate and make sure that both versions end up being reconciled on nine crossover day and put it on governor deals\nDesk or whoever the next governor is Yes sir\nAll right Josh thanks for the call appreciate that yeah you know I I have a huge issue with this line from the story\nFrom the lawsuit that says that the Abrams camp is demanding that camps office should cease using the exact match law going forward they're basically saying via a lawsuit\nWe don't like the fact that you're following the law so we demand you break the law because we feel like by following the law you're keeping people from voting those same people who couldn't figure out how to make sure that the application filled out the existing data on the databases already within the state it's just I have a
