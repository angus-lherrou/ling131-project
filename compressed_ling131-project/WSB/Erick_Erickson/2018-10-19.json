on this but I'm going to actually maybe I Do want to get on my soapbox here\nThe reason we're having these fights is because Washington has become too powerful Washington has become way too powerful\nOur founders never intended it to be so in a lot of it by the way does have to do with the Supreme Court seeding more and more power to Washington allowing Congress to pass things off to the court I mean that the Supreme Court is is uh he'll die on here now\nI'm\nThe Supreme Court the Congress the president they do way more than they were ever intended to do and that means national politics in this country has gotten way out of hand\nCongress was given limited powers in the constitution and they've overstretched their bounds we would not be having these visceral fights in this country to the extent that we are if Washington mattered as much as the founders intended it to matter\nInstead it has gone way out of bounds way overboard and every single fight is a massive fight because Washington controls everything that's why we are where\nWe are and neither side really wants to rein that in you have a group of conservatives who want to smaller Washington DC and of course are liberals are fighting them but Republicans are fighting them as well Republicans in Washington have for years did they wanted to to defending Washington and since our back to the states but they haven't actually lived up to that they haven't actually funded that\nAh they've been growing Washington just like the Democrats have and now we're in a situation where the Supreme Court control so much of our country culturally in morally not just legislatively or even keeping Congress within the bounds of the president\nBut on moral issues as well from abortion and gay marriage we can't allow the fifty states through democratic process these to decide these issues the Supreme Court has to every he'll as a he'll die on now in Washington and it shouldn't be that way\nBut the result of this by making Washington so powerful and making it'd be the be all end all of every fight in every issue on on every subject\nIs people are turning violent against each other\nNow there are other issues as well I don't want to super simplified but\nBy and large what it is is people feel like they gotta fight every fight is monumental when it comes to politics because of Washington DC and how much power it has and the margins are so narrow now when every vote counts and we are seeing it turned violent it should not be that way\nEveryone should be able to find the state they want to live in with a diversity of politics and ideas and live there\nAnd leave everyone else alone but now because Washington and just everything is one size fits all everything's a fight this is not sustainable in any

and the media\nHas convinced them that they're not going to be able to vote when they could\nMean Brian Kemp is doing more to encourage people by the way in two thousand six team we had record breaking number of minority voters voting in Georgia and registering to vote in Georgia and brain can put this was the secretary of state\nThere is no there there were these complaints and yet so many people are running these complaints and complaints including people in the media and I find it really disingenuous I find the media spin in this not just the Democrats but the actual media spin it really really disingenuous\n[noise] and it's disappointing\nUm but that's what I'm here for disabuse people these facts and that's one reason I asked and we'll get a Brian Kemp he's going to be with me for the hour on Monday at four pm\nTo talk about the campaign to talk about voter registration issues to talk about these issues of how voters are process on in the polls\nAre looking forward to talking to him be sure to be here he'll be in Studio with me at four o'clock on Monday we'll try to do a video life's dream of it as well now let's step out and see how can this Friday I don't\nDo that by the travel by the dog the dog too many lives down the gap earning exit number do rather than trying to think about this plot half of the interstate arrogant planes or blood\nWork road got better out of the trouble is clear that I think Seventy five hundred Seventy five twenty\nFive minutes over George memorial at forty one [laughter]\nAll right now I Want to talk about the mega millions jackpot is crossed a billion dollars which is unheard of 'em\nSo now these numbers are a little bit off then I'm going to give you now because it was written with the jackpot nine hundred Seventy million dollars supposed to over a billion but essentially\nUm first of all if you win then remember that if you take the annuity in your the payout over Thirty years you're gonna wind up getting more money than the lump sum and I know some of you you're okay with that you want the lump sum it's going to wind up being over three hundred million dollar lump sum payment\nOr closer to four hundred million dollars now I'm after federal taxes you're going to wind up with about four hundred six ... million dollars now there are some catches that are worth noting in the ... let's see right now I'm\nA detergent you're going to wind up yes after\nFederal taxes right now you're going to wind up with four hundred twenty nine million eight hundred and fifty six thousand dollars if you do the ... after your first your taxes and it's going to be twenty five million three hundred thirty three thousand three hundred thirty three dollars but now wait wait wait there there is\nA nother issue here worth\nNoting and that is that you got state\nTaxes as well and I'm kind of shocked ah life hacker dot com has listed this ... first of all the number of states that don't\nTax a lottery winnings is a pretty interesting in Delaware and Florida don't do it California doesn't tax the California doesn't tax lottery winnings um what other states some states taxes\nA lower rate than their income tax rate as well I'm a trend to skim through I Know Texas does at New Hampshire doesn't\nUm ... where else in here\nYeah Texas does not Puerto Rico does not South Dakota does not Tennessee does not the Virgin Islands do not a Washington state does not uh Wyoming does not some states have an income tax but they don't text lottery winnings here's what I find disturbing and sad Georgia\nWheel tax it at six percent\nSo you're in New Jersey you're going to get a ... million nine hundred and forty thousand dollar in taxes owed\nIf you do the lump sum payout in Georgia you're going to oh roughly thirty three million dollars in taxes and you're going to get a a payout of somewhere around three hundred eighty four thousand dollars and let me see this with with a billion dollars up to okay three hundred and Ninety five thousand\nA missed three hundred and twenty five million dollars in other words with Georgia the point here is that\nWe have a very high state income tax and George compared to a lot of other states even Illinois Illinois a a state that is not very well run and loves to tax people has a lower income tax than the state of Georgia Indiana has a lower income tax than the state of Georgia\nA South Carolina is slightly higher but the overall business taxes in in South Carolina or less you look at all of the states around us uh from Alabama to uh Florida to Tennessee to North Carolina to South Carolina\nWhat really stands out in my mind is that uh there's no economic incentive for you to buy your lottery ticket and live in Georgia\nGeorgia has higher taxes than any of the states around us you will actually make less money from winning the billion dollar jackpot in Georgia\nThen if you live in one of the other states and that's something I think our politicians should pay attention to\nAnd meanwhile the choice couldn't be even more clear in the state ... really has an adult now saying she's in favor of tax cuts when actually she campaigned up until three weeks ago campaign on even repealing the tax break we got this past year she wants to raise taxes\nAre making George even more uncompetitive\nI really think this is something that\nAs a state law makers should look at and I don't mean exempting lottery winnings I mean figuring out a way to make us more economically competitive with the tax code and everything else\n[noise] Atlanta's
