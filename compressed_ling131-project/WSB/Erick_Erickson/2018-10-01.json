S.\nOn the income tax she wanted to get rid of the income tax cut she scrambling a a a all over the place and Brian Kemp is not\nAnd that suggested the Abrams campaign do they released a poll purporting to show they were in the lead a it has some internal data suggesting they are not\nAnd that is I think significant\n... she's the one who was scrambling right now um she's the one who is trying to change your positions on stuff\nAnd she's also on the attack against Brian kept very aggressively they flew a plane over ... this weekend are claiming he supported Tennessee nobody even to the sea fans don't support Tennessee that that's\nThat is less believable than than Stacey Abrams claiming she didn't really want to blow up Stone Mountain after holding on to that position for so long but\nThere is this is where we are in this campaign ... all you got to do is look and see who is scrambling and who was not\nYou do not see the Republicans in Georgia scrambling you see the Democrats in Georgia scrambling a and the scrambling is not the scrappy ... they're getting momentum it's the scrambling of oh my gosh we've got to do damage control we're seeing something in our internal polling we haven't made public\nAnd what I'm hearing from outside groups\nIs that the Abrams negatives are going up\nAnd kept negatives are not what I have noticed in my own household is that the Democratic party in Georgia has been an inordinate amount of money on male pieces to women\nAnd they're not using their money why usually in that they're targeting women who are considered hard Republicans that he's you absolutely no they're going to vote Republican and everybody else as well as just a a scattershot if you're a woman in Georgia\nWho is voting age you're getting bombarded bombarded\nWith ongoing male campaigns from the Democrats attacking Brian Kemp uh they're attacking him for all sorts of things and you have to give Casey Cagle some credit here [noise]\nChemical attack killed on a lot of the same things that Stacey Abrams is attacking jump on and the result is that\nThese attacks are working on ... because everybody shirt I'm already meanwhile no one's heard of the attack so Stacey Abrams like for example you can say well you you know people who were the ... have found my taxes we got an extension I'm going to the Irish or some money or not much but all of them some\nAnd Stacey Abrams in the same bed although ... she owes them fifty thousand dollars so that that's understandable and that's not the attack the attack is that she got money instead of ...\nSo for taxes she gave it to her campaign that's a legitimate argument about how can you trust her with her money and on top of that you've got the situation with her wanting to get rid of the tax cut that the Republicans put in place this past year so think about those things noodle on them I got some more here but first we got to go check with Doug terrible Doug any more cows out there\nNot

urge you not to take my word for it take the word of the Republican National committee the national Republican congressional committee and the national Republican Senatorial Committee that is there is a real worry shaping up\nThat Republican voters are so convinced immediate demand the media is lying that this has has so down into the polling and Republicans are just adamantly convinced\nThat they're going to win that momentum as on their side that is going to be huge mow the problem with that is it's not true based on the data everyone is seen\nThe Democrats are more mobilized and Republicans in the reason Democrats are more mobilized and Republicans as because Republicans have gotten complacent because of this\nRepublicans are so convinced they've got it in the bag that and they're not mobilizing the way Democrats are no thankfully the cabinet nomination is mobilizing Republicans to some degree but I'm hearing from a political was in Georgia that this is starting to affect Georgia races that shouldn't be\nContested races ... should not be heavily contested races\nAnd it's starting to impact them here because Republicans are sitting on the sidelines I cannot tell you the number of people running for office who have urged me again and again to tell Republicans that you cannot sit home you cannot keep them places you have to get fired up because so many of them are so many are convinced that the polling is wrong\nThat they're going to wake up the day after election day and realize it's a huge nightmare it is potentially now beginning to impact the Senate races and that is a huge huge troubling issue\nIn that it's impacting the Senate races the reason it's a huge huge troubling issue is because the Republicans could potentially be making gains here but Republican apathy is starting to affect those Senate races as well\nI'm across the board Republicans are looking like they're going to have a very bad year at the ballot box not so much because of Democrats but because of Republican themselves are convinced they got it in the bag and they're not showing up so I just I got to tell you\nKnow you don't have to take my word for it you can call the orange gene called the ... you can call the Republican governor says she stopped all of them talk to any campaign\nThey're all starting to freak out that Republicans have bought the idea that the media is lying to them so much that they believe the polls are completely wrong and there's no reason to go out because we've already got it in the bag and boy I don't know those people I I I don't know anybody who's eggs in the bag\nBut all these consultants and all these candidates for office at the Senate level the gubernatorial level the congressional level they're really freaking out that

indictment on these people that they think it's impossible to drink without blacking out\nAnd for them it probably isn't for a couple of them they've done plenty of things they regret and some of them have had to go to rehab\nBut they are taking their own indiscretions and putting them on Brett Kavanaugh understand that it is really ridiculous to see some of these people in D.C who I Know have drug habits\nI shouldn't say I know they have drug habits I let's just say there is enough office gossip and the same the as much corroborating evidence from from Christine Blasey Ford is there are there's some of these people who are bad mouth the red capital have drug habits\n\nAnd they're going after Brett Kavanaugh attacking break out of it all\n\nBecause they look at their own life and they say you know I Can't drink that much without blacking out and doing things I regret say must be the same way with him they're using their own experience on his anecdote but his data\nAnd that's a very dangerous thing but it's what they're doing because they've got nothing else these are all partisans\nThese are all partisans now capitals roommate Dan Murphy has come out and and he's released a statement and said quote I never saw Brett blackout\nOr not be able to remember the prior evenings events nor did I ever see Brett act aggressively hospital or in a sexually aggressive manner to women Britain was and is a good natured kind and friendly person\nThere you go\nBut they're going to believe people who never hung out with Brett capital\nThey're going to believe people who are partisan activists who don't want to rightward tilt industry where they're gonna believe all of these things\nThey're going to believe Christine Blasey Ford's junk science and they're going to move the goalposts from sexual assault so let's find out about his drinking I saw people they say well he lie he lied to the Senate seat he said he never drink an ex has actually he said there were times you drink in excess\nBut with these people have decided is that drinking in excess means you blacked out no drinking in excess means you've got drunk maybe got really sloppy drunk\nBut it doesn't mean you blacked out it doesn't mean you wake up on the couch in the how did I get here\nAnd that's what they've decided it means because that's their experience that is their life experience and so there can demean Brett Kavanaugh now for their own sense\nAnd they are shaping Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to be a lie because in their experience it would be a lie\nIs really unfortunate but that's where we've come with this show many members of the media\nHave gone into the tank against Kavanaugh\nYou know I have spent time on this program taking angry phone calls from you guys for defending the press against the president's attacks I I don't know that I should spend any more time ever doing that considering just how blatantly biased members of the media have become\nIn this matter they are not reporting things fairly accurately or honestly\nThey're blatantly mischaracterized things are running with the most ... stories NBC News has decided they're gonna run with Mike Lebanese clients story these are the same people who the other day reported that other Kavanaugh accuser come forward and when it was finally revealed there was no accuser it was an anonymous letter about an anonymous claim about a third party\nAnd now they're going to run this stuff\nWe're going to have to Wade through this entire week folks were going to have to Wade through the week and on friday there will be a vote and I suspect as it stands right now Brett Kavanaugh was going to be on the Supreme Court I Hope so\nA lot of evening news very Gary breaking\nNews or militias accurate and defend all five day
