O'Rourke campaign is starting to fade in Texas in the run up to the election and people realized he's not Bible suddenly the media is like oh we got a progressive\nIn Georgia and there is a reason\nThat the Democrats are right now focused on this voter registration issue in Georgia\nAnd it has nothing to do with mobilizing their base if anything it's keeping their voters from turning out by making them think they're not going to be able to vote if they show up so why bother there is a reason there highlighting this you need to know what it is I'll explain it to you when we come back\n\nWhen you ask me about ... media group station\nOne twenty four hour news weather and\nFive and a um\n\nKnow it is five o'clock I met ... live in the U.S the twenty four hour news center this is the land is the evening news President Trump is making right now meeting with officials there about damage from middle to south the southwest Georgia the president in front of reporters now just moments ago we\nJust left Florida and they're so ...\nBut they're not really because this was brutal they haven't seen any they live\nPossibly that hasn't been as it was almost two hundred miles and this\nThe foundation so so some areas that were hard to believe actually actually to believe that the people are incredibly slow in Georgia about\nTo we need to go and they got a little bit of the residents of this ones are the ones off of it so critical people but I Want to thank FEMA was first responders and law enforcement has been so incredible\nAnd Stacey Abrams trying to avoid peaking too soon\nBy suddenly now getting a bunch of national media attention she was on wood Jake Tapper this weekend on CNN she was on with Chuck Todd on meet the press answering questions focusing on the voter suppression ... this is this is the issue about what she has been passionate for a very long time\nShe's conducted a numerous unsuccessful voter registration drives over the years\nAnd he it seems one of the things that is it being said is that these fifty three was fifty seven other states fifty three thousand people\nWho can't vote actually can vote they just have to take their id to the polls but on top of that there's another issue and it is that many of these people didn't fill out their voter registration paperwork he was other people probably those affiliated with the Abrams campaign they filled it out in screwed it up\nSo the people who are being disenfranchised they probably weren't even going to show up anyway if you're an old if you're over Thirty years old and you have never registered to vote the odds of you show up in November to voters slim to none to begin with\nBut they got registered and now they've given a headline and it looks like Brian ... is denying people the right to vote and that's simply not true Georgia is a state where the law has an exact match law and that means your voter registration paperwork has to exactly match your driver's license\nIf it doesn't what you have to do is show up at the polls with your driver's license and get it fixed on that day you vote\nNo the Democrats are leaving that part of the story and here's a big fear that some Democrats are starting to express\nThe the anger and rage about this is going to keep some people from voting in November\nBy seeing all these people are having their votes denied by saying brand Cuba suppressing the vote by St brand give us throwing people off the rules are going to keep people from showing up people are gonna say well my vote doesn't matter so why should I go vote\nAnd it's a fair point and by the way\nYes that's what the Democrats are doing\nAnd it is very intentional they do wore black voters to show up and vote the Democrats don't oh that's so counter to do it it was you know I had lost my mind bear with me there's a message to the madness you're paying attention to be but first let's go check with mark ... ... the gay\nHello Aaron human by third and fourth being

shoulder to shoulder already crowded break down again\n[laughter]\nThank you very much okay you got to bear with me here\nWhat is the maximum percentage vote for Democrats in Georgia State why\nThe answer is forty five percent Michelle Nunn against David Perdue forty five percent of the vote Roy Barnes against 'em again ... Nathan Deal get forty five percent of the vote\nRub orange against Sonny Perdue got forty five percent of the vote Jason Carter against I'm Nathan Deal got forty four percent of the vote [noise]\nAh what's his name uh who ran against Saxby Chambliss a God I'm forty five percent vote Democrats in Georgia get forty five percent of the vote and Democrats in Georgia had been peddling this missed two major donors that the state has dramatically shifted in their direction\nExcept what all the polls show right now\nStacey Abrams is forty five percent of the vote the only poll that shows Stacey Abrams was more than forty five percent of the vote you Stacey Abrams own poll\nEvery outside poll has Stacey Abrams a forty five percent of the vote some of them have brand kept tied some of them have brand Cuba head all of them have Stacey Abrams a forty five ... she's at the Democratic ceiling in Georgia she has nowhere to go\nBut she has been pushing the mythology\nFor four years that she is an expert at getting people registered to vote she has been pushing the mythology that she could drive up the vote she's been pushing the mythology that she would build a coalition of progressive\nBlack and urban white voters and they would push or cross the finish line she's been pushing the mythology that Georgia is now a purple state or a blue state she's been pushing the mythology that the Democrats\nCould finally seize power interestingly enough four years ago when um when Jason Carter was running as Nathan Deal she was thinking it was going to be twenty twenty two or so before Democrats could take part but now she's the nominee and she thinks now is the time\nExcept she has hit her peak she ... she is nowhere to go so what she's got to do\nIs she's got to convince every one that the reason she lost is not because she's been wrong all this time not that she's been invested in pushing a mythology of his time is the brand kept stole the election\n[noise] she's got to tell people that Brian Kemp suppress the vote Brian kill denied people the right to vote Brian Kemp and those awful Republicans\nThey ring did so she could win and so we're gonna have to mobilize the outrage and informal ...\nShould be able to do it that's what's happening right now but here's the thing\nShe has gotten some voters really fired up and early voting has a gun\nRepublicans in Georgia are kind of worried that it's going to be close\nRepublicans in Georgia are worried about the down ballot races no one really thinks that Brian Kemp is going to lose even among the Democrats\nBut it looks like so many Republicans have convinced themselves he's going to win that their phone and it in\nAnd they may think he's got it in the back so they don't show up or they go show up and they check the box for brand given leave and the down bell racist it's the state legislature in Georgia that's going to be impacted\nRepublicans in Georgia aren't really worried about Brian ... they're worried about the down ballot races they're worried about how many seats they lose in the house in the Senate because they are deeply worried that Republicans have gotten so confident in Georgia\nThat's going to hurt those damp outrageous\nIt solved is very weird election day jockeying for position messaging situation\nBut among Democrats nationally the reason that some of them have become upset with Stacey Abrams here at the end of the campaign is because they're convinced she's talking down her own base\nThey become convinced that Stacey Abrams by pushing this this voter registration message that Brian Cuba's nine people who are right to vote that they're sending all sorts of messages that hey don't even bother going to vote because you're not going to be able to impact things\nBut she's got to do that\nStacey Abrams has to convince Democrats did not go vote now\nAnd the reason Stacey Abrams has to convince Democrats not to go vote is because she's already lost\nSo now she's got to make it look like the deck stacked against her and\nBrian Kemp cheated because she's been telling\nGeorge Soros types for years now and not just Soros but all sorts of major left wing activist groups nationally who's invested in her nonprofits do voter registration in Georgia to do all of these things in Georgia she's convinced them all that she was going to do great that she had the voter registration map down\nAnd so now we're having all the screaming and complete because it really hasn't panned out the way she promised\nShe can admit that it's her fault the Democrats can admit it's their fault\nSo it's got to be brand keeps fault they got to make him the fall guy not for the voters\nBut for the Democratic donors whose money they still want to come into Georgia to try to swing to the Democratic side they're going to see how that brand kept guy he stole this election he stole it from us if you keep sending us more money after we blow it all will
