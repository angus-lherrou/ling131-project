I I don't remember this level of vitriol and our political process\nIt's you know it's really got very angry and I think\nA lot of these races where you have um a woman democratic gets a a woman Republican it amped up a little bit and then we saw today with uh the bomb threats everyone has to sort of brain the temperature down a bit um this is not how\nThe process as a should work and it's really gotta stop\nWell speaking of bringing the temperature down I I Want to ask you about that but first we got to step out as we always have to inject with ...\nThanks very much most of the of the wild and this guy got here and we're going to pick up the going door crosswind but it'll take a while about a quarter mile up the phone and he by north north of Jimmy Carter boulevard the bugs\nThat

traffic in Atlanta that we will suffer through I I Do want to ask you though ... temperature down instead of talking about you're going to look let's talk about you and your campaign and what are you hearing from people on the campaign trail out there right now [noise]\nI Am hearing a lot of very positive feedback\nAll across it in six district there's a lot of energy a for Republicans in the ... district I Am you know me I always run like a temp voice behind\nUm so I'm they keep the pedal to the metal all the way through to them for sex but you know I I think the biggest thing people see is just\nAll of this outside money pouring in and you know just this afternoon another three hundred and twenty five thousand dollars book I'm On behalf of my opponent but everybody's working hard and\nAs among Republicans everyone understands what's at stake and understand that you know the economy is going so well\nAnd and we are finally getting things done and we do not want to\nTurn back the clock on on all of that progress\nI hear that a lot from people as well the the idea of turning back the clock here to eat in regards to ... and in order to roll back some of the education reforms governor deal is made\nWith Democrats in tax cuts um ... what do you see is the big issue moving forward ... assuming you get reelected in in\nThe cook political indexes I think moved you into the likely Republican category which is good do do do stop running like your ten points behind though don't take it for granted but ... if you get reelected ... if the Republicans are in the majority\nCome next year what's your big issue that you really want to get done\nAnd saying now that we have addressed the revenue side of the ledger in terms of the federal government at getting the economy going again it is and here it is that we turn our attention to the spending side of our financial ledger because\nWashington really does have a spending problem and it's tough to deal with with cutting the budget when we have so many people unemployed we now have the lowest unemployment in decades imperative to get to deal with a year and your deficit and the long term debt\nI'm Glad you said that because I Do have this real concern\nWith Republicans right now and and if they don't take back the house or the ... having to rely on Senate Republicans with the\nNancy Pelosi majority in in the house to do anything about the debt and deficit and seems like the Democrats only solution is tax increases but uh I haven't really seen a lot of Republicans willing to to own up to we need to do some spending cuts\nYet so we've had a guy in black has long had a bill to do it across the board one percent cut we never get enough votes to get that across the finish line and across it in the Senate and the president has now asked every agency had to submit a proposal of what a five percent\nCut would look like I'm all of these things so I think we will start to uh once we keep the majority start to see some of the tension there for for the listeners you might think about Social Security or Medicare look we'll get the obligation that we have\nTwo individuals who are on on Social Security and Medicare we get that and I don't want to have anyone feel worried about that on that day but don't worry they shouldn't worry about the Democrat Medicare for all plant\nWhich will end Medicare as we know it and it'll prohibit employer based insurance program so they'll get worried about bad about how the ... but I think everyone would agree that we've got to get serious about uh the building spending\nYou know you mentioned this Medicaid for all thing I I realize you've got a number of Democrats including the lady from New York City calls herself socialist and Bernie Sanders wanted this plan and\n... every projection I've seen says that even if you were to tax people at a hundred percent of their income you wouldn't have the money to pay for this thing and yet they seem to think it will pay for itself\n... it's it's inexplicable to me the numbers don't add up\nBut what is even worse is that it would be basically Obamacare to ... and take\nA healthcare system and turned it into a full throttle government run government takeover of health care which is exactly what we don't need they don't need more government in health care we need less\nVery much so no listen
