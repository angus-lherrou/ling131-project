for\nThat will be my call them tomorrow going out to hundreds of newspapers around the country except in Atlanta\nAnd\nI feel very strongly that the capital\nSituation is making lots of my friends feel the same way they are more and more being pulled towards the president\nIn response to what they see is the media and the Democrats a coke conspiring to destroy and not just a good man but to up in the republic to to transform us into some sort of progressive utopia\nIn twenty sixteen the ... the president's character graded on me and he was a hypothetical he was a a Democrat who became a Republican who said a lot of liberal things and there's still a lot of things I don't care about the president ah I think his his character is deeply flawed I don't like it I don't think he's role model I Want to present whose role model even if I disagree with him on stuff\nUm but I don't have that but I Know I'm not going to get that from the Democrats and the president's no longer a

you don't have to raise your hand I Know I've heard from so many of you Republican voters believed the GOP did not have the spine\nAnd because they believed they did not have a ... they were\nReady and willing to abandon the Republican Party they were ready and willing to decide that if the Republicans were going to stand up for garlic bread capital why even bother keep into\nWhy even bother having despite\nAnd suddenly they're seen Republicans in the Senate fight for them and so they're willing to fight for the Republicans in the Senate such as the president now that Republicans are are rallying for its its Republicans in the Senate and this separate to Obama from Trump but a key way\nBlock Obama could never get democratic voters to go vote for Democrats it was always a singular cult of personality\nAnd it looked that way with Donald Trump but between Trump and the Republicans in the Senate fighting for cabinet seen enough for him suddenly Republican voters feel like they've got to go be loyal\nThe danger is still that a lot of Republican voters ... that momentum is on their side and the polls wrong in the polls are not wrong the polls are not wrong the Democrats still will probably take the house although there are some who think now we Republicans may barely hang onto it maybe have a seat or two majority\nBut it's going to be very very close to the house but it looks

Jeff Flake and Lisa Murkowski the bail at the last minute on Capitol\nThis is going to cost the Republicans the Senate Republican voters will be so disaffected so disgusted so disenfranchised they will watch a protest\nI think that's very dangerous But Kevin O's confirmed there is this the Democrats are trying to say oh that's going to help us going in both those more no I think that really hurts the Democrats it is a morale killer if they see capital of the Supreme Court and I think Republicans are going to put him there and that's only going to help them in November\nEvening news very
