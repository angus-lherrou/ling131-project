immediate resignation\nOr a lot of people have asked me what I Know I've gotten phone calls all day long about ah what do I know what's the insides you Nikki Haley and I are friends we've been friends for close to ten years uh I knew nothing and\nI'm not going to call and bugs her and ask her about stuff because we we are we actually do have a a friendship here so I'm I've stayed out of out of texting her and asking her what's up I Will tell you this I wrote a piece\nAbout an hour and a half ago instead I suspect this is not the last we will see of Nikki Haley on the world stage and she re tweeted that\nUh which is she she was disappearing I don't think that's something we would see her retweet uh the White House was completely caught off guard\nBy Haley's departure they had no idea it was coming a couple of people inside the White House and I got to believe that these are no nothing people\nIn the White House but\nThey're actually genuinely were people in\nThe White House who said oh my gosh she's like going to let like the media um ascribed is to like Brett Kavanaugh and see that's why she's leaving like that's just totally not cool\nYou'll yes there were people in the White House on background no one brave enough to go on the record who were venting that her leaving now will allow the media to portray this as EMT\nA bread capital which is garbage it is a garbage nonsensical thing and that shows you everything wrong with the media you know the fall out of this probably is the most interesting thing here is the number of people who\nReally want to\nSinister motivations that she's leaving so there's an ethics complaint\nAgainst or for a fly on private planes uh she filed all the appropriate disclosure she's friends with people but someone fathers will this must be it or or oh the president must be going to stick or somewhere else or or it could just be she's got two kids in college she's been in the public sector for so long as she's ready to make some real money\nShe may have a real offered the private sector that she wants to go to make some real money um but it is typical Washington inside the beltway reporters really cold there must be scandal\nNo one would ever want to give up power if they're given a power there must be some deep dark secret there as to why good be\nShe just wants to go make private sector cash which is far more than me she's been a state representative while she was a count and that was a part time job should a fulltime job as an account it she then became governor of the state of South Carolina for a term and a half\nShe left um the last two years of her term to be ... UN ambassador\nShe's been UN ambassador for two years and now she's ready to go off and earn money\nGood for her I think that's fine the the meltdown and speculation is crazy now a few more on this and we'll take your calls when we come back for all for eight seven zero seven zero one eight hundred W.

S. B.\nAt the end of the year I I got to tell you that I've always found the speculation\nAmong reporters very very funny it is true you don't often\nTimes the people walk away from power\nWhen they have it um but let me say this Nikki Haley was very fortunate\nTo be in Washington DC where she did not have to be directly in the shadow of the president she could if you will spread or own wings\nShe didn't have to watch out for the White House a lot of people inside Washington tend to get smothered by the president I'm not I'm not talking about this president President and general\nThey don't want to overshadow the president in in New York she could do her own thing\nAnd she ruffled feathers in Washington at the White House because a lot of people felt like she took attention away from the president even her defense of the president remember the anonymous off it yeah way back last century we had an anonymous op ed about Donald Trump and ah they're after Nikki Haley responded to it\nAnd said you know what if if you don't like the president you don't have to work there but don't be anonymous you coward\nAnd a lot of people who has a whole this this just puffs her up it doesn't really help the press the president himself barely actually really liked it but you deal with that as a secretary said and and I can tell you that\nAh when what's his name uh was who who was who was the the dummy who was the secretary of State Tillerson doors and yes the the guy who ruined the boy scouts or was there a jury state for a while I was going to write a piece\nEndorsing the idea of Nikki Haley for secretary of state and\nSeveral mutual friends of ours got wind of it and reach out to be said no no no no don't don't don't do that\nDon't do that she's she's really good where she is we don't want her to go to Washington um where where the the dysfunction around the White House could could do rich doing a good job it's like okay I'll keep my mouth shut and I did never wrote the piece\nBut it's been pretty clear for a while that there are people in the White House who really dislike they feel like she distracts from the president the president is not one of those\nPeople do but\nI think there's something more simple to this I don't think there's a sinister explanation I don't think there is a scandal\nI don't think she wants to a different position and the government I think there's actually an easier answer it is all speculation I have not talked to Nikki Haley I have not talked to people close to Nikki Haley but I'm pretty sure there's an easier answer I'll tell you what it is after we checked traffic\nTerrified there'd be no but you want to be back to the holiday yesterday we're definitely not getting America by today and what about the about the breakfast running forty to forty five minutes or Georgia ... what\nAgree with all their story you got a one hour under the rug\nAnd if you were out there because they want you to thirty five north northern and what do you want to\nThank you very much by the way there are some scattered very very light showers in the area around Dallas or north Roswell in Alpharetta there are some inside the frame around Decatur they just shattered very very light a the heavy stuff is when you get down to first sight you have the first out her band of the hurricane a down there\nSo it and it's it's dumping rain but there's not a lot of lightning or anything down there anyway so Nikki Haley I think that the explanation is more simple she was a an account it was her husband has long served in the national guard\nAnd then she was she was ... she got elected to the state house in two thousand ten she was elected governor of um the governor of South Carolina\nIn two thousand fourteen she was re elected governor of South Carolina\nShe is now served for two years as ambassador to the United nations she's been in public office\nReally she's been about ... officer for about I think fourteen years but fulltime public office for what ... years\nYeah ten years ... if I were her I Would be ready to go make some money in the private sector\nHer ... her kids have grown her kids in my kids have\nGrown up it's just been funny to watch her kids grow up as Mickey and I've known each other since two thousand nine um well my youngest was born December of two thousand eight and we knew each other agendas and just kind of funny to my my kids my oldest used to refer to her as princess Nikki 'cause you know her family is is royalty in India\nUm and it just it it's been fun to be friends with her with Michael\nAnd he is I mean he's been in Afghanistan ... he's been in Iraq a lot she's been a full time mom and governor she locked herself out of the governor's mansion one morning or a bathroom credit group kids ready for school\nUm I mean she she's a mom and she loves going to ... and football games don't hold that against her with her kids if they're in college and she's been in her husband has been in military service she's been in government political services type or to go make some money\nI don't think there's anything sitters your ability there is a scandal I don't think she's trying to save herself from the fall out of the elections I I don't think anything like that I think she's ready to move into the private sector and finally make the money you know people forget that she is Bobby Jindal\nIn Louisiana he got elected in two thousand five cheese no that was that was Katrina she got elected two thousand seven Louisiana does audio elections Louisiana's odd I'm from there I can say that so he got elected in two thousand seven\nAnd he was governor for two terms he ran for president he's out on the private sector making money\nAnd we are reaching that stage where the original entrance of the Tea Party revolution of two thousand ten or reaching the point of being in service for government service for ten twelve years and it's time to make some real money\nI don't blame them I I don't blame Nikki Haley for wanting to do that it that's why she's leaving and my guess is that is why she is I don't think we'll see the last of her and I the reason I say I don't think we'll see the last of her is because\nUm I wrote a piece today about her and on Twitter the the what I put up in relation to that piece was I don't think we've seen the last of Nikki Haley on the world stage and she re tweeted that\nOr to all of her followers\nAnd I think that right there is a big ... she's not actually going away\nOr what she is actually doing I don't know she says she will be campaigning for the president and twenty twenty she made that pledge for him I don't know what she's gonna be doing it twenty twenty four ah but nonetheless I don't think she's going to disappear from the world stage I certainly don't think she disappeared from the national political stage either\nWhen we come back that's all we need to save up Nikki Haley but there's no one really knows and everything just speculation when we come back\nWhat I think we're going to do is\nMove into some state politics because there is some news you're Stacey Abrams out on the campaign trail\nYou got ... yesterday a taxi Brian Kemp she's running for lieutenant governor for the Democrats said that in the meat to Iran he may not last as governor a you know suggesting diplomatically that he may be as much a predator as as Brett Kavanaugh or have skeletons in his closet real classy of the Democrats there will now Stacey Abrams is coming out\nAnd well she thinks that Christians who think that I'm seeing what's happening in the world today they may need to get a referral past well she's come out against it a sin she she's a person to face she didn't need anybody to finish her face\nRed is they're going after the Baker and Colorado again and coming to you soon here in Georgia\nWe got that we got the president's today a progress in North Korea perhaps and then Hillary Clinton of course sounds like she's a Trump voter at least what the media has said about Trump voters except they're praising Hillary Clinton for what she said I'll play that audio\nHarry Carey an evening news is that guy I Love\nThe information you need to

know I I\nRan the numbers on the Democrats I I wrote about this at the resurgence dot com and I want to give you some some numbers here because I and the Democrats are believes in their own press\nAnd\nThey should you see that the Democrats are convinced including Democrats listening to this program right now are convinced that they are the majority party in the nation\nDemocrats loved to point out that this is Nineteen eighty eight Republicans have only won the popular vote in two presidential elections\nYeah OK\nThe problem for the Democrats though is it in you know first of all if you subtract out California California released use everything\nIs so short California Donald Trump won the popular vote in the nation but ... you don't have to protect California here's the problem for the Democrats have for people like Hillary Clinton in fact the Hillary Clinton famously hum this was her chief problem she ran her campaign focusing on an skinny jeans ... bushy beard hipsters in Brooklyn\nAnd ignored Wisconsin Pennsylvania and Michigan and lost them to her detriment\nThe problem for the Democrats is they have convinced themselves for so long that they are the
