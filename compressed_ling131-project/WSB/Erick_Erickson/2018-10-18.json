investigations that we should be able to get to the bottom fairly soon\nThe president saying us reaction will be severe of the Saudi Government sanctioned that murder and Israel to ABC News Washington\nAnd continue to fall out for over all this the confirmation now that treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin will not attend a plant Saudi investment conference\nHave come out and condemned the remarks uh this is Stacey Abrams yesterday saying that uh people shouldn't have to work in agriculture hospitality she wants to create jobs in a renewable energy because global warming is real or climate change is real\nYes she said that uh the remark has not played well you know so we part of the KIPP strategy is to build up his votes outside of Atlanta to\nNeutralize her advantage that she may have an urban highly populist urban areas like Fulton in DeKalb County\nHe couldn't have asked for greater gift than Stacey Abrams insulting farmers and hospitality workers a in doing so in South Georgia it her campaign has realized she made a mistake in his tragedy damage control\nOn it but uh the damage was done when you've got the Asian American hotel operators coming out in and taking issue with that but\nThere is something I Want to focus on positively a wish Stacey Abrams or for those you listen we did our poll yesterday we had over five thousand people voted in our poll are are texting poll a and the Brian Kemp won when like Ninety six point eight percent of the vote\nI'm Stacey Abrams got two percent or so and then the rest were undecided or less than two percent undecided um I I kind of surprised by that to some degree nonetheless\nOh what is so fascinating to me in this is that there are a lot of left wing political reporters in America who are convinced\nRacism is real and everywhere you look and they are so infatuated with Beto O'Rourke in Texas who has no shot at winning and they have completely ignored Stacey Abrams in Andrew Gillum in Florida Andrew Gillum is the Democratic gubernatorial nominee in Florida very progressive\nI'm very very very much to the left he has a real shot at winning he may very well before does next governor of the ... the polling there's tide\nAnd the media has completely ignored him in favor of Beto O'Rourke there is an NBC News piece today\nThat Beto O'Rourke has transcended the politics that that's where the actual story is he's he's become a cultural phenomenon now the NBC News reporter used to work for the progress to the left wing political site you should new you do need to know that does it left wing activist\nWho has NBC News has given the veneer of objectivity to writing the piece that Beto O'Rourke has transcended politics and become a cultural phenomenon\nThey're not writing these things about Steve ... they're not writing these things about Andrew Gillum they're not writing these things about black candidates it's left wing reporters to see racism everywhere who are only writing these things about white male candidates are pondering openly by the way what why why don't Republicans have rock stars like like better work\nWell they would never give them that status and Marco Rubio Paul Ryan you name it a win\nFor me given the same status that a guy like better work has given because they're not liberals they're not less dislike but ... says all the things they want he gives them die sweats based on his policy positions um but Stacey Abrams in Andrew Gillum do as well as they're completely ignored because they're not white\nAnd that is a a real reality here that that even conservative should be mindful of\nYes there is racism in America still exist in a lot of that exists among progressive reporters across America who want to throw their pain is it better or can completely more and more viable challengers to Republicans who happened to be black in Georgia and Florida because well\nThey're not Kennedy esque in their appearance\nAnd you should be mindful of that we should also be mindful of traffic let's just just\nGot a lot going on here Aaron Burr's dog what are they apply more to to this guy I've been doing it by trying to recover the only area that's worse than a normal

grip on alert out on the radio at five Seventy five north on your door shut\nDown reflect sold out there but\nThank you very much now the latest Internet outrage today is over Brian jumped so there is a series of videos on voter education this is total Internet outrage but of course the national media bit to claim that the campus racist\nUm these videos one of the video shows kids they're all kids acting as adults going through the voting process and the kid who shows up\nWithout photo ID to vote happens to be a young black girl\nSo progressive on the Internet went nuts today uh this is racist stereotyping an on and on and on and on and the ... campaign as secretary of state's office they took down the videos after the outrage but here's the punchline\nThese videos were paid for by the federal government and they were released in twenty sixteen\nAnd all of the people screaming outrage now we're around twenty sixteen but they said nothing\nThis again is another example of the weaponization of race on the campaign trail in Georgia\nTrying to make black voters angry to go vote against spring not vote for Stacey Abrams would vote against Brian Kemp they're trying to tar and feather him as a racist as they tried to tar and feather Brett Kavanaugh as a sexual predator\nAnd their evidence is a video\nPaid for by the federal government released in twenty sixteen by the way when Stacey Abrams was in the legislature\nAnd neither she nor any other member of the legislature nor anyone else had any objection to these videos when they were released in twenty sixteen but now suddenly it as an Internet phenomenon and they're calling on Brian Kemp to resign as secretary of state\nBecause of these videos yeah the the the Abrams campaign and progressive activist groups are calling on him to resign because of the racism of this video paid for by the federal government and released in twenty sixteen\nThat's all they've got it this that this again you know none of this sounds like a winning campaign uh they've released a ... I'm not even in a play the audio on the air here really Savage um attack\nOn Brian jumped today or the ... campaign has ah they're not even trying to make a case for Abrams at this point what they're hoping is that black voters we'll vote for the black candidate without any thought as to who the candidates are with their positions are\nThey are trying to scream and the national media that Brian Kemp is races to as sabotaging the voting in silencing people in denying people vote that they're not making an issue speaking ... meanwhile you got you jump out there he's flying to southwest Georgia to make sure that uh the election can be held\nHe's touring farming country or talking about the disconnect with Atlanta and how Georgia needs to remember how agriculture is a big economic a generator for Georgia while his owners that insulting farmers\nAnd he's trying to make the case that it would the rest of the state shouldn't have to subsidize Atlanta we need to focus on um how we can help\nPeople who live in rural partial Georgia or none of the expense of Atlanta but in addition to the people in Atlanta or his he's run into very issues based campaign and meanwhile the other side has gone hysterical or screaming about everything is racist and everything is voter suppression and everything is bad and everything is awful and\nThat just it doesn't sound that sounds like a grievance campaign it doesn't sound like a gubernatorial campaign it it sounds like we're trying to make people angry not to make people go vote\nAnd I don't know that it's a winning strategy in the early voting numbers don't suggest that it is either Republicans appear to be out pacing Democrats in early voting right now and and that's not a bad thing\n[noise] Erick Erickson ... evening news who is a guy I Love the information you need to use them in every night ... five AM seven in the evening news is sponsored by Comcast Business [noise] five Nineteen\nWearing red alert in Union City my door down and found a blanket old I think that's all it took a lot of screwed up the crash that had been up to the two I blamed\nFor to get all shut down and watch all the I wanted I straight up as an older to thirty five dollars all the three or four years ago\nSaid that you think back to Seventy five five sure all sort of Seventy five what what do you know trying to get them to get on it when you go\nTo the Congo line now between bucket and Sandy Springs on four hundred north bound bumper to bumper battled from North of Lennox wrote out to the north springs Marta station delays selling fast offering and coming leaving one word parkway to highway twenty northeast Mike shields\nHitting the brakes heart a far north bound before ... and you stay on and off the brake pads spaghetti jokes in up to Pleasant Hill road secondary so some picks up maybe find more than ... sugar parkway a pass to Ninety five splits then you're off to the races past\nSmall Georgia three sixteen eastbound on and off break some eighty five into wars bill tripled in traffic ws be\nCome on don't give me that during the headlights look you know Georgia's distracted driving laws enforced but that doesn't mean you'll ever be stuck in traffic download the app and keep your hands off your phone\nWith us we seemed traffic alert that by your phone your golden ... before you begin your commute the graphic alerts or automatic ... bone loses enabled ...
