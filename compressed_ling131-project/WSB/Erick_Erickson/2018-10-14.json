bounce back from a bad laws before like last year ...\nWhat are the things that Chris talks about your from talks you are in touch with your clients at least every quarter there's four meetings per year whether they be in person or by phone or by Facebook or whatever it is there's some sort of a a reach out and touch this would be one of those times you reach out and touch clients who were kind of thing\nAnd I want to go protection look at the market go I Want to hit throttle go gas pedal let's go right Oh absolutely\nThis is the time when people Who Forgot about some of the pain and suffering in two thousand eight and this is when they theoretically wake up and and we do we we meet with our clients every single quarter that is just part of what we do we have held our business to that standard since day one and\nThis is the the best time because as I mentioned it I cannot emphasize this enough this is the the\nVery thing that happens that gets people to realize All right I got to really start looking at some of these things and and potentially making some changes that maybe I wasn't ready for right now who is the person who needs to wake up call right now what's it called that you made this week\nWell so there's a a car and I have who he's he's done very well he's big into real estate and he still does it and he's half retired as he likes to call it but he has several variable annuities\nArea building duty is hooked to the market market goes up you money goes up market goes down your money goes down absolutely I have a variable annuity with a life\nInsurance company and then you have sub accounts within this annuity that our security there in the market there participating in the upside\nBut they are also participating in the downside okay and this is one of those things we have consistently talked about making some changes putting more protection into his portfolio because he's Seventy one years old guy and he is in the market one hundred percent he knows that he needs to start traveling back\nBut getting him to actually commit to it\nAnd take some of that greed off the table and as you like to say is like pulling teeth yeah\nSo this is the wake up call for an awful lot of people if you looked at your accounts this week and you probably did you went online don't wait for your statements go online to find out where you are if you saw a big loss\nThis week that means you do have a lot of risk with you and your portfolio you're going along with the market market goes up you go up market goes down you go down that may seem very simple\nBut at a certain age you have to kind of make some adjustments along those lines Oh absolutely\nAnd rainy this the thing and this is a call to action for the listeners out there today if you are one of those people where retirement is just along the horizon right two three four five years from now\nAnd you saw some real susceptibility in your portfolio you got to pick up the phone and call is yeah you got to come into the\n... you got to let us do a stress test take a look at where your allocated and see if we really do need to start making some pre retirement changes because I Know you'll talk about it with everything that happened this week with the fed with the markets the correlation with bonds inequities\nIt's time you know it's time to make some changes it's time to meet with somebody and find out what we can actually do to protect some of your earnings that you've been lucky enough to get over these last ten years\nWill Chris talks about it when you do this analysis and that's where we offer we call it a retirement road map and this is a plan this is a financial plan for you the first thing is to do is get a very good analysis the thirty thousand foot flyover of where you are right now\nAnd he says Ninety percent of the time we find something there's too much exposure to the market there's too much bonds there's too much of something somebody's not paying attention to taxes or something in there that you can find that you can uncover that many times that person doesn't know about\nOh absolutely so I I actually just met with a couple two weeks ago and the husband's been retired for a few years and the wife is retiring within the next Eighteen months there's no set date but she is retiring and she has every single dollar she saved in her employer plan\nAnd we did the review and it turns out that there was One Fund that's it she had One Fund or that she was invested in and this particular fund\nWas about Seventy percent fixed income mhm meaning bonds for for those who are not sure exactly what that means but Seventy percent bonds and they're both very aware of the relationship between the interest rate environment and bonds\nAnd I'm sure you can imagine the look on their face when I gave them this information and they were shocked they had no idea\nAnd I think that what we see most often\nIs there's just a general lack of knowledge of what's actually happening in the portfolio people or they're not getting the help that they need when it comes to their employer plans the advisory services are very limited\nSo people just aren't in the no on what's happening in their portfolio what the allegations are and when we bring it to their attention\nThey realize it's time to make some changes especially with the type of environment that we're in economically\nTalked to an advisor this week and he said somebody came in and he was making an average of ten percent on his portfolio and he was very proud so he was kind of coming in with hey look what I'm doing you know give me that go ahead give me the thumbs up a pat on the fact that I'm doing great\nAnd the analysis came back that fifty percent of his portfolio was responsible for Ninety percent of his gains so that meant fifty percent of its portfolio was dragging him down and he could have been doing so much better than ten percent and that's the kind of stuff that nobody knows\nOh absolutely we we see that on a regular basis because equities rights no secret the last ten years they've been a rock star marathon runner it's gone up than up and up and up\nAnd one of the things that I'm seeing is bonds are continuously bleeding and they are dragging people's portfolio down and once again do they know that that's happening they have no idea right absolutely that's great to average ten percent [laughter] you can't beat that were thick\nBut you know when you look at the flip side if you actually dug in and you built a strategic plan what could you have done that exactly\nAnd and what protection could you have in there and still do well you know Chris talks about it all the time it's like being on two eighty five there's the fast lane there the the hyper speed lane that are that some people go in I don't\nAnd then there's the ... way over there on the other side and then there's that middle lane let's figure out how to get you in that middle lane and then you don't have to go over and park you don't have to go in that that hyper speed lane you do have to find a happy medium in between and let's find that for you\nA we make available to you what we call the retirement roadmap this is a financial plan and if that's what you're looking for there are two kinds of people to listen to the show one is that person who realizes I Need this I don't have this I Can't find that person and I don't know who to trust\nAnd then there's the person who has a financial plan who wonders am I missing something well their retirement roadmap is really for both of you\nIt will uncover whether or not you're losing money in taxes it will uncover if you are susceptible to a market decline it will uncover if there's parts of your portfolio that aren't performing the way they should it will uncover if you're completely susceptible to rest\nAnd you may know that already by looking at your your accounts this week if you went down considerably that means you're going along with the market\nAnd if you're doing that and you're fifty nine sixty sixty one years old you might want to really reconsider that the retirement roadmap is free to you for being a radio listener here give us a call right now here's our number it's for all for nine zero eight eight eight\nFor all for nine zero eight eight this is a full blown financial plan we call it the retirement

fishing in the right now [laughter]\nHere's the question that you're going to see all week on the financial networks and they're going to be asking every person who comes in they're going to say is this just a momentary blip that we recover from or is this the beginning of something bigger\nAnd no one knows the answer to that question nobody knows that the question is are you prepared either way and that takes a financial plan we talk about our retirement roadmap building that end whether or not the market does it's funky stuff or whether it goes up there goes down you got to be prepared for that\nYeah absolutely goes right back to it I just said Murphy's law you know what what can go wrong we'll go wrong and I said earlier in the show if you're just tuning in you know if you're one of those people that took a hit this past week and\nYou are just you know a couple of years from retirement five years from retirement\nYou probably realized I'm entering dangerous territory if you're

a call for it it's for all for nine nine zero eight eight eight ask for the free retirement road map you can also text us the word road map to the same number for all for nine nine zero eight eight eight\nWell let's talk about you said that person who's getting close to retirement there was an interesting article in entrepreneur magazine and the guy obviously was English and he was talking about soccer matches and boxing matches and he said if you got to be offensive if you're going to succeed if you're going to do well you've got\nTo be offensive nobody wins unless they do the knockout punch nobody wins unless they have good off ... nobody gets rich by just simply saving money which I disagree with\nBut let's talk about our fence and defense do you believe that or should there be a mix the two or are you a person who comes at it from uh\nAs defensive standpoint what do you say to that\nRandy I'm going to tell you just like I think every single coach I ever had growing up told me\nThe best defense is a good ... alright so you have to be proactive on both sides right I mean if if we related to sports you know we're in the middle of football season\nWell if you're a defense is not on you're going to suffer if you're often says not working you're going to suffer so you have to have a mixture of both right you have to be able to pay a bit and move with the markets and and that's where things like quarterly meetings come in and actually\nHaving a real partnership with your advisor\nBut absolutely you you have to get on the offensive and you have to make some choices and you need to to be the one to steer the ship because nobody cares about your money as much as you care about your money ... right I mean that's simple I mean we we care a lot about our clients money

financial territory that we're in right now and it has been a very very upsetting\nWeek for those if you were getting closer to retirement so one of the things that we talk about all the time is managing your money taking an active\nRole in managing your money Chris talks about that all the time you need to be the C. E. O. of your money why is that because you need to know what your money is going to throw off in the area of income you've been saving you've been working out at your whole life what does this big mass\nOf money that you put together what does it do for you so let's talk him come here\nYeah so every person that I come in contact with if I asked them\nHow much are you worried they can answer that question mhm they can pretty much it's very quickly most people know exactly how much money they have among cash retirement accounts on and so forth but when you ask the question All right\nIf you needed to generate income off of all of your assets starting in two years what would they generate\nPray at great and they of course you're ... cannot answer that question and to people's defense they're not financial planner so it's it's not that they should know the answer but\nIf you're on your way to retirement there's a thing called an income plan and you need to have one\nYou may know how much you need you may say well I think fifty thousand or sixty thousand or Seventy thousand dollars a year will do it for me we'll those raw materials that you're bringing to the table\nWill it throw that money off yeah you you know there's a lot of factors when we sit down with somebody you know we have a a questionnaire that we go through and it's in depth as far as you know what the the current income level is in the expenses and then the future expenses and\nYou know everyone has a different standard of living and you know they have they have different expenditures\nAnd if you don't put these things on paper it's very difficult to plan for you know I used to work with a gentleman that said where performances measure performance and ... and it's the same way with everything you have to write these things down you've got to put them on paper and you have to know exactly which direction you're going\nI think that you know any kind of a fidelity or vanguard or John Hancock or wherever you have your money they have this thing where you try to figure out what your number is where are you going to\nAnd if you want to reach a certain level of funds and they say well you're on your on track to reach that that number by what you were putting you and you're going to reach that number I think there should be switched\nI think it should be this is how much I Need per year\nOr poor months for my retirement how am I doing on that\nAnd I think that that would be an eye opening experience for\nAn awful lot of people oh I agree because the way that most of these platforms work as they show you based on what the current account balances\nAnd then future returns how much income it's going to generate and Randy I'll be honest with you I don't know where they get these numbers for us no matter what type of magical mathematics I Do on my\nMy financial calculator I don't get numbers that large and you're right I agree one hundred percent\nYou got to be realistic obviously\nBut you really have to dig in and you have to find out what those numbers are what the path as and unfortunately these financial tools that we we have on line\nMost of them don't actually generate good information and what they're they're built for is to extract information so that they can get a phone number and give you a call right\nIf you want a hundred thousand dollars a year you can do that on a million dollars but only for ten years [laughter] you're running out of money okay and you don't want to do that we want to make a plan for you that brings you into your nineties to a hundred whatever the number is that you want to sit down and build that's what a financial plan does that's what the retirement road Baptist\nYeah of course and Randy this as a as good as time has any to really hammer down on this topic right with what's happened with the markets over the last week with what's happening with the fed\nRandy this is the type of stuff that can destroy someone's future income planning and to go back to two thousand eight you know the people that were sixty four sixty five retiring in the next year that took a forty percent lost\nTheir entire way of living in retirement is completely changed because the way you can view that is forty percent of their potential income and the snap of a finger\nA marketing event when you retire in the first years that you retire is very hard to recover from\nYeah that's what I Would call the danger of ... [laughter] and and you have to start thinking in those terms you know you've been in the accumulation phase for Thirty years\nI'll give it to somebody it is really difficult to change your thought process to now generating income off of the wealth that you've accumulated but ultimately that's\nBy you started doing it in in the first place so you have to get prepared you have to start mentally preparing and taking the necessary steps so that you're in a position where you can start taking income and you're not going to be susceptible to the wrath of the market if things start to go haywire

tomorrow democratic candidate for governor Stacey Abrams is joining other lawmakers and raising concerns over voter suppression in George W F the Cheryl Castro port Abrams point the finger of blame at her Republican rival Brian camp\nAbrams calling on secretary of state Capitol resigned over an AP investigation that found capstone fifty three thousand voter registrations because names don't match other state id forms as they are required to kept says those voters can still vote if they show an ID at the polls Abrams says that's an unnecessary hurdle plus\nAnd people in their thirties and forties they've already gone through it in two thousand and an elite and they have done nothing differently than with the way they were structured in two thousand two thousand eight to protect against loss and here we are sitting again saying tied to protect tend to learn how to hedge tied to preserve capital and which just begging address because if they don't learn it they're never going to hit those numbers\nWorld champions the definition of insanity if you lost money in a mutual fund in two thousand eight you lost money in a mutual fund in two thousand one and two what do you think's going to happen in your mutual fund again and that's the that's the biggest picture that were banging the drum on how do you figure out what type of position you to be and how do you protect this and it's a skill champion said all the\nTime well it's amazing because when you hear the term hedge fund and people here that they think Bernie made off\nThey think it's you know something bad hedge funds inherently a really good because they allow you to take advantage of the movement higher in the market and not take the loss in other words you take a very small loss when you're wrong but you don't take those large losses at cripple you overtime\nAnd many of the listeners don't realize that they could do that exact same thing that a hedge fund does in their own portfolio\nYes you can it's not a complex process and see a lot of the money managers and certified financial planner as in registered investment advisors out there they want you to think that you're not smart enough because their Wall Street they want you to take it you're not smart enough to do that and you can't do it a hedge fund does and yet the reality is is you can\nAnd there's things you can use like options you realize you use an option to protect against a position in the market in other words I could own stock her own and exchange traded fund which is very similar to a mutual fund I could have an option as insurance of the market collapse as I can walk away at virtually all my money in tax\nThere's so many things we can do do you realize that there's funds where if the market goes down you make money in other words when the market collapse as you profit there's things that are out there that the individual trader investor the person is driving down the road right now is maybe never even looked at managing their own money doesn't realize is available that you and I can use to keep yourself safe\nAnd they help us at our goals and long term hit that retirement number and it's not a difficult process but yet people want to believe it is because they've been trained to think that way by Wall Street\nWe're telling you you don't have to be smart to be successful in the markets you have to follow the rules understand some basic principles and you can be successful and capital preservation is paramount to long term success because if you don't measure risk you'll have no risk diminish\nWell and that's why a lot of individuals are out there they're concerned about this market they are concerned about what can they do a lot of people don't think they have time to take the time to figure out how to preserve their capital and she had you'd say this all the time it doesn't take a lot of time to figure out how to protect your money but you got to want to protect your buddy I I'd had people that I Know\nThat manage their own money and six to ten hours a month\nThey're protected in the collapse if the market and the S. and P. and the dog goes down dramatically they're going to walk away almost unscathed they'll take a small loss but they've got protected positions on and most importantly\nThey're able to participate in the upside in other words they get the return of the market when it's happening in the way they needed to and if it goes against our starts to fall or collapse they walk away virtually unscathed because they have a protective position\nCapital preservation is not a complex process it's just something that you have to understand first of all and then once you do it becomes a simple system that you follow time and time again well there's\nMany listeners out there to bulls and bears that have questions on how to preserve their money in there for one k.'s and their IRAs and that's why our sponsor online training academy teaches

that's all at last I and I have hair [laughter] do you have always having a good time here you know one of the key things to the financial markets is\nWhen someone's investing and when someone is trading they can do it however they want there's people out there that a long term investors there's people out there that day traders\nAnd the reality of being in the financial market for anybody\nIs to make some money whether or not you need a daily basis or an annual basis you're trying to grow the account was take a moment let's talk about the guy out there or the lady out there be some of the best traders I Know are women let's talk about what is it looked like for someone to trade for income if they want this to be their income and quit their job what does that look like\nWell it's realistic if you go through a learning curve and obviously like any skill set what I Love about on trade academy to sponsor bulls and bears is that they constantly speak of skill building\nIn other words if you want to get good at something you have to build a skill think about it I was a builder\nI mean I build homes I was a framer idle learned UBS frame that's the skill Adler this surges as doctors this pilots the secretaries this pizza delivery people you've got to learn the skill and through the process of learning the steel you get good at it and repetition serve you well it's the same thing in trading\nAnd so a lot of people when they hear the word treat or they think gambler\nHigh risk couldn't be further from the truth I Know people that trade in their spare time maybe an hour a day\nThat are moms there on the PTA there you know they they they they do use Cooper church and they trade during the day they treat with a good system and a good set of rules and it's safe and it's not ... it's not risky it's risk averse\nBut more importantly allows them to get consistency over time and it's a skill set that they built over a period of time we always talk about a three to nine months learning curve to get the skill of trading under your belt\nImagine if you commit thirty to sixty to Ninety Days to learn the skill of trading or even up to six months and then you could basically go into the markets on a daily basis it didn't matter how much money you had or a weekly basis and you can make a good decision\nIf the market fell you could profit margin of profit you'd have to leave your house that's the dream and for a lot of people it replaces the second income because they don't want to go punch a clock or leave the house it can do it from their home\nAnd it's amazing because when you start to realize that it's not the picture that Hollywood creates of what a traitor is that Gordon Gekko guy with suspenders on Wall street somewhere in some big tower overlooking the city no it's just people like you and I that are looking to make a little extra money and with some of the products that are available in the markets\nIt opens the door to everybody if they're willing to learn the skill and start the process of putting the system together\nAbsolutely in a key part is what you're saying champions learn the skill learn the skill learn the skill if you think about it no matter what your profession you hit this earlier\nEverybody has a skill set everybody understands what a checklist is er recipe is and trading investing if you think about high probability low risk you can figure this out it's like what you said three to nine months someone figures out a second stream income let the account get big enough to be your primary and get\nOne of my favorite students that I might treat academies young man who came in at Seventeen years old now he was home schooled\nAnd he told his mom and daddy want to learn about trading in the markets that was a passion is and so they kind of let him create his own curriculum\nHe came through these walls as an Eighteen year old young man\nAnd I've known him now for ten years you know him as well and he's transitioned his life I mean he's training a six figure account he's never ever not understood the markets from it from when he became a grown man and he just knock it out of the park and what's great became an instructor with the academy so proficient in so good in the markets\nThat he got doing auditing process was brought in as an instructor he\nCame in he was a kid and so I Love the fact that it doesn't matter what your background is what your skill set is if you want to learn a different skill\nThe markets can change the game for you and what's great about that is just so many ways you could approach is you don't have to have a ton of capital trade currencies are futures are crypto currency is was virtually less than a hundred two hundred bucks some cases and start to get some traction start to get some success\nSo trading for income for many people when they begin to realize that it's really just a skill as not a casino it's not you gamble as you followed a set of rules\nIt really opens the door to people most importantly given that chance to make that ... income and maybe supplement and more importantly could turn into something bigger down the road\nThe best thing about the market doesn't care about your age doesn't care about your sex doesn't care about your race it doesn't care about any of that\nAnd no one's ever going to tell you what your where do you go out there and earn and that's the best thing online training academy to sponsor bulls and bears they teach a class specifically on trading for income\nIs a five hundred dollar value every time we give it away here and ... and bears the photos light up\nAs a five hundred dollar class on trading for income if your brand new the market or have you been to mark and you're not consistent this is your opportunity we're gonna take callers ten to twenty pick up the phone right now called aid for four or five one trade that's eight four for five on trade for callers ten to twenty to get a five
