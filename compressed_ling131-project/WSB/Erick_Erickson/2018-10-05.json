I don't believe you're handles actually is as much at play um there was an issue there I think where some Republicans just thought she had it in the bag and they weren't fired up they are now fired up\nA and they've got to be fired up you know why because the Democrats are already out this afternoon say that if they take the houses are going to impeach Kevin ...\nThat's the Democratic message now isn't beach Kevin ... an to impeach President Trump that's insane for them to do but that's what they want to do\nSo I'm thinking this isn't going to work very well for the Republicans\nWere referred up no listen you do need to do that just based on redistricting just based on redistricting forced redistricting in Pennsylvania\nAnd the the the ballot initiatives in California where it's a ... a jungle primary Republicans are in danger of losing the house I don't think no you know some people said oh it's going to be Seventy feet I don't think so\nIf they lose the house you if you're like your regular show this program you know that I have said for a while the Democrats were taking it out at this point it's all up in the air is they take it back it's going to be a small majority I think\nIt is not even sure any more Republicans have become so far but can Republicans for four weeks were four weeks away from the election can Republicans continue this level of anger momentum I think if the Democrats were out there saying we're going to teach Kevin Oh we're going to be capital I think it can work\nAnd the Democrats they they can't help themselves or as as an Richards the former governor of Texas you they can't hit themselves they can't help themselves yes I I don't think they can't help themselves I think that they are going to rev up the beach capital movement\nAnd that's going to help just as much as Trump because people Republicans conservatives motion emotionally\nInvested in ... capital they're emotionally invested in him it's gonna be a problem for the different they've overplay their hand here in\nThis moves us into Georgia I Do want to spend the rest of this hour talking about Georgia politics Abrams and kept\nHaving Eric Holder coming in to nationalize this race when it's already be nationalized against the Democratic narrative I think that was a bad move by the Democrats and Stacey Abrams for them it's a great move for Republicans Republicans are now suddenly be fired up in the suburbs\nOverwhelmingly I got to see this I Want to see this and people are gonna be there I I already tweeted it and people are already anger you should see how angry people are at me right now on social media for say this\nBut I'm going to say it to you and I stand behind it and I know it's it's too blunt for some people\nBut if the leadership of the progressive movement\nWere not filled with bitter childless feminists\nThey probably would have known that accusing an innocent man of rape would not play well with moms dads or anyone else\nAnd that's what they did because they're stuck in their bubble where they thought it was a good idea and no one around them said hey you probably are going to make suburban moms in particular upset and that's exactly what's happened including a suburban mom from Maine name Susan Collins\nAtlanta's evening news era Gary\n... militias accurate down to a federal five day forecast for the same traffic every six minutes don't you ask me [laughter] [noise]\nI Know John Boehner and the thing I got to find out now I'm going to cost you about half an hour that's about it and then over by the way it all in Georgia do most of\nThe north north down one thirty seven\nNewly almost four hundred from two eighty five up to the Marta station just a tap on the brakes right there then you've got a bit of volume as you approach highway twenty and then the heavier stepped up between ... and brown springs road and coming forward or tell pounds of speed limit ride northwest my ...\nSeventy five north they'll even mid town of ... to break lights will get you know ...\nSouth Park way if you make your way up the highway now to an accurate southbound delays from highway Ninety two down to the five Seventy five split five Seventy five north down so heavy volume through military curb and then once it getting real Sixers wrote\nThis report by by eagles why shop at the eagles the savings of course this week pickup boneless beef Chuck gross three Ninety eight upheld and forty eight else friendly ice cream to for five dollars with your eagles advantage card angles low prices loved the savings tripled in traffic ws be have\nDon't give me that during the headlights look you know Georgia's distracted driving laws enforced but that doesn't mean you'll ever be stuck in traffic just download the app and keep your hands off your phone\nWas silly you must be tripled seemed traffic elusive on your phone your goals are up yet before you begin your commute the traffic alerts or automatic look on your phone loses enabled ...
