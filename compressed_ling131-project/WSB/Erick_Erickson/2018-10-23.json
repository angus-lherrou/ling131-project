to me this afternoon and said uh yep the British or this is legit and is this comes on the heels of the New York times story that Stacey Abrams a burned the Georgia flag on the steps of the state Capitol in Nineteen Ninety two when she was a college student\nI have to tell you and I realized this is a sensitive subject for a number of people\nBut I Want to tell you out of the gate I Do not blame any citizen of Georgia who is not white for being offended by the state having the Confederate battle flag on\nThe state flag when it wasn't done until brown versus board of education as a white protest to civil rights a spare me your outrage over saying that\nWe're just going to have to agree to disagree on this uh I don't have a problem with any black person in this state being offended by the Confederate battle flag and I don't know that you can appreciate that um some of you but that's where I stand on this issue\nAnd I was not offended myself by the Confederate battle flag on the state flag is or something that people by the time I moved to Georgia viewed as a heritage issue but I totally get it once I discovered when it wasn't like Mississippi\nThat had the Confederate flag added right after the civil war this was done as a white protested night late Nineteen fifties against the civil rights era and I totally get people not liking it a particularly if you're black I mean ... years you're you're ... descendants of slaves in this country who\nPeople died under that flag to keep your slave I get it or we're not going to revisit the civil war here I'm just telling you I I don't hold that against Stacey Abrams for burning that flag on the state Capitol Steps in the nineties ... it as a college student I I don't\nI'm what I Do though has a problem with is this idea now by some including Stacey Abrams that we need to tear down all the monuments to the confederacy\n[noise] and the reason I have a problem with that is that unlike the Confederate flag being added to the Georgia flag or in the fifties as a civil rights as a protest against civil rights in desegregation\nMost of the major monuments in this state\nA dedicated to the confederacy every small town in Georgia has a Confederate soldier who faces north or in they did not come about during the Jim Crow era\nThey came about after the civil war as monuments to the fathers sons brothers other family members who died in the war\nAnd people in the south white people in particular bill\nThose to honor the men who fought for their country it was a different time there were different views across the board not just on slavery there were different views on nationhood there were different views on state sovereignty there were different views on the United states or keep in mind that it was not until after\nThe civil war that people begin commonly referring to the United states is the United states prior to the civil war it was referred to as these United States\nNow ... is a big it it was a big difference\nIn many many families contributed money to erect those statues to honor the fallen soldiers of the south\nAnd I do not think that we need to hear those statues down\nI Do not think we need to tear Stone Mountain down I Do not think we need to purge from our history the statues that's actually what authoritarian regimes tend to do\nI think if you look on the statues and view them with contempt will look on them and view them with contempt and remember the history holding contempt\nIf you look on these statues and you remember it was your great great grandfather who vote in the civil war will remember your great great grandfather we don't have to all have to have the same view about these statues but I don't think we should tear them down\nThey are historical legacy in this nation and there's no reason for us to a race that has a history any more than any other history and Stacey Abrams disagrees with that it wants to hear these things down her mother talks about that in this audio uncovered by Monica prison in ... and I want to play it for you after we checked with Dr\n... thank you buddy five or do you know the guy got their way out of that we have to travel advisory board the other troubled you've got to learn to happen now my book to go right by the out of it and again and only three over there at the time but it\nWould if I\nWork out five area over George Will drive and nobody thought it awhile ago children\nThank you sir ... maybe maybe it's a good thing to the phone lines are screwed up right now my goodness I just looking at a couple of emails that have come in for me talk and you'll\nListen I I'm Sorry but I I'm I view the flag differently from the monuments\nAre largely because so many of the monuments happened right after the civil war and clearly historically we know they were to honor the fall and they were not to rub people's news in a history or in Jim Crow as opposed to the Confederate flag being added\nTo the Georgia flag in Nineteen fifty seven as a protest in the state legislature to desegregation I view them completely differently I I'm not going to hold it against Stacey Abrams\nThat she burned the Confederate flag I Do however wants to play the Saudi well from other were because you know the the official position now of Stacey Abrams is she doesn't want to tear down Stone Mountain as she has long claimed well listen to this again had tipped Monica ... and Brinkley her producer for finding this\nUp if I get all my my wires crossed year\nThey say the ... when I went to school here and on and tell me they're going to seminary\nAnd she is she was not\nBeing represented in the end you know and now she's a candidate but not until I [noise]\nAnd and\nAnd you you you might have seen me in and she gets in your lifetime you know\nHe he's trying to get him to take down statues Stone Mountain knows racist ... and ... and the flag but then when she found than she went on this in the capital and learn to play out in the ... not that I'm not [laughter]\nYou have to love a mom is she's clearly proud of her daughter and I don't blame her Stacey Abrams as accomplish much a ... and again I'm not going to make an issue about the flag I think it's a non issue\nOr the other though is I mean she ... she wants to get rid of those monuments and she's walked that back on the campaign trail\nAnd I don't think that something that you can walk back yeah I think you got home that uh because it's pretty clear to me that that is her position\nEven though she's walked it back because I guess the polling suggest most people in fact you know nationwide a polling seems to suggest that a a slight majority black voters but overall in a very decisive\nMajority of voters independent Democrat and Republican or opposed to revisiting the issue and tearing these monuments down and I suspect that's pulling issue for her but here's your mom a\nScenes she wants to get rid of them all which had been Stacey Abrams position until she got through the Democratic primary and then suddenly walked it back as she wants to find some sort of compromise I I don't actually believe she wants to find a compromise I think she does want to hear those things down now you may want to tear down so mountain as well I I don't um\nI I think it actually is a work of art that whether I agree with what it's supposed to represent or not it's a work of art on that side of that mountain and there's no reason to blow up the mountain or\nCarve off the monument or add something else up there um but nonetheless I Wonder what the effect of this will be in South Georgia\nI Wonder what the effect of this will be in other areas of the state outside the Atlanta area\nMy suspicion is in South Georgia there's a drip drip drip effect and Stacey Abrams needs to make inroads in South Georgia because Brian ... has a huge base of support there and he has a huge base of support in the metro area elder you'd never do that by press reports\nAnd between her comments about agriculture and her comments about the monuments and the burning of the flag et cetera and\nI don't know that that plays very well in certain parts of the state but there's something that shouldn't play well across the state from Atlanta to rural areas I've got audio of Stacey Abrams attacking the free market\nCalled into question with free market has done polling for greater government intervention and that shouldn't play well anywhere and I will play this audio for you when we come back\n[noise] Harry Carey lemons evening news who is guys I Love the

story the homestead exemption status of a democratic candidate for Congress in Georgia said to be revoked by the Cobb County ... office tax documents show\nDemocrat Lucy McBath and her husband Curtis make bats are facing replication of their homes that exemption and Cobb County for the last three years and twenty eight team because they no longer meet residency requirements make bath is challenging Republican Karen Handel George ... congressional district\nOr she has publicly said she recently moved back to the district after living in Tennessee but her husband Kurdish wood bat has been claiming the homestead exemption in Cobb County for sixteen years even though many documents otherwise use to verify residency Georgia are legally recorded into the sea\nYikes\nNow make bad has been criticized for inconsistent comments on residency\nOr in the Atlanta press club debate may twenty Eighteen she said she'd been a resident of Georgia since Nineteen Ninety but records indicate she voted in Tennessee and twenty sixteen\nDean she reverted back to Georgia when he's Seventeen the Tennessee secretary of state's office confirmed in July twenty Eighteen Macbeth registered to vote in Tennessee on march twenty thirty two thousand six team\n\nThat you know the the blunt county tax office in Tennessee says Curtis McBath her husband owns three parcels of land in the county and Lucy McBath is that her husband is a permanent resident of Tennessee So how does that work you're married\nAnd you live in Cobb County Georgia and your husband lives in Tennessee\nReally I I don't believe this I'm\nHere's the thing Lucy McBath says that her husband's a permanent resident of Tennessee and she registered to vote in Tennessee\n\nYou vote where you're a resident\nAnd Lucy McBath is voted in Tennessee I have a hard time believing that the sixth congressional district in Georgia wants someone who lives in Tennessee being their congresswoman\n[noise] I don't actually think that Karen Handel is going to lose this race but it is very interesting that we have someone running against or who didn't sort out these residency issues to begin with\nA deeply problematic and then there's just this whole ... that's just weird I'm Sorry it's weird even in the twenty first century it's weird you are married and you're\nTrying to claim residency in Cobb County while you vote in Tennessee and your husband as he described by you as he permanent resident of tendency\nThat doesn't add up\nBy the way you should note um that the Cobb County commissioner's office are conducted an audit didn't send an audit letter to Lucy McBath\nAnd where did they send it they sent it to an address in Rockford, Tennessee [noise] even though the property is on Britain would drive in Marietta\nIt's worth noting the property records for blood to the sea list a myriad of addresses a correspondence address for Curtis McBath ... addresses the same one cruise we basses claimed the homestead exemption on since two thousand two\nSo let's review these inconsistencies after we check traffic with Doug Turnbull [noise]\nDo it you know what you want to be on the out of my job down to about thirty five minutes I worked in a broader market all the way around I twenty I intend to bring back I've been trying to wrap on money of course I've got\nTo almost forty minutes rocket around I don't know if I don't work at an earlier and earlier I don't have any down here and there\nThank you and and again you all I'm looking at all\nCalm that has this uh Jessica forgive me I always but your last name so I'm not going to say don't air but a Jessica at all on Georgia who just fantastic uh reporting on these issues she has this and she points out these inconsistencies\nAre so blunt county Tennessee doesn't offer homes that exemption soon as he doesn't have a an income tax they don't do homestead exemptions and there are three properties and blood county Tennessee listed encouraged me bass name now the records for the property in to the CDC Kurdish me bath resides in Marietta, Georgia\nBut Lucy McBath is that her husband is a permanent resident in Tennessee\nThe bass acclaimed homestead exemption in Cobb County for the last sixteen years but during the entire sixteen years Curtis mass has been a registered voter in Tennessee\nLucy me back to sit and she's not hasn't been a resident of Georgia for a period of time but was one of Tennessee but even during those years she wanted the homestead exemption and Cobb County\nHomestead exemption laws require the vehicles all by property owners have to register to the county where the homestead exemption claimed but may bass vehicles are registered in Tennessee\n\nTo make bass campaign says Lucy lived in Georgia six congressional districts in two thousand eight but into thousand Ninety thousand ten she claimed homestead exemption in Douglas County while her husband claim one in Cobb County\nDouglas County isn't in the sixth congressional district meaning McBath was not honest about living in the sixth district\nI mean all of this is just [noise] my goodness gracious y'all we have a candidate and of course it's a Democrat running for Congress of the six Russian districts who probably actually lives in Tennessee who's been claiming homestead exemptions in areas that she doesn't live\nTaking advantage of the tax payers of Cobb County\nAnd at least Cobb County is seeking a refund of the exemptions given for the last three years and and not given in two thousand eighty which is good but this is this is another ... why are the Democrats bidding these candidates better me either you know the situation on Andrew Gillum mood Gilliam who's running\nFor governor in Florida it looks like he may when rubber stamped his

Florida you've got the open minded he'd be white liberal in Arizona you got this lady in in the sixth district and nobody bothered to actually that the candidates they were playing for identity politics\nAnd they didn't bother to bet that these people and look what's happening by not vetting these people their their campaigns are starting to fall apart or because they were never voted but you know this is the moral of the story here by the way is that primaries matter\nPrimaries better primaries make you a better candidate in the general election typically having a rough and tumble primaries look at ... up the Stacey Abrams campaign is pouring on lots of dirt on Brian Kemp\nRight now and it's not affecting him in the polls\nThree says it's not affecting bracket but the polls is because it's all old news he whether these attacks in the primary in the runoff they've already been vetted the voters have already heard them they've already dismissed them they've already treated them as old news\nAnd meanwhile all these things coming out about Stacey Abrams in addition to the stuff she's currently said on the campaign trail all these things are new ... and she didn't have a real primary and no disrespect intended to Stacey Evans but she didn't have the budget\nAnd so she couldn't level these attacks and\nSo what's happening all the stuff that's coming in now Stacey Abrams on Lucy McBath when the ... and cinnamon in Arizona and you name it they didn't have aggressive primary nobody level these attacks on them\nSo that didn't have a chance to respond and know what's happening right before the election and they are getting their clocks cleaned as a result\nPrimaries matter and neither party ever does well when they decide to coordinate candidates\nThat as a lesson to be alert here it is a lesson Republicans had to learn in twenty ten and twenty twelve it is a lesson Republicans had learned in two thousand six when the Democrats clean their clock\nIs less than Democrats are having to learn now core nations create terrible general election candidates they need to whether the fires of her primary so that they can be vetted thoroughly by their own voters and the other voters can be exposed to an undocumented from the negative views that hasn't happened with these candidates\n[noise] Atlanta's evening news very Gary\nUser militias accurate than be five day forecast for the same traffic every six minutes don't you ask me [noise] like\nThe guy got about a hundred and drama and the left lane a virus down just down to the Arab Georgia or a hundred birds objectively intimate down more on down here and I think that it's only like it that way\nI don't know what am I getting better but [laughter] to go to mark the get go I Would\n\nSix thirty I'm Chris Taylor live and the ws be twenty four hours of W.
