getting oh gosh that never ever ever happens well obviously this is how he conducts his courtroom\nThis is the kind of individual he is what is it with the left is out there who agree with the idea that it should be a more progressive court what is it would you guys saying it's okay to lie\nWhat is it what you're saying it's OK to cheat and steal to when I get it's politics at the level of our politicians I don't ever expect any of them to tell me the truth ever I got to dig for myself\nCombination of wisdom experience knowledge research I don't buy a headline ever when I read it I might be in treat to go read the entire story how many have you go read the entire story I mean if you just go ahead and fast forward and and share and light and re tweet\nI don't care if your individual politics say I want the government to be more progressive I Want us to turn into a more socialist nation I Want to take money from the successful and give it to the unsuccessful that's my personal belief great do you live in America you live in the greatest country in the well for you I get it it's not but\nFor me we live in the greatest country on the face of the earth and if you want to believe that you have the freedom to believe that say that\nJust say that if you truly believe that's the way we should go say it\nGo forward just like my friend and say it's about making a ... a more progressive court well that's fantastic here's the problem we're guided by the constitution and in the constitution the president of the United states when they Supreme Court vacancy comes up\nNod of being able to select the person they feel most suited and the Senate per the constitution has the advice and consent cause they're supposed to make sure that the president's nominee gets a thorough vetting to advise and or provide the consent to what has been selected by the president\nGoing to get into this a little bit more but let's get some advice on the roadways Doug Turnbull has all of\nThem are with all my block again Alan declared again nobody wants to be in a Geiger counter hero we've gotten all the Democrats are playing none of it all off to this\nI've traveled advisory Seventy five and I weigh one thirty one over there like Seventy five forty one year old we bought the on the side of town and when you're older wanders\nForty five minutes from working out of what it's about forty five minutes hundred around it I was wondering what\nIt appears right now nobody who's ... employing the Machiavellian tactics have said anything necessary lie cheat steal swindle fast forward or just don't even think none of you want to come up and say what's why that's okay because I think oh you realize it's not\nBut the Senate's acting the way they are in the Congress is acting the way they are and they're just basically performing\nAre we all end just this really weird reality t._v. show are we are we in the Truman Show\nOnly we don't know what there's another audience out they're all watching us act and and and deal with one another and the most stupid of possible ways that we allow somebody to just blatantly lied to us and we say well but we want what you want so go ahead keep lying to us and we'll just go in ... what you just said because we don't want to think for ...\nTo hoard\nGo to the phones you got ... from Monroe calling into ws be Brett what's on your mind [noise]\nAh yes I agree ... probably ... as crazy as they say\nOh you're cutting out hold on let me let me let me let me fill for just a second and see if we can get you a good signal back are you there\nYes I'm here okay there we go sorry about that saying that\nBecause it gets out just as you're making your point yet they they they taper Hillary\nClinton will to threaten our national security in the closet so it's not okay with all due on credible allegations he was like\nWell you know there's a big difference there is a de by one person's name and one person was nominated with an R next to his name is\nBrett thanks for calling and I appreciate it and that's a great point if you believe the accuser one hundred percent you are guilty until proven innocent if you are the accused why didn't that work against Hillary Clinton she was accused of putting illegal emails on a private server we know she did\nWell you know she broke the law we know this but let's play it out as if we didn't already know that if you did that\nAnd I make the accusation why wasn't she guilty and had to prove her innocence\nWhy did she have to go under the road to router investigation why did ... elements within the FBI conspire to write her exoneration no before she was ever even interviewed because we have according to Senator Dianne Feinstein a new level of due process in our country\nIt does not matter whether or not you can prove anything you say but if you make a serious charge that is tantamount to having committed the actual crime in other words if you came up to me and said you know what I think you ... you you haven't been paying your taxes\nNeed you to submit to an IRS wrote a router for the last seven years otherwise if you don't it's obvious you're guilty\nI Want you imagine imagine somebody walking up to you right now maybe you're a business owner maybe you're a stakeholder and a company maybe you're a partner I Want you know imagine what would you do if someone walked up to you and said I\nHaving a good authority your channeling money out of this company you're funneling it your embezzling cash and I think you need an investigation on yourself\nAnd if you don't it's obvious you're guilty see it's obvious because only a guilty person wouldn't want to go under the microscope of an iris inspection of your books got to be right we should move forward from that one that's the new level that Dianne Feinstein wants us to follow and the other folks that are\nAll up in this whole idea that you have to believe the accuser\nWith one hundred percent ... and then it is somehow a bad thing is or the caller said and as you you're not allowed to question you're not allowed to kind of ... from you're not allowed to ask for ... you know apparently we have rewritten all of centuries of of of of process\nAnd the concept of innocent until proven guilty now it's the accusation so think about that the next time somebody comes to you and makes a charge\nFrom now on it's up to you to prove you're innocent how would that go if we did that moving forward\n[noise] Erick Erickson and his land has aids making us
