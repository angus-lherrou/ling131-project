can fix them they can even see them on the day of the election you're not hearing that from Stacey Abrams\nOr all of this just to show you that the Democrats in Georgia led by the Stacey Abrams campaign are willing to weaponize race further than it has been done\nBefore as a way to when they are willing to scare black voters they're willing to drive up hyperbole in fact there's a story it is a little notice I'm ... ... of the story indie AJC is Stacey Abrams\nYou mean that black churches tried to drive black voters out to the polls as well on on this hyped up rhetoric about brain guilt about Republicans about the change that they can do that they are weaponized dean race to try to drive out black voters but I can tell you just listen to this audio\n[noise]\n\nThey're willing to

of Abrams\nAnd an address of the nearest polling place\n[noise] noticed that this happened at a church\nCan you imagine the press reaction if Brian Kemp was doing this sort of thing and churches around the state\nJust more I think double standards on display\nOr you got Stacey Abrams going on national television making up counties in Georgia that don't exist Glasgow county attacking Brian

Elizabeth Warren herself that happened at the Netroots Nation convention in Atlanta last July\nHad to come out on stage and ... the crowd and get Stacey Evans off the stage as a broom supporters were intimidating hurt 'em tried to force her to drop out of the race\nAs if only Stacey Abrams was allowed to to campaign you all were seen the weaponization of race in this campaign and it is not Brian Kemp it is not the Republicans doing it\nIt is the Democrats and I can assure you or that they will be emboldened to do it further unless voters respond accordingly which I think is going to happen\nOr we should not allow them to weaponize a race as they had been doing a scary black voters and trying to intimidate white Hispanic and Asian voters in this state and\nTried to to harass the

worry the lovely we're looking for it later on and on\nThe hit by the way he has this just popped in my head well ah well do you legally unrelated to traffic you know but this whole trust black women thing shouting down Stacey Evans trying to intimidate white voters in this very much reminds me of the whole Kevin situation that we've got to believe all women\nOr is it are bred capital must be guilty because some woman said so what happened to that one by the way she's falling off the radar since since this happened uh so we got to believe all women are but not the women who defend Brett Kavanaugh only the women who would would a damning with faint praise or or say he was guilty of something\nLike this is identity politics at its most visceral and violent form a short of actual physically beating people up the idea that you must be shut out of society must be driven out of the towns where he must be taken off TV and radio and your your opinion is not valid unless you agree with this mob\nIs what we saw with bread capital believe all women never mind that there were no witnesses never mind that all the people who are named as witnesses said it didn't happen never mind all the facts and we had to believe all women here you've got to trust trust black women or white women can't run for governor in Georgia\nOr white men can't run for governor George ... it's racist if anyone dares to stand up to Stacey Abrams\nA weaponized gene race is it's not just happening in far out left wing states like California and Oregon and New York it's happening here in Georgia trying to to weaponize race to intimidate people to not show up at the polls and the only way you can stop it as if you do go vote and you do vote\nFor camp for Republicans for those who aren't engaging in the weaponization of race and make your voice heard through that way to say this is unacceptable now there's another thing you know that they said this to only happens in far less date\nThe city of Atlanta has settled with Kelvin Cochran one point two million dollar settlement\nOne point two million dollar settlement Kelvin Socrates the fire chief who could seem read fired for writing a book for his Sunday school class called who told you you were ... you know what he had the audacity to do this but I've got a copy I read the book\nHe quoted scripture he quoted scripture the scripture he happened to quote was the scripture that calls homosexuality a sin and he wrote the book and was fire chief for more than a year\nAfter that book was published he says that the ethics office at the city of Atlanta gave him permission to write the book\nIn the settlement the federal judge said it didn't matter that he had free speech rights she may be an employee but he wrote the book in his off time for a city school class didn't matter whether he had permission or not he had the right to write the book\nAnd the book didn't affect his job there's no evidence that affected his job but the city of Atlanta fired him for not just being a practicing Christian but for writing a book\nExpressing his faith in affirming the an air and sea of scripture even related to homosexuality you'll recall no doubt that it was after years of this book had been out that he retiring lesbian fire captain in the in the fire department complained and said he made her feel uncomfortable ... there was no evidence he actually did\nBut this was the complaint to get it all started in the mayor of Atlanta fired him and claim to be justified in firing him\nAnd you know whose side Stacey Abrams ... she didn't take the fire chief side and now she's out campaigning say we don't need religious freedom Restoration Act in Georgia we don't need our religious freedom protected well who's going to protect Kelvin Cochran\nThe city settled they didn't want to admit they did anything wrong but they decided it would cost them far more to continue the litigation than to settle for one point two million dollars no jury would have taken it up for him but he never should have had to go through this process he should have never been fired by Atlanta\nFor writing a book that accurately reflects the Christian faith a book that he wrote for his Sunday school class\nAnd again\nAbrams at her supporters are on the wrong side of that\nThey're out there now denying that there's a problem in Georgia a fire chief was fired for being a Christian and the Democrats in Georgia say that's no big deal it's no problem everybody move on there's nothing to see here and oh by the way if you vote for the white person you're a racist\nThat's the Democratic message in Georgia\nThe madness of the Democratic party you are seen on TV every night in major cities around the country it's happening here in Georgia to we're not immune from this it's happening it just doesn't get covered the way it gets covered elsewhere but it's happening and the only way to respond to it the only vaccine is to vote\n[noise]
