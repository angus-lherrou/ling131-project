Feinstein and Chuck Grassley both come out and said they want to keep everything private we know that it's going to leak and we know the leaks are going to come from the Democrats and we know that the leaks are going to be most opportunistic Li used against Brett\nKavanaugh so there are some Republicans in the Senate who are thinking they just need to release the full file\nBut there is also a new twist remember what I told you the other day about Christine Blasey Ford and why she remember breakdown in fact she said so in her Senate testimony on Thursday\nIt was the double door\nShe wanted another door on the front of her house it was going through renovations and she wanted another door and everyone told her it was a bad idea that she didn't need another door and she insisted they needed a door on the front of their house\nAnd she finally in therapy explained that it was because of Kevin all and she had run out of this house undetected unseen after he sexually assaulted her and it was all his fault she wanted to do double door\nWell you know you would think that this would be easy to go Steve because most cities particularly if you live in California you got aggressive planning and zoning and you got to get licenses and permits well real clear investigations\nAside site to real clear politics has gone out and actually pulled over the permitting it turns out there is no record of\nUm the Christine Blasey Ford trying to get a separate door on her house except in two thousand eight remember she didn't tell the therapist is until two thousand twelve\nIn two thousand eight she and her husband renovated their home to build an apartment on the first floor of their house and so they had to install a separate door as a separate entrance into this separate apartment that\nThey had built that's what that was all about\nThere was no double door to get in and out of the main house they were building an apartment\nAnd had to put an exterior door on for someone to use the separate rooms separate living space as an officer apartment and it turns out that there was some sort of therapist\nWho worked out of their home or worked out of this office for a while who claimed to help recover memories of traumatic experiences\nI'm Wondering if this is the therapist\nI Wonder if this is the therapist and it's so it seems to corroborate the the reports that maybe she was hypnotized because remember she wrote a paper in the nineties in defense of hypnosis\nFor therapy it's been widely criticized since then because it relied in part on a paper from the Nineteen

D writing virulent hatred of Brett Kavanaugh\nConvinced and this is a very smart person who is convinced that he must have sexually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford convinced that all the bad stories are true and this is a very smart person\nAnd someone in and amongst my friends on this email chain said you know my guess is that this person was the victim of a sexual assault\nVery much like how\nOften times the people who are most virulently of pro abortion or people who've had an abortion and at the same time that people who are most virulently against abortion or the people who have had an abortion ... situation\n\nAnd ... there's a\nMajor pundit who wrote about a sexual assault on her today and is very much in the anti Kavanaugh camp\n\nAnd I do understand this I Know some of your going to claim that you don't understand it but you do\n\nYou did this they may not you they have hit this for a long time\nAnd it's starting to come out and they're angry\nAnd so they're gravitating towards the woman who claims to be a victim no I think Christine Blasey Ford has is lying and I think the longer the story is going on the more we realize she's line\nBut there are a lot of people who they've held on to their own secretive abused for so long that now it's all flooding out and and they can't get past what happened to them to look at the facts of this case and I do understand that I just grew with them but I understand them\nBut what's happening now we're in this post modern era\nAnd you've got a bunch of people saying believe her believe her\nWhy not believe him well into social justice warrior ecosystem you believe women over men because men have been the oppressor and so you have to give value to the women do uh to compensate in this intersection of ...\nThat the left wants will ... the white male in particular is is more dominant over the black male is more dominant over the white female is more dominant over the black female and on and on the road it goes\nAnd so instead of believing truth word to believe him were believe her believe her truth or believe his truth as opposed to just leaving truth yo if you were saying there's no such thing as truth ... to need to understand this\nAnd for many of these you'll be okay with this but if you're seen we can't understand truth we can't know the truth we can't embrace the truth we can't find the actual truth what you're saying is you can't know God you can't have a relationship with him\nBecause scriptures this crisis truth to you say there is no truth will then there is no God but there is a God\nIn were wrapped up in this post modern idea of of we have to find out what someone believe is true you know what you believe is true is not necessarily true I Know people who fundamentally profoundly believe we did not land on the moon my grandfather was one\nConvinced we did not land on the moon and there is no way you can convince this person that it's not true short of taking them to the moon and showing them Neil Armstrong's footprints in the way they're not going to believe it\nAnd that's their truth but it's not the truth how do you get people to know the truth will sometimes it's hard\nThis is hard that the moon landing when it's hard ... how do you you ... well they're not geologist they don't understand that\nThat that material doesn't exist here on planet earth so it

no one can keep a secret even in the Nineteen sixties and no one ever leaked out today this was on his Hollywood sound stage et cetera et cetera et cetera and\nBut I mean if if you're committed to believing your truth and not the truth\nThere's nothing anybody can really do to help you with this\nBut it doesn't mean that it is true and you and I\nShould commit ourselves to try to find out what is true in reject the idea that we can't know truth because if you believe you can't know truth well then you must be an atheist because you can know\nGod\nYou may not be able to fully grasp him but you can know him you can do is real and he is truth\nAnd to to say there's no such thing as truth or to say there's her truth and his truth there is to say there are multiple gods will we know that's not true either there's only one so there's got to be one truth\nIn what is getting lost in this entire situation is truth\nBecause people who are wrapped up in their own emotional experience and we use our emotions and we use our past experiences to help inform ourselves and help but help guide us in life that I get that and I get that ... if you were the victim of a sexual assault you're going to be more sympathetic to people who were victims of sexual assault I get that as well\nBut her truth is not the truth is truth is not the truth there is the truth\nAnd when you're wrapping up people in stereotypes and judging them by other people's actions and and decided to be mad at them because someone else did something to you in the past it's not fair that's not right that's not justice that's not equality and that's not truth either\nAnd we've lost all of that in this conversation about capital will be back\nNews wondering why don't you I mean Eric Harris and Madeleine of evening
