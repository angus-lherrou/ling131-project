S. B. talks with the president says he has not signed there have been some bad bad reports on this the president has not signed an executive order ending birthright citizenship\nHe says she will sign an executive order ending birthright citizenship\nBut he has not actually signed it now the issue is whether or not he actually can do that is it constitutional and there is some level of debate I Want to explain to you the debate um first of all we should start at the beginning\nThe Dred Scott case back in the early Eighteen hundreds said that a slave born in the United states was not a citizen that was part of what it determined\nThe early Americans believed that they were premised on English common law and it ... there was an English common law doctrine for um birthright citizenship Mel this differed from most of continental Europe\n[noise] most of continental Europe had the idea that you could not have birthright citizenship you had to apply for citizenship\n[noise] but most of continental Europe did not have what the British at the British had a massive global empire\nWhen the British to the sun never set on the on the British Empire they were actually being literal with that there was in every line of longitude except through the spans of see there was territory controlled by the British by and large\nSo the son didn't sit on the British Empire it was always sunlight somewhere in the world on a piece of land owned by the British the British needs to be able to control those people\nSo the British are common law idea became birthright citizenship if you were born within the British Empire you were subject to the crowd and England\nAs a result you became a citizen within the empire even now with the commonwealth you can travel between the commonwealth nations within the former British Empire\nWell the Americans came for the British Empire they had this idea that they were British citizens that's part of the reason we have the revolution is because they believed they were British citizens so along comes to the Dred Scott case that says okay yes this applies to white people but it doesn't apply to black people\nSo when they passed the fourteenth amendment\nThere was one guy who helped author the fourteenth amendment who says and the congressional record that this does not mean birthright citizenship\nIt only this essentially they're applying birthright citizenship to slaves who were born into this country and were otherwise not citizens but for the rest of 'em they weren't well every one else have you read the congressional record over the fourteenth amendment debate really disputes this\nAnd the common argument for most people with the fourteenth amendment was that this would restore the British common law that American so they had it would completely reverse Dred Scott and would replace\nAll of the dread say all all the decisions that came after Dred Scott and would essentially affirmed that we derived our heritage for British common law and\nThe British common law heritage was birthright citizenship\nSo fast forward after the forty them in what you see are legal cases that have never specifically address the point but if you read them you can tell it contemplates that we derive from this British idea of birthright citizenship which was distinct from continental European systems\n[noise] most of President Trump's appointments to the federal court\nOr on the record supporting the fourteenth amendment birthright citizenship\n[noise] so if the president for example in the Fifth Circuit court of appeals which covers a Texas Louisiana and I'm Sorry I'm ... African anyway the Fifth Circuit covers Texas for sure and that is where most\nOf the anti Obama immigration decisions have gone are the executive order or the the judicial injunction restraining bronco bomb on DACA and all that have come out of the Fifth Circuit have come out of Texas Jim hole and I'm Don will it\nAre both now on the Fifth Circuit court of appeals their President Trump appointees both have written in the past that birthright citizenship is in the fourteenth amendment\nSo if this case gets to the Fifth Circuit and that's probably where any um support for the president's going to come from the ... circuit did they're going to find Trump appointees who say no no the fourth fourteenth amendment\nComfortably birthright citizenship you can fix this but it takes a constitutional amendment\nThere is the dispute over whether or not the fourteenth amendment actually applies to birthright citizenship\nActually has a very recent phenomenon within the past Twenty years\nThis is a very new argument within the past Twenty years that it doesn't actually mean birthright citizenship what it says\nAnd even among those who think it doesn't a lot of them

I just don't like what Georges ... out of like a three point seven percent unemployment fully funded through twelve and a tax cut for the first time in the history of the state\nJust hard for me to think somebody doesn't want to be continued to see that happen\nRight well in ... and the Democrats certainly are running on a major expansions of entitlements in Georgia a and there's this far not saying they want tax increases but if we have to have a balanced budget I'm not sure how they're going to pay for everything\nThat well what we can't afford to the other side right it's just it's just that simple blocking and tackling it remind folks you know the ten percent in the middle\nOf forty five percent of going to vote for Republicans at forty five percent of going to vote for Democrats we always seemed to really try to figure out that ten percent in the middle and what we need to communicate to them as we can't afford another idea you may not be with us on every single issue\nBut continue to let us have conservative successes continue to let us focus on public safety and education at all these big ideas especially on health care I mean that's you mentioned it a second ago you know we can't afford to just let government run health care we watched with that look like with a bump chair\nYeah and now I wanted to expand Medicaid in the ... we we've also had there's been an ad that's run here with you both Puerto attacking both brand campaign you for not wanting to expand Medicaid and the state\nBut I've spent a tremendous amount of time in the legislature I wrote the rural healthcare released though\nA tax credit program that allows individuals and corporations to write checks directly to rural hospitals and get a hundred percent tax credits back\nThat's empowering communities to solve these issues here's what I Know about healthcare Georgia's got an opportunity to really innovate over the next few years I think we've got an opportunity to deliver a tele health in a way that no other states trying to figure out it really invite the world to come here and innovate\nAnd I think also with price transparency you know if we can log on to what happened to find out what the cheapest place to get a prescription is\nWe ought to be able to do that for other healthcare services knee replacements and checkups mammograms and all the other things out there\nAs as Georgians we ought to want to be able to innovate and I think we can\nI think so now I Am going to put you on hold real quick while we go check with ... chicken traffic force\nThe thirty nobody went

west twenty what about the fall of the five north worse than normal or caffeine road guys\nThank you very much I'm Talking to Jeff Duncan our next lieutenant governor so ... you're running for lieutenant governor and I think a lot of people they pay attention to the governor's race in in not necessarily to the lieutenant governor's race what is your real message out there on the campaign trail\nBut I've got drawn into to look at it this opportunity for lieutenant governor because I realized after five brief years and the general assembly\nBut I'm a policy over politics guy\nAnd his lieutenant governor you get to sit in a position where you're you've got your fingers on the pulse of all the policy coming through the state and and I feel like that's you know look what I didn't get into this position or coming through the political realm I was a baseball guy with the minor league I was a business guy started and sold a company and so I look through the lens of this\nAll business owner and my leadership style is one that looks for opportunities to empower those that work with me and ask a lot of really good questions and go just represent folks hardworking folks across Georgia\nThat's what's got my attention for this job and and really that's how I Want a tough primary but I I I feel like my message of the looking through the same lands\nThat the taxpayers do and I got three kids in the public school system up here for sites education's important the opportunities that education creates personal responsibility those are values that I Believe in it I was taught as a youngster and I get the opportunity to teach my three kids by watch\nHow was the reception been with a\nHouse guy coming into the sort of given the the fun contagious I Can't tell you how often I hear people on both sides say that the Democrats or the opposition but as the other other house that's the enemy and and yet here comes the guy from the house\nWho's going to take a position of lieutenant governor Howard the senators adjusting to this\nYeah it's been great great relationship that I've been able to form a lookout worked well with those guys you know they they were part of all the big bills Michael's wall and cargo soft act in the world health care bill\nUh looking here at the end of the day my job is not to go in there and\nTry to act like I'm the smartest guy in the room is still work with them and to build a team that really goes and represent what the values of Georgia or and and and I think given the opportunity I'm going to walk in there and and and and work with a team and continue to build a team that looked for ways to lower taxes improve public safety improve education\nYou know what education is one of those areas that I think we as Republicans can really truly makes some great strides on because the greatest gift I think it's a the state of Georgia and give a child is a quality teacher twelve education I think we can innovate around technology and empower educators with more technology in the classroom\nBut at the end of the day if that child doesn't have engagement or involvement from their parents or guardians at home there X but actually going to have a tougher time than than a kid that does happen gates that technology I believes gotta help engage those those family members that oh yaupon to raise those children\nAmen to that ... it's amazing that the studies I read more and more about uh the the difference between an a student in any other she is just how engaged their parents are a staggering um what parental involvement can do for education\n... kids have all kinds of difficult situations right to a single parent homes they've got\nYou know grandparents or aunts or uncles or you know foster care adopted all I mean there there's all kinds of tough situations but we ought to be able to partner with our public school systems and our charter schools or private schools and work with communities to empower communities to be able to be more involved in like everything we want to accomplish in Georgia\nHas to start with a quality education it has to\nYeah yeah I I agree with you on that and it makes me very nervous to hear the Democrats wanted to get rid of the opportunity scholarship and even ... curtail some of the reforms you guys have done on charter schools are just just seems so beholden to a special interest as opposed to actually looking at improving education for the kids out there\nYeah what I like I went through the lens of of three kids in a public school system broke and I you know or or or blessed to live in a community like suicide county that just does so good at educating kids\nAre really puts a child at the center of that of that education process but not every community can can wake up and send their kids off to a school that's performing like we do and so what we've got to be able to make sure that the closest\nA decision maker so that child which I Believe it's at the kitchen table is able to have a voice and be able to put those kids in the best quality position I can to given that opportunity to provide for themselves and their family for a lifetime there should be nothing else at the center of our decisions around education and the child\nYou know it's just so we've got really less than a minute I got to tell you that it has occurred to me in our conversation\nThe most unusual thing is I'm actually having a conversation with a politician and I'm not having to interrupt you are with which I appreciate normally a politician comes on and I got an interrupt because they filibuster I appreciate you having concise points that ended up period I think you appreciate\nThat appreciate what you do and the and the awareness you bring all the issues that are out there\nWell let's say good luck to you on the campaign trail and\nI Will certainly be voting for you as I'm sure a large segment of this audience will and I know you've got one more exhausting we used to go so my best to you and your family I'm Glad you're able to sneak away for some family time tonight\nAwesome thanks Eric Cantor check us out on a team duck and died or\nThanks very much Jeff Duncan he will be the next lieutenant governor next week I presume the polling looks for good for him which is another reason by the way that I think that uh Brian Kemp certainly as an advantage over ... is the lower tier races are all very Republican still\nAre you still going to get out and vote 'em but just doesn't will be fantastic lieutenant governor\nAnd it's nice to see a Republican and a state that has very entrenched Republicans now really running as a reformer which she has run the whole way through I'm bringing more common sense to the state legislature and going from house to the Senate\nOr to
