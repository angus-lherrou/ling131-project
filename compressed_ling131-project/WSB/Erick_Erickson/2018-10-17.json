I Would I I find this condescending to people who work bartenders waiters waitresses people who work in restaurants\nThe agriculture industry that somehow they don't want to be there\nUm they would love to work and renewable energy jobs some people do have to work in the in the hospitality industry jobs or whatnot because they're in school they're trying to make money or they don't have a college in advance college degree\nThey become a bartender they make great tips you know this is where the problems with liberals in in New York are fighting and as the city of New York it pushes more and more to get rid of tipping and encourage higher wages in lieu of tipping people are losing income because there are a lot of great tempers out there\nAnd it just is liberal do gooder is here on display that bankrupt so many states and I don't want George you to be next to this idea that the governor of the state can create jobs and that those jobs should be in renewable energy because climate change is real y'all there's this thing called the free market\nAnd in the free market the private sector create the jobs based on where people can make money\nThe government stays out of it keeps regulations low and the private sector does things here you know the chamber of commerce\nHasn't endorsed Brian ... they want to stay out of the race or their butter over Brian kept saying he would he would support refer in Georgia that they're really I mean the the chamber of commerce will cut off its nose despite its face in this race\nThey want nothing to do with Brian Kemp because he would he would support refer they don't want anything to do is with a Stacey Abrams 'cause they think she would be bad for business you would think they would do with the guy who would be good for business\nEven if they don't like this one thing this is how religious that has become for the chamber of commerce and George over refer ironically more on this but first we got to go check with Dr ...\nGot a lot going on here and buy more team do you want to be here I got it when he was white and out in the realm of all the right way to start at ... and you want to lose you get all the way round I Want to have had the right way to get gotta get a little\nOver five hundred oil drive older roads don't blocked about a mile or so and when he wrote an earlier they're all in there and I'm going to graduate okay we'll give you\nMuch ... is so here's the thing for for the chamber of commerce guys who they're literally sitting in this race out because of refer up they they\nRefused they had their big meeting a Abrams came and Kim came and they chose not to endorse\nBrian Kemp because of refer\nPonder how anti religious the chamber of commerce and Georgia has become\nNonetheless I mean\nTalking about cutting off your nose to spite your face here as a candidate for governor in\nGeorgia saying the governor should have the power to create whole industries in the state and direct people into those jobs\nWho is condescending to the chief economic engine of the state of Georgia agriculture\nLittle in the hospitality industry you got the Braves you got the falcons you got um the hawks you you got to eat in Atlanta United people who work in the hospitality industry there my goodness gracious folks the\nThe level of condescension that people shouldn't have to work in those places what if they want to work in those places\n\nShe wants to create different jobs because people shouldn't have to go into agriculture or hospitality to make a living\nNo one should have to go into any job some people have to because of life circumstances but the idea that the governor of the state of Georgia should have the power to create a renewable industry renewable energy industry in the state\nBecause climate change is real so we should have power the governor you know there's a larger story or ... let me step back out of George Baltic real quick um you will remember if you went to school as I did in the eighties\nYou'll probably remember we went to school in the seventies I I was born in Seventy five so but I I I've seen the national geographic some time magazine's whatnot you know the big fear after ... in the seventies instead of global warming it was a global ice age\nBut one of the things that stayed consistent was there was this whole idea was blurs the pushed by Canadian and Russian scientists back during the eighties the the Soviets and the left wing Canadians\nPushing the idea that the United states was going to be a a desert it was ... the ... the central heartland of the United states was going to become a giant desert and\nIt was essentially a long term push by anti capitalist people that resources needed to be allocated elsewhere not in the United states\nIt's really funny the un has issued its new climate change reports say we've got ten years to fix this never mind that five years ago we had ten years to push it in ten years ago we had to ... and Fifteen Years ago we had ten years to push it we're we're way past the point of no return according to all of their other reports and now some ...\nYears if you do what we say but they're back to the United states is going to turn into a giant desert there back to that there is and and so there was this\nPush among climate scientists that we need a command and control economy that the major scientists who are coming out of the global warming agenda are pushing the idea that the United states and other western democracies need to embrace government centralized command and control economies like\nChina to stop global warming\nThere is an air of that in what Stacey Abrams is said\nBecause climate change is real she should have the power to create whole industries in the state of Georgia to hell with the free market\nTo hell with the private sector you guys you do in the agriculture hospitality sectors are meaningless they're bad you shouldn't have to work in those you should be able to work in renewable energy jumps there is this other problem hanging out\nTheir brain Cuba is actually out\nWith a plan to improve schools including significant pay raises for teachers in the state Stacey Abrams is refusing to even go down the road a pay raise for teachers well KIPP is she says it's not going to happen she says he's not even going to do it\nWhere are you going to find the educated workforce for renewable energy jobs\nYou're not willing to take on the education establishment of Georgia you know would say the plan is for the education establishment Georgia's it's to perpetuate the status quo and punish people who want to send their kids to private school she wants to get rid of the state opportunity scholarship fund that allows poor kids to go to private schools to get good educations\nShe wants to rein in charter schools in the state she wants to go back to all the failed education initiatives\nThat Georgia Voters Black and white together have rejected over the past decade she wants to essentially completely undo all of these deals education reforms that have actually improved education of the state and yet somehow she thinks we're then going to have this massive educated workforce to go into an industry that she herself thinks she can create because of climate change\nThe whole thing\nIs just ridiculous I have they have the Democrats just given up on trying to win there just even in in Texas now with Beto O'Rourke they're just going full progressive uh showed his what they really think even though they can't win I that seems to be what's

if he's not there and all the security surveillance shows he went in but didn't come out well then he must be dead and the Saudis were the only ones inside the Saudi embassy they must have guilty I think it's very plausible here but I think what is equally plausible\nIs that a lot of people are seizing on this to attack the Saudi Government because they're really upset over the Iran deal they don't like our close relationship with the Saudis Brock Obama had a real interest in undermining that relationship which he did\nHis staff are now in place in Washington is pushing very very hard to say she got all our relationship and impose sanctions and by the way I think she sanctions are justified if a writer for an American newspaper is chopped into pieces and dissolved and ask them flushed down the toilet\nIn the embassy of a foreign country we should be imposing sanctions at a minimum on them\n\nBut there is something else we do need to consider here\nThere are bad guy\nI Know people don't like to talk about this these days we supposedly have moved on from the Cold War issue but the Saudis are our bad guys\nAnd\nThey help us advance our agenda against the Russians against the Chinese against the Iranians and increasingly against the Qataris\n\nI don't know that we want to get rid of the relationship I don't know that we want to to scuttle that relationship\n\nI mean just ... it reminds me of Pinochet in South America Pinochet was a man who ... if if reports or to be believe from the left loaded up communist on helicopters and drop them off in the ocean\nI got a buddy

thing\nPinochet also revived the economy of his country\nRan out the communist dropping them off into the ocean and helicopters and saved as people from oppression he was a bad guy but he was our pet

pick our allies as as unicorns and puppies and all love each other sometimes we have to make deals with bad guys to save us from worst people would you rather if you if you were forced to choose that

to do\nSomething ...
