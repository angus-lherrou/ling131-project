only way that filters down his shows like yours are are turning it into a TV ad\nAh the fact that she still hanging in there is really ridiculous\nSo out of step with Arizona values and American values you rattled off a number of uh a number of things that would have a Senate committee disqualifying in the past\nAh the here we are right down to the wire over eighty percent or around eighty

at night and you're going to be able to tune into the coverage and watch all night one thing you might hear is speaker elect Nancy Pelosi do you want to hear that\nI don't think so I Want to hear you know Senate majority elects Schumer I don't think so\nNow the way things are shaping up if you're a big Nate silver five thirty eight person which I'm not but I listen I look at what he produces um meat did catch the Obama wave early which kind of when you look back in retrospect\nWasn't that hard to figure out um but uh he got twenty sixteen wrong as did so many others anyway he saying it's an eighty six percent chance now that the Democrats take back the house\nAnd eighty two percent chance the Republicans keep the Senate gain seats\nUm I don't have a feeling by educated guess and I looked at the cook report and I looked at Nate Silver and I've looked at and talked to many pollsters around the country and is anecdotal evidence that I can sign on both sides of what we're seeing with early voting some of it looks good for the Republicans we just don't know\nBut the bottom line is is this election you know it needs to be about well first of all are you better off than you or two years ago\nOr is it as America's economy better off because by every objective discerning measured the answer is an overwhelming yes\nAlthough Obama so it's so funny\nHe referred to himself Ninety two times in eight thirty eight minute Nevada speech and they only had a crowd of two thousand in Nevada I saw the crowd last time I was out there with Dean Heller and President Trump when I interviewed Trump\nUm and then more people outside than the twenty ... twenty thousand people inside did you see last night's arena home never seen anything like it at people tailgating before twenty waiting twenty four hours before the start last night of Trump's rally what Ted Cruz in Texas\nAnd I thought my little crowd of four thousand in Beaumont in a airplane hangar was pretty good crowd apparently it is compared to Obama that's twice the crowd he had poor crazy uncle Joe Biden only a five hundred people at his crowd so that might be anecdotal evidence I mean but but to refer to yourself Ninety two times during a\nThirty eight minutes speech is pretty pathetic and he's back on the campaign trail and then don't forget now you got to remember that you know you see the good news about the economy remember it started with me\nPoverty and was [noise]\nAnd that's what I handed off for the next guy\n[noise] so so when you talk about [laughter]\n'cause right now it's me from [laughter]\nThe
