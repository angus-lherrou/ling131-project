concerned about the lack of production of some doctors we've gotten a lot of documents access to more than a million documents for the department of justice from but some key key documents including the so called McCabe memos which could very directly bear upon this question of\nA war with Rod Rosenstein doing in that meeting\nA immediately prior to the point when Robert Mueller as special counsel\nAnd are these allegations that are in the New York times actually true ah I think that can be a lot of life can be shut on that if the documents we'd been requesting for quite some time are made public so as a result of that this week I if they're not produced by tomorrow or Tuesday in this week\nUh we are going to issue a subpoena to the Justice Department that expands upon the subpoena we issued earlier this year and include McKay memos and some other documents that have been requested by us but not far not produce including Peters trucks personnel file some of the struck page\nA tax ah the ah the the Bruce or three of one and some other things\nAll right so joining us now in Studio we welcome back to the man that's in the middle of all of this and I said do you know what the news is tomorrow you getting bits and pieces of information about what's happened\nThere ... there we have people that know that were there that understand that in fact I'm a lot of this was a plan in a scheme of not only a media strategy league strategy but uh to take out a duly elected president I'm hearing a lot\nOf big hints coming Sean but similar to the situation where the DNC paid for a lot of lives about me I'm careful to not jump to any conclusions until the real facts are on the table so but I I agree and what I'm hearing is going to be really big\nYou know when all of this I mean to get for Pfizer warrants against you you would think that you must be a really bad guy and now that you've discovered how they obtain this information obtained these warrants against you um you've never been indicted so I guess you're not a threat to the country\nUm I've since learned through previous interviews that when you would go to Russia where your work brought you that you often would be debriefed by our intelligence community and you had a good relationship with them correct absolutely Sean yup\nYeah I've been by intelligence I mean CIA FBI gosh absolutely and other intel community people for decades yes for decades and I assume they like you and trust that you\nAbsolutely you know and we would sometimes disagree on things in terms of our various assessments you know similar to any um international relations or security discussions that I Would have back in the Pentagon et cetera but that's you know an honest debate\nRight but okay but they wanted it was never a time where you you ...\nWanted you to spy on your country that you love no but I again I'm happy\nTo share insights and ideas just like I Do you know used to at New York university when my students yeah that's what we're pretty open guy\nBut so anybody I guess that would regularly go to Russia because they are a hostile regime at and they've been hostile to the United states um we do know that in fact that ... does have a network of\nOf their own deep stayed operatives that are trying to create chaos in America by using social media and et cetera right that you don't doubt that\nWell in terms of creating chaos in America if you compare everything that the Russians did\nVersus what what the DNC did with their lives and millions of dollars they spent on that you're talking about election interference particularly their conspiracy with the deep state you know the OJ FBI CIA now that we're learning all these details much much worse than anything Russia did how did the\nDNC ever get away with never handing over their computers to the FBI um I don't think I'd get that consideration an option and no one's going to hire a room people what was it like when when did you first know that you were being spied on\nWell I started a I had some hints about it you know people I Know in Washington mentioned it in September of twenty sixteen right around the same time when I started getting phone calls from the New York times CNN Washington Post about these DNC funded lies\nAnd they mentioned to me that there were a Democrat hired\nOperatives working in Washington who we're paying for these ah these operations and you know soon thereafter dies I found out about the you know the hacking of my emails and wiretapping of my uh\nEndless of first happened in August so you found out pretty early\nYeah and actually I I first started getting phone calls I didn't know about the intelligence operation I just got a literal ... say\nThat they had this buys a warrant against you in the media knew about it or you believe they knew about it\nWell the first news report a I think came out with his a lady Louise mensch in October of twenty sixteen ... within just a couple of days of when the uh first Pfizer weren't with I think first\nRan with the story in March of Seventy yes and that's what we said wait a minute there is a buys a warrant on the Trump campaign or were you aware of our reporting at the time\n... it's funny Sean writes a interesting story I haven't talked about it in the media before but in March twenty Seventeen that's what's been leaked in the Washington Post that I was having all these meetings with the FBI\nI remember you know in these long series of ten hours plus meetings one of the meetings I'm walking out I mentioned\nThat well I had a long interview in detail with Catherine heritage and it's going to be airing tonight on the on the evening shows on Fox what they say they were quite a you know they they gave me a bit of luck let's just put it that way but there\nAgain because it's all about you know media perception what are they asking\nYou at the time what do they want to know their spying on you and then they're bringing you win simultaneously you've never been charged with anything there's no indication you're ever going to be charged with anything at all you don't fear that that in any way you're going to be charged right\n... well I Know I've never done anything wrong right and again the primary focus of those conversations was about the ... right by the same false allegations that the DNC paid for going back to ... a lot\nAbout that that they ask you specifics about that dossier\nAbsolutely yeah and to basically everything I've done and kind of all sort of revolving around that also you know as you were alluding to I've been a source for the intel community previously and you know I helped or the year prior there is a an indictment\nOf ... or ... you know someone pleaded guilty in the southern district of New York and I was a witness on that case you know we were talking a bit about that too\nAll right let's talk a little bit about what now now that your life had been up and that um you I I Know you're fighting to get your good name back\nI Know media organizations have pulled lives about you\nOr I Would say that the there was absolutely reckless disregard for the truth that a lot of these cases um what are your plans what are you going to do what are you going to do to the government that ends up you know using on verified information to literally take away all of your civil liberties has got to be some records for you\nWell I'd definitely working on a few strategies Sean to me the biggest concern is just the damage that this has done to our country and the roads blocked that has created for the Trump Administration in the first couple of years in office so\nMy the biggest thing that goes back to the first thing you were talking about in your segment a with chairman Goodlatte just getting the truth out there and so I'm doing everything possible to help facilitate that you should write a book\nWhat it's like to be spied on by your government you know something to that if I'm Serious that would be you know a at a movie certainly that could be put on the screen as as well but I mean what does it feel like ... I guess maybe there are some people because they took out the Warren on you\nDo you have you ... do you know what they did they ask you about everything that you were saying and doing it this time basically yeah and I'm going back many years again at\nAnd we had talked about how many hours total do you think you've spoken to intel community FBI Muller all these people how many hours do you think you spent total over the last two years out of the last two decades two years last two years well I mean\nIn terms of actually in person meetings you know forty eight hours or something like that but you know when you add in the hundreds and hundreds of hours I had to do in terms of document production etcetera right now that's a whole different level\nWhen you went before a mall or what was that like\nYou know I don't I don't like to talk about that ... just because in general they has been\nA less leaky in terms of getting the you know mentioning that fact but it was reported in December of twenty Seventeen December last year that I had a recently been in front of the grand jury and I won't\nI don't remember that night but I I don't even I back at all absolutely not and you haven't\nYou know and as the is it now they now stopped asking you questions one of the last time he got a call from anybody\n[noise] I haven't I haven't talked to anyone in twenty Eighteen\nAt all the whole year and it's like a year's worth of free to well you know\nIf I'm not worried about freedom for me I'm worried about\nFreedom for our country and freedom from the fake news you know I watched what happened to judge Kavanaugh it's just a complete replay of this exact same DNC smear tactics so you think\nThat there'll always be a cloud of suspicion hovering over your head because of this\nI talked with uh someone you know a top law professor a earlier this year and he said well there's always going to be thirty to forty percent of the country that has never believe you and completely hates you\nIt sort of thing but if you're on the brains in a series perjury their downfall here in game for the off its goes cold and the bullpen can't hold a lead hers was if you put that land on top of the two Ron ventured single and the fourth and that's all it line against the Dodgers pounded out for five runs in the sixth and seventh round rock and chat democracy to stick up for the\nMagical Tony Eighteen season the Dodgers advance\nTo face the brewers and they you know so yes\nPraise must wait until opening day march twenty eight twenty Nineteen and Philadelphia from Santa Rosa parks likeable he wants to marry\nAnd hurricane warning has been issued for the Gulf Coast of Florida had been expected mid week ... from hurricane Michael new justice Brett Kavanaugh says the Supreme Court is not a partisan or political institution\nAnd it's promising to always be a team player on a team of nine when that county police are on the scene after our body was found believed to be a man in his late teens or early twenties down there a house on north cliff drive near ...\nThat can win his connection is to this neighborhood we do know that he was found by asking children that were in the neighborhood corporal\nMichelle pie Harris has this man was face down and there was a lot of blood right now the death of being called suspicious and the national Transportation Safety board says there were no apparent skid marks the Fort limousine barrel through an intersection and crashed into a parked car killing ... people in upstate New York telling us the news time it's nine thirty to\nWrite another tax deadline is fast approaching or maybe you filed in your money and you can't pay it so what do you do a Sean Hannity here to tell you don't call the IRS ever on your own or they're the most brutal collection agency on the planet\nEvery day you put it off the stress is going to build is only going to get worse you got to deal with it called the pros at rush tax resolution\nEight five five IRS called eight five five IRS call\nOn the Web it's rush tax resolution\nDot com or one listener old one point one million dollars and rush settle for less than fifty nine hundred another old Ninety thousand dollars\nAnd you got to rush tax resolution settled\nAnd you're not going to believe this for a hundred bucks zero complain history a rated with the better Business Bureau with a five star rating I'm Talking to you call now eight five five IRS called eight five five IRS call on the Web it's rush tax resolution dot com\nBecause of fears and he ever catch them you can deal with cold morning coal cars but a cold shower no way to replace her upgrade your water heater and said we can deal hardly for for piano and if you don't have hot water today you don't pay ws the listeners book in October and Kathy ... gallon water heater\nTo fifty gallons free but you have\nTo move now to lock in this deal telemarketing you when you come seven seven zero Catskills and this is ...

S. B.\nAnd we have chronicled this now for years on this program\nBut the stakes couldn't be higher\nFor weeks from tonight I'm you might hear the words Nancy Pelosi will be the next speaker of the house\nAnd committee chairman Maxine Waters and committee chairman Jerrold Nadler of New York I born Jew over and over again they don't have any vision to make your life better or they do want to destroy Trump they want impeachment open borders ice eliminated keep their crumbs and Obamacare\nShort of that what else did they stay on for\nSo if you've got to start it's important to remember that you know it's an uphill battle in mid term elections the party that controls the presidency has only gain seats in the house of representatives three times in the last one hundred years\nYou have also on top of that you've got about forty retirements to deal with which means that the names on the ballot or new and different hopefully better in some cases\nBut are you better off today than you or two years ago as a matter of America better off today than it was two years ago is America stronger than it was two years ago if the economy better off than it was two years ago\nIs the president keeping his word just promises to you the American people\nWe know that on the issue of the tax cuts while he's kept his promise on the issue of ending burdensome regulation nice kept his promise on building a wall he hasn't fully been able to do it because that hasn't been fully funded Kevin McCarthy introduced the ... bill today to fully fund the wall\nBut he has spent three point three and a half trillion dollars to\nFund the wall in our record unemployment and fourteen states we now have the lowest unemployment rate in over fifty years the last time it was this low was Nineteen sixty nine when the New York Mets shocked the world and won the world series that's how far back that goes\nHispanic American unemployment record lows African American unemployment record low women in the work force record low record low for\nAsian Americans also record low for a veterans who have come back from war they're getting employed as well to\nResidents kept his promises on feely dealing with rogue regimes like Iran and North Korea sanctions in Iran are now paying off\nWe see the Iranian economy about tank every day we see the whole issue with little rocket man we don't have a rocket being fired almost every other day that seems to be remaining on track the president hasn't given up anything in regards to that\nPresident has opened up an war we now have one of the largest oil reserves that was on available because of environmental extremism it's a vast wilderness and we just let it sit there\nAnd we haven't been able to tap into those resources or building the Dakota pipeline or the Keystone Pipeline that's all in the works now too\nIt's not a small deal is it that the president kept his promise and put to original is on the U.S Supreme Court they've now been confirmed he gave us the names of people that he was select from any selected from that list\nPromises made promises kept too short years and we see the benefits of the country\nAnd then twenty eight days or weeks from tomorrow from tonight you're going to tune in and we're going to find out what the results are\nThe good news is is that you have the power here a lot more power than you even think Nancy Pelosi's pick it up the drapes Maxine Waters is thinking impeachment Jerrold Nadler once endless investigation nobody's thinking about what they're going to do for you we the people\nWhat are they going to do they're going to now finally come out against Obamacare no they love Obamacare they gotta now say you know what these tax cuts of working and it's creating jobs they're not going to do that either\nYou know we've learned a lot in the last couple of days and we're really going to dig down deep do a head of the investigation and the next hour\nYou know while we've been so busy in the last three weeks covering the blood joining of judge Kavanaugh leading up to his confirmation there's been a lot of news that we have not been covering one of them is John Solomon Sarah quarter you know Byron York everybody Katherine Harris you've all been breaking stories but\nYou know we have all the evidence now that things were far worse regarding the effort to literally ... do\nAn election of the president first we know just to remind you bring your backwards a little bit remember Hillary Clinton the single greatest obstruction of justice case slam dunk case in our history\nWe know that Hillary Clinton obstructed justice when she deleted subpoenaed emails\nAnd then use bleach pet and then busted up devices with cameras were had her age do it that's obstruction but of course she had friends in the deep state they took the case away from the field agents and brought it in a house with the upper echelon of the FBI and that would be called me and struck in company\nAnd told me and struck in particular they wrote the exoneration Hillary in May of twenty sixteen long before they ever interviewed Hillary or the main\nAll involved in the whole thing and then all of a sudden they interview heard Peter Struck one of the interviewers a man that thinks that Hillary should win a hundred million to zero and they exonerate Hillary three days later and then they launched the Russia investigation\nAn exoneration before an investigation that means the fix was it if the field agents if they were allowed to do their job it never would have ended up that way because they would have followed the rule of law they would have they would have kept their pledge of equal application of our laws\nWell now the new evidence and remember then all everything goes back to the dossier that Hillary bought and paid for but\nWe now know that last week while we were covering the cabinet issue that the FBI general counsel James Baker remember he reported directly to James ...\nWell he told congressional investigators last week that an attorney\nRemember the company ... that's the company that Hillary's campaign and she was controlling the DNC money according to Don and Brazil or they will funneling money into Perkins Kuwait which is a law firms so it would show up on campaign finance report says illegal cost\nIt turns out they would hire fusion GPS in our research group that they went out and hire the former and my six agent\nOr the name of Christopher Steele Christopher Steele uses Russian sources he himself doesn't even stand by any of his sources he doesn't believe his own dot CA when push came to shove and an inter August ... and Great Britain\nBut anyway this revelation is Baker telling the number two the the lead counsel for the FBI who is now gone twenty five pop representatives of the FBI and the de OJ or either resigned or fired or\nOr stepped aside\nAnd anyway stunning revelation that he told congressional investigation gators that an attorney for ... law firm gave him the materials again this is what Hillary paid for about Russian election meddling during the twenty sixteen presidential campaign\nThat's done in terms of what it reveals since uh directly contradicts Justice Department an FBI official sworn testimony\nSo in other words they lied under oath\nAnd Baker was telling Congress last week the ... lawyer Michael Sussman directly handed documents to him about Russia's attempts at meddling in the twenties sixteen election\nIn other words he was a cut out he was a go between for Hillary Clinton and the FBI knew it the question is why did the FBI knowing this then lie about\nThat in effect you know its application then for the ... which we now know the bulk of information for that was the Clinton bought and paid for dot CA that even the guy that put it together doesn't stand by but anyway\nThe fights application was based on Hillary's bought and paid for dot CA but it was all to get warrants to spy on a Trump campaign associate\nAnd by the way it seems now that it was done at the direction of Donald Trump's opponent Hillary Clinton from the get go\nMuch by the way it would be entirely illegal for both the FBI and for Clinton what appears that they've done here how many times if I said this is the biggest abuse of power scandal in American history\nNow you've got numerous officials after the OJ and the FBI have told us under oath that nobody at the FBI ideal Jay knew anything about the Democratic party being behind all this Clinton dirt\nHouse intelligence committee chairman Devin Nunes is he was on with Maria berets aroma think on Sunday said well now you have one of the top lawyers for the Democrats in the Clinton campaign feeding information directly to the top lawyer at the FBI\nSo it appears that the FBI and department of justice for doing the Clinton campaign's bidding and applying for the Pfizer warrant to snoop on Trump's campaign communications\nAnd they did so by getting the size of war to spy on Carter Page which means that with Hillary's without Hillary's involvement here\nThey wouldn't have been a finds the application to spy on the Trump campaign that wouldn't be fusion GPS or dusty a Trump we wouldn't be living through his second year of endless Trump Russia investigation with no evidence whatsoever because Democrats cynically launched the whole thing\nTo ruin Donald Trump's presidency and set 'em up for impeachment\nAnd the news story that we have out breaking this morning proves just that\nYou know James bakers test the testimony is blockbuster and I don't see

continues and hurricane Michael now is headed straight for the Florida Panhandle looks like it could hit land at a category three\nA and there's a massive storm surge risk for the panhandle and and the entire area that would be just in Fort Walton Beach uh and surrounding communities and uh in hurricane warning storm surge warnings have all been issued along the Gulf Coast\nAs I understand that we have some evacuations now taking place and it looks like it's a really big threat to the panhandle of thoughts and prayers go to our friends down in\nThe panhandle area we check in with both job authority the official weatherman of the Sean Hannity show and of course he's with weather bell dot com and being I'm being told that the worst storm to hit the Florida Panhandle and like decades how bad is\nWhy I think it's going to be the or maybe the worst on record in Panama City or that area particularly last major hurricane to hit coming in at this angle was a hurricane ... back in Nineteen Ninety five hurricane cage\nIf they are in November believe it or not um Nineteen eighty five that was a major hurricane in the Gulf\nBut a week into a category too when it went through there so this is probably going to be the benchmark storm for that Panama City area now the fortunate thing is if we want to cover the of sort of the silver lining here Pensacola and mobile are going to get north wins\nAnd mobile I don't think this is a big deal immobile Pensacola go forty ... sixty maybe three four inches of rain but once you start moving east southeast would down the coast and especially in that Panama City area\nThis is going to be as bad as you see in that particular area\nThan weather pattern you remember of Florence was off its peak when it hits in North Carolina coast this one because of the weather pattern is intensifying as it comes to the coast\nAnd I don't expect anything to stop it from being a strong category perhaps even a a borderline category for upon landfall very well telegraph in this pattern you remember Shawn last time I was on with you I said I'll I'll probably see for a week in October\nWhy why why is this now getting stronger the way you're describing and ... what does it mean look the average person including me has no idea why the actual angle of the ... when it reaches land matters so much why does the angle of the storm matter\nIt's also the overall pattern one Florence was coming into powder in the western Atlantic was a weakening as far as tropical cyclones on September twentieth believe it or not Japanese me to Raj you see it snaps came out and said look out October of ...\nThrough about the nineteenth and the Atlantic basic you notice all the tycoons have shut down in the western Pacific completely I said well what is it has to

hit Louisiana and Mississippi with Gordon Alberto\nWe hit off to the east over there with or this is going right in between and instead of coming west northwest sitting at sitting in the classical faction from the south west corner race through the Carolinas so you folks in the Carolinas you're going to have a fast moving tropical storm go through there and unfortunately\nIn a lot of these areas that were hit by Florence is going to be another three to six locally ten inches of rain coming Thursday night into friday morning friday the storm will be between Cape Hatteras in Norfolk go

might be fired after it had been discovered that he was talking about what you want me to wear a wire\nAround the president and his answer was you know at least has the spin was while I was just saying that you wouldn't want me to wear a wire around the president and it was all in the tone and the cadence of what he said we have three articles in front of me right now one by Katherine heritage that Fox one by Sarah Carter won by John Solomon\nSolomon's article goes on former FBI lawyer plot to record removed Trump was not a joke and John Solomon let me read from the article don't tell for FBI general council member James Baker he was one of those that resigned that those infamous discussions\nAbout secretly recording president Donald Trump and using the tapes to remove him for office where a joke he apparently doesn't believe it and he yelled quite the vantage point as he was on the inside of the FBI bureaus leadership and may have twenty Seventeen when the discussions occurred and Baker told Congress last week\nThat his boss than acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe remember ...\nAnd Lisa Page both took notes of the meeting and McCabe was saying yeah Rod Rosenstein had in fact said this\nAnyway now James Baker is saying and Andrew McCabe is saying that in fact they were dead serious about about the idea\nOf Sarah surreptitiously recording the forty fifth president\nUsing the evidence to make the case\nThat Trump should be removed from office according to every source now in all three articles and Baker told lawmakers that he wasn't in the meeting that McCain had with the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein in which the subject came up but he had first hand conversations with Medicaid\nAnd the FBI lawyer that was assigned to a ... page about the issue so Baker talk to both of the\nUn quote as far as Baker was concerned this was a real plan being discussed that the source directly familiar with the congressional investigation it was no laughing matter to the FBI or member then you can go back to what was the insurance policy to remove Trump\nIs this five months now into his presidency is this just before the appointment of the special counsel\nThat says just in the timeframe around the media elite strategy that was occurring anyway so it goes on word of bakers testimony now is surface just days before Rosenstein said to be interviewed them private by the\nHouse Judiciary committee lawmakers that's supposed to happen Thursday of this week and the New York times first reported allegations that Rosenstein the number two at the department of justice has tried to downplay his role in all of this in his office suggested that\nHe thought the discussion was a joke that Rosenstein never gave in order to carry out any such plot\nAnd he doesn't believe the Trump should be removed from office of making those statements through a spokesperson is a bit different than having Rosenstein himself face Congress answer the questions under the penalty of a felony if lawmakers think he's lying and bakers account lawmakers this month clearly complicates that already complicated picture\nAs it relates to Rod Rosenstein before Congress assuming he shows up put Thursday's interview but even more so Baker story ladies' battered extraordinary conversation and we go on from there now we've got to really take our time with this issue today and\nWe're going to now begin to put the pieces of the puzzle together because what this is we're laying out here are the top people at the upper echelon member twenty five people have either been demoted fired or have left the FBI the OJ their\nUpper ranks here and James Baker is one of them and Andrew McCabe at least a page of both corroborating what apparently now James Baker is set about Rod Rosenstein anyway John Solomon ease ... investigative reporter is what the hell break Jarrett Fox News legal analyst\nAnd of course the seller of the number one book the Russia hoax thank you all for being with us I'm John let's just I I Want to also put this in context where people because it gets complicated we got a first start with the pine light and the timeline is may have twenty Seventeen or that's when Robert Mueller is getting appointed by Rod Rosenstein\nJust before that we had people like ... at least a page and and Peter Struck talking about uh media leaks strategy that had to do with the ...\nWell it now appears that that was all being league for the purposes\nAnd again ... all it was was the dot CA recycled and different news outlets for the purpose of initiating the special counsel so would get appointed that we're discovering that they're even talking about surreptitiously taping the president of the United states so that they can remove him from office this sounds like a cool to me\nWell if it was one other event that occurs and that may timeframe that really I think you're the shock wave for this conversation and that was the termination of treats go\nColumbia's the FBI Director of it all out all this Russia investigation to go on and we know now just after market may still at it from a proving any form of collusion with Russia so they've been nine months out of James Kobe's let this go on for mark\nHe's led to agents who have an anti Trump fires read that investigation he got fired and what's the natural reaction of all those who've been supporting James Comey roses are McKay and a stroke page it's hey maybe we can remove this guy rather we can't prove that he did something wrong with Russia\nMaybe we can prove
