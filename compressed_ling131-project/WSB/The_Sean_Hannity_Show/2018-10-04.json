Chandler reports of Metra Atlanta teacher has got investigators attention\nYou know Joe I I I don't know what the law enforcement should do I do know this I Know that we have now examined every single case\nIn every case there is no corroboration in every case there is multiple inconsistencies in the last case Julie sweating like there are so many inconsistencies in his mind numbing that NBC would ever aired that interview\nBut they are today anyway the eyewitnesses are the witnesses she mentioned one is dead one doesn't even know who she is and they can't get an answer from the other two\nAnd now the last minute 'cause they're desperate now they want the FBI investigating ice throwing incidence in high school\nWell I think um what has happened with Julie sweat Nick is that the Senate committee after the confirmation vote occurs needs to make a criminal referral\nTo the Justice Department or the U.S attorney for the district of Columbia to investigate her for obstruction of a congressional proceedings by submitting false affidavits and for perjury is written testimony very easy to investigate and it has to be done in order to send a signal\nTo everybody out there that you cannot simply make false statements to a congressional committee in a confirmation process to get yourself publicity is very very important that ...\nBe investigated by a federal grand jury to act as a deterrent against others from making false accusations there is no substantiate issue for her story there is no substitute education for Mr Ramirez story and I just wanted to say something that I Know\nAre probably showing you don't agree with she has repeatedly lied him like her lawyers did not tell her\nThat the committee was willing to come to California to interview her that is a lot for lawyers did tell her that no good lawyer would never community\nShow I I got I got to tell you I don't think they told her if you remember that moment when professor Ford was asked when I forgot maybe it was Lindsey Graham who or whoever it was said we offered to go to you may be Senator Grassley I think both Senator Grassley and then\nShe said oh I ... there was genuine surprise now remember Dianne Feinstein was working behind the scenes to get a\nRadical left wing activist a resistor as a lawyer this is separate hats\nNever catch by the way who said well Paula Jones only spent ten or twelve minutes with with Bill Clinton it wasn't a big deal that wouldn't constitute sexual harassment in the workplace\nAnd also defended and in the case of Al Franken but I I saw a genuine shocking surprise and she goes well but I didn't know that but that was very nice of you if you offered that I didn't know\nThey should be referred to the D.C bar then for violation of professional world I I\nI may very well come to conclude that eventually and I'm perfectly happy with except that\nI can buy that and I'll tell you something that really bothers me about her story and that's an old prosecutor who tried sex crimes cases\nHere's the one thing about her story besides everything else we talked about that doesn't make any sense any victim in a situation like that goes to where people are for safety now why is her story not include are going to those people\nBecause if she had done that\nIf she ... literally if if what she says occurred and if she had gone to those people get\nWhat they would have remembered it in order for her to have a story that holds up without anybody knowing about it she had to leave the house\nI don't know though and look maybe you know because we're talking about we all know that there are real evil predators\nThere are people that do murder and rape innocent people there are people that will drug and rape people I eat look at the bill Cosby case\nWe know that and and this is why I think that the Republicans credit they took these allegations in charges seriously they handled it professionally they afford it every combination which was the right thing to do\nBut for the Democrats they just they just now push this so far\nInto it it ... into any allegation no matter how many inconsistencies no matter no evidence no matter no cooperation whatsoever and we saw that they hated the guy from the beginning\nI I don't I don't know what I don't know what victims remember or don't remember Joe and I don't know what how they act or react I Would assume was probably\n... people react differently like you go to a funeral some people are crying some ...\nI was I was perfectly happy to accept anything that she had to say and I listen to her testimony carefully at the time and his and then I went back and I looked at it repeatedly and it may very well be that she believes everything she said\nThe problem is there's not a sin pillar of evidence to corroborate and convenient late enough everything that could happen that would have made her story corroborate rubble it's nonexistent\nThey taught us than happen that just doesn't happen\nSean ... let me just say well you know we make our living trying to look at stories like this and taking them apart are supporting them\nThere's another problem with her story listen she said that they there was music on an upstairs bedroom that kind of weird because the party was downstairs that let's take it and they turned that music up so nobody could hear her\nAnd then she likes to south in the bathroom and she can hear them talking going downstairs what you think these guys just turn the music ups and no one could hear it went over and then said let's turn it down so many flaws in what she does say\nI just don't know what look I I it's very hard I don't want to get into that whole aspect of it I got to take a break we'll come back\nMore with Victoria Toensing Joe
