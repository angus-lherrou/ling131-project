four hour a new center with ws these how story this hour it's sold at certain now the judge Brett Kavanaugh has less than twenty four hours away from being confirmed as the new Supreme Court justice do free to point\nI'm Jamie do pre in Washington no matter how the GOP squeezed out the votes on judge Kavanaugh the bottom line is that this is a major victory for President Trump on the Supreme Court\nThe biggest irony about it obviously is that Senator Susan Collins the rhino that many more conservative Republicans want to run out of the party that she was the one who came through for the GOP uninsured victory\nA final Senate vote on Kavanaugh come Saturday afternoon\nAnd four million people off of food stamps and I can just keep on going and promises about the types of judges he put on the court and gutting endless bureaucratic\nRegulation that that literally hamstrings all businesses in America\nPromoting buying and hiring America actively promoting and asking people to come and

that's pretty good but with thirty two days out of the electorate a lot can happen between now and then John McLaughlin as pollster founder of McLaughlin associates Doug Jones is with us also a pollster author political analyst for Fox News\nOr thank you both for being with us or we can see I don't know if you want to call the cabin on balance or the\nCabinet awakening there's every single state now Claire McCaskill is down significantly in the latest poll in Missouri\nJoe Donnelly is in trouble in Indiana Heidi Heitkamp is down in eleven in her state of North Dakota or I say that Rick Scott will be the next senator from Florida and then of course Martha ... has been surging lately uh where do you think it stands at this moment John McLaughlin\n... I think you're seeing a a definitely a cabinet effect but it's really what it is it's a ... gauge whether the Trump voters a shorter you know your dog and I talked about two years ago how Trump had to bring new voters and to win the election and we did\nDonald Trump ignited millions of voters who came out and voted in twenty sixteen that didn't vote and twenty twelve that took a pass on Mitt Romney and\nUp until this time up until the hearing last Thursday a those voters will stay home or a good portion portion and weren't engaged and I think\nIt's got to see the the the actual hearing the news coverage and the character assassination the ruthless politics I think\nThe Democrats could look chores are really smart strategic senator and he's the leader and he looked at the map and he said just thirty five feet so twenty six or eight hours entering states that that Donald Trump won\nWhat can I Do to try to take back the majority\nAnd he probably made a calculation if we can embarrass cabin or that the Republicans pulled him it was suppressed the Trump voters so that's a good number of those sixty three million would stay home\nBecause you only get Ninety million come out in the mid term elections so they they made they hit the Republicans stuck from the president stuck with him and the Democrats were exposed these voters are now outraged\nThe Democrats would put such a late hit on and try to mirror good person who would remind them of their father their their their son their their their brother\nAnd said this was totally unfounded uncorroborated there's no evidence to it\nAnd they're trying to destroy this man in this family and the Republicans ... ... the Republicans and independents who supported Trump or coming back out and you're seeing them in these polls\nThat Missouri poet McCaskill behind was appalled that we did for a super back she's down ... points down or you're seeing this I'm seeing this impulse every day it's it's not a big explosion but what it is is\nTrump voters coming back in and\nGet along well ... ... that Trump voters worked I\nWas a huge enthusiasm gap just a month ago well less than a month ago two weeks ago two and a half weeks ago\nUm has now totally and completely evaporated and conservatives have been awakened and and by the way Doug shown the party that we saw protesting and the party that Russia's to judgment the party that doesn't believe in due process a party that doesn't believe in the presumption of innocence\nOr the need for some corroboration and the party that defended Clinton and defense Keith Ellison a I don't think they're looking too good here to the American people right now and they they're being shown to be the radical party I'd been describing for some time\nAll shot I mean I don't quite know how to fly but I'll give you a ...\nAnd you can just say I actually agree with your characterization in their handling of all of this has been pretty stupid and detrimental um to you know any sense that they have have any sense of moderation in this day and age\nWell I don't think they have any sense of moderation but what they do have\nIs that I'm going to leave the house which I just did it lead to pick up the house and I think from what I see looking at the Senate races\nThey're all very very close within the margin of her and I really think to get a definitive answer will have to come back and in a week or ten days after capital is as I think we all expect\nNarrowly confirmed to see whether the effect job and then you are talking about Iran is actually going to hold over time I think it really has to play out and I think there's a good chance that the protests you've seen from the Democrats are from women like him or not we'll continue and will ultimately\nA benefit particularly in suburban congressional districts less so Senate races the Democrats\nHow's it going to play with the voter in the rest of the country not in New York D.C San Francisco and Los Angeles or or Illinois or Chicago how's it going to play with my writing of America I think it's going to play very differently\nI think the the real challenges the one John raises I think it starts right will this re engage the Trump voter I think as of today probably some evidence that that\nIs going to have it in such twenty points enthusiasm gap just the ... and in sixteen days\n[noise] let's let's let's wait a week Sean and we'll see where we\nDon't think this leaves a bad taste in people's mouths what they did to this man for support\nAnd disgusting and I remember the who live poor experimenting Arlen and things like\nThat do you what they did to this man and how they bludgeoned this man and his family as as vicious as they've been with no due process and for once you know how critical am of Republicans they took it with the seriousness the topic deserved they handled properly\nThey looked into every crevice in corner and we still have no corroboration now do we believe in the presumption of innocence or not\nYou probably have the Democrats handled this\n... ... ... if if I can voiced support for you ...\nGive me a chance to do that I Would have a I said this is somebody who has my own a judicial legal and philosophical differences with the judge Kavanaugh so I Would not be voting for him but I Do think showing that you are correct\nThat the way this process has played out depresses me as an American first and the Democrat second\nUm I think the process is destroying\nA the independence of our judiciary destroying the presumption of innocence and basically what is destroying what makes our country great so we may disagree philosophically but I'd like to think we stand for the same enduring values\nIsn't Lindsey Graham who in many ways showed such a profile in courage in this\nUm and even and I think the deliberate seriousness of Susan Collins\nYou know Republican Party is made up of a varying factions that I don't see these factions really existing in the Democratic party John I mean you've got the extreme left and then you've got the super duper extreme left and\nThere's no room for a scoop Jackson they even through Joe Lieberman of all people out of the party how do you throw a Joe Lieberman out of your party [noise] um I mean that's insanity to me\nOh absolutely and and I tell you what does it does make the point you have over four weeks ago\nAnd that's a lifetime in politics I mean I mean remember twenty sixteen the Democrats puts a late hit on Bush or not Bush part of it they did it to Bush or the drunk driving but they did it with to Donald Trump with a tape of that women are people people weren't right door to realize there was a choice between Hillary Clinton\nAnd Donald Trump than they voted for Donald Trump and and this voters in the heartland right now that are engaged we have to keep them engaged over the next four weeks because when we when again and cabinet gets confirmed they can think oh things are fine now\nI don't get him so I I I think
