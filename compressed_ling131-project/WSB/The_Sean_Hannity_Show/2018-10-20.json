probably get a good\nWe'd probably be in a better position right now with that with this election but I Do get a lot of flak for that um [noise]\nAnd I don't know what's your what's your your take on that basically I mean what were you play something for me a while ago\nThat where um some activists ah we're saying we should have a collective votes or ... or ... or ... okay and I believe in the same clap\nShe was telling people that they should all about how she tells him to they should vote for the incarcerated and the undocumented yes right so when you start with the lesser of two evils or the collective votes or vote how your leaders to tell you to vote blindly\nThat's what you get you actually get a\nJust pure power jeep pure power\nIf she actually said that people need to step in line and do is they're told as a Democrat\nSo that I mean not just negates the whole concept of democracy and as an a narco capitals I'm not I'm not actually card\nCarrying member of the Libertarian Party a I they're just not really libertarian enough for me I'm In a narco capitalist\nI Believe this concept of self limiting government\nIs a utopian fantasy you know I don't think that you can limit but I have decided to dedicate my life to defending the bill of rights because those are real ... those are our rights whether they're written down on a piece of paper or not\nIt's helpful to have written down on a piece of paper and and if the system has democracy as a method to appoint the people who are supposed to oversee those rights and preserve those rights on our behalf\nThat would be great it seems to me that what it actually does is the opposite you elect people\nWho subvert your rights who take your place and don't have your interests at heart that is why I'm not a fan of the lesser of two evils thing because\nOver time uh it has gotten us worse and worse to the point where it's just evil versus evil and and the and the argument is the other guy's worse\nBut I Do I Do feel like\nWhen you start getting to the point I heard another Democrat say to me that it was outrageous that the Republican leadership didn't a better control the voters and the rank and file and I said well that you're obviously expressing a\nYou know that you don't really believe in democracy he said at this point yeah [laughter] I was like okay 'cause it's not going your way but it was all fun and games when when it was ushering in the welfare state\nSo what's your I I I\nI think ... got to vote just like it's a choice to vote people are often pressured saying it's her civic duty to vote and you you must get out and vote you must get out and vote you must go ... and that's fine but it's also a choice not to and it doesn't mean that you don't have a voice because you choose not to that's one of the\nYour biggest propaganda ... beginning of time is you must vote for the choices that we chose for you\nYeah and and think of it this way forty I think that I reach forty percent of people of eligible voters don't vote what Ninety percent of eligible voters didn't vote wouldn't wouldn't that be a vote [laughter] yeah sort of you know I mean that would say we do not accept\nThis false choice that you're giving us\nAnd it would happen overnight do you think it would it would take forever that this is the thing about the lesser of two evils voting is that it's the way they boil the frog it's the way you know that they get you to just incrementally lose everything and I and I think of an example of that is Ronald Reagan\nWho I was always a fan of cried when he was shot [noise] um I was little\nBut he uh\nMixed in a Republican closed the gold window in Nineteen Seventy two I Believe 'cause that's when Ron Paul decided to enter the arena happens scribes in 'em and had to Washington\nAnd within one decade less than a decade the economy was in a tailspin that interest rates the currency was all mess predictably and Reagan was elected in a landslide\nAnd instead of saying look obviously we can draw a straight line from the Nineteen Seventy two dot to the ... of total you know near collapse\nBecause he closed because next and close the gold when do we need to re establish real money but instead he and Paul Volcker Volcker I think took the lead on a fixed it he they they\nInstituted some harsh policies that are at that preserved the out money\nAnd I would I Would ask was that better is it better and then you have that you'd have a crisis and Tony trillion dollars of debt right now I mean economic stuff gets no wants to but on but it just has an analogy is it better to allow uh to to take the lesser\nYou know take a little to take a little when at\n... knowing that in the long run all is lost so I I think that's food for thought but I I Will not take any golf [laughter] for my opinion is I normally do because you know mostly but on the show have delivered so much important information about the true nature of these candidates\nThat uh that I I think\nThat the voters who do decide to vote even the lesser of two evils will have really learned a lot from what we've put out there\nAnd not and the stuff that you have today is no exception we really absolutely have to dig into it\nI I Am opens a call now and if people want to tweet questions for ten minutes is going to be on later we're um we can accumulate those you can tweet us at Monica perhaps shower at freedom act radio and I\nAnd also get to some calls for oh four eight seven to zero seven fifty one eight hundred tell us we talk and frankly let's cue up some that fantastic a

Believe he wiped them clean so you could not see if there what whether there was election integrity or not\nThat's bad and ah and we talked about some of the so I Wonder\nSometimes if if he might have been in trouble for that and maybe\nHe's lose on purpose candidate I really don't know I mean I I I have no idea I'm not making that accusation but I always think\nWhen someone comes off as a little crazy like Jeb Bush made some crazy ads these boots are made for a walk and you remember that one against a Marco Rubio just weird stuff that made it looked like he was trying to lose on purpose [noise]\nI always wonder about that\nI've been wrong about that in the past so I'm not a falling on my third for that only fall and my sort of a bill of rights\nBut this ah so I so he does some goofy things she's calling them out on it she's saying look he's he's the not job I'm the stable one I I'm the one you can count on this guy is clearly\nA radical she takes the high road is what it sounded

mother preaching and what are her credentials mother her mom has a\nTo graduate degrees one library science and wanted seminary from Emory and I can't remember what her undergrad Emory\nThat's good stuff\nSo let's hear what she has to say about her daughter right\nYes very revealing ...\nNot going to stay fit and stay with the with the school here in ... we now going to seminary\nAnd she is she was she just\nDown from being the house of representatives democratic minority leader in Georgia and now she's a candidate for governor of Georgia [noise]\nAnd and\nAnd you you you might have seen are good on TV and and she gets in trouble to like find your does\nShe she's trying to get them to to take down statues of Stone Mountain known those races things and and the flag but then when she found one college she went on the steps of the capital and burn the Georgian flag I don't know if they know about that or not\nThey do that they do they do now thank you basically and you didn't like stumble upon that and the AJC or something right we all started and some obscure website how this is what I find interesting though I Know that you're the only one who has it\nI Can't reveal my secrets oh oh okay sorry but it wasn't like you heard somebody talk no you know I was searching I was looking at your stuff because out of out of feeling that hurt your ... her ... were probably a little more radical than all potentially relevant audio you are scary [laughter] so\nSo so here's the thing so it sounds like she is an extreme radical burning the flag the Georgia played for the candidate for governor George is burning the Georgia flag on the steps of the Capitol when she was in college yeah nobody's talked about that which is really curious\nBut this is the one who led the only peaceful protests during while the whole world was riding around her in the actual\nNeighborhood yeah she was leading these under the peaceful thing for Rodney King yeah\nShe was leading what she says was a peaceful thing although you read all the articles to protest coming from the schools\nEnded up breaking out into violence that doesn't mean that she did it but she for her to lead a peaceful protest through all the chaos she would have been able to do something that neither the the governor the mayor or the police captain was able to do\nAnd they were black so they might have been able to write wouldn't they 'cause this was a racial issue yes so it's not like she came and save the day as this powerful black woman it's\nThat even a other community leaders everybody we're powerless to stop violence\nFor what she did is she led one of these she ended up being basically the face of representing the students just like her those two other kids\n[noise] yeah I Want to get to wear this led though because I I it sounds like she's just radical but I think\nWhen she went to she was like that for for ... it's such an elite program I never even heard of it this Telluride thing until I was investigating her and I talked about our previous show\nSo she went to this Telluride program in high school and I think they really taught her how to plant her career which she talks about since she was Nineteen she is she is plotted the path that she is still walking on twenty five years later\nAnd I think this was also kind of calculated and led to personal gain for her\nThe deal you ride program has a four point seven percent acceptance rate\nAnd that's of the people who apply to it yeah I never even heard of it you know what I\nYeah and it is no to give a
