I mean it's mainly genetics hair loss really is a ... inherited genetic sensitivity to normally occurring hormone in our bodies called die hydro testosterone it's an analog of testosterone and it's made from testosterone\nA genetic sensitive to this causes the follicles on the scalp to over years produce fewer and smaller hairs\nAnd the result is that we can see around those tiny hairs and we're looking right at your scalp and that's you know that baldness ... of setting in and so you\nKnow it's important to you when you're considering hair loss both address the hair loss itself you know the surgery and if you if we replaced the airliner or fill in some some a weak spot you know that's not going to affect the rate of the hair loss itself so\nNow do follicles close up or do they I I guess I'm thinking maybe of where the hair grows from those\nFollicle raven hair the hair is produced by a follicle just like er nails are produced by the nail bed\nHairs produced by a a a skin upended we call it called a follicle the hairs you know about ten or twenty percent of the follicles just have one here the majority fifty to Seventy percent of the fall it will have to hairs\nAnd then you've got some three and four hair follicles what happens is you know there's ... overtime win affected by the forces of of hair loss\nThe caliber of the hairs\nYou know get smaller and the hairs are physically getting thinner and every guy with ... knows this you look in the mirror and you can see the little wispy things on the what used to be your front of Ireland that's really what's the process literally called miniature ...\nAnd after a long time the haircut the follicle can you know typically stop producing hairs but really what happens a lot of the you know the follicles end up producing hair that's like on a woman's forehead\nAnd I'm just here there but it's not you can't even see it\nRight now we do want to take your calls your questions and we're going to be covering a lot about what we can do about that so if you can relate if you have questions call Dr Anderson for all for eight seven to zero seven fifty as the number so\nDr Anderson let's kind of go toward that okay we've established you're you're suffering from hair loss you're kind of at your wits and\nNot knowing what to do about it so a patient comes in for a consultation with you and what is the process look like how much time does this gentleman need to set aside to go ahead and begin the process of you and then the treatments and the procedures and then he's all that\nWell in my practice it's a it's a pleasant experience you know we recognize the hair loss you know it's it's stressful it can be embarrassing patients could be self conscious about it\nAnd so they're looking for help or looking for solutions and uh so we sit down um I have a track called just her name was ... and uh she will\nSee the patient first and you know the requirements for about an hour long ...

upstate New York\nOfficials now say for unknown reasons that limo failed to stop at an intersection and hit a parked car killing all Eighteen people in the limousine and to pedestrians Saturday afternoon NTSB chairman Robert Sumwalt says it's the deadliest transportation accidents since two thousand nine when they fatalities\nIs just horrific I've been on the board for for twelve years and this is one of the biggest losses wife wants to ... we've seen a in a long long time federal\nThe big because they're not on the same page the stress level is massive and it's causing fights constantly and so whatever range of that spectrum people are most of us can identify with a ... this thing is like I thought it would be I thought maybe once I got that job or once we had a little more money it would go away and it didn't\nSo how did you get into the financial services business tell us about the passion that you have for helping other people\nYeah well I get when people walk in and talk about this stuff it resonates with me so a number of years ago uh\nMy first job out of college I was a youth pastor and I was working and I thought it was something I I was a deeply cared about 'em but my wife and I had two small kids and and then she became sick and no one can figure out what was going on so we went to a specialist after specialist\nTrying to figure out why she was sick\nAnd kept getting no answer and so the medical bills began to mount and as a youth pastor you can imagine I wasn't making a crazy amount of money at that point and so the medical bills were getting bigger and bigger it got so bad and she was so sick we had to move in\nTo my inlaws basement and it was not quite finished if you turn on the toaster oven all the electricity would go down in a basement it was one of those situations\nUm and I will never forget sitting\nOr on the couch we had down there with just thousands of dollars in medical debt my wife was starting to get better but we're on the phone with a debt counselor\nI've never been so stressed a really in my life\nAnd the counts are talked through our situations that honestly you just need to declare bankruptcy I that's all you can do and it was just like hitting bottom for me it was just forgot where are we going to go and we didn't end up needing to do that\nBut it took a lot of time and attention now to dig out of that and honestly that's what prompted me that's why I Love what I Do that's why I started this business was because I Want to sit with people again whether they have\nThere were I was where they just really didn't have resources or maybe they have a lot of resources but it's just a constant issue of argument in contention are fighting with each other um how do you get through this how do you\nFind a goal that you can agree on a make actual progress towards the dreams that you have because that's what we did\nAnd I can tell you the difference it makes the ... I Know what it feels like to sit with thousands of dollars in debt but I also know what it feels like the pay that off\nAnd wouldn't incredible thing that can be to actually make it through that kind of a situation and so uh that's why I got into the business was it was really a feeling of\nCan I help folks do what we had to go through how how do you get to that point\nSo multiple hats and you're not physically wearing a hat today but I can already kind of see it and talking with your financial planner an educator and the marriage counselor you got to get in between and sometimes one side's right one sides wrong you got to bring someone on that the other side you know kind of meat in the middle of\nThe funniest thing about that is that often it's just not having common information so when people walk in it's usually you're and maybe you felt this before people listening felt this when\nOr if you think if I said what's the issue why do you have a problem with money the immediate answer is just pointing at the other person oh they are the issue right and so then you start to gather information and say hey\nLet's talk about what we're actually let's look at this together and they realize it's really neither of our fault system we've created how do we change it together and it's incredible to see the change that can happen when you get on the same page\nYeah people working together I mean that certainly but my problem too and and being in in a marriage and in a relationship of course money is is a stressor for most of us Ninety five percent of us I Would say that making a plan and yeah you've got the plane and you put your heads together\nBut sticking with it you know you stay on us to each other for a couple of weeks sure and then it all goes out the window or you have the air conditioner break or something and at a set back like that yeah it's hard to get back on track\nThat's why we talk about what we did was coaching it's more coaching than it is just sitting and telling people you should go do this I'm so much of it as a relationship that when people come and sit down and it's just like when you go to therapy of them plenty of marriage therapy I Wonder if there are many reasons\nUm and the reason I Love it is there's a third party objectively holding your hand and walking through it and keeping you want to focus right and so when people come often they ended up coming over time and every time I checked back in its this reminder of\nAre we still on track towards the school for the future and then we bring tools around one of my favorite things as we have a website that everyone who works with his has access to where they can see every part of their financial world and suddenly there's no arguing over you know the gray areas because there are no grey areas\nIf it's how much money to spend we can all look at the same information together and often that's what the argument is it's well you always do this and you always do that well now we can look at it together so you bring the tools around it and then you bring the coaching into it and then you really can make progress\nSo you can see what Chris was talking about on the Web site in my life is more dot com talking with Chris Burns more than money and the host of a show by the same name or the money here on WSBIU Sunday mornings at five give us a call and ask a Chris any questions really that you want or jumping yeah\nFor all for eight seven to zero seven fifty maybe or trying to build or even rebuild it for all and K maybe something happened where you had to borrow against that\nInvestment questions savings consolidating that might be an interesting one you know you've got so many credit card bills and just maybe if it's a good idea to consolidate or budgeting yeah talk to me at at my age in my mid thirties\nI think it's never too soon to know how to create a budget that that would alleviate a lot of these he said she said kind of arguments\nWell one of the misconceptions people have is that they all first of all I really feels like we should be saving more but no one knows what that means because it's like how much is more how much is enough right\nAnd then often what we do is in our parents told us to do this or if you had a if you went out to finance Clint class in college it probably talked about this it's right when you get into a job you've got to put as much money as you can and your four one K. right that's where the dollars have to go but the problem is when you put money in a four one K. you're walking it up for decades and you cannot access it without major penalties\nWhich in in some cases is a good thing because it kind of hold you accountable\nLike race going to be there when you need it and once you build a foundation yeah\nAnd so the problem is people just don't start with a foundation they don't have liquid savings sitting and so because all the extra money is going to the four one K. whenever life happens and it will read all of us can immediately think of something this year already has not gone according to plan\nAnd you have to spend five hundred thousand dollars on something if you don't have that liquid savings in an emergency fund then what are you going to do and it's why the credit card\nFive AM\nMe to\nGood afternoon it's four thirty I'm Sheryl ... live in the ws twenty four hour news centered
