sent for Merrill executives to jail for a year and that got turned over by the Fifth Circuit court of appeals that sound complicated it really isn't it is the single biggest abuse of power corruption scandal in the history of the country and I haven't even mentioned\nThe abuse of the powerful tools of intelligence\nThat we give these people supposedly to protect us joining us now a civil liberties attorney criminal defense attorney David shown and Carter Page was banned at the center of all of this for the last year and a quarter I Know that you're moving forward with investigations lawsuits and I don't blame you one bit I mean\nFrom everything you've told me is that our FBI our CIA our intelligence community knew well because as your work took you to foreign lands when you come back from places like Russia\nOr you would willingly ... feet deep briefed ... and and tell them everything you know to help your country out so uh I guess if you are really the bad guy that needed to be surveilled than they needed to Hillary Clinton's unverified phony Russian ... to do it\nAs the presentation to commit fraud on the rise of course I Would think you'd be indicted right now if you were as bad as they say\nShot it just it it just it getting crazier and crazier every day I uh I think it just uh just this week we have the Saudis that are um owning up to various things that may have happened there and you know starting investigation\nAbout things that happened a couple of days or or he was within the last few weeks\nI mean this is something that is you know people have been covering up here in the United states for over two years so I think as a a you know a symbol of democracy a symbol of\nGood government and hopefully uh hopefully the uh the car just starting to fall here and people will start phoning up to all the uh all the wrong doing that was done and that I think we're getting into that if you've been a\nA all over in terms of your reporting so\nBring David and David as an attorney in a in a really good attorney you know Congress has a constitutional roles called oversight their job they or their check we have a system of separation of powers and checks

where they cite national security is a reason for not turning something over only to be turn out to be having nothing to do with national security only in ...\nThere is meant to them now we see in in

to appear in testify under oath James Baker is testifying today and James Baker and Lisa Page and Andrew McCabe in one other person all saying Rod Rosenstein wanted to wear a wire\nTo go after the president of the United states\nOr if you are representing our friend Carter Page here I mean I Would think you'd have a multitude of lawsuits in the Carter page ought to be a pretty rich man by the end of all of us\nYeah quarter page has a strong basis for sticking not only information but also damages and relief and he is now by the way of course\nConducting some litigation going after that doesn't Carter Page is very important to St example of how very wrong\nThings have gone with the ... the court and otherwise and governments you hit the probably the most important point going on here on\nRussia's role in providing oversight um you know God willing congressman Munoz is going to return after this election his work and ... as the vital Congress to no longer bluff though anymore they've got to compel the testimony of these folks I think there's a real argument for a Fifth Amendment waiver\nFrom the public statements that these folks make the American public demand since ...\nAnd they deserve nothing less and transparency and by the way these aren't simple mistake that have gone on you know we've talked about this Ninety nine page report on Pfizer court ducked abuses that uh and it said director Rogers was talking about um these aren't just mistakes these are conscious effort and engender\nBy law enforcement officers to invade the law\nThere is by the way what other uh avenue that no one really has explored yet and that's a fight the quarter of review there is a court that just above the five to ... it will also under their rule for considered procedural

should the outrage collie or the judge and the court and these judges other quarter review it violates their own rules rules Thirteen and\nIt violates the Constitution's and as you pointed out anytime

that's not just taxes that's the whole country you know we could have put it on short wave radio and TV\nHe could've done a Facebook wife short Twitter live show and done better than a million\nAnyway so you know then you know Texas by the way we have some examples there of people asking non citizens to register to vote that's now becoming a big problem down in Texas oh by the way even MSNBC held paid or rock as a rock star he could be the twenty twenty nominate\nA yeah try and get through Ted Cruz ... good luck with that but we're following all these races let me tell you where I think we are right now I think the Republicans I think between the caravan that we now have coming towards us\nFour thousand people strong that want to get to the southern border where the United states from Central America\nI Know that the secretary of homeland security secretary Nielsen\nI I had an opportunity to call her office earlier today because I actually do real reporting on this show and get an update apparently as of now there's full cooperation with the Mexican government that that's not gonna happen\nBut four thousand people still four thousand people and what did Democrats what did they resist that they don't want a solution\nFor the border problem we have with the opioids crossover human trafficking is occurring you know we they now are using these drug cartels you can't say they're stupid they're evil but they're not stupid\nThey've been using and this is I Can't even believe this is true you know these drones that they fly with cameras above him so they'll fly from Mexico into the United states along our southern border they fly drones with cameras on them and what they do is they map out where the border patrol\nWhere agents aren't so then they give like the perfect entry way where it's most likely to succeed\nIn bringing in their heroin and their fat and all and drugs that are really being targeted towards your kids your town your cities at so evil these drug cartels are and how desperate they are\nTo be successful now the president well he offered now we spent three and a half billion dollars so far that's the only amount of money that has been allocated towards the wall these pens every penny\nBut we need twenty five billion dollars total to get the whole job done that in part is what this election is about it's also about a party that has given up any sense of honor\nAnd any sense of constitutional or authority let the rule of law that is based on our constitution that would mean due process that would mean equal or access on there are laws equal application of our laws\nAnd we know that they gave that up any sense of due process with judge Kavanaugh they wouldn't even give him the honor of the presumption of innocence even after an FBI investigation the eighth one that he's had in his late well now they want to Ninety One\nBut the way I see it Eighteen days out is that we've got the Senate is looking better Rick Scott has a slight

and uh I'll be interviewing Ted Cruz and we'll be hearing a lot of this on a Monday obviously CNN as they made their decision as they're supporting which is pretty fascinating anyway we'll just Eighteen days away from these all important midterm elections\nAnd what do we say we see that Brett is it has now been exposed this week in Tennessee is somebody that is purposely lying to the people in Tennessee the same with Claire McCaskill we say that Christian cinema is falling apart\nI mean literally ... you know she she says oh it's fine to be a fine to join you know radicals um and the Taliban actually said it wasn't by the way this is the meth capital of the world Arizona or by the way you're crazy and she has the anti war rallies while her opponent Republican Martha McSally\nIs fighting for a country that's not playing well very very well right now in the state of Arizona and you see that Heidi Heitkamp totally out of touch with the people in North Dakota so it seems a lot of pickups are in the making there for the Senate for the Republicans\nTight race though in Florida both for governor in for Rick Scott who always does an amazing job for the people of Florida are anyway joining us to analyze where we are Eighteen days out is our good friends welcome back to the program John McLaughlin Doug shown pollsters both of them\nJohn Eighteen days out what do you see happening\nAll over the house is still in play and the Republicans are a without a doubt are fighting back to have gotten more aggressive but still it needs to do a lot more and and what's really amazing to me is the focus of\nYou know you're exposing the Democrats in what their agenda is all the time but the focus of the Republicans really needs to be to expose Nancy Pelosi and what she has to do I think you played a clip earlier about humor in the Senate\nAnd he wasn't very specific about whether they're going up in the polls because the Republicans post Kevin uh have have really done a lot better in a in a in the Senate polls that have come up I mean when you're talking about uh Arizona modalities now hit by a little in Tennessee Republicans leading out decisively a so that so the\n... the Democrat opportunities to pick on the Senate looked like they are going off the table and on the other hand it looks like the Republicans were ahead in Missouri they're\nThey're they're run close races and in Montana Indiana\nNow West Virginia I mean even in New Jersey uh it's it's turning into a competitor\nWas really looking like New Jersey might be a dog fight for Bob Menendez and the people in New Jersey of had it with him and you know now that his association with this Chilean Epstein guy uh that has now become an absolute verbal war between\n... and his Republican opponent of opponent and now showing up at the polls\nAre dug show where do you stand Eighteen days out\nWell I think where America's fans and John and you are right\nOn fortunately I might add is that the Senate has moved pretty decisively\nRepublican I don't think that New Jersey will go all the way because it is a operationally democratic state but\nThe other states you cite showing I think are moving in with I think are the wrong direction I still have a chance to pull out in Nevada and Arizona but both of those have deteriorated above it from my perspective is the last\nWeek and I think Arizona in particular but Dean Heller was in a very tight race for reelection the Republican he was ... it was a to point raised a week ago Donald Trump goes in and now he's up by seven and I saw the crowds when I was out there was massive but the crowd outside was even bigger than the one inside\nWell look yeah yeah I was gonna say I I've seen the same numbers Johnny please go ahead\nAnd absolutely I mean the president is motivating his base and and the Republicans need to embrace up because a nationally when he won he had sixty three million voters and when the the uh uh\nUh when the midterms occur we only get Ninety million people usually out might be a little more this time but it won't be as big as the hundred and thirty nine million who showed up in a twenty sixteen\nSo if you can get to sixty three million Trump voters motivated that they're coming out again which the Kavanaugh hearings did and it appears to have backfired\nParticular Senator Schumer and the and the Democrats in the Senate or if you can motivate those Republicans to come out\nThose Trump voters those independents and Democrats are supported them they have a very good shot at getting Senate seats and it's probably the only shot they have a winning the house that van and going after Nancy Pelosi the idea of stopping Nancy Pelosi the most popular\nFor let me tell you what I'm saying I Am radio and TV if you vote I don't care what congressional district here and there were four hundred and thirty five congressional districts in this country in any of those districts if you vote for any Democrat you're voting for ... if you stay home it's I have\nA vote for below sea and the same in the Senate if you're going to vote for tester and McCaskill and send them on against Dean Heller and Donnelly and you're going to vote for you know bread on the news just a phony fraud to the people of\nGetting caught on tape the being it uh and and not put more Marsha Blackburn in you know you'll get the government you deserve but you're really electing and voting for Schumer because they're going to they're going to tow the line with pillows the in the house and told a line which humor in the Senate that's\nYou know and what do we know that they want they want to impeach the president they want endless investigations\nThey want to raise taxes they're actually saying that they're hiding the impeachment begging Maxine Waters not to say it any more John Podesta Center for American Progress and said all Democrats should not talk about immigration for for this they want to open borders sanctuary cities\nSanctuary states that elimination of ice and they want to keep Obamacare that's not that that didn't work for eight years dug and why\nWhy do we we sold him to a bit of a leading Indiana is say keep ice you say go the wall and he's saying no impeachment which\nWhen he was the only reason he surviving and not down by five or six now is because you've got a libertarian in that
