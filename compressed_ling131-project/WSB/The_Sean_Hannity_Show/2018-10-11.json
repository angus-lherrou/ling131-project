to zero seven fifty is the number and give us a call tell us a if you're in the Atlanta area what ... what precautions are you taking what precautions\nOr do you think are necessary and some of the things I think are necessary is still your coolers with ice fill your bath tub with water alright make sure all your all your electronics are charged\nA lot of people don't realize that when you charge a computer it's like having another battery cars you can always put your phone into your computer writings get bad and you have to have your phone right are you also have your car\nYou can plug things and if things get really desperate you can go sit in the back seat in the car but those are the things you need to get safe don't you may have heard you know duct tape your windows to keep the the glass from flying not so much a good idea then\nIn theory that's a good idea but that's not so much a good idea all you have is connected flying shards of glass at that point the best thing to keep your windows from from shattering and flying is a plywood [laughter]\nWhich is probably a little late by now unless you live in the neighborhood of the all night plywood store [noise]\nBut uh for

far enough but you get a lot of rain and then you get a then there'll be a break\nYour right arm bands of going through in life it's moving pretty quick in the wind is going to pick up as we go through tonight\nYeah well I Would like to encourage people on my way and I did notice that that people are still flying down the interstate flying down surface roads you\nKnow it's dark out that you

they jump out of a at least three people over the last total that we had authorities just confirming that at least five people are now dead in the storm here's the latest that we have on the developments as of this\nOf Wisconsin and I hope the people who Wisconsin finally remember that but we now have Walker one poll finally up by one but it's very very close are we have a Georgia governor race that's also closer than I Would like for comfort\nOr with the Republican camp up by two and so we're following that raised pretty closely um in some of the other races that were watching the president's approval rating now is doing very very well what fifty one percent and Rasmussen\nAnd so we'll watch that but I think if you look at Heidi Heitkamp I think she's going to be and should be defeated in North Dakota\nI Hope the people of Montana will pay attention and understand that you basically have Chuck Schumer junior because John tester always goes with Chuck Schumer\nAnd the people in Montana I can take back that state which is a red state then you've got other states like Indiana I think Joe Donnelly can be defeated in Indiana\nI think definitely Claire McCaskill she ought to be sent packing and I think Marsha Blackburn is going to be a phenomenal senator from the great state of Tennessee should have been a longtime friend of this program in recent polls now have her up as well and then we get to the all important house races I'm not going to spend the time here it's more of a visual thing that we're doing on television\nAnd we're picking ten important house races at night and we're identifying those specific districts that are gonna make\nA difference on election night in twenty six days and that will literally they these these districts were putting up hold the balance of power in the house of representatives\nI mean because of gerrymandering ... big portion and percentage of seats I end up being safe for both Republicans and Democrats\nSo we'll find out for voters by the way Trump more help now to these candidates and the president's got what he's up for days this week and he's going to be campaigning for everybody and these tight races in an attempt to help them all out now am\nI honestly think that the Republicans would adapt just a little bit they don't have to take the style of Donald Trump but if they go out and and passionately support making the tax cuts permanent if they passionately talk about ending the bureaucracy\nWay the president has been doing it if they will sign on to a building and fully funding the border wall if they will do the alternative health care solutions that we talk about all the time on this program like health savings accounts on health care cooperatives et cetera were just going to have a better country\nAnd and the more prosperous country you cannot deny the success\nOf this president and the fuel the pure force of personality I mean Donald Trump is a force of nature and I know that he breaks dishes I Know isn't iconoclast I Know he's a disruptor\nBut if he's not fighting then we're not winning and when he goes up even against their own allies and says you're not paying their fair share of NATO and we're paying the bulk of money for NATO and then you're stupid enough Chancellor Merkel to go make deals to help make Russia and Vladimir ... rich again well you're basically\nIt's at your counteracting everything that made I was trying to do which is prevent a hostile regime\nFrom ever having the power to turn off the ticket and turn off the light blood of western Europe's economy\nIs a simple basic things nobody ever thought that the president would get along with little rocket man fire and fury apparently Mike Pompeo the secretary of state at a phenomenal meeting I talked to two sources\nA phenomenal meeting with little rocket man and now little rocket man is dead he's serious about getting rid of any nuclear ambitions denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula the guy that everybody in the media said was going to start World War three that guy is bringing peace to the Korean Peninsula\nYou look at Seoul South Korea you know you look over the DMZ and what do you see thirty million people live there\nA nuclear armed North Korea is not something that the world needs if you care about human life\nAnd as a result I Would assume that you know markets would open up to North Korea the people of North Korea been suffering you might even see a reunification one day of north and South Korea Korea how great would that be for the world and he got a president that's not dropping cargo planes full of cash and other currencies\nAnd on the on the tarmac for mullahs in Iran that hate us in chant death to America death to Israel that's not happening either\nYou know I Want to get in Michelle Obama was on the today show earlier today and an interview with savannah Guthrie asking about recent comments from Eric Holder about kicking Republicans let's go to holders comments and Hillary Clinton's comments you can't be civil with anybody that disagrees with us listen\nTo all over [laughter] my wife went really high school you're hearing me [laughter] it was always you know when they go low we go [laughter] [laughter]\n[noise]\nWe'll just give us ...\nCannot be several with a political party that wants to destroy\nWhat you stand for what you care about that is why I Believe if we are fortunate enough to win back\nHouse and or the ... he can start down but until then the only thing that the Republican theme to recognize and respect strength and you heard how the Republican numbers led by Mitch McConnell\nThe president really demeaned the confirmation process\nYeah we we can't be symbol of we disagree with them no give us power and then we'll be civil or you've got to be kidding when you when they go low you just can't come\nOn Michelle Obama said fears is not a proper motivator hope wins out and if you'd think about how you want your kids to be raised how you want them to think about life and their opportunities do you want them to be afraid of their neighbors and you want the main greedy one dimensional\nWondering Michelle Obama say anything when Sarah Sanders was run out of a restaurant or Pam Bondi was run out of a restaurant or secretary Nielsen was run out of a restaurant by these angry liberal left is moms and they are moms\nAnd this this is Rand Paul pointed out somebody's gonna get hurt\nSomebody might get killed and all of this if they allowed us to continue but the rhetoric is coming from the quote so coal leadership and by the way Brock Obama himself was not exactly a faint when it came to the issue of being a well civil\nTo go on to your friends your neighbors to the doctor whether they're independent or whether they're Republican or you're with them in the face of the foot miss a purchase on Fox News also\nAlthough Mr bird is up against a Sean Hannity

with judge Kavanaugh would know due process no presumption of innocence the most outrageous allegations that were thrown against this man and people know I Believe that I Believe people when there's no corroborating evidence\nThat's a party that doesn't believe in fundamental basic fairness constitutional due process and the presumption of innocence that isn't pain\nAnd we saw what happened to him but we did every two and four years don't we and we're seeing it now and it's happening and you got people like let's see Maxine Waters Cory Booker Eric Holder yeah getting their face kick them when they're down you know follow them in the gas stations and grocery stores\nYou cannot be criminal with a political party that wants to destroy\nWhat you stand for what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough to win back the house hand or the [laughter] that ... he can start to get\nYour body cabinet\nWilling\n[noise]\n\nPlease don't just come here today and then go home

week\nAnd the Stanford Daily reports that rice camera and who is the president of the Stanford college Republicans claims that a classmate Melinda Hernandez coach shoved him in the chest with their

he wanted to wear a wire on the president of the United states in a scheme and a plot that he had to pay something\nAnyone may went into details apparently well they're not going to check my phone

and then the same information that we now have learned the media leaks strategy that existed\nJust before at least ... said nobody at any evidence of any Trump Russia collusion at all and Peter structure that there's no there there at all\nNow we know what the insurance policy was they had immediately strategy to to create the impression that there was a lot that they had when in fact it was them leaking to different news sources to create the impression that this was real\nAnd then of course you know uniting what they're good friend Robert Mueller and that's why it's been a witch hunt\nFor whatever Eighteen months the biggest abuse of power ever that pony dusty I used to manipulate not only pies with court judges and commit abroad on them\nBut that information was disseminated before the election so that the American people would buy the lives in the propaganda and and vote for Hillary oh jeez the hookers in a bad urinating in Moscow we can all like this guy\nAnd then it got used again and again and again they weaponized what turned out to be nothing but at the bumped set of documents that its own author won't stand by\nAnyway why won't Rod Rosenstein know pure under oath before the committees with Trey Gowdy and Bob Goodlatte where's the subpoena demanding that he turned over the the three oh tools to fight the wars all these things that have been requested\nJim Jordan who's joining us Freedom Caucus member candidate to be speaker of the house of representatives if the Republicans winning twenty six days\nCongressman Dave Brat of Virginia and by the white congressman Dave Brat it happens to be in one of those districts that it was a very very tough but winnable district if you're in what district you in ... in the commonwealth her\nSeventh seventh district Sean ...\nIf you're in the seventh district in the commonwealth of Virginia let me tell you something we need Dave Brat as part of the Freedom Caucus ... that's the only group that's been out there fighting to keep the promises that the Republicans made you know for the last seven years\nAnd he's been fighting hard every day and he's taken a lot of heat for it and now they're thrown tons of money to get him to feed it\nIf you're in the seventh district in Virginia I Hope you go out and vote for Dave Brat maybe help out his campaign if you cut and we welcome both of you to the program a gym let me start with you is it is it three or four people now that say that Rod Rosenstein or\nHow many have you been out there there there are several here's the bottom line when the when the chairman of the committee of jurisdiction\nAsk you to come in and testify in this case the chairman the Judiciary Committee you are obligated to do that remember rock Rosenstein is Senate confirmed when he goes through the confirmation process if he gets asked that question will you come and testify under oath an answer Congress has question when called is this or that is yes he is obligated to do it and for him not to come\nIs ridiculous particularly in light of what we now know where we have a ... a account\nOf someone saying that he was serious about actually recording the commander in chief of this great country so yeah he's in front of us and if he's not going to come in like he's supposed to like you said he was going through then there definitely should be a subpoena will bring him in for a deposition\nWell there's a lot that Rod Rosenstein needs to explain and it should be under oath that's the normal procedures to underwrite\nIt sure is it serves the supposed to come in at Berkeley under oath or you're you're maybe he's the guy who won the Justice Department and understand the timeline\nMay ninth Kobe is fine with based on the Rosenstein Nemo or make six eight to ... when he had this conversation with these the page and ... he said he was thinking about\nRecording the president contemporaneous with that ... held the FBI chief counsel Jim Baker that Rod Rosenstein was serious about that this solemn may sixteen and of course may seventeenth is when Bob Mueller's named special counsel ... what else happened on ... ... more than ... director\nThe same day just kind of interesting and then of course he doesn't get the job in the next day he named special counsel so this all happens and then as you pointed out in your intro a defies ever knew that there are no we'll get signed one month later so that sort of the timeline and what we want it's all you want to bring in and ask your questions about all those it then\nThroughout that two month period\nAll right Dave Brat let's bring you into this but first of all how is your race going I you know I Know that you've been targeted now by by Nancy Pelosi and company and the thrown a ton of money in your district to get your defeated how's it going\n[noise] yeah it's kind of like going where it went on the policy yet the healthcare immigration practices that my opponent is of color your local and so we're putting the word out but it's like you said they're pouring billions in because\nThey know they're going after you and never come back talk big time and you're right\nRight no it's it's a it's a battle and that there there is is that my opponent the resist\nA she really doesn't have a platform it All right now and so she's just running out to resistance and out and do vote and that that's why I think I think the people especially after the Supreme Court dabba ... and then she'll every yesterday and all the folks chime in and on the left\nI think the ah the voters in Virginia or darker to write that\nLook I think we've been putting a pen specific races a night um congressman Jordan\nYou know I mean the California Arizona a meal loving Utah Colorado as the number of seats there there\nWas it and if people want the full list of the the we've identified the top Seventy seats we put it up on the Hannity dot com at all so that people can check and make sure that that if their congressmen or a woman who is in a tough race that they get out to the polls what do you think's going to happen in twenty six days ...\nI think we're going to win I think we got great candidates like Dave Brat who were fighting for the for the American people are lucky enough to fight for so I think we're going to win and I think the way you phrase it ups on his way you've been doing it\nHow radical the left is I like to say it this way they're they're good luck today is that they apply Capra Nick when he respects the flag they embrace Governor Cuomo when you've got the Mac was never decorate mature on Maxine Waters when she says go out and harassed anyone who supports the president and we saw that double down on that whole mindset doubled down yesterday with what Clinton in older set about Republican\nWhat are you ... they're going after terrorists Sanders and Pam Bondi and secretary near the\nYeah I it just it just how radical the leftist today's modern Democrat Party today's party of the ... has taken most extreme positions in history raise your taxes abolish ice never secure the border continue to socialize medicine and impeach the president and you contrast that with
