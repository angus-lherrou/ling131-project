to corroborate the stories of this\nThat's what they did they got what they wanted and it's never ever going to be enough All right back to our phones as we say hyper Brandon is in Colorado Brandon Hi how are you glad you called and welcome to the Sean Hannity show\nHey thanks Sean I grew up in spent most of my life in Arizona where my family's still and I'm actually a distant relative of Jeff Flake and I do think is a decent man and I think he has a\nA good heart but I really feel like he's getting played here by the Democrats and the left and I just really really hope that uh that you'll make the right decision tomorrow or Saturday ...\nSounds like after his comments today that that's more likely but uh it's just you know I Know there's a reason he's not running for reelection and it's just hard to see a few good people leave to Washington and come back a few years later and not be able to really recognize that I feel like that happened with McCain I feel like it's kind of happening with just as well\nI think the most shocking statement that he made was on sixty minutes when he when he actually admitted when asked if he would be voting this way if he had to face the voters he had sold ... not\nUm [noise] and I'm like\nOh so you're you're only stand on your principles when when you have to face the voters but that's not how you really feel it really sums up how I view a lot of politicians you know I I just look at a guy that can't doesn't know was old mind at times and doesn't right\nNow is a\nGuy that wanted to be on the survivor show and you know ... you know look at him and uh you'll find that funny Sean but we were actually related I think it's our three or four generations back a great great something grandfather he was actually the founder of snowflake Arizona which I thought you would really love\nTo know somebody told me that yes what am I correct but really\nThere is a snowflake Arizona senator ... like\nI'm not that hard because the right thing if any Republican senator now especially Murkowski Collins flake after they they got what they wanted they got their delay they got the FBI weighing in\nA Joe Biden said it would not going to offer recommendations\nAnd they're not going to offer opinions here and all they're going to do is give you a straight data and that's what was given and everybody seems pleased by that his comments Susan Collins comments seemed to satisfy them no corroboration of any of these claims as we've been claiming\nAnd as we've been telling you and so the allegations have been problematic from the start ... you know assuming assuming for a second here judge Kevin over to get confirmed we we have got to have a deep analysis\nIn this country over where we want to go forward in terms of going forward because if we\nAllow this to happen to good people it it's it is so ... it's so dark I'm having a conversation with a friend of mine who's religious and we were discussing you know look at the ten commandments why is one of the ten commandments\n... shall not their falls witness against a neighbor because it's devastating for the rest of Brett Kavanaugh's life\nPeople know that this is what he's been accused of and yet in spite of the fact there's been no corroboration shifting stories and\nMedia hysteria that that's why\nTo the extent that people can literally destroy other people with a new window falls uncorroborated claims a shocking to me they did it to Robert Bork they did it to Clarence Thomas they've been doing it to Brett Kavanaugh they do it to Republicans conservatives every two and four years they're racist or sexist\nAnd it it leads to being a constant frustration for me I Am never influenced by the money spent on the campaign particularly campaign ad didn't that doesn't affect me I Know who I'm going to vote for before I CNN and there's not an ad in the world that's going to make me change my mind\nBut I have to keep in mind how rare that is most people watch local TV they can avoid all those ads and a lot of people are not immersed than this stuff\nLike I Am and maybe you too and so they are influenced by these ads I have to keep reminding myself\nThat these ads and the the spending of a voluminous amounts of money does matter\nI just I have a tough time I see how people who pay attention to things could even think about voting Democrat right now I I folks I really mean it I think\nGiven what we've seen since Trump was elected the Democrat Party and the deep state deserve the biggest electoral landslide loss ever\nThis country needs to rise up and reject these people I Know their voters are not going to reject them but\nI don't believe they're the majority I think these people need to be skunk their behavior\nJust in terms of decency common decency these people must not be rewarded for what they're doing destroying people destroying institutions destroying concepts in our rule of law\nI shudder to think of them being rewarded for this stuff\nYou know it used to be the you know the economy was great just by living through it but now you apparently have to be told that it's good\nYou have to be watching TV and then somebody on TV has to tell you the economy's good then you have to believe it well I remember a time when the economy was roaring along and people were doing well did you didn't need to be told you know it but now we got the Democratic party out there saying it's not a great economy tax cuts are ruining everything\n[noise] and some don't costs believe this stuff [noise]\nYou'll you'll reject what you're living and believe what you're being told by people [noise] so I just I Am I have yet to be influenced by a political ad now I realize I'm very feminine my convictions and I know what I Believe but there's not an ad in the world's going to change my mind\nAbout a candidate\nOne other thing I get along the lines of one of the Democrat's gonna do if Kavanaugh gets confirmed I told you they're going to double down and they're going to keep harassing and they're not going to stop trying to get rid of this guy I have just a little bit of anecdotal evidence to back it up I have a tweet here actually to\nFrom

against Kavanaugh then it will all fall on the shoulders of democratic Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia as a final vote is expected around five pm on Saturday\nThat the cabin a nomination is where the process has finally hit rock\nAgainst this backdrop that it is sad to each individual senator to decide what the constitution said\nAdvice and consent duty names informed\nBy Alexander Hamilton's

nominated by President Obama\nAnd justice Gorsuch who was nominated by President Trump [noise]\nSo I began my evaluation of judge Kavanaugh's nomination by reviewing his twelve year record\nOn the DC circuit court of appeals including has more than three hundred opinions\nAnd his many speeches and law review article Nineteen turning including lawyers from the non partisan congressional Research Service\nFreaks me many times each week and it says to me in the value waiting the judges extensive record\nI met with judge Kavanaugh for more than two hours in my uh\nI listen carefully to the

Susan Collins Republican senator from Maine announcing her decision on the Capitol Supreme Court nomination if she is a ... year when she has the Kavanaugh is it\nShouldn't want to adjust says who would take just this kind of approach\nAnother assertion that I've heard often is said judge Kavanaugh cannot be trusted if a case involving alleged wrongdoing by the president were to come before the court\nSaid basis for this argument seems to be two fold first judge Kavanaugh has written that he believes said Congress should enact legislation to protect presidents from criminal prosecution or civil liability while like end up at\nHis or president I Believe opponents miss the mark on this issue the fact that judge Kavanaugh awkward Vince legislative proposal suggests that the print he believes that the president does not have\nSuch protection currently\nSecond there are some who argued that given the current special counsel investigation President Trump should not even be allowed to nominate adjust of\nThat argument ignores our recent history\nPresident Clinton in Nineteen Ninety three nominated Justice Ginsburg after the whitewater investigation was already underway and she
