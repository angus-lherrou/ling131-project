Corey O'Connor today after eleven people were shot and killed at a synagogue in Pittsburgh squirrel hill neighborhood there is a vigil plan for tonight with heightened security tomorrow the man accused of carrying out the massacre or make his first court appearance ABC's ... has more\nI was gathering with many friends and we were talking about why this is occurring and\nPart of the issues that are going on is the way\nBoys grow up and I think it's a little different than the way girls grow up as I wrote in the article\nWhen a girl's thoughts approaching puberty there's usually a conversation because it's a scary time for a young girl if they're not prepared for what's about to happen and I don't think that same conversation on the most part happens between fathers and sons so I started thinking about that but I mean\nThat is just concrete right a woman is going to start to amend straight ...\nAnd so she's got a physical change in her body that that really can be emotionally significant in her life as she deals with it correct she may have discomfort you may have pain and then she'll have some physical signs that could be very scary and guys get body hair but nothing of that dimension\nBut true but they may wake up one morning and have their first nocturnal admission and then they don't know what that really is they're not prepared for that\nAnd so we were talking about that among a group of friends and um then it's interesting because in urology\nThere are younger boys when they go through puberty they may have an issue of that is clinically significant when they're testicle twists and there are sort of embarrassed to tell their parents than if they don't get to that\nQuick enough that testicle could die and they could lose a testicle so I\nI Want to do to encourage fathers to have that conversation mothers if they're single mothers to have that conversation and to make sure that their child is not embarrassed\nIf they have some issues in their private parts during that period of time because sometimes they're very significant and it could help\nIn the future or could help save our testicle in certain times so that that's what prompted me in terms of the me too movement\nI was thinking about it and\nI Do think that when boys are going through the dating process especially with their friends they're encouraged to do certain things are there you know they when they come back from the date the boys that are there and they want to know how things went words a little different when a girl goes on our first date and\nIf that same Boyd becomes a super billionaire or a multimillionaire with power and they ... they have that same way of approaching women that may lead to some of the issues that we're having in society so that's why I wrote the\nArticle [noise] so and this ... this came out in ... how many months ago when it came out I think two or three weeks ago just to ...\nAnd and it was picked up from some of the other news stations but it came out in the Atlanta Jewish times and then I don't know where it went from there\nAnd is this the first time you've submitted something that was kind of that you did something like this and just admitted it whether it's dangerous times are AJC or whatever\nYeah so I was ... occasionally I'll write something but the first time but something like this yes\nSo so that's what prompted that and uh I got a lot of positive feedback thing you know\nEspecially from people friends my age thing a wish I had the conversations with my son's\nA and a and my kids read it and ah my kids gave me a little bit of a hard time saying that you should have been more open than you are because I you know and we could all do better and that's the gist of the subject matter and we could all do better as we bring up our sons and we can all be better fare\nSo in in light of the events of the day we were talking before about the fact that excuse me so many of the individuals\nWho committed these atrocities are are men in fact nearly all our men in the U.S NATO and many are young [noise] it seems to really get to this issue about teaching values to our kids and and that was also part of this statement you were making I think\nWell I think that in terms of our society today like you said most of these shootings most of the ah especially in this country are are done by a man and um I think it's important that\nThese values and we instill values in our children when they're very young and hopefully as a society won't be much better off in the future\n[laughter] so\nI'm given the response you've gotten used to ship it you're going to be doing more of this\nThat's an interesting question I don't I could I could do more of it but I'm I'm not trying to be controversial it was just something that headline\nThis was actually an easy one right wasn't that controversial or you could probably be a lot more controversial but right now so I'm not trying to be controversial not trying to be politically\nCorrect I'm just trying to stay the fact that I think that boys when they go through there a significant years of a a growth in puberty I think there are there are taught a little differently or their approach differently and then in young girls that was my point\nSo it's interesting as the me too\nMovement a roast and hearing from so many hearing so many women to talk about the incident that ... that they could remember not one more and I actually thought back to\nUm\nTo a a a memory that was pretty well I guess recess does I'd been on a date\nAnd the young woman in the end of the date and the ... and she was kind of thinking about like playful little kissing and suddenly my hormone started to rage and I my ... I was going in a different place and she push me away and I saw the look on her eye and she was afraid\nAnd I thought oh my God and it took me and I apologize and I took her home and I you know\nAnd then shelled the memory you know compartmentalized it nicely the way that I probably would have compartmentalized the events of yesterday you know watching our football before I came to the show and if it weren't for walking through the kitchen and seeing the ... candle um it probably would have stayed compartmentalized by compartmentalize that and I thought about the fact\nYou know how many of US Army guys\nBecause maybe we weren't aware enough of what we're capable of we weren't aware of these things that might be happening to us\nUm because no one really explained what these things could do and how you could hurt someone I'm In a way how valuable to be to have those conversations and not one talk it's not like we're going to have to thirty minute you know a burden to be taught that you know that really have a conversation about values and who you want to be and and what kind of person who want to be\nI came back from San Francisco um last week on a flight and I watched\nUh the Mr Rogers documentary and I'm not you thought it was really fabulous but it um what was so interesting like realized because I guess the point in stretchers came on I was already Thirteen so I was not watching it and\nBy the time my kids were it was kind of already passed said that\nHe was talking about events like yesterday would have been topics for the show because the kids are watching TV they're hearing their parents talk about it\nAnd this notion that somehow you don't have these conversations and whether it's about hate and war or whatever it may be but they are they're they're multiple vessels and and you talked about having these conversations when they're seven or nine not even like twelve or Thirteen correct\nSo the question is that those conversations about going through puberty how about the conversation about\nHate hatred or hatred in the world of bigotry and I don't know if I'm not a sociologist I don't know whether the people who do some of these uh especially these um\nThese religious crimes or a bigoted crimes are taught at a young age to be that way or that that develops later on but that I don't know because that's not my field but clearly if love is taught or of caring for people who thought\nThat I think that there's less of a chance that that individual is going to commit or perpetrated a crime like this because they they ... they were indoctrinated with good\nAnd helping people and not not negativity and the same thing with me to it if boys are taught how to treat women\nThen they will treat women nicely and respectfully and I think there'll be less of the things going on in the world as ... and in addition if they're taught to do a um\nRecognize changes in their bodies when they do have that pain they won't be embarrassed to tell their parents so we have a chance to to do good for them\nOr a medical way break we're going to break we'll be back stay with us [noise]\n\nThree twenty and the whole re carrier W.

George urology or we've been taking some time talking about the events of the day and and is there a a a healthcare story involved in that and we think there is and has a lot to do with\nUm healthy kids and the role of parents take in educating them um and I think some of that has to do it you know helping maybe them to understand it can be a kinder gentler world and not as bad was telling me during the break just the kind of primitive hunter mentality um that has been our history as certainly the history for men\nUm and and in that vein of a kinder gentler world\nThere's a lot that's happening in health care that may not seen as kind and gentle and somebody has to do with the way that there's kind of reorganizing\nAnd as there is more consolidation that's happening in health care or there is concern that patients will lose choice and that that loss of choice will impact them in not being as kind and his gentle away or to get through their problems and and not directly impacted berries practice so tell me more about how that impact distract\nWell as you note today there is a lot of competition with the insurance companies in the hospitals and they negotiate for contract contracting is a very big big business as I spoke to the insurance commissioner about maybe two or three months ago\nSo what that means is that if you have specific\nInsurance you may not be allowed to be admitted will have a procedure at a certain hospital and how it affects me in my practice in some of the guys who work on the south side I've been in the south side of Atlanta for thirty one years\nIs that there are patients that live in McDonalds or Griffin were even making that I've been treating and\nThey're no longer allowed to be treated at the south side hospitals so if they have a significant problem they may have to go all the way to ... and with the traffic situation if there's sometimes in severe pain this is a big big issue and it affects\nA lot of people and it also affects some people that are having really difficulty driving in navigating the highway especially if they have to be it the the north side hospitals\nAt nine AM or eight am that could be it could take hours to get there and if they have a problem they have to go all the way back there so I think that affects thousands of people and I think it's not fair and I think the insurance commissioner should be involved and make sure that these patients\nAre taking care of in a better fashion\nSo it's um it's kind of not that novel or this notion of having centers of excellence so if you're going to have a bone marrow transplant\nI'm an elective cardiac surgery or they could even be glad to state it could be you have to go to Cleveland Clinic and and those kinds of things have happened what sounds different about this is that just awe hospital it's not just restricted to kind of some high cost were high risk procedures that are typically elected\nCorrect so if it's a if a patient needs if the ... center or Centre of excellence that's completely understandable but if it's a routine procedure\nEven a kidney stone that they have to go drive two hours and then if they have to have multiple procedures sometimes or some of these procedures need multiple procedures to have to go\nTo our drive each way and if they have a complication to go back it becomes a problem the other thing that ends up happening is they end up in emergency rooms and they have to be treated on the south side but if it's an elective schedule case they have to go\nAll the way up to the north side of Atlanta\nSo I'm well I'm curious that the conversation you have an insurance commissioner was just one sided and you did spiel and he just got ahead not or the equivalent you know by voice it had not thank you for calling or is there kind of a real dialogue that took place\nI explained to position it was more it was more of a head nine I he listened the there was somebody else on the phone and they explained it but I don't know maybe behind the scenes or stuff being done\nBut I think it's all about the contracts that insurance companies have with the hospitals and they try to make their best deals and get the best care but there should be a centers that are not so far away especially because a lot of the patients we treat her over Seventy five\nAnd if they do drive they don't go and highways\nWell I'd be I'd be surprised if we don't get some calls about that for individuals who had been in that situation now this is relatively new to this new Dell right to contract\nSomebody has

health\nCare system can in fact our community those of us from rural Georgia it first hand six hospital closures there's twenty thirty nine guarantees with no doctor at all to sixty four counties without even a pediatrician it doesn't have to be this way if we expand Medicaid here in Georgia five hundred thousand more people have access to health care\nAnd will even see an influx of new jobs fifty thousand across the state most to limit communities like ours rhyme give who's running for governor is against expanding Medicaid the has NO PLAN for big thing our health care system at all his website only has seven words about helped\nGear yep seven words those of us in Georgia are losing eight million dollars every day and watching our communities leveled the lack of access to basic

[noise]\nYeah oh yeah oh I didn't realize she hit a specialist on so I Hope I'm not\nA you know kind of change in the uh the theme of the show\nBut um it's my understanding that a constant stress is very hard on the body or you know if you know it's one thing to be a cricket world is a age age that you're trying to constantly get you but I'm the idea that uh\nYou know in our modern world America was supposed to be calm steady state and for the last number of years we've been getting into real high tension a situation\nYou know obviously these shootings and uh you know the ... on the airwaves and whatnot uh is uh is very hard on the psyche so I'm Wondering I'm\nWhitney Affordable Care act was ripped apart you know when the Republicans came into office a year and a half ago uh they tore apart the Affordable CARE Act and I'm Wondering is there a layer of statistics showing how many people have died how many people have\nYou with the loss of medical care or is there a any kind of charter worst theater summary of how\nMany so David David let me cut your cars run around the time so I'm ... there are some stats and I can only speak for what I\nKnow in Georgia and so what we do know is that some of the states did not expand Medicaid and we do know in states that didn't expand Medicaid we know how much money their state taxpayers have paid into the aggregate\nFederal Medicaid system and we know what the other states and per capita distribution of Medicaid has been so we know the cost side\nAnd then we also know that the number of individuals in those relative state so what is you know how many people would have been enrolled in Medicaid numbers for George are pretty powerful numbers hundreds of thousands of people would have had a coverage you don't have coverage or had it been expanded a Barry ... yes\nThe only thing I Would say is I see this every day also even the people with coverage\nWhat's happened over the last few years is their deductibles have gone so high that they don't go to the hospitals or the hospitals deny them ignition\nElective admissions are elective procedures because they may have a five or ten thousand dollars a ... so I don't think it's just about having coverage because many patients I see has coverage and can't use it so there is a big ... a much\nBigger problem whether they have coverage and not with or without the Affordable CARE Act there are plenty of people that had coverage\nBut they couldn't use their coverage so David we got to go but I'll tell ya too quick resources so the commonwealth fund is one um in fact that's probably your best to go to right now and they have some pretty good stats health affairs a is a journal that addresses that as well to try the commonwealth fund thanks for calling [noise]\n\nYou're

the scope and they're also sometimes is painful\nAnd if it's very painful it has to be changed or they could have another way of draining the kidney but a ... the point is that when you write a blog like that ah people read it and then maybe they won't be as a afraid or they won't be as fearful or if they need a stent\nSo are you getting in the dock some kind of coaching given the ease now written for kind of you know not professional media ... media in terms how many words and you know keep away from the jargon and\nCorrect you make it simple make it simple and five hundred words or so and ah and then we have the marketing team looks at it and they tweak it a little bit and they go back and forth and and the ... it goes out and it's very helpful because\nUh to be honest with you it's it's it's written these these are written in layman's terms in layman's words and people people are people are like it we could see how many hits you know the marketing team could see how much a traffic there is and how many people read these things\nAnd and I'm sure they also track to see that if somebody types in stent or your reader will stand you know where how how quickly you come up\nCorrect so those are uh you know specialized or services and they they basically basically a word recognition basically on the Google Search and\nSo so how many blondes have put been put out during your tenure and are there are others that come to mind\nIs got to be a bad or at least twenty I've written three or four of 'em ... maybe even more so uh but probably twenty or twenty five over last year and a half so\nAnd when the doctor doesn't meet this deadline or her deadline had you discipline\nIt's not a ... there's no [laughter] they don't meet at somebody else will pick up the slack but but the our we have a marketing company lands and is what happens is that when somebody agrees to do it they usually make sure that it's gets done because they'll call and say listen we needed by a certain date and it's really\nIt's really not a very complicated thing to do it should take Fifteen twenty minutes to do so it's a good thing it's a good educational piece for the public and very healthy\nAs I still have ... what would you tell a patient just write it down\nCorrect right that it's not very much more than that it's like sitting there and time to the patient if a patient says do I need a stent or how you're going to take care of their stone or how are you going to take care of this prostate problem it's just basically ah in in two or three paragraphs putting it down and you have your you have a\n... so are you prioritizing the issues to be covered and you're trying to do or is it like you're trying to get all the dachshund rotation each stock pick something\nEverybody's ... everybody wants to can write a blog and when we have some of the when we have our marketing meetings usually once a month we say what's the topic of the month and then I started asking around then usually it's pretty easy to find somebody to write a blog\nSo I'm\nSo in ... in regard to the obviously a much bigger marketing plan do do the ducks are they supported did they get it to the understand the reason why are they comfortable with it um\nSo that's a good point so clearly we we both started in Atlanta almost around the same time their kids are same age basically\nAnd or in the Nineteen and late Nineteen eighties\nNineteen eighty eight eighty nine Ninety there were no billboards there was no commercials about drugs\nAnd we've we've we've witnessed a dramatic change because now you're watching the super bowl you're watching football games and sometimes you know we were afraid to have our kids watch commercials now\nAnd now we're also afraid because of some of the content but now there's also stuff about all kinds of drug therapy that that are on TV\nAnd some marketing has become a major aspect into medical health field you'll see drug commercials or hospital commercials on a regular basis which is totally unlike it was Thirty years ago so ten years ago ten years ago\nI I think if you watched the nightly national news I think that's all that they have any more as pharmaceutical commercial\nI mean we used to we used to cringe thinking that we would advertises physicians in the eighties and the only one or advertising professionals you'd have lawyers advertising and and maybe different accounting firms advertising now ... we're right in it with everybody\nAnd and so is it brings up a really interesting points so as as a consumer to take off the doctor had as a consumer how do you feel about the direct to consumer marketing\nI think it's I think it's\nHelpful in terms of an educational process but when you watch these commercials about drugs you'll hear at the end it's almost like a car advertising that somebody's really speak infested the other side effects might be and they keep going on and on and so you know legally they're trying to cover all their bases and it's just sort of\nA were just ... it's almost like we're like everybody else now and um it's a little sad but I guess that's what ... what's needed in today's society\nSo that the latest uh that's coming out is um there may be pressure um that will be legislative that will require that when you do an ad you're going to have to include pricing\nAnd question of how that you know but but you said that typical drug ad you know I'm you know ... take reverse of tall deal ten years younger versatile you know ten milligrams three thousand dollars whatever it is I'm and I'm Wondering you know how far it goes in and\nYou know on the on the one hand obviously a lot of conversation about cost of care and you know why shouldn't it be transparent why shouldn't we know people get pronounce from their hospital bill to eight and ten pages long they can't understand them um and so I'm curious about it because of the one hand we want transparency but now that we're in the mix as well do we want to put our prices out there\nSo\nWould probably be a question for the pharmaceutical companies I I don't know that there's a set price because patients go to different drugstores and now they're getting many many of them are getting drugs from Canada because they're more they're cheaper and more affordable see that in your practice yes especially some of the drugs for erectile dysfunction they're getting them\nFrom other places and then there's also this place called the the ... express scripts\n[noise] twenty four hour news weather and traffic\nFive AM\nTo\nNow we thirty
