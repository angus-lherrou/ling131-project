nutritional yeast everyday\nNutrition used to have a certain type of beta glue candidate that can actually helped tremendously we keeping your immune system strong\nSo if a nutritional you should get a grocery store I don't I don't have it on my website or anything most health food sections of grocery stores carry it I use more than a quarter teaspoons I liked the flavor it's a nice savory flavor it stimulates my mommy taste buds and um I just love the flavor makes things a kind of rich and thick\nUm so you can do that and you want to make sure you get your vitamin D levels where it needs to be you need to be around forty to fifty uh that that's how we measure vitamin D um\nAnd when you get your blood work done check your vitamin D always and there I like it or ride around fifty to be honest with you forty I think is like the low end I'd rather go up to fifty most people are vitamin D deficient and especially in the winter because I was at a party last night and actually one of my patients with her\nAnd she's so I get out in the sun a lot I'm outside a lot but in the winter the UVB rays are hitting the earth on an angle that is not going to stimulate vitamin D production um because if it's just not getting the right angle the sun so in the winter always always always vitamin D to further north you go the more likely you are to get sick\nWe noticed people on the equator you never hear about a flu outbreak along the equator why is that lots of direct UVB rays lots of vitamin D\nSo a on a website Dr Joe dot com we have Dr Joe's vitamin D we also add vitamin K to to to help build your bones or I take five drops a day five drops his five thousand international units not a lot and a half century no flavor\nThat's really important for flu season I also have to products

what once you start taking it it's ginger horseradish cayenne pepper onion garlic puree and an apple cider vinegar\nAnd it tastes the way it sounds but it's so amazing to see a lot of pilots carry with them people travel flight attendants are because it really really works real well in most cases again I'm I'm not telling you take drugs\nBut this stuff works really really really well from a natural standpoint so the vitamin D the wellness boosted of seasonal tonic or those Ron website Dr Joe dot com and it's really a good idea\nUm to keep your body healthy and those are some things you also want to avoid sugar sugar weakened immune system in my book eating right for a prescription for health\nWe talk about how sugar cane blowout your immune system we have a whole chapter on that so it's ironic that we eat the worst foods\nWhen we're not getting enough sunlight enough exercise what what do I mean but it works foods starts for Halloween everybody overdoses on candy what do you buy candy for the kids kids don't show up you don't get the candy\nCould return to the store and get my money back now that would be silly I'm just going to eat it and then everybody gets sick the week after Halloween and then we come up with Thanksgiving and then ever get sick the week after Thanksgiving and then we just go to Christmas parties like crazy everybody's sick from Thanksgiving to New Years and it's just a horrible time\nSo you really got to do everything you can to keep your body as healthy as you can and the vitamin D is going to be a big player or the wellness boosted a seasonal

concentrated animal fats because it really puts a stress on the gall bladder you want to go to alkaline diet soda ... acid\nFoods or alcohol meat sugar dairy coffee soda and artificial sweetener so if you're eating a lot of acid foods I was asked it has to be neutralized with calcium and neutralized calcium acid combination can gets getting clogged up your liver\nBut staying away from processed foods fried food sugars these are the things that put the main stress on delivering the goal but it's connected to deliver\nStaying away from concentrated fatty foods animal products is a real good

watch in Florida it's a dead heat and that's both the Senate with Rick Scott and that's what governor and Rhonda sent this was a couple of points behind and that's not looking good I'm also worried about panhandle and people showing up in the panhandle you had a very tight race for governor and the great state of Georgia although I think that we'll be back towards camping back towards the Republican\nIn Tennessee it's if you want to keep the Senate it's a must win seats in Tennessee with Marsha Blackburn against bill Brett is it and we have reticence team on tape saying that he was lying about cabin on that he's going to govern as a liberal\nAnd I think that really is taking people back also on tape staffers progressing calling the people Tennessee ignorant I don't think that's helpful so I think Marshalls but people have got to get up to vote 'em we see Josh Hawley is doing very well and he's up by a couple of percentage points in Missouri against the phony Claire McCaskill\nAnd she's bragging about how she really politically is just like Obama but she too like Brett as soon as hiding who she really is\nHeidi Heitkamp in North Dakota's down by double digits she also was exposed but project very posh uh we now have in a Braun in Indiana he's up by a couple of points against incumbent Joe Donnelly a Democrat you only the only factor\nThere that I rarely see is

the attorney for the blind shake the Arizona State university and saying right after nine eleven was perfectly fine of Americans want to join the enemy and joined the Taliban I don't have a problem with it anyway he believes that he can help get out the vote Ralph Reed is with us that's the Senate do you agree with my assessment\nI'd do Sean we're uh we're currently are contacting twenty six million\nEvangelical and pro life and pro family Catholic voters and Nineteen states\nWe knocked on a million nine hundred seven thousand three hundred and twenty eight doors a through this weekend Sean not that we are counting and as of this weekend five point eight million of the voters that we've contacted have already voted we expect that number to exceed ten million by election day\nWe think we're going to have the biggest turnout of Christian voters we've ever had an internal actually\nWell I Hope so I'm I'm a little worried about the house uh I look at ras muses number of the president has not had a higher approval rating than he does now which is perfect timing\nThe president literally has been going state by state and out doing everything within his power to make people aware that this was really hard mid term election history is going against the tide ear\nIf we are to hold the house and hold the Senate and pick up seats in the Senate but I think will definitely pick up seats in the Senate I'm worried about the house real clear politics average has the Democrats and two oh five Republicans at two hundred and you know basically you've got these dirty toss up seats or or thereabouts that are in play and that's going to make all the difference\nYeah that's right and and Sean what our eight five to people right now certainly the thousands of volunteers that are out there and knock on doors and distributing voter education literature through our organization is ignored the polls ignore the press ignored the pundits do your job get to\nEverybody but me you
