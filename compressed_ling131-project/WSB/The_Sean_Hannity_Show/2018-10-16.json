another one of those things where we get the money you know keeping on the deal yeah I listen to fly on the war crime\nI take the money [laughter]\nWhat I'm saying is if they asked to unless they specifically ask is she voting for the wall we should just let them go they need to think so I made my shoes they actually were the wall and they don't ask me then let them think that right\nAnd if they don't let them think that that's what the rule is now for the Democratic party even the center for American Progress sending out don't talk about immigration Maxine Waters admitting that she's being told don't talk about impeachment just shut up about it we we know we know we're going to do but we're not going to\nWe're not going to help people the truth before an election that's Claire McCaskill and and people on her staff people just can't know that she wants a semi automatic rifle ban and that\nThat of course you would vote yes on gun bans of course she supports the semi automatic rifle ban\nYou know she's quiet on guns because she has a bunch of Republican voters but secretly shoes that she supports say hey gun control group\nYou know what our staff is saying well wait till after the election to bring up Trump impeachment to voters get over it we can't do it now we got a line now\nWith you know three weeks Twenty one days collection they why would we ever tell people the truth people just can't know McCaskill\nAn Obama essentially have the same views on everything wow now the people in Missouri I Hope you're paying close attention but it's bigger than that a project Vera tosses got this undercover video they got the undercover video of the week before about former governor of Tennessee Bredesen Marsha Blackburn now what by fourteen points\nBecause on that tape it's the same line he'll he'll do the right thing when he gets there of course we don't agree with everything Trump says no not at all do what ... what we're saying we vote per capita of course he wouldn't vote for capital\nI mean this is all part of a light campaign propaganda campaign and it's all about power and it's being exposed to very high level I mean this is really you know seeing people how they really are is should be so enlightening to the people tendency in Missouri a James O'Keefe is with us She's the founder project Vera toss\nExposing these senators I you know I watch this and I'm just like what a bunch of liars that's all I think when I see this great job\nYeah Sean this is a pattern you know we really the Tennessee won the Tennessee Senate candidate rather than you know responded by fumbling and bumbling his words caught red handed these are all of a staffer Sean inside their McCaskill's office they're all saying essentially the same thing when it comes to Obama\nGun control impeachment they're all saying that we have to do one thing before the election and do another thing afterwards some of that already it was a little hard to hear but one of those powerful pieces which when the sky Glenn Winfrey one McCaskill staffers explains to our journalist when we asked so what do we tell the moderates ... after we did the impeachment because we are going to mislead them\nAnd the guy goes will tell them get over it\nAnd that's the that's the ... it's that this is that the guy next arose field organizer tells us he says a quote people just can't know unquote than the cast on a bomb had the same views no I confronted neck on the street yesterday with a microphone ethnic why don't you why don't you tell the truth\nAnd of course the reason is and this is true in Missouri it's true in Tennessee is true in North Dakota\nOh how nice red state Democrats they have to lie to the voters to get elected it it's a necessary condition so we're doing is exposed\nYou don't want to know what you're going to say this agree with that point they don't have the lie they have to lie if they want to win\nAnd I think it's a question of whether or not they will put aside any any sense of decency honor honesty\nAnd embrace any level of truth and they won't and that's the point and you know I think everybody on they're showing on TV if you look the houses and play the senators and play if you vote for any Democrat but in the house you're voting for ...\nIt'd be a boat for Claire McCaskill or Bredesen or a high camp or cinema or Donnelly or Bill Nelson you're voting for Schumer because that's who's going to own them in control them that's what they're going to vote to be their leader\nWell you know and and Sean and some of these states like Missouri in particular the pro life Democrats and pro gun Democrats used to be a thing decades ago misery with the ... when I came to those things but that's a shrinking\nGroup of people and and people like Claire McCaskill half state it in order to when they have to or they think they have to mislead\nAnd again this is the Greek chorus of staffers these staffers are not necessarily villainous I suppose there is on us because they're going along with it but they're just telling the truth so tiny very interesting to see British and after we played the tapes on your radio last week\nBritish and talk to local media this is kind of the Senate candidate he told all the local media stations well al these ... these young guys were caught and kind of misled staffers who while they don't work for me when in fact they did he apologized so\nIt's going to be very uh by the way that was a lie to the first thing is that well they're they're just college kids no they weren't they actually work for\nAnd the guy polish I describe brown who is the Democratic spokesperson for the brightest in campaign he actually apologized to the media can you believe that Sean apologized for misleading people without our videos so it's very interesting to see how McCaskill's gonna respond now this guy Josh Hawley the [laughter]\nThat help our farmers right now is Seventy eight degrees on Peachtree Street they're
