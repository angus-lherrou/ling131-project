duplicated how you you've been out and about on a champion of this for a long time\nYet we've helped over five hundred and fifty doctors convert to this model in the last few years but there's about a thousand total there in forty eight states every state except north and South Dakota right now but we have one about to launch in North Dakota [noise]\nUm and then it's even gotten a little bit international so um this is a a sound tried and true model\nNow and what do you do Dr gross in terms of your president of duck a doctor patient care foundation you know now that\nWe have alternatives that are working real life experiences seems to me that we ought to be able to duplicate it a lot more than we are\nAbsolutely a so doctor patient care foundation was a physician run health policy because doctors never seemed to be at the table when ever having conversations about health care\nSo we put traditions are getting back to the table to help these conversations\nPersonally I I also have a primary care practice much like that lets them either in southwest Florida the practice of any health are plus when he was you know why are we using insurance to pay for health are for basic primary care services\nSolid does is create obstacles to access in Turkey where ... ... ... points as Dr Josh and we're seeing patients come from all over the state of Florida and even from outside of the country\nAre seeing some in medical tourism are and what we're finding is that you know not not the same thing got about health insurance we're just using it for all and you know when somebody is you know pay twice the amount of money for a service because they are how some shots\nWater we ensuring if you don't trust drives up the cost of the other products so among the cash price Ross is two hundred and twenty dollars while using or your commercial insurance you know we go through all the the hoops to give it authorized\nYour co pay five hundred dollars or so we we see this time and again on the more people are are coming out of pocket to pay for health health or a with the side of the ... more insurance seems to become an optical\n... solution so I'm pleased to see the the you know we're shifting the conversational from a coverage for everyone who I'm Talking about reducing the cost of health care I think that the real close enough I was about to testify on us some help committee yeah honestly because I pop it\nIt be a better idea I mean I'm watching for example they have this race out in California everybody shock Gavin Newsom ... who is now offering free health care for everybody\nIt whether you're pay our taxpayer whether you're in the state legally or illegally everybody's got to get free health care well I basically put a sign that says come to California but you get sick\nUm because people are going to go there now what's interesting to me is that a Republican is within striking\nThat gubernatorial race out in California because instinctively people no we can't afford to pay for every illegal immigrant in the country are but the reality is is that if I Lived in Wichita, Kansas I Would be a part of atlas empty and I would be your patient\nDr ... because I I think it's the best deal I liked the idea of being able to call my doctor whenever I'm sick or if I have a kid that sick every parent wants the ability to do that and your preserved service provides it for fifty bucks a month now how much does the average in Wichita, Kansas catastrophic plan of it but the big things heart attack\nOr accident or cancer how much would one of those plans cost\nAbout five hundred dollars to family five hundred dollars for a year or a month or so\nAnd the current rates closer to you know a thousand twelve hundred a across the nation people are paying more for health insurance each month and they're paying for their mortgage if the Trump tax cuts when we put a hundred dollars per household per month in and they're being credited with\nThe economic boom of your four point two percent GDP\nIf we fix health insurance we could put five hundred dollars back in the pocket of every household a the the real ... and the the politician their heads and California is to send them on a ridge analogy\nThis throwing more money at the problem has never fixed it so you what we're doing is Dr Lee and ourselves and in a thousand other physicians is is innovating and saying how do we get much cheaper how do we make it so patients don't have co pays how do we provide stitches for no cost because they're so affordable\nI'm actually looking at ways a fundamentally fixing the system that's what we need not just promises of more spending\nAnd if I could add up to that just a a book you know as far as the cost of care you know people ask us as well how can I just get major medical you know we\nWe can afford what what services the primary care practice is providing but we just need something catastrophic well I'm a care made that illegal\nOr so something little stretching just brought ... get access to these major medical plan it's called ... short term medical plans and you know some would argue that these are actually true insurance they don't cover anything except ... they're Seventy five dollars a month or\nWhat it is this going to be implemented easily city by city town by town we can duplicate the model it already does take care of individuals with preexisting conditions if somebody wants to sign up for atlas MD and they have a preexisting condition a doctor or do you deny them service\nEverybody's welcome everybody's price the same just based on age um we know we're going to work harder for some patients ... Wilson oh we're going to not have to work as hard for other patients and we don't want to be judged by their illness\nHow did you get to to directly negotiate these prices with these pharmaceutical companies\n[noise] boy I I Wish I could say was because we're so darn good at it um that the truth is it's so much more simple than that\nAt a doctor's in forty four states are allowed to work directly with pharmaceutical wholesalers so just like you can go to Costco and get something for much cheaper because you pay a membership\nWe do the same thing and we're able to\nGet the you know the actual cost of medicine might be a ten dollars for a thousand pills and because we don't have a staff of seven people per physician fighting insurance\nWe can lower the cost and in past the savings on directly to the patient ... this is a win for everybody we we don't take care of of Republicans or Democrats we take care of people\nSo how does somebody had a group of doctors in New York say implement those cars are going to look at this and say fifty bucks a month I Can't make ten cents off of that\nBut they're gonna have to move out of New York because they don't make it easy but they could work with a pharmacist in New York state's one of the a few states that make it very difficult but then a pharmacist could say um if you do a five dollar a month membership with them then you get the medicine that cost that would be an amazing model it it would cut down\nThere right let's take the New York out of the equation for California out of the ... let's say any other state Louisiana Florida um I don't know Missouri yeah how do they do it\nIt's as simple as signing up effect shopping on Amazon there's there's almost nothing to it um\nYou know we have one supplier that makes it very easy overnight shipping and that's just it if I Want to buy a bottle of a hundred pills of blood pressure medicine I can if I Want to buy a thousand pills I Can't and it's about the same price um but it's fundamentally cheaper than what\nAbout Lindsey Graham is saying that what only block grant the money that we're already providing to individual states and let them come up with these innovative you know like centers of innovation all around the country and I think naturally people would move toward your system\nI I I Would agree with the logic or the federal government's basically saying we've given your money with strings attached before and we haven't received full value for that because we weighed you down with regulatory burden so we're going to cut those strings and just give you the money and say go forth and do the best job that you can\nWrite a quick break we'll come back more Dr Josh ... some day and Dr Lee as grows president on docks for a patient care foundation\nThe we're fresh leadership ... past events coming up on Wednesday October the twenty fourth write it down hosted by our friends at expressed pros dot com or they're celebrating their ninth year there were a fresh leadership ... cast\nIs going to be hosted down two hundred low patients it's a very unique event you can recharge all your leadership skills will will help inspire and motivate encourage your team\nRegistered today or crush leadership dot com slash same old cast refresh leadership dot com slash ... cast you gonna learn how former president of Adidas North America mark king encourages creativity and competence with big dreams vision and energy\nJoined expressed prose this year at the we're fresh leadership sign will cast all happening Wednesday October the twenty fourth and helps with networking and inspiration registered today we're fresh leadership dot com slash time all cash or just go to your local express employment professionals office had expressed pros dot com\nAnd all\nIn the street fighter who takes on a system than I had an ... powers you want us about conservative voices fighting fire\nSean Hannity [noise]\nHe was not he by five AM seven fifty [noise] don't you ask me [noise]\nFor the past nine carrier to us being twenty four hour traffic centers in those on the album and productivity five west punish you make your way to an isolated by water for workers were sending up in a lab traveling spinning toward cob parkway also construction work continuing Seventy five north and south down by ... counties red top mountain road ... affected in both\nCity beach Keith combs W.

dangerous this is as it goes ... we're talking about in Augusta, Georgia you're going to be having aged or a hundred mile an hour winds tomorrow same thing as your head up to Columbia South Carolina into the\nInto North Carolina so a lot of bad stuff happening our thoughts and prayers with everybody and just no help will be on the way we live in the greatest country on earth would the most generous people on earth\nAnd whatever our friends in Florida Georgia the Carolinas are going to need I Know that people will be there to to help in any way imaginable a we have some breaking news on the deep state as it relates to Rod Rosenstein oh this is really outrageous\nRod Rosenstein I'll think of everything that he was involved and think of how conflicted he as bad as it relates to all things deep state that we have been telling you about now for a year and a half he is the person\nIn May of twenty Seventeen recommending the firing of Jim told me he is the guy that appointed special counsel Robert Mueller he is the guy that signed the third ... knew the fourth buys a application to spy on the Trump campaign associate Carter Page\nOr the bulk of the information in the ... of warrants as we all know now or the Hillary Clinton bought and paid for phony Russian dusty aid that even its author Christopher Steele doesn't stand by\nAnd of course that was funneled money it was made to look like a legal expense when in fact it was anything but a legal expense\nNow he was now are supposed to testify but those three people now\nLisa Page Andrew McCabe the former deputy FBI Director and James Baker again we just learned this you know this week\nJames Baker now the third person\nAre all saying that Rod Rosenstein talked at length about surreptitiously going into the oval office taping the president of the United states by the way that would be without a warrant\nAnd then hoping he can get some information something from the president that could then at night or ... or start the process of invoking the twenty Fifth Amendment to remove the president from office\nNow he's denying it said he was being sarcastic that it was he was joking about it but the testimony of Lisa Page Andrew McCabe and James Baker all contradict what Rod Rosenstein is now saying\nWell Rod Rosenstein was scheduled to testify tomorrow to the house Judiciary Committee but unfortunately this hour there at an impasse\nAnd the impasse over the terms of the testimony because lawmakers are calling for what is the standard congressional taskforce interview and insisting that Rod Rosenstein give a transcribed interview and that the interview be under oath\nHe's refusing to do so and those close to Rosenstein say they prefer a meeting and I'm sure they do or briefing with the house Judiciary Committee chairman and other lawmakers they don't want any paper trail\nDon't want to be under oath at all\nNow the house Judiciary Committee aide said on Wednesday they left the door open for a possible resolution there should be no resolution the resolution is to subpoena Rod Rosenstein and having testify under oh did he or did he not\nAs Lisa Page as McKay Andrew McCabe is James Baker all saying Diddy or did he not talked about wearing a wire against the president and the hope of getting something he says to help and both the twenty Fifth Amendment\nEither he did it or he didn't do it and then we can also talk about why he signed the the fourth and final buys a warrant\nA publication as it relates to Carter Page why why did he signed off on a document himself talked about well with regards to ... warns you know that as an affidavit and career law enforcement swears to the validity of truthfulness and if they're wrong there's consequences\nWell we all know the bulk of the size of applications including the last one\nAnd there's one that shouldn't have been signed by that point they knew Hillary paid for it they knew the DNC paid for it\nThey knew it was full of uncorroborated on verified information we're now nine months in two surveilling Carter Page by then you think they would have figured out that the CIA was phony and made up and even its own author\nOr couldn't prove any of its contents and when questioned in in in Iraq a tour and Great Britain said I don't know if any of this is true it's just raw intelligence and people just pay and things like to hookers urinating in a bad in front of Donald Trump or in Moscow and the Ritz Carlton\nWell nobody ever verify that or corroborated that and it is if you're going to get an affidavit ... the law especially a fight the application Pfizer warrant\nAnd protocol that you verify the contents and the information here presenting to a ... court\nAnd you don't purposely withhold information pertinent information like the fact that Hillary Clinton bought and paid for that pony ... that you didn't take the time to verify or corroborate but there's obviously they all hated Donald Trump because remember struck was the one that said\nWell first they get to smell the Trump voters in a Wal Mart but also said that Hillary should win them a hundred million to zero\nAnd then you're going to add to that the insurance policy comment that he made and what you really have here is I think now the validation or the ... operation of what the insurance policy was\nInsurance policy is that you have people conspiring\nNot only remember Lisa Page testified as we head into may nine months into the investigation into so called Trump Russia collusion by the very same people that gave Hillary Clinton a pass on the biggest obstruction of justice case in history\nThen they go into the Trump Russia so called investigation\nLisa Page confirms that they had no information Peter Struck tech confirmed that there's no there are there\nBut anyway then they start ... media elite strategy all coming from the same source which is Hillary's bought and paid for dot CA\nThey get their willing accomplices in the media to spread their lives and propaganda from the CIA and it creates an atmosphere where an impression is being created that whoa there really is something going on here\nAnd then it's used by the very same people the phony information that they spread to whip up hysteria so that they can go forward after the firing of called me on the ninth of may in twenty Seventeen then they appoint\nRod Rod Rosenstein goes out in the points his buddy Robert Mueller\nBut there was no evidence at all according to Lisa Page that there was any reason to open a special counsel investigation\nThe whole house of cards the corruption those sailing tool is now exposed no wonder Rod Rosenstein doesn't want to speak to the Senate\nJudiciary Committee ... sorry the house Judiciary Committee no wonder why Whitey especially under oath where then he could be charged with lying under oath you know and people worry about that just ask Papadopoulos or General Flynn\nOr we have a lot of information we're going to get to we have a rash musician a poll out today Republicans tied with the Democrats on the generic ballot that is huge we have more information specific information of just how radical\nThe Democratic party's agenda is if they ever get back power in twenty seven days we have in Arizona mix Sally thankfully has taken the lead in that close Senate race out there she was really an American war hero\nAnd ah anyway I think we're seeing a lot of moving in Missouri in favor of the Republican candidates a lot of movement Heidi Heitkamp is in trouble in North Dakota Joe Donnelly is in trouble in Indiana Bill Nelson needs to be defeated by Rick Scott who I Love in Florida but Rick Scott can't be campaigning now taking care of the people in the pan
