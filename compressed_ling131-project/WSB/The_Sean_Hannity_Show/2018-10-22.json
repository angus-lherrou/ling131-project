patients coming to say I've been meaning to make an appointment for\nBlank\nAnd they fill in the line and that like all the way back to Thirty years I've been in practice thirty four years so yeah about up to thirty four years and finally here\nStop that just get off your little Fannie\nGo to our website Dr Joe dot com make an appointment right on line if you want to get a little less tech

um but even if it's in network coverage is out of network coverage let us help explain you and and walk you through the insurance maze 'cause it's very confusing\nAnd I've had patients they already

fast\nAnd chances are you'll feel better and make enough money to pay ten times over whatever you paid any doctor because you need it so we got a few minutes here we're talking about gross things in the grocery store something worse than high fructose corn syrup\nAnd if we talk about high fructose corn syrup earlier in show an outbreak down into fructose has to be converted the glucose and it produces your gas in his waste product and your ... your gas it gets in your joints and it hurts and you're a cast it prevents the body front property producing nitric oxide\nWhich is why Dr Joe's nitric oxide support is one of well they're all popular but one of our very popular supplements because it increases circulation your brain to your\nReproductive Oregon's we smile and we say that 'cause it's a family show but the gentleman you start your engines are but all those products are on the website Dr Joe dot com but there's something called\nAspartame now aspartame is a not good\nBecause aspartame has made a three components just bought a gas at federal ... now spotted gases ... toxins to the brain and cause of the brain to fire faster than it's supposed to and can literally burn out your\nBrain cells not a good thing\nFederal Alan and if you can't produce a camp process fell alley through your kidneys you get you have something called federal ... and that's why if you've ever read any threat aspartame it says not recommended for people if they don't get in your area because it can kill you potentially\nAnd then it breaks out to ... ... is our mess and all these methyl messing is wood alcohol now if I was going to drink without them I was going to hand you a glass of wood alcohol\nI could be arrested for attempted murder because without a whole is very dangerous to the nervous system and specifically affects the optic nerve\nAnd many people have reported if they drink diet sodas while flying somehow the barometric pressure changes can actually cause something called tunnel vision where they they can only see a small part of the middle of their eye if they lose some peripheral vision\nAnd then they land on the ground again it goes away and go oh it was no big deal to go to the doctor doc can't find anything so if you have I issues and you're drinking a lot of Sparta gas in failing to mess last year as we call it aspartame make sure you tell your eye doctor\nBecause that can be affecting the optic nerve in many cases when you come off it we you know we also have what's called aspartame detox in about six months\nA lot of people do well\nAnd so it's really important that you are you do that um and it can affect the neurological system as well\nSo some people will come in and say they have been diagnosed with uh uh uh from neurological issue and the first question I ask is he ... official sweeteners and if the answer is yes you need to cut out the artificial sweeteners because it affects the nervous system you spotted gas it and then we see six months from now we may have to do a re evaluation and find out what's going on\nBut it it's ... it's not good stuff to stay away from the artificial sweeteners number one side effect of artificial sweetener is headaches\nSo sky practice a lot of patients come to us with headaches neck pain back pain headache very very can we see it every day and why are we say we need to do a dietary work up on you why because if you're doing something that's causing the headaches it may not be a chiropractor case that you have or maybe in addition to a chiropractor case you might have a\nChemical issue I Can't do caffeine if I Do caffeine I get a headache it's not a secret chocolate coffee\nHas prompt that gives me problems I just can't do it but if you're doing diet soda is aspartame by the way is about six thousand six to eight thousand products last I read so that's a big important thing that you may be causing a lot of your problems wouldn't it stink\nIf you suffer from headaches are blurred vision or fatigue or a brain fog and you did it to yourself and\nI felt a lot of patients over the years get angry why did somebody tell me this sooner I don't know that answer but I Do know you know now\nSo it's not what you want it's not something good and expertise believed to be carcinogenic than accounts for more reports of adverse reactions that all other food and food additives\nCombined\nSo take all the food additives that dies and the chemicals in the uh the coral color we just talked about all of them grouped together\nAfter you get more complaints about aspartame than any other of the of the products that is something called a soul fame K. or eighth ... potassium uh and it's been linked to kidney problems and super Los\nIs again we're talking about gross things in a grocery store so close to the ...\nThe the hydrocarbon what that means is we take sugar we go through a five steps chemical process and we create something called super close which in theory supposed to taste sweet but not be absorbed in your body\nWell the problem with that is that it does get absorbed and would sue Carlos gets into your body it acts as a ... a chemical disrupt the hormone disruptor and indifferent disrupted we call it and it can act like estrogen and estrogen as a growth hormone and if you're not growing\nUp you can grow out\nAnd so this is why study after study after study has shown one of the reasons that people use artificial sweeteners many times\nGained weight and don't lose weight [noise]\nPlus you have to an end you missed an amazing

says it caused between six dollars and twelve dollars an hour for the new robot to hit the streets\nQuite frankly in Manhattan I give us thirty minutes ... before someone knocks it over and then just stripped down for parts [noise]\nOr when you consider all the bad drivers on the road imagine for just a moment that all those drivers now have a drone accessible\nTo them that's right and twenty six Tina drone came within two hundred feet of a plane that was approaching LAX but what if that collision has actually occurred All right Kevin poor man he's with the University of Dayton research Institute impact physics division and he said I Want to find this out\nThe answer they he arrived at isn't very reassuring his group is able to launch things that high rates of speed so it was able to simulate a crash using the right wing of a loony em twenty plane and then a drone\nWas a DJ I found him to quad copped or it's two point one pounds and then he had the biggest their cat in his lab could actually handle so the banter wasn't certain to his forty foot cannon released at a speed up two hundred and thirty eight miles per hour it hit point zero three seconds later\nAnd although the drone was obliterated it held together long enough to strike the wing is one object that's key here rather than multiple fragments\nNow wired magazine describes a slow motion video the drone entering the wing as like a spoon through chocolate moose than if you're a kids club member and you're watching the video can actually see\nThe drone go into the aircrafts wing explains that the drone traveled

that maybe it's not the best politician with the best gift of gab or ... or but boy when it comes to getting the job done when the people of Florida need Rick Scott he's there for you\nAnd the same with ah we've got it for whatever reason the media's fall in love with Andrew Gillum down in Florida\nAnd you know run to set this up out of the great debate last night and he is now fighting to to prevent Florida from getting a forty percent business tax that Gillum would support\nGillum is we use some of the most harsh rhetoric against police that I've ever heard before he's fairly radical in his views\nHe's trying to hide it just like every other Democrat is hiding who they really are they can't be elected by being honest with their constituents in who they are what they believe and what they really want to fight for\nWe saw that with Brett us then and the project berets as tape and the great state of Tennessee anyway you know run the Santa sees in a fight for his life down in Florida we got Marsha Blackburn who's going to be a fantastic senator from Tennessee but\nYou know for whatever reason Britain is out there trying to convince the people of Tennessee that he is something that he's not that he's a moderate liberal and these tapes blew that out of the water as they're calling the people of Tennessee ignorant people in his office and saying that his public position on Brett Kavanaugh\nIs just for show and we saw the same thing and the tapes in Missouri Claire McCaskill\nYou know we've already found out she was a phony but now we really know she's a phony\nShe goes on a an RV tour of Missouri except she's taking private jets looks so Harvey tour with with wings unbelievable\nBut some anecdotal evidence now there I think the Kavanaugh hearings I think this caravan is now becoming a massive campaign issue\nAnd just the fact that there's seven thousand people that are marching towards our southern border to create some type of confrontation oughta tell Americans what the party of sanctuary cities sanctuary states the party that wants to eliminate eyes open borders means\nWhen you look at the amount of money illegal immigration has cost the American taxpayers it isn't in the billions and billions and billions of dollars because if you're in this country illegally and you're arrested for something we paid the criminal justice cause\nIf you go to a hospital hospitals not gonna not take care of you we pay the healthcare costs we pay the educational costs when your kids are in school nobody's against illegal immigration\n... nobody's against immigration everyone's against illegal immigration we're saying we have a process\nThat we have sovereignty and we have borders and they deserve to be respected\nAnd what does it say about the people that do go through the process legally improperly that's now coming to the forefront\nAt the president's call for a wall is right sanctuary cities and states are wrong there's been so look at the crimes committed in Texas alone when I was down there for that security briefing with Rick Perry I mean the six hundred and forty two thousand Texas alone\nVictims of crimes some very serious including murder\nAnd then it gets downright scary now we have more instances Mitch McConnell over the weekend confronted some guy banging on his table at a restaurant taking his leftovers and throwing them throwing those out the the door of the restaurant\nNow it's almost happening on a daily weekly basis we got a lot of new tape that we're going to play for you but I think the biggest thing that people need to know is Democrats want to stop all progress what do they want to take us back to\nWe know failed after eight years of Obama\nTheir signature legislation Obamacare their fundamental promises which was keep your doctor keep your plan pay less millions of Americans lost their doctors plans and are paying in some cases one hundred two hundred and three hundred percent more than they ever paid before for in theory or coverage\nWe have many states where you only have one option one the health care option that's it\nSo it has not worked out well for the American people it was from the beginning it redistribution scam where you're forcing the young and the healthy to buy plans they never want needed or desired and forcing them by threat of a fine\nTo literally subsidize the sick the elderly and and the disabled uh Americans when all they really need is a catastrophic plan and one office visit a year or and they catastrophic plan would be like fifty bucks a month and that's for God Forbid you have a bad accident get cancer and heart attack\nBut the anecdotal hope that I'm Talking about is political even says looks like Chuck Schumer his dreams of becoming the Senate majority leader or evaporating before his eyes\nEven his Democratic colleagues don't think it's going to happen anymore democratic hopes of winning the Senate have faded in the final weeks of the twenty Eighteen electorate with a party now needing to win every one of the more than half a dozen\nCompetitive races to capture control the chamber\nBrian from pretty much the last year and a half hour we're gonna we're gonna take control of the house in the Senate\nHeidi Heitkamp seat has slipped away looks like it's going to be Republican pickup Martha ... going to join us later I mean every day gets worse for Christ in cinema\nI mean there's just an unmitigated disaster for her I mean you know she thinks it's okay for Americans to join up and support it scared Mitt treason against their country and support the Taliban we've got that\nWe've got her on tape saying that her state of Arizona the people are crazy and it's the ... lab of democracy and then of course you know attacking border patrol people inviting radicals like the lawyer for the blind shake into town\nAnd meanwhile Martha ... Sally twenty eight years of service serving our country six tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan what a comparison\nSo that we have top Democrats are urging caution on the blue wave to temper expectations new Fox a poll has come out top Democrats now they're spending their time managing expectations about ... the blue wave and sweeping the party into power on Capitol Hill\nUrging caution about those predictions amid fresh times at the midterms are much closer than anticipated Democratic National committee chair Tom Perez still hasn't condemn Keith Ellison\nSaid today that he doesn't use the term blue wave to talk about a possible victory for the party even though house minority leader Nancy Pelosi who has her eyes on the speaker's gavel said just days earlier that we're looking at a democratic tsunami\nLook I Can't look I don't have a crystal ball I all I Know is winning everything is possible\nI can see a scenario where Rick Scott wins in Florida Ron dissenters becomes the governor Marsha Blackburn wins in Tennessee Martha Black ... Marshall mixed Martha ... Sally wins in Arizona\nWhere we have Dean Heller hold this seat in Nevada which is tough that's a tough state tough race a lot of money being poured against him\nWhere I can see Claire McCaskill getting the exit sign Jon Tester getting the exit sign and Heidi Heitkamp saying goodbye and even Joe Donnelly problem for the Republican Braun in the state of Indiana is well in his particular case she's got a libertarian in the race\nAnd that means that the libertarian siphoning votes away from the Republican broad\nMike Braun is now claiming that you know a Brett Kavanaugh search citing internal polling is now as a leading will see in Fifteen days\nYou know if you look at all of this an app to all of this this is an opportunity one bit of anecdotal evidence we have you know they say voter enthusiasm for the Democrats is that an all time high but you know crazy uncle Joe Biden was at a rally in Vegas on Saturday in an attempt to boost\nDemocratic Senate candidates poured into the a P he drew a pathetic five hundred people\nA hundred and thirty thousand people have signed up they want to go see the Trump cruise rally tonight\nMean amazing I was down in Houston in Beaumont, Texas this weekend and and doing a a town hall with Ted Cruz and then we had four thousand people around there a moment at a huge crowd in Houston as well\nWe're doing better than crazy uncle Joe Bernie Sanders is warning his party that there's no blue wave coming and he also says that you can't win elections by alienating half the population and I hate to say it but I agree with Bernie you're absolutely right\nAnd you've got to force the hypocrisy so we got\nThe cabin on your shoe you got the caravan coming you got more mobs over the weekend in front of me and and showing nothing but mean spirited hostility to people that are trying to serve their country you've got now two years of magnificent success record breaking jobs and opportunities for Americans\nWhere you have more safety and security are stronger president versus eight years of failure so we have a choice in this election\nAnd I like choice elections you want to go back to the failed policies of Obama ... do you want to

S. B. twenty four\nHour usa breaking news from what you asked me twenty four hour news that the breaking\nNews is from within that county where a middle school teacher has been stab this was tricking middle school and the principal sent a note to parents explaining what has happened a student is in custody after stabbing a teacher during a class that happened in an eighth grade\nLanguage arts classroom the shooter was caught immediately the principal says Ryan queen all of the students are saved the teacher was taken to the hospital\nBut was conscious and talking to the emergency responders the school was on lockdown for a time ban has since been lifted the simple just coming in and we'll have more as we get it\nAlso from going out to the big story the search wet accused cop killer has ended with the suspect being shot to death by the police\nDanger to the community is over when\nPolice chief ... says two of his officers found Eighteen year old so far in Maynard in a shed behind a house off he would road when he threatened them with the law and more blade one officer opened fire killing him it's the ending to a nearly forty eight hour Mannheim\nWas on the pending list until she turned Eighteen just a few days ago because in Georgia you can register to vote\nWhen you're Seventeen and a half but when you return Eighteen you automatically go to an active status that's how the process works\nUh you know people there are other people to use the fake address with a street name only know street number no street tight\nUm that that failed to match the U. S. cents a day to a data that's out there we've got over three thousand people that are on the pending list because of their citizenship could not be verified in this state law that we verify people's citizenship before we registering to vote just like do you do when you get your Georgia driver's license\nThere is also over five fifty eight hundred people that are pending but they match another active are inactive vote or in the database main meaning that person got flagged could you could have a a double you know someone registering or being on the rolls twice it's supposed to catch those kind of things and you wanted to do that\nOkay so let me let me just stop you there is reviewing these numbers so nine thousand two hundred twenty four pending because they're Seventeen and a half years older so you can register to vote and then you become active two thousand nine hundred thirty five have a fake address\nThree thousand three hundred Ninety three are pending because we couldn't verify citizenship which were required to do five thousand eight hundred and forty two are pending because they match someone who's already registered to vote\nAnd so you're left with roughly forty six thousand on the pending file\nAnd now my understanding from people in the secretaries of state secretary says officers that Seventy five percent on the list or on the list because their Social Security number doesn't match\nThat's exactly right so so that is a that is a federal process a federal process that was pre cleared to check you know do the citizenship verification it\nWas pre cleared by the Obama Justice department when Eric Holder was the attorney general\nSo they are blaming me for a process that was approved under President Obama which is outrageous that that they're even talking about this and you don't want to register people if they are so she was the last for their social doesn't match up because what happens if you know it's not and then what happens if they're using\nYou know a number that they don't know who's it is\nBut you can always register without using your says so by simply using online voter registration system are are registering at your county elections office with your Georgia\nOr id that you can get if you don't want her driver's license or your Georgia driver's license but these individuals elected not to do that and therefore they have a problem and that's why they're pending in the system so\nNow the one of the the Associated Press mentioned the lady I uh ... noon you as a as one of their voters who were\nOn the pending file and uh the Associated Press says that she was flag to because of the hyphen between her name was but um I understand from talking to folks in your offices that she actually is an active voter unlike what the Associated Press reported\nSee is so what we found was was she was in the system or as an active voter she re registered for whatever reason um you know maybe she didn't think she was on the rolls maybe she wanted to see if she would get registered of again tested in the system\nYou know who who knows what happened here the basically when she re registered she misspelled her own name so it did not match the name and the current system or the name you know on her verification documents therefore she was flagged in the pending system\nAnd that is the individual did they're calling me a voter suppressor over and I I just hope that people have this great state would realize that you know they are not being told the truth there there'll be in line to a it was done two years ago before the presidential election the same type manned us it was done in two thousand and fourteen\nBy the New Georgia project they're very this Stacey Abrams set up\nYou remember they had the Prescott rice with boxes of vows eighty four thousand people\nAre on the list than we won when they took this to court on all tent camps because it was outrageous I mean one of the person's\nEric and I know that you and I both would love that this person registered in Georgia but one of the pending a applications is is Jesus Christ of heaven street [laughter]\nYou know we can't we can't register\nNow ... that's in the north Georgia mountains from what they tell me up in the blue ridge area well outside of the garage [laughter] God fearing people up there yeah so now it looks back up because you mentioned the New Georgia project which was a nonprofit Stacey Abrams started to register people to vote and\n... ... from what I'm hearing you say a number of the people who were flag because of Social Security numbers don't match actually came from this group\nI think like fourteen percent of the people that are still being held over from two thousand and fourteen so that like this is some new\nYou know breaking news story I mean these are people that the New Georgia project signed up in two thousand fourteen they never came in to correct their\nUm their form of taught the
