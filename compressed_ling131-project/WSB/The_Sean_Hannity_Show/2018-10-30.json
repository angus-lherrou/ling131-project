to fifty six year old Cesar ... who was in court today\nTo make it to the southern border the United states and the president and the secretary of homeland security of made it perfectly clear the vice president made it perfectly clear that that's not going to be allowed to happen and we're a nation of laws to turn around\nThat to do with the right way to do with the legal way and in spite of that the marchers keep coming although the president of Mexico did make an offer for some of the migrants if they wanted would be given\nSpecial consideration to work in southern Mexico a but not many takers apparently according to what I read this weekend you know a lot of people have been asking well okay how did they get so organized to organize them\nAnd who's financing all of this\nUm there's been a lot of conspiracy theories that I've never believed that the only one that made any end it's not a conspiracy I'd I'd when the vice president said last week\nThat he felt that some of the leadership\nIn Honduras was responsible for promoting the caravan and some countries are from South America Venezuela particular we're we're helping a finance some of this that's the only\nBit of information that I found that was somewhat viable as a potential truth um anyway Sam Faddis is with us Sam Faddis he's a senior partner uh and former CIA operative with Thirty years of experience in conducting intelligence operations in the middle east South Asia Europe\nAnd he's worked against the most dangerous of terrorist organizations the planet has ever seen has extensive first hand experience with their methodology and tactics and a welcome to the program so glad you're with us thanks for serving your country\nThank you for having me pleasure\nWhat so you're you wrote a column and night but I haven't read the whole column here but what if my read a bit is as you think that the vice president was probably right on the mark\nWithout question what on the mark I mean there's actually there's actually a great mystery here I mean the guy's been organized this or folks somebody party called ... which is a Honduran Marxist Party\nA number of years ago supportive of of of the president who basically tried to overthrow the constitution and making ... a life\nThere and done with the Venezuelan and laid out in front of God and everybody all over the Internet there will and organizing a posting videos pictures from the mark\nSo again no great great mystery this is the work of guys allied with Venezuela Marxist and it is in effect a giant covert action campaign designed to make the American\nGovernment ... bad in our allies look that\nI may look America doesn't have much of a of a choice and and this has to be obvious to people ... and I'm listening and watching the comments and some people sort of associating this with ... with anti immigrant sentiment or dino phobia or whatever the the charges it's not true\nAll conservatives are saying we don't care where immigrants come from the president talked about a border wall with a big door and that people should respect our laws are constitutional republic\nAmerican sovereignty and come in and if you want to come in we just need to check out make sure that you don't come here with radical ideas and that you have the ability to sustain yourself\nAnd don't need our help and then we can let you in and you could become a part of our family to the extent that you want to go through the process of maybe become a citizen I don't think that's too much to ask that's called the legal wet\nIt without question this doesn't have anything to do with a with a necessity but not anything to do with race this is yeah we're a nation of immigrants were also with nation of laws and according to legal immigration procedures period which don't simply get to walk across the border I have always wondered\nBy the way those books that are actively don't want to control the border why is it that only people who can walk here should be allowed to get him just out of stuff if that's the principal\nWell what I'm married I was I don't want anybody to get hurt because America the president means what he said and if people rush across our border beat at a port of entry or along the border that has not fenced\nIn our military is on the border the military is going to be given the order to stop them now we don't want anybody hurt I don't want and I'm assuming Ninety nine point eight percent of the people coming here\nAre coming here because they come from impoverished countries and they want a better life for themselves and their family that's my guess\nBut nobody can vouch for every single person in that caravan\nAnd for the sake and safety of the American people we can't let that number of people rush across the border have no vetting of the people and sadly maybe amongst the fourteen thousand there's one or five people that come here with intentions to bring us harm\nI agree ... percent we don't want to be hurt and also it it was undoubtedly true that most of these people are simply being utilized by folks hostile to the U.S stuff on the probably been lied to I'm again I'm told that when they get to the border will be allowed to cross\nOn so they are being put in the in the middle of this I'm simply used as human shields on on a harder on the behalf of folks hostile to the United states that is a horrible tragedy because these are mostly just average people being used\nNow look I Will tell you that you know what I really feel sorry for people I'd taken the time I think more than any other person and media in this country\nAnd I've been down to the border Thirteen times and horseback all terrain vehicle boats helicopters I've been there I've seen gang members arrested I've seen drug warehouses I've seen tunnels built um I've I've been on the border spot one place in particular did have a wall and fencing and I can look across the fence\nAnd on the other side of Mexico I saw nothing but poverty\nI saw ... what we would almost describe homes built surrounding will look like what we would describe as a junk yard even and then on the other side of the fence or you know million dollar half million dollar homes in San Diego\nAnd if I'm On that one side and all I see is poverty and and and ... I think I'd want to look across to the other side and I want to go over there is things looked dramatically different and better over here and I don't think Americans you know there were very open people\nBut we can't take in the world's population and we have to have the ability to control our borders and what we're asking is that people do it the right way\nAnd it really just keeps you know what's in our circular argument it's just what we have to do for our own safety\nIt without question of what you've just described is most of the world all of sub Saharan Africa most of South Asia most of Latin America is the argument here on the people who will control the border\nThat we are supposed to allow me to ... billion people move here because that is what you are actually talking about if you're going to carry this to its ultimate logical conclusion obviously cannot do that we have to maintain control of\nYeah All right we'll really really appreciate it Sam thank you eight hundred nine for one Sean is our number you want to be a part of the program and we got to take a break up right so the biggest part of off year elections mid term elections or turn out that means you showing up\nAnd this election that we have coming up well it's the most important we have seen in decades why because your savings your tax savings that's on the ballot the American economy he's on the ballot America's comeback is on the ballot your jobs are on the ballot your kids' future is on the ballot your wages your four oh one case that is also on the ballot\nAnd if you're a small business owner your tax cuts are on the ballot\nAnd here's the biggest issue on the ballot who is in charge of America's future politicians bureaucrats the socialist Cindy seat or you you want to preserve the victories of the past two years\nOld get involved this election this November and go to big choice election dot com big choice election dot com\nThey're going to make it simple for you to do your part now you can mail make calls and emails tax knock on doors help neighbors get to the polls go to a big choice election dot com because the only way we lose this year is if you don't show up\nIf you don't turn out go to big choice election dot com do your part and let's not get out worked in November big choice election dot com will come back for your phone call straight ahead eight hundred nine four one Sean toll free telephone number\nRight here to get out of a media man room\nDo it [noise] is Sean\nHannity show [noise]\nHe was Ninety five five AM seven fifty [noise] don't you ask me\nWhen I sang team who re carrier WSBIU twenty four hour traffic center and Sandy Springs on the on the road or do any by these bounds you still have to be a part of that has been in the cleanup stages blocking right land so far north side Dr Howard Stern wrote exit\nTwenty two also still dealing with the authorities when when that kind of dealing with the downed power lines and pull on riverside park way that is blocked at McHenry church road causing reruns route highway one twenty and highway three Seventeen this report you bike angles\nWhy shopping angles false a savings of course and this week you could pick up Tyson boneless skinless chicken breast just to ... to ... and her she stuck sized candy to for six dollars happy Halloween from angles Steve winds low W.

look at real clear politics they have they have narrow this down to five races that they believe will be the tipping point it's actually thirty races kind of like what we have but\nThey they have a five seat race they've got the Republicans locked in a two hundred seats they got the Democrats locked into two hundred and five seats\nAnd the remaining seats are up for grabs in other words they are toss ups in other words if we win the seats and that means that Republicans will retain the house control of the house of representatives now that would be the super when that you want to go for the Senate is looking better but don't take anything for granted I think will have pick ups\nAnd the whole Tennessee with Marsha Blackburn I think we can beat Claire McCaskill Heidi Heitkamp I think Joe Donnelly can be beaten these down in the polls I Believe that Christians to send them out can be beaten as well how she was up at three in the latest poll is beyond any imagination I have\nA poll has a dead heat exactly even tie forty six all Nelson versus Rick Scott who's been a phenomenal governor for the great state of Florida Rhonda Santas is coming back interesting John James Michigan is cut his\nThe latest stat but now in half\nAnd it's only a six point race in Michigan where it was one twenty and so he's doing very well a lot of eyes are paying attention to the latest poll of West Virginia where mentioned is down by two\nIn New Jersey Menendez is only up by three and seeing is very weak and could be the big surprise of the night both West Virginia and New Jersey to states to watch for potential surprise is not likely but potential uh one of the house races that are on our top thirty\nIs Marty a no Stein is a gold medal is currently serves as the chairman of the board of

where you are you're one of the thirty that will tip the balance of power how's it going there\nAnd I'll say this shot first off thank you for having me on the show out campaigning hard every single day eating every corner of this district and I got to tell you there's a lot of motivation out there right now I think people are starting to pay attention they understand what's at stake and they went to feed the Democrats in November six\nWell look the issue to me are simple but we have is we know what the Democrats agenda is to impeach trumpet don't say it open borders sanctuary cities sanctuary states but don't say it keep Obamacare but don't say that either just say work for great health care for all and make it sound wonderful just like\nYou know keep your doctor your plan and pay less that's their agenda and they want their clothes back\nBeyond that it's let's hide and not tell people what we really stand for because when we do we know we lose which is why all these we have now another Senate candidate will be exposing tonight\nWe've got reticent in Tennessee we've got Claire McCaskill we've got Heidi Heitkamp\nWill unveil another senator tonight all caught on tape all three campaigns saying that they purposely running as moderates but they plan to govern as liberals and their offices are laughing and the case of Tennessee you got reticence that calling the people in Tennessee ignorant so is your opponent out there saying what they're really going to run on what they believe in\nGod I absolutely not you know she's running as somebody she's not at the end of the day are Democrats think everybody hates Trump like they do [noise] you know and to me they're completely out of touch they can't see past are angry at least Sean and let's not forget don't forget election night two thousand sixteen when the media had two snares out there\nOne of the best the best case of Hitler and wanting the worst case of Trump won and yet Donald Trump still wants\nNow we have a president wherever the president is has a record Hillary's true colors of come out contrast that the two thousand eight where it was best case Obama and then look what happened to two thousand ten can midterm stink about that the voters corrected their mistake Obama last sixty three house seats and what's there to correct now\nWhat part of the Trump success story to the voters want to change give it a crime\nIn fact increase the regulator watched jobs go back overseas see now that's that's a difference my opponent goes and talked about that they're hiding behind a bunch of smoke and mirrors and not running for really are but I think the ... the voters are a lot smarter than that right now and we're going to some some people in November six\nI noticed that former New York city Mayor Bloomberg is you know putting tens of millions of dollars apparently into a lot of these house races are you seeing the effects of his money and others\nI'm not seeing Bloomberg's

developing stories here first\nPolice activity downtown Atlanta this is a long peach tree street north east they have evacuated part of the peach tree center mall as a precaution swat and other law enforcers are and round and we're told this is the getting the constant traffic difficulties in that area as well but trouble\nWe learn from the international Center for everything else St John Campbell I'm\nSixty two degrees of peach tree street at three oh one double USB meteorologist ... with an early look at Halloween and the heads up about a likely stormy Thursday particularly Thursday Afternoon and he's got Atlanta's most accurate dependable forecast coming\nEvery ... every one of you listening to my vote I don't care if you think your congressmen a safe or not you'd better get out and vote\nBecause otherwise if you don't vote that's pretty much a vote for Nancy Pelosi and if you have a Senate race going on in your state that's vote for Chuck Schumer\nThe second potential outcome is a split decision\nSplit decision would be Republicans hang on to the Senate\nGate a couple seats and Nancy Pelosi them become speaker and Maxine Waters is a chairwoman Adam Schiff is a chairwoman and let's say Gerald ... chairman Elijah Cummings the chairman and it's endless investigations\nInto one of the most unbelievable things that we're watching unfold here\nIs what we got this desperation factor of the Democrats I mean even when I think anyone I warn you\nOf what they do every two and four years racist or sexist besides your nose Xena phobic Islamic phobic homophobic you know dirty air dirty water kill children pro granny over the cliff just when you think it can't get worse it gets worse\nThe echo chamber if you've ever doubted ever doubted who the media in this country has pulling for just just watch any so called cable news channel besides Fox\nFor thirty seconds because it's every second every minute of every day hate Trump destroy Trump help the Democrats and if it means falsely accusing the president of being responsible\nFor the synagogue shooting over the weekend and not even tell the people there viewers that well the shooter this got mad man power hated Trump because of Trump being so allied and good partners with our closest ally Israel\nAnd the same people you know St Trump cause this Trump's responsible for this you know it's a it's it's a sense of madness but it also does show\nA desperation that has now kicked in for the Democratic party they are desperate\nYou know one thing I I think I'm going to talk about polls a little bit in the course of the program today but I'm also on the other hand seems like I'm Talking to both sides of my face I'm really not\nI'm I'm gonna tell you to just ignore the polls at this point doesn't matter you still have a job to do and if you want to keep the progress that we've had you want to prevent hearing the night of one week from tonight and one\nDay after one week from tomorrow when we talk about the results if you don't want to hear the words speaker elect Pelosi Senate majority elects sure then you're going to have to do something about it the worst case scenario is they can win at all and the only way that's going to happen is if you stay home\nThat the reason I'll tell you not to pay attention to the polls is because they get it wrong so often\nJust two years ago the exit polls showed that Trump lost Florida he won it last North Carolina he won it that he had lost Ohio he won Ohio that he lost Pennsylvania He won Pennsylvania that he lost Michigan Wisconsin anyone both of them\nAnd the media nobody there were candy because they read these results as I was on the air at five Fifteen I had it before everybody else\nI remember my first break at at the about twenty after the hour I called then candidate Donald Trump and I said somebody's going to come in in about a minute with bad news and tell you that you lost everything don't believe it\nI said I don't believe these polls I said there's no way these polls are accurate\nAnd he goes why do you believe that and then I told them the story about two thousand and four\nWhere the median again the polls came back and George Bush and Dick Cheney and lost Florida Ohio Pennsylvania and it was over\nAnd Dick Cheney called the radio program this radio program at you know on election day two thousand and four or five thirty five and reminded people they still had time to vote because he read the same information that I just read that John Kerry was going to be the next president\nYou know if you go back in you know other polls where they've been wrong twenty four team you know let's go back with the election one week away it's coming down to the wire conventional wisdom is Republicans will pick up a few seats in the house or in the Senate but lose the house by a painfully slim margin\nOne of the reasons is look if you look at real clear politics that's based on polling polling is not totally inaccurate information there's some things you can glean from polling that are\nAnecdotal maybe the way to put it helpful in other ways right now real clear politics has the Democrats are two hundred and five seats locked solid or leaning Democrat and it has leaning Republican lock solid Republican two hundred that's a five seat difference but\nBecause Republicans have the majority\nOf ah right now that means that they have more seats they have to defend is like thirty seats that they call toss ups that can swing one way or the other we've identified these we put them up on Hannity dot com you can check it out for yourself\nAnd the only thing that can make a difference is if you want the progress of the last two years to continue\nYou get to decide how you're gonna feel a week from tonight I mean when the when you watch go back to the media in twenty sixteen this five Fifteen they were getting\nWell it's pretty clear Hillary I think is going to bring the next president Frank Luntz was reporting from Times Square at six Fifteen and I'm watching him it's over Trump lost it ain't happening turned out not to be true turned out the polls were wrong and I'm not criticizing Frank he was reading the polling data\nI read the same data\nSo if you don't have the sense of urgency I don't know what I can say or do to give it to you but the media is all in on helping the Democrats get back the house and the Senate and they're doing everything within their power to make that happen\nBecause they've handed Trump since the day walk down the escalator with millennia\nI think it's worth noting now that conventional wisdom does not exactly have a stellar track record this is where I urge you to be cautious about the polls and don't let the polls influence your motivation here\nBut there's not only are they wrong and twenty sixteen they also wrong in two thousand and four they were way off in the last midterm election member Republicans have been set up because Ted Cruz's fellow buster oh we're going to get cleaned out in the Senate that didn't happen\nOne year before the twenty fourteen midterms the media insisted the GOP hopes to recapture the Senate were dead on arrival that goes in October Ted Cruz had filibustered Obamacare and shut the government down for sixteen days good for him makes me like Ted Cruz more\nExperts such a short us a hundred percent certainty in twenty forty Republicans have got to pay huge price when the twenty four team midterms rolled around Thirteen months later the G O P not only won back the Senate they did it with a nine feet Senate landslide\nNow remembers the night went on in twenty sixteen media was kinda Getty but then that getting this began to give away to a little bit of a little bit of nervousness I think we got it still but ah yeah to get a little tighter than we thought isn't it\nAnd then I turned into what all out melt down depression collectively by the media and they couldn't believe it because you we the people shocked the world all that but an old for it's happened in fourteen and it happened in sixteen don't resent it can't happen in a tea\nYou should do it for no other reason because you want to keep America on the great growth growth trajectory we're on and maybe for another reason to watch these idiots in the mainstream media these sanctimonious\nA self righteous they're not news people advocates that they are the extension of the Democratic party they're going to lose it\nIf the house remains in Republican hands and Republicans picked up a number of Senate seats they will lose it just like they did in twenty six the this is a this is all white latch CNN was reporting that night\nAnyway the so called experts saw the Republican landslide coming that none of them thought in twenty fourteen known very few of us saw that we could wait\nI'll give you the let's go to twenty fourteen final Wall Street journal NBC News survey before balloting and twenty fourteen had\nForty six percent of likely voters favor Congress led by Republicans forty five prefer democratic control kind of similar where they are now the G O P claimed a similar one point advantage lead\nIn ten states where Senate races where the most competitive with a balance of power in the chamber would be decided those results suggest a narrower advantage for Republicans and and the latest mid term and you know still they claimed oh Republicans pick up nine seats that's a hell of a field goal\nThey were saying they might they might well twenty ten was kind of a two touchdown embarrassing loss for Democrats this is more Republicans went on a field goal\nOld they were wrong Pew Research was wrong I Know meanwhile over at five thirty eight Nate Silver was saying the poll showing Republicans retake in the Senate by a slim margin with oh they were wrong too\nReally the main road and I didn't belong from having to leave me alone I'm looking at the international

suspect now in custody ... a cop Elise also say ahead a rather earlier today\nAbout to other people a man and the woman were able to get out of a home before the standoff began this was back around nine thirty or so they alerted police to what was happening in the home that there was a hostage situation going on earlier we heard from a neighbor on the scene in that neighborhood\nAbsolute chaos nobody can get through anything locking insurance right and left um they've got people trying to get out and ... head and\nThat was the scene earlier today around our coast driving Cobb County in Marietta again the deputy chief says that suspects in custody is a convicted felon about a hostage is safe and up and back out of the home live in the new center at betray gets WSBIU sixty\nThere were text messages release were that an FBI agent is a tax thing that the main lobby it's buddy of Andrew saying really appreciate mayor coming through I was\nArrested isn't that buying influence in corruption\nWell there is an ongoing investigation I mean that's the thing I think that um uh we don't know what's going to happen because this has been going on for quite some time they've been gathering a lot of evidence\nAndrew also the same lobbyists that arranged the New York John get paid for four nights a in a luxury Costa Rica villa for Andrew Gillum answered and pay a dime of that and then Andrew turned around and gave that lobby as a two million dollar contract to do a restaurant in the city of Tallahassee now we know in addition to that thousand dollar ticket\nThat the agent gave the Gillum the FBI agent also under wrote a forty three hundred dollar dinner for Andrews campaigned on twenty six team that was never reported which it needs to be and so the question is\nAnd you can't report that after the fact that just basically covering your tracks CYA so it only interested in a port\nIt at all the only reason we know about it\nIs because there's an ethics commission investigation of Gillum and and and a response to those subpoenas uh one of the lobbyist attorneys release that said the public so forty three hundred dollars and then at least a thousand dollars for Hamilton Andrew says he's not under investigation\nBut Sean you tell me what are their wreaths and what an undercover agent have to do those things if he wasn't investigating mayor Andrew Gillum\nWell let me ask you to two days ago\nIt was the political reported that apparently his running mate you know claimed that quote Jews nailed him to the cross and read the text message to you know apparently it's now out there\nMany you know people in in South Florida apparently are pretty angry at this remark and er which seems pretty anti Semitic to me as he's standing by those\nBut I think it's reprehensible Andrew Gillum picked this guy knowing that he had done that but here's the thing about Andrew Gillum\nHe is aligned himself with some of the most anti Israel and the anti Semitic groups in Florida including this radical group called the dream defenders\nWhich is a leader and the boycott divest and sanctioned movement targeting Israel they actually say Israel's genocidal apartheid state and so that's one of Andrew strongest supporters Andrew to this day\nOpposes having our embassy in Jerusalem he opposes recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital\nAnd when a Israel fought back against the Moffett fats and may ah Gillum blamed Israelis do they just use those attacks as a pre tax\nIt'd be able to do a disproportionate response and\nWhat what is that really vendors organization that he won't disavow\nThey're one of the most radical organizations in Florida ah they they believe that the police and prisons have no place injustice and that the police needs to be funded they pay they say the U.S is the biggest bully in the history of the world that our military needs to be caught\nThey if they favor or replacing what they consider disaster capitalism is their words with socialists principles that are so radical make Nicolas Maduro flush so he signed their candidate alleged gang that he would support a this radical manifest so that's just who he is he believes in what they're doing\nIs endorsed them personally and uh it would\nLose a tape of him I guess that was discovered in June and saying that he's pleased I'm proud to sneak food to dream defender activists during a thirty days sleeping protested the Florida State Capitol\nReferring to the twenty Thirteen month long anti gun protest or after the Trayvon Martin George Zimmerman case and I hope you keep at it and he supported them but you're saying that there are radical group\nWithout question I mean they they are anti law enforcement they're anti free enterprise there in the military um they're anti Israel uh I don't know I mean like that may be a group you would want to be aligned with if you are running for the mayor of the Gaza Strip but not for governor of Florida\nWow well let's go over a little bit of his his background and the proposals that he's making because I think it's fairly extreme a number one he was endorsed by Bernie Sanders that speaks volumes to me\nThere's a lot of outside money uh reports that he's getting money from left wing billionaires like George Soros the George Soros really spend one point two million in this race in Florida to help him\nOh yeah I'm probably much more than that at this point now\nHe says that he supports Medicare for all I Am a champion of treaty health care and as a right not a privilege so he wants what nationalized healthcare\n... the bill he supports what abolish I care and Medicare Advantage for seniors enforce them on a single payer\nGovernment planned it would eliminate everybody's employer based coverage and force them out of government single plan so we're really a fan the arrangements have millions and millions of ... that he thinks it's appropriate for government to take away health benefits that people are burned and to force them to be\nOn the single payer plan I think that'd be a disaster\nHe wants to raise the corporate tax rate forty percent of forty percent increase ... what's that going to what's the impact that's going to have on Florida businesses and Florida workers if the businesses pack up and leave\nWe will lose jobs we will lose business says and we're also I mean you know shock because everyone who works and high tax states\nThey're always thinking about relocating to Florida and we have a historic opportunity to really capitalize on that
