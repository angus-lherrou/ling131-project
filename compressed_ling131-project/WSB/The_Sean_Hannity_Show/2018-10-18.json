things that they're ceding most about\nBut what they're most hating right now is the fact that both Claire McCaskill and Phil Bredesen neither Senate candidates one of them as the United states senator had been forced to respond to these ... you know all over the local media coverage I mean it's it's it's critical mass in Tennessee in Missouri their their their local TV stations are calling me\nAnd the D.C journals do not want to talk about this in fact I just got to have like a Washington Post he's tweeting at me and he's and he's saying well you know she's been public about somebody's

sense of moderation that has no agenda that they're willing to talk about that ... that is a really scary\nScenario for the country and for people that ... that's the only way they can win is ally ... who they are\nThat's what the stories about these red state Democrats have been on your show now this is the fourth or third third video between Tennessee in in Missouri and one of the staffers agrees McCaskill quote essentially has to lie to get elected and this is not just one staffer\nThese are staffers throughout her office hiding hiding and masking the source of contributions one staffer says it's acting beautiful it's great when it works for us not against us\nTo take the money ... indirect means in order to I guess appealed to moderates as a front page New York times story today about how these\nPro life pro gun Democrats were shrinking\nConstituency in Missouri the Democratic party have voted these people out McCaskill still have to appear moderate so that she can get elected so it's it is a truism that in order to get elected in a state of Missouri are kind of see you basically have to mislead voters to get elected as a Democrat and that's what these stories and cover\nYou know the thing is to me um I think we the American people had it when\nThe Democratic party a band in any sense of due process under the law equal application under our laws you know immediately I Believe her but they also said the minute Kavanaugh was announced we are going to oppose them any way by any means necessary\nAnd then when all the the the allegations are getting more severe more severe and everyone's saying well I Believe her not even want to hear from judge Kavanaugh presumption of innocence at all and when corroborating so-called corroborating stories fell apart they still didn't care\nAnd I think the American people are watching that we have a story out today where you got these ... middle class of vendors attacking to Minnesota GOP candidates are assaulted one is a woman\nA name a state representative Sarah Anderson punched by an anarchist EPA trying to stop him from kicking her campaign side\nI mean this this is now the Democratic party and you're exposing it

Claire McCaskill issued a videotape state which is unbelievable and they play a little bit on your show last night and she said that number quoted she says well starting with Josh Hawley us to her opponent would be part of ... billion betting someone in my campaign first of all I categorically unequivocally deny\nThat he does not work for me he does not work with me I've never spoken to any of these candidates I stay away from candidates I investigate candidates but she just went on TV Sean Claire McCaskill just falsely stated that Josh was involved in is the attorney general Missouri was involved in this and then she says three times I committed fraud\nWill will walk by what recording the people being honest that's brought\nIn their own were their own their own are it's not\nMy words I'm not the one who said quote get over it this is a direct quote for staffers next a roast about how she's going to impeach Trump that you can tell the moderates to get over it after she gets elected that's their words and she's calling me a fraud stir for telling the truth to the American people it's the job of investigative reporting\nTo expose the truth\nAnd and I think she didn't have to respond to her response because it's filled with lies and innuendo an accusation\nI'm just glad that you were able to get\nAll of this out than before the election um why do I suspect that there's probably going to be more tape other candidates well I have known you now what for a decade or more\n[laughter] that's right yeah I mean ... you know am I Am oh a pun intended Missouri now you know my

Seventy five ... county today Georgia State patrol\nSays the Kabul was pulled over by a trooper in Carter's elected to Ninety three that trooper\nFound illegal contraband inside the car the female was put under arrest the male passengers and gave a false name then handcuffed behind his back at some point from there he was able to get a gun from inside his parents\nIn this country the single worst vomit care what the problem is if you like your doctor keep your doctor your like your plan keep your blame you you you get paid less\nAnd it never worked out that way for anybody and frankly Republicans this was their moment and look we got rid of the individual mandate\nIn Nineteen days we can create a system of health care second to nobody in the world that's why for seven years I have harassed and bothered port Josh ...\nAtlas MD Wichita, Kansas not only do I put them on radio and TV oh no that's not enough I set up meetings with him he flies to Washington on his own that we should pay him\nYou know well then I'll probably get accused of something if I offer to pay for something\nI'm been oh we should put the effort fifty dollars a month on limited concierge care he did go sheets ... directly with pharmaceuticals and Ninety five percent reduction you you need chemotherapy got breast cancer well for a lot of those drugs it's six dollars that treatment\nGood luck getting those prices anywhere we couldn't institutionalized this\nAnyway so there's ... there's not running on what they believe we've learned that with Brett a sin in Tennessee thanks to project Vera toss we've learned it with Claire McCaskill caught on undercover videos ... outrageous we needed investigation investigation to what\nThe fact that you and your own words are saying to the people in Missouri I'm a liar I Am a fake phony fraud I Am a I'm just a pony\nI'm a liar I'm saying whatever I Need to pay to get elected I don't mean any of it my job is to bamboozled the people of Missouri lie to them then go to Washington and I'm going to govern just like Iraq Obama\nThey can't win if they define who they really are\nThey can't win if they give us their true agenda they can't win if they say yeah we really want to impeach Trump impeach forty five and Pete forty five and Pete forty five are claiming my timer claiming my time they tell Maxine Waters don't say well I I don't want to talk about\nIt just don't say if they tell her and she says they tell me not to say it but I'm going to keep saying in any way\nSo their gender is impeachment and lists never ending investigations\nOpen borders eliminate ice sanctuary city now we have a sanctuary state California\nThey want ... why do they want to open borders through they calculated that is going to benefit them at the ballot box helping them retain power notice every decision and every agenda item is about them wanting to hold onto power period\nIt doesn't matter the output uh the the what the end result is doesn't matter Obama wrecked the economy I won't give you the statistics again if you listen to this program regularly I Know you can recite them by rote as well the only reason I say it so often is that so everybody nobody can say they didn't know\nBut that's what they want to take us back to that but they want their crumbs back they want they want to destroy Trump they're driven by a borderline like tonic hatred of this president\nThey want to go back to what back to Obamacare they want open borders so that they think that their their party will remain in power forever if they get enough people crossing the border caravans of people\nAre going to talk about what the president's planning and it's like that's what they stand for\nThis is what the Democratic Party take back the crumbs keep Obamacare open borders impeach Trump endless investigation what name one thing they're that they're doing to make your life better\nBecause after losing Thirteen million Americans and and having them have to go through food stamps to survive and sustain themselves in eight years of failed the comedy of Obama the only president never to reach three percent GDP Growth in American history\nYou know they want to what we don't want to add more people why 'cause they're dependent on them\nThe crumbs they're handing out the irony of that there but what what did the leftovers they have\nYou know when they're done building their gyms their Senate gyms their house Kim's there you know house barber shops there Senate barber shops the Senate dining rooms their house dining rooms or they treat themselves while they're not they're not on Obamacare they got to separate out system just for them very different\n[noise] so that's what's at stake you know I'm going to tell you something about this border as I watch this care of it\nYou got to understand this is a about national security this is personal security\nI think I'm the only person in the media that actually took the time over the years and I've been down reporting from the border Thirteen times side Hannity you've told us that before yeah I've been on horseback yeah Ben and helicopters yeah been out on boats yeah I've been on foot\nI've been all terrain vehicles I've been on the border all the way from the Rio Grande straight on through San Diego in many stops in between\nI've seen gang members arrested drug warehouse the biggest warehouse I've ever seen in my life floor to ceiling drugs confiscated his where they were headed\nTo Yorktown your city to your kids that they ingest them and now it's worse than ever\nBut there's now a lot of the heroin that we have we have an opioid crisis in this country\nIs is one the one issue is oh kids go into grandma grandpa was medicine cabinet\nThey try a bike and then a perk you said anoxic ... and then they go back they got another one next thing you know they're addicted next thing you know they're buying them on the streets God Knows what those pills really are the drug dealers don't give a rip it these kids die\nThen when they find out they can't afford eighty bucks the pill well then some genius idiot friend or dealer friend quote of there's\nThere's one you try heroin does much better high on the lowly ten dollars a bag and they'll start snorting heroin or chasing the dragon as they call it and they light up in smoke it and then eventually you're going to be main lining it and then guess what they're on a trajectory straight into the grave\nAnd a life of a living hell and that's the opioid crisis and wears a lot of those drugs coming from right over the border where it's human trafficking happening right over the border what's happening all across the border there's a new thing it's called ... and all\nYou know talk to my buddy Eric bowling his Nineteen year old son bought an ...\nWhich is you know to relieve anxiety\nAnd and and it was laced if you have three grains of fat and all the size of three grain of salt\nIt will kill you and we have nearly a hundred thousand kids dying every single day one death every seven point five minutes\nYou know almost a hundred thousand deaths a year and we keep talking about opioid crisis left and right opioid we can stop it if we secure the border\nCaravans now so I think it's right I think Kavanaugh what do we see what's happening all\nThe total total elimination of anything that we recognize as the U.S constitution the rule of law equal justice under the law equal application of our laws or the presumption of innocence what presumption of innocence I Believe her never heard from a bribe believer\nYou know they know corroborating evidence I don't believe her\nYou know but then ... no no no but but they were lined up almost on a weekend basis they wind up in the whole first they spike the punch bowl and after they fight the punch bowl the boys would line up in the hall every weekend and then they rape the girls in the room they take turns and it happened almost every weekend\nAnd then the story evolved into well I didn't see him spike the punch bowl but I saw a mirror punch bowl\nAnd I see I saw him give out a red solo cup\nThat's what that became\nSo and then Dianne Feinstein wants to bring that up again after eight FBI investigations\nWhat are they offering for you because since Trump spent president you got for a million new jobs since Trump's been president four hundred thousand manufacturing jobs jobs that Obama said would never coming back\nSince he's been president we've gotten rid of more regulations than the last five presidents a combined uh he's opened up the entire energy industry of which we have a wad\nLiterally of natural resources those are going to be career paying jobs high paying jobs for so many millions of Americans\nAre then we got oh the president the grading ISIS nobody thought little rocket man would stop shooting is rockets nobody thought that you know being tough on the Iranians would would bear fruit but the Iranians are dying economically because of the president leading a boycott\nAnd then on top of that what record low unemployment fourteen states African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans women in the workplace and youth unemployment\nWill do you want to end and the next Nineteen days what for what what what are they offering you that is better give me the better alternative\nBecause the eight years prior to Trump really sucked with the worst numbers were statistics the most embarrassing foreign policy right being dictators and ... that chant death to America\nFor years I'm encouraged you

I think it will get worse before it gets better 'cause I ain't going to keep losing and I think\nThat they they are so alienated from most Americans that all they have left is this kind of a new electric violence a which in the end I think turns people off it's it's it's it's it's also a little scary because this is Steve ... proved when he was shot um\nYou know if you're conservative and you're in public life there's a certain danger level now that is totally on American and that comes entirely from the left\nYou know the thing is that's missing and and you figure it out I mean I watch the whole process when you became speaker it didn't happen overnight it started with a series of videotapes about running to transform America and it was called renewing American civilization when did you first put those tapes out\nWe first began working on it in uh Ninety two and did the first wave of tapes in Ninety three and then the second wave after I was ...\nAnd it was all based on ideas Komen dating in a contract with America and I I think people forget because\nYou know we've had waves of conservatism maybe if you want to start with Gary Barry Goldwater that's one it wasn't successful but it was the beginning Reagan's victory in Nineteen eighty and then subsequently in eighty four that was another big victory and and obviously the Republicans taken over Congress for the first time in forty years with your contract and I'd argue Donald Trump is the fourth leg\nAnd that is a everything he is doing in terms of governance is conservative even even threatened trade wars they're not\nThey're not materialized because that's never been as a pension his intention to for better trade deals for your theory deals\nYeah I think look I I think he is the fourth\nOh cycle if you will of moving back from a left wing America and we've been gaining momentum and gaining clarity and it's often tell people you know we didn't have Leonard Leo and the federal society\nWith so many good solid conservative lawyers that we could fill up all these judicial appointments uh and that that's just a huge advantage and they're all grows out of what is now if you go back to Goldwater of fifty four year movement um but I think it's also coming to a crisis because\nTrump so clearly articulated each a pro American\nPro work ethic pro patriotism policy but he drives the left crazy\nAnd I think as a result the left which has gotten more extreme they haven't modulated they haven't come back to the center they've decided that their job is to beat up and intimidate those of us who disagree with him and and the and I think are just further isolate from\nSo their agenda is pretty clear that get back the house they want him peach meant they want the crumbs back the largest tax cutting history which is obviously having a big impact on the economy we you know all the record unemployment numbers the varying demographic groups that are doing better than they've ever done\nUm they also want open borders but John Podesta said don't talk about immigration they want to eliminate ice they want to keep Obamacare\nI'm an endless investigation I Would add to that I don't hear one positive thing that's going to create one job or make this country one bit safer not nothing that they're running on just that and we hate Trump that's it\nWell I think that's right and it's partly because if they tried to tell us honestly what they stand for there will be defeated so badly that they just they know that they can't afford to be honest but but I think I mentioned the send your TV show last night I think that we're about to be a magic moment\nIn American history I think the two words that captured in my mind or Kevin all and caravan I think Kevin all the way they treated him of the viciousness smears\nThe character assassination to childish behavior by US Senators incentive meetings I think all that came together to really re galvanized conservative and I think this caravan coming up from Guatemala should be a major focus of Republicans for the next couple of weeks\nBecause it makes clear the argument about whether or not we have a right to be a sovereign country or whether in the Feinstein pillow see San Francisco Democrat tradition we have an obligation to open up a quarter to anybody\nWho can get finance and remember these three thousand people I agree with Laura Ingraham is asking the question who's paying for this these because when people probably cost Twenty one million dollars to move\nGuatemala actually four thousand people now grown too amid a spike among a U.S border crossings but you know Nancy Pelosi actually said we are not funding the border wall\nAnd that just as it seems to be an appendage that Donald Trump manhood I mean you know imagine anything similar said about any woman by any Republican or conservative\nI mean it's outrageous the double standard and then so flagrant but\nYou know we're we're already have paid between healthcare education criminal justice we've already paid trillions of dollars for people that didn't respect our laws and sovereign states costs the American people a fortune and by the way the people of California and now we're going to be paid\n\nTwenty four hour news weather and\nFive and I am\n\nNow for thirty good afternoon I'm ...
