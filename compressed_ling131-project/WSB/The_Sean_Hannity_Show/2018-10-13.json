I think without a doubt by the way one of the things you got a notice this week you know just a marker and went down its up a little today but went down in the past couple of days and it was triggered by interest rates stuff but in the meantime I had some analysts telling me\nThey're afraid of the Democrats taking the house of representatives and they would want to raise taxes again they would stop Trump from doing all the good things that he's done on regulations of businesses with the economy and they would want to raise taxes again\nAnd that would cost jobs that was slow down the American economy and you've got an economy now that's really growing at about four percent higher than any of the expectations\nAnd what they're really afraid of is that Nancy Pelosi could become speaker again I can agree with you showing that the Republicans are going to pick up Senate seats in the Senate seats looking really good because of what happened\nWith the backlash of about the whole cabinet are hearing it how unfair it was and you could see we had a poll this this week where I'm McCaskill was losing to Hawley the Republicans for the U.S Senate\nAnd the way that I also Joe Donnelly is now down write and write and Heidi Heitkamp is finished she's down by double digits\nWe have polls there because of the the energy sector is so important to the state that you're\nThat you're seeing these these polls um you know people want shops\nAnd what Gary is in the last three weeks where you're going to decide is if you want the economy to keep growing or do you want do you want it to slow down your closer to raise taxes take what you got to take away the jobs take away the pay raises and the vast majority of Americans\nDon't want to go back to that I mean we had holes in September with were Nancy Pelosi has fifty five unfair will among all voters she has a she has a fifty three percent\nUnfavorable among independent women that the independent women are going to decide this election and and they don't want to go back to the way things work before Donald Trump took over and it's hard to drain the swamp and get things moving again for the country\nSo these house races you're talking about\nMost of the ones in play a Republicans those Republican incumbents or the or the Republican or a candidates in the in those open seats they're the ones who are going to vote to keep lowering taxes to keep the economy growing and basically to stop what you saw the last couple of days where\nYou know the smart money on Wall street saying hold that she's if she's going to be speaker\nAnd they're going to oppose the president's agenda they started selling off\nI mean it'd be a disaster for the country\nDoes shown 'em I honestly don't have a feel yet for the house but I think the Senate you have to admit is looking very good for Republican pickups\nI think when you have thirty three races now that will that will actually tipped the balance one way or the other in the house of representatives a little too close for comfort but those as somebody that knows Nancy Pelosi I think that would be a worst case scenario and we'd have endless investigations and impeachment and higher taxes and\nAnd you know it then they want to get rid of ice they won't fund the border wall et cetera it's gonna be the same nonsense all over again with them\nWell I my sense is that the house is still a in democratic hands where the election today so it's getting closer or the real clear averages gone from a thirty one or thirty two seats for the Democrats are twenty six twenty seven so it's moved the same direction as the Senate races but not quite\nAs far and I would have to concede much as I Would like not to that the Senate races have moved decisively andme interaction\nKavanaugh had a lot to do with it\nYeah I Do I think they're really two realities there's\nThe reality of the world that we live in on the east coast and west coast and the reality of the rest of the country who thought that a lot of what happened to him\nYeah I kind of like an island in the middle of that east coast I'm not the rest of the east coast I don't represent the value of the New York I noticed it was just a pretty hard core left wing state even as a Governor Cuomo does anyone want me in this day did you know that\nI didn't know but if I got\nI got taken it no he actually said those
