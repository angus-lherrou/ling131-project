man I Will tell you who was dressed up like a shark in his costume earlier today Dr ...\nLet me tell you a lot of people want to have you got to\nGet a little north up on the other\nAnd we've seen it look let's look at this horrific anti Semitic\nBigoted racist attack on innocent people in the synagogue in in Pittsburgh let me play just immediate blaming Trump now understand that the shooter hates Trump\nThe shooter hates Trump in large part because he's such a staunch supporter of Israel and yet that doesn't stop them from collectively losing their minds ramping up this hatred and rhetoric blaming Trump\nFor the synagogue shooting but yet the guy involved in the shooting hate the president in large part because he is so closely aligned with our closest ally Israel\nTerror threats in this country is white men must have been radicalized ... up to the right and we have to start doing something about\nIf you got to stop the main things about me I'll stop and signing an agreement to kill you whether the\nPresident knew what he was saying the alleged gunman certainly for something that resonated with\nTrump is doing is stoking inciting for the purposes of political power the worst amongst us to take action in his name anybody who sits there and says that there is not causality between these events\nAny insight unless he was dishonest as they are\nBlind I don't think you have to be rocket scientist to draw the line between these people and the rhetoric that as being terrified by the president of the United states the\nRations to manage them I think that he's with our original ...\nIt is oh factually a lie because the guy hates ... all the evidence is there why he hated Trump hated him because of his support for our closest ally Israel how many presidents promise to move to the capital of Israel from Tel Aviv\nTo Jerusalem where it belongs many none had the courage to do it except this president\nYou know it's amazing when you listen to the prime minister of Israel spanking the president no president has gone as far to say we will destroy the enemies of Israel because there are closest ally just the opposite of what they are reporting and what they're trying to do look\nIt would've been dishonest and I said at the time when Bernie Sanders supporters went out there and shot Steve skull east on the ball field in and shut up these other innocent people you know it it would have been it would have\nBeen wrong to blame Bernie Sanders Bernie is not responsible for what one of his crazy supporters to he's just not isn't it's intellectually dishonest to suggest such a thing\nI said it at the time and I even had at the time this is not some accommodation or rationale they would ever give it if it's a conservative just the opposite in this case you don't even have a Trump supporter and they're still blaming him\nI mean you know it it is in is what it is the biggest donors to the Democratic caused this election season is the media\nIs universal almost at this point they hate Donald Trump every second every minute every hour every day it is hate destroy Trump at all costs you know the whole lie about Russian collusion it's just what I've been saying\nThey don't care about Russia collusion unless the Trump\nHillary bought and paid for ... a full of Russian lies\nUsed to disseminate propaganda and influence the American people in the lead up to twenty sixteen it was it was used to get fired warrants on verified uncorroborated Russian lies that even the own even the author\nOf the\nOf the ... even stand by let me tell you something let's remember when the media bashed Trump a lot of them were moving the embassy to Jerusalem\nAnd the president went against in many ways what is a new alliance forming that could be maybe at some point God willing a path to peace in the middle east ones overall because of\nThe threat of Iranian Gemini and the region now caused an alliance that was unthinkable maybe just a number of years back with Israel the Jordanians Egyptians\nThe Saudis the Emirates putting aside what Saudi Arabia recently did\nI mean there was an emerging alliance here because of Donald Trump in large part and what he's done but I Will tell you you know let's play Joe Scarborough Joe Scarborough was lost his mind I honestly I don't I don't even it's inexplicable\nThat this guy has evolved into what I think is just he's he's lost any sense of reality all of these people in the media\nThey don't even see what blowing hypocrites they are\nOh they are guilty of the very thing they accused Trump up their rhetoric that they faint moral outrage about but there are guilty of\nHe's been he's been playing the race card I he said I'm a nationalist David Duke comes out the next day say thank you thank you so much for finally admitting that year old white castle list and then you have a we even some Republican back ventures uh that\nAre are Lincoln George Soros in these anti Semitic threats\nTo the caravan get Fox News talking about small pox and leprosy coming up it is ... I'm Sorry I have a I won't say specifically what regime this is out of but go back and read your history books and look at some of the most important regimes in the twentieth century\nMight as well be certain countries talking about gypsy ... lines up historically exactly with what certain countries we're talking about when they're talking about gypsies and Jews [noise]\n\nYou know I mean I don't even know what to say anymore you know Don Lemon last night or the night before whenever I think it was last night listen to what he says\nSo we have to stop demonizing people and not even I think\nBiggest terror threat in the country is white man most have been radicalized brought up to the right and we have to start doing something about them there is no travel ban on them\nThere was no ban on you know they have a Muslim ban there is no white guy band so what do we do about that\nI just I don't even know what to say you know and then their morning host adjusting the Trump and the synagogue shooter using the same language\nTerm messaging we'll start with the president so he seems to be a hero in in\nOn the two pillars of the media\nContinuing hit the trail attack against and migrants continuing to ratchet up the language about them just and and frankly I mean I have to say using some of the same language that the mass murder at the synagogue used in terms of invaders and\nIn Beijing for these tragedies work at cross purposes narrative so it's hard for him to celebrate his narrative of ... migrants when again the alleged mass murderer did the same thing\nAnd I don't I don't even know where to go with this\nJoy is very hard not even on her show the view but on conspiracy TV MSNBC you've also at times got along with them as as cars out now who\nNot only that such a cycle I I've I like the guy in a way it was like oh you're in New York character he got Republican or Democrat he's just an advocate size on that [noise]\nAnd I don't mean that in an ad hominem wet [laughter]\nNah not at all let me tell you what it means they are afraid\nThey eat a ... look there are three scenarios as I said for election night will be examining the results one week from today on this radio program and there is an unknown factor here anyone that tells you they know what's gonna happen doesn't\nThere is there's not one outcome to be very Frank with you that would

outside you got tester on the bubble even I'm Joe Manchin on a bubble in West Virginia and Bob Menendez on a bubble\nYeah and I actually know what kinds of different levels you have a nine guys on our very own state where the Democrats should be safe because his personal\nOr guilt or with the Senate Ethics committee on a bipartisan unanimous majority find him guilty of a whole range of things I mean some very very unsavory rumors that were built for one of those that are so he says he's now in such bad shape\nThey'll carry the pouring millions of dollars that they like to go somewhere else

from state to state to state\nUh how these things are involving right now because they're they're very ... very much in the air and there are I think ... no no for the Russian should assume\nThat this was over one of the day can stay home and then they feel about run out and voted for him if he ended up not by election day do you not do anything else that they can vote it's that serious\nMe let me ask you this because it lets go with real clear politics and they have to wonder written for the number of house seats that they think are\nSafe for the Democrats and about one Ninety nine for the Republicans or work with the Republicans have in the majority all of those toss ups put them on defense than you did at forty five retirements for the Republicans that's a big number in any election year\nUm the house is what I'm most\nRead about and you know the thought of Nancy Pelosi being speaker elect and then speaker of the house once again as a pretty frightening thought um where do you see the house going\nWell not functionally [noise] ah I I my personal range is reaching the bottom of about two of them one which would mean below sea ... going to be twenty thirty which would mean that Kevin McCarthy and couldn't get to speak and um\nAnd I can't I mean all honesty is you know I have always been standard but I Can't give you a more accurate number I Can't say to you\nKnow I Can't either I really can't I mean and I think and and look the conventional wisdom is Republicans will hold the Senate pick up seats there and let them see below sea what when the house\nUm that's not a great case scenario but that would be sort of like a split decision by the American people also say one other thing is\nYou know some House Republicans have earned the wrath of their voters but it's really not about them it's about stopping an agenda that we know is going to be about impeachment and lives investigation raising taxes they want their crumbs back a sanctuary cities open borders eliminating ice in keeping Obamacare\nAnyone who does not bode has effectively voted for him and she should be no one should get themselves if you want to have Nancy Pelosi\nAnd then you'll have to house\nAnd people like congresswoman waters in charge of the financial services which just single phrase it tells you how crazy their party edge how how could you know again she was one lady she's not somebody I Want to have watching over banks in our financial services\nUm and she goes out and I'm going to think of\nAnybody who says I'm tired of it all I don't like to know why should send her on that kind of not voting is in effect a half vote for him and she should be speaking [noise] um I think that's\nGood yeah I don't have to tell a ... there were four hundred and thirty five members of Congress all of them are up for reelection\nAnd every race is important and the idea is no this is the either stay home or you vote for the Democrat you're pretty much voting for ... the the same in the Senate races you know you vote for John tester you vote for Claire McCaskill you vote for Christ in cinema you vote for Bill Nelson you vote for\nReticent in Tennessee ... you're you're voting for
