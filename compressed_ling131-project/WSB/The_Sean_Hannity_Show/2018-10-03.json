I don't know yet but uh I think that's correct so here with the agreement with our colleagues\nAnd Chris Coons was never part of the agreement he's a Democrat from Delaware Chris but he was never part of this agreement\nWhat compromise has been reached for Chris ... she is voting no he's asking for the investigation to continue our around whether or not he's been honest about it as drinking habits so Chris Coons is a non factor here Lisa Murkowski Susan Collins and Jeff Flake expressed a desire for the FBI\nTo talk to the witnesses around the Ford allegation and mystery Maris and the fall and incredibly incredible lead within a week\nI think the FBI is about finished everybody can look that report for themselves and saved his changed anything I Hope we don't move the goalpost Geoff oh did you sing committee with the understanding that he wanted to see what the FBI found about these accusations and hopeful and get this done this week\nAll right let's talk about this agreement because it was supposed to be limited in scope and now it is expanded out further we now see the ... ah your your colleague on the Senate Judiciary committee the great senator from the state of Hawaii he wants men by the way to sit down and shut up\nYeah which was pretty outrageous statement but anyway a senator Hirono now is saying she wants an F.

I have no idea what Lisa Murkowski is going to do I have no idea what Susan Collins is going to do or they are your colleagues maybe you have some more insight than I have but\nTo me they're the ones that met privately with Joe mansion and they decided on this course now that it's an FBI investigation but right close to be limited in scope is now expanded out into other allegations\nBut if you fall one vote short you came up with a pretty interesting and thoughtful idea that I kind of like\n[noise] well I think we've got the votes and then from an but here's the question does the Republican Party abandon Brett Kavanaugh do we legitimize\nThe way he was treated at the Senate is it forty nine what I Would like to see happen is to appeal the verdict of the Senate and the November election and take it to some of the states and see if the people in those states agree with senator about Brett Kavanaugh the swap\nWould abandon Kavanaugh the traditional way of doing business is if they fail one vote short just pull the plug\nHe's never quit I don't want to quit on him so I think Trump might be different I think Trump would say listen this man it's been abused are not given up on hand less have an election to see if the vote in the Senate really represented the Trump states were Democrats a rain well\nI mean this is the thing I mean we have people like Joe Donnelly he's a no he said already Claire McCaskill's know already as a matter of fact yes most Democrats wouldn't know no matter who Donald\nTrump ... they've already against score six\nYeah All right so now what's gonna happen to Bill Nelson of Florida and Joe Manchin and Heidi Heitkamp and Joe Donnelly and well a smart question\nMartin makes Sally is a great candidate for the Republicans in Arizona up most served their country with honor and distinction I Hope she wins um we certainly could use a win out in Nevada or do you think this impacts the race and do you actually think you're going to get the votes and why do you think you'd get the votes\nWell number one I think we're going to get the votes because Jeff voted in committee yes I don't believe the FBI is going to find anything a relevant to this limited investigation that would show that\nThat are ... Ford's planes are more credible and that there's anything new about Brett Kavanaugh in terms of the investigation I Would hope they would stay consistent with this vote I think the other two Collins and Murkowski or friends they're wanting the FBI to check the committee's homework I get that\nThat will be done here shortly but you're asking me a hypothetical\nI Can't imagine how we would explain to the Republican Party that we gave up on Brett Kavanaugh because for one vote short when a lot of the states that led to that vote being short Trump won I Do not believe North Dakota wants a Heidi Heitkamp to vote no\nI agree with you\nI Am so this is why you have an election appeal the verdict of the Senate if we have to to the people of of the country and November\nLet me ask you if you've spoken to these red state from state Democrats that are up for reelection if you talk to any of\nThem doing it right now uh so you mean you're you're communicating Hannah I'm not sure if they're all Hannity listeners and viewers beyond that I doubt if they're listening\nI think we're fine but here's the dilemma that you that this process has put us in this is about the teacher the judiciary the states couldn't be higher is about the reputation of one of the finest man I Know\nThis about who would come forward after this debacle is about sending a tone and the standard that will destroy the ... and eat the Senate alive so I Know President Trump pretty well\nI think we've got the votes and then some but I think he's a different kind of politician that he wouldn't let the system get off the hook\nThat if we had to as a last resort where one vote short list they have ... we would take this issue to the ballot box and about thirty something days\nThirty five we can I find that extra vote that way we would have a good nominee or have a light salvaged have a process uh saved and the people finally get to speak up here\nI think we're fine but you asked me a question and I thought about this yesterday\nAnd said if Brett Kavanaugh is on the ballot in some of the states I think it changes the election you see in North Dakota there's a poll out today the number one issue in North Dakota is I'm Brett Kavanaugh's nomination as far ahead of anything else sixty to twenty eight the people in North Dakota North Dakota support Brett Kavanaugh\nWell it's fascinating to me that the Democratic leadership is showing no support or comprehension or understanding of what their colleagues from states that are not New York and California have to go through in terms of reelection but the reality is\nThat I Would even argue that if they do vote for Kavanaugh it's only an election year conversion and there were only doing it because if they don't the people in their state will throw him out but they'll probably go right back to to be in a party line vote would Schumer at the end of the\nDay [laughter] well you know I'm I'm not a psychologist or political scientist I don't care as like you know I'm a ... I don't care how you found Jesus as long as you do you know if you can figure out that Brett Kavanaugh was highly qualified and these accusations have crumbled\nAre good for you and now here's the point\nThis has become the most despicable thing I've seen in Washington and that's saying a lot it changed the face of the judiciary forever if we condone it so it's just not a complicated issue for me if we follow vote short\nA less take this to the ballot box and see what happens\nMe ask you about this whole process now we've gone through and and I do think the Republicans and you know I'm pretty honest broker I'm pretty critical of Republicans when they're wrong I Do think that they they have handled this with the seriousness the charge deserves a damn ...\n[noise] yes no I think they handled it properly because these are serious allegations but she identified and and look I won't go through the ... the entire\nWe don't need to we don't need to reach try this case I made a gun and you made up your mind there five accusations that have are are are not verified or just made up not true outrageous so it's not about Cabot I'll\nPut that on them is that this was the environment we live in senator and I warn those arguments on radio and TV every two and four years\nIf you're a Republican or a conservative and you're running for office you're going to be called a racist or sexist appoint a massage and as the homophobic Xena ...

be twenty four hour news center innocent until proven guilty is going to say David Perdue takes to the Senate\nFloor moments ago to talk Brett Kavanaugh will have more in a moment first did you know it was coming or did you and your co workers had ... scared out of you about forty minutes ago will you and two hundred twenty five million of your closest friends just got the first ever nationwide emergency alert chance for wireless phones seem as Wade Widmer says here's why\nA lot of discussion and concern about the ability to warn or Americans or people in the United states of emergency is the only the radio and TV\nWhat is you know what we now know fact should matter in this particular case and in the case of any allegation\nYou know I I Want to get into what this whole means I'll get into that at the bottom of the hour a little bit but what we do know now is that obviously all the people that said we believe her long before we knew really anything about it\nThose that rush to judgment eliminated all due process all presumption of innocence that is the Democratic party today for getting that of course they were against judge Kavanaugh before he ever got an ounce anyway and it didn't matter who Donald Trump\nNominated to the U.S Supreme Court they were going to be against but Democrats not caring about your rights fundamental rights that have made this a stronger country and I actually think the New York times by moving on to a Fifteen page\nA tax expos they on Donald Trump's father and well he might have gifted son money years ago when he was eight and therefore he got his wealth from his father I mean it's it's totally seems to me that they moved on from any chance that have covering the Kavanaugh case 'cause it's probably already done\nWith the FBI investigation wrapped up wrapping up and now handing hand he goes over to the Senate\nI Want the American people that have a right to see this I think the American people now invested in this\nAnd I think the American people will have a right to know for sure what the FBI came up with remember they're not going to make conclusions they're not going to make recommendations they're just going to say probably what the Senate investigative committee and found out already\nThat they in the case of professor Ford for example she didn't remember date a day of the week a location how she got to or from the location where the alleged crime took place she mentioned for witnesses and for people that were at the event no corroborating evidence of any kind\nAnd no one backing up her story including the one person that she placed in the room during the alleged attack and Democrats you know they they thought this was enough to initiate yet another FBI background check and you know so now it's wrapping up in the mainstream media they've already made up their minds in fact in\nYou know that we learned about mystery mirrors and the New York times couldn't even print that story because when they called dozens of people they found out this Ramirez was actually\nNo she didn't know herself if it was professor I'm Sorry if it was judge Kavanaugh because she was asking former yell classmates I don't fully ... do you remember I'm not sure it was him\nWell that kind of puts that case to rest\nAnd on top of the other things that she admitted that she had gaps in her memory and that she had been in ... braided rather quickly that that particular event\nAnd the third claim the most outrageous claim from this woman named Julie sweat Nick represented by the anti Trump to sell it Michael I have a nominee alleging that Kavanaugh was involved in\nThe cereal drugging almost on a weekly basis so she says she went to ten of these parties but as you said almost on a weekend basis\nWhat happened where young boys and these prep schools would be drug in young girls teenage girls and lining up in the halls and raping them\nAnd then of course she gave for names to NBC News and well NBC News didn't find one person to back up a story one of the names was dead and another name was somebody who said I have no idea who this person is\nAnd they still ran the story and then of course backtracking on a on a variety of issues significant issues of the story that she just released a week a week prior\nHow does that become news and yet that is what the media now does they were perfectly happy airing that interview and now she's saying well\nWell they weren't exactly wind up in the hall um well he was in ... I saw on the air the punch bowl and he was given out red solo cups too people that's not drug in girls on a nearly weekend basis and lining up in the halls to gang raped women\nYoung girls and you'd have to believe that if that happens that regularly and was that well known there would be some cooperation\nThat somebody would have told at the time or a law enforcement official a teacher a parent that this was happening or this happened or their drug young kids and and then lining up to rape young girls\nAnd it's gotten so absurd now that you have the senator from Hawaii wanting to investigate the ice throwing incident Brett Kavanaugh apparently through ice in a bar when he was in college\nPolice documents that show that Brett Kavanaugh through ice in someone's face during a bar fight when he was in college do you feel that that is in any way disqualify for someone within a Supreme Court [noise] why we need an FBI\nHaitian because there\nA lot of allegations and I mean for really are about how he behaves finance truck\n[noise] All right so we're at the end of this process now it's interesting that the Senator Grassley in a written declaration released late last night that we got a hold of at the Fox news channel\nAnd ex boyfriend of professor Ford's uh was the California professor accusing Brett Kavanaugh on that particular case anyway directly contradicting her testimony under oath to last week that she had never help anyone prepare for a polygraph examination\nFormer boyfriend whose name was redacted in the declaration also said the forward\nNeither mentioned Kavanaugh ... mentioned that she was a victim of sexual misconduct during the time that they were dating from around Ninety to Ninety eight and he said that he saw for going to great lengths to help a woman that he believe was a lifelong best friend prepare for a potential polygraph test\nAnd he added that the woman I had been interviewing for jobs with the FBI and the U.S attorney's office a further claim the Ford never voice any fear of flying even while aboard a propeller plane that they were on\nSeemingly having no problem living in a very small five hundred square foot apartment ... look\nThese are the small details to me I and I some of you may think this is all significant\nAnd at the end of the day she said there were four people\nThat could corroborate her story none of them\nCan corroborate her story most don't remember any party like this and the one eye witness that she placed in the room at the time of the alleged assault\nSaid it didn't happen so at that point you've got to presume somebody's innocent\nYou don't know the place you don't know the time you have a date you don't have a location is nothing that the FBI can do except take your statement and assuming that the poor people that have already been interviewed again under penalty of a felony\nYou got to assume that they didn't commit perjury and commit a felony when the FBI came back to ask the same questions\nAnd if they did then okay that would be a pretty big deal there's no indication up to now based on reporting that has come out on all the people that have been spoken to\nA lot of people are making a big deal over the fact well they haven't spoken to professor forward but I I mean professor Ford has now told their story multiple times and I've got to believe and assume that\nThey're they're thinking that well her story hasn't changed you just said at last week before the Senate Judiciary committee [noise]\nUm you know it's just [noise] I I just there's there's so much at stake I Want to get into what this all means\nBecause what it means matters you know at the end of the day what this means for the country for the future of the country all of that matter\nLindsey Graham is saying Clinton sex accuses were treated a hell of a lot worse than professor Ford and I I think the the Republicans held the actually did something well\nI think they handled it with the level of seriousness a topic like this deserves\nAnd we'll see what happens in the next couple of days and who's going to vote which way a democratic protesters by the way assaulted a GOP congressmen in his Capitol office apparently congressman Andy Harris assaulted by protesters Tuesday Afternoon they they're gonna have to start kicking people out of the ... of these\nSenate buildings income congressional offices

represent in the country Mitch McConnell firing back at it an army of out of control you know democratic protesters threatening and trying to intimidate him and other Republican senators and\nSo we'll see what that means from his vantage point uh we also have Grassley saying the investigation now is almost done\nFor complaining the FBI never contacted her but they have a story what else did they need and much more I Will get the oldest today eight hundred dying for one show more in our nation's Capitol Newt Gingrich is going to stop by\nVictoria Toensing Joe diGenova Haley Mak an anti Geoff

dishonest and vicious they are I Hope to that stage for very long time\nLet me ask you a thirty four days out of an election you were there as a strategist when Reagan became president\nFor the first

hearings and the Democrats\nDemocrats don't have a vision for the future we had I ate horrible years of Obama\nWe've had two very successful years of President Trump what is the pitch what what should these congressmen and women and senators be saying\nWell first of all the president has done a great job he watches various trips such as Mississippi will be in Minnesota and he's laying out the case that if you want results of a team called Republicans\nAnd if you want resistance you've got a team called Democrats and he's been laying up and and you see it in the numbers than people realize the lowest unemployment for African Americans in history lowest unemployment for Latinos a continuous economic growth many good things that are happening thank the president has set the stage now to

saying we're back yet because we're not\nPush of a lot of work to them but we're coming back and now you have a chance for the president's leadership\nAnd I think this will actually be about which kind of America if you want us to be\nWe want us to keep coming back keep creating jobs do you want us to control the border to save our children from MS Thirteen gangs from France and all and promote
