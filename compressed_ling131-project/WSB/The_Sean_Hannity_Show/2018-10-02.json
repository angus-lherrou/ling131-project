I I sure they were it was either find people because they already had been interviewed\nBy the Senate Judiciary committee like the the the goalposts are moving faster than the speed of light here it's it's very difficult to that can believe that any of these people\nAnd it it can take themselves seriously they said it's going to be four days a week and now they're going to have an artificial that time you know they were saying the FBI the gold standard there impartial\nThere you know she worked at that every Democrat that that now they're going up that Trump is evil puppet master controlling the FBI are actually going to be it's horrible partisan organization\nYou know it it it it is and it would be laughable if it wasn't a man's\nLife long reputation here on the line [noise]\nTake your job when I got to do like two weeks ago as far as everybody else knew Brett Kavanaugh had an impeccable reputation that is now that's gone forever you know re Donovan famously one said after being investigated for a year and a half where do I go to get my good name back mhm well in this case\nI I don't think Brett Kavanaugh ever gets back in many many ways I mean Clarence Thomas will ever be remembered because of the last minute accusations of Anita Hill\nYeah it it it's very discouraging although I have to say I I Do get some on there is someone who clerked for Justice Thomas and knows the why he he you know there's certain ... ... people who are going to get simply use that as their excuse is counted the name of discount them because they disagree with them anyway\nAn atheist someone who does ... incredible amount of perspective on that that\nJudge Kavanaugh is a kind of person where even when he was on the DC circuit at a lower court judge the Supreme Court said it saw him as someone to really take seriously you know more than a dozen times they fought to fourteen different times they found out they vindicate his opinion they had a huge amount of respect for him I don't think that's going to change I think\nUm they are not going to be watching this with a sane knee jerk a part in response as I Hope that that that we're seeing them some of the people at ... but\nIf it if the parents to do on a reputation now\nIf you read James Comey's New York times piece that he came out with the ... it to me it's absolutely Sony\nAnd the things that he's saying because while the FBI's packet in the middle of it when we handled the Hillary Clinton email investigation while he was writing an exoneration himself prior to the real investigation which didn't happen until three days before he publicly exonerated her um\nBut then he goes on to trash the president at length\nAnd then he talks about FBI agents are experts which they are and interviewing people and quickly dispatching leads to their colleagues around the world to follow up with additional interviews\nAnd they will confront people with testimony and other accounts and you know yes the alleged incident occurred thirty six years ago but FBI agents no time has little to do with memory um which I found a little strange\nUm and then you know for example everybody remembers if it rained on their wedding day uh I don't think that's the political in that particular sense maybe to somebody who is traumatized by could see that but for somebody that's not traumatized maybe not\nUm once they start interviewing every witness knows the consequences he says is one thing to have your lawyer submitted statement on your behalf it's very different thing to sit across from two FBI special agents and answer their relentless questions\nOf course the bureau won't have subpoena power only the ability to knock on doors and ask questions most people will speak to them that there is what he says refusal to do so\nIs its own kind of statement now I Want to just address that because my FBI friends my friends in the in the bureau special agents have all said to me never ever talk to the FBI unless you have a lawyer ever and I'm like why I'm somebody who loves the FBI\nDon't love the upper brass on their Khomeini and the cave and struck and page but the FBI is is the FBI people I Know the salt of the earth people and I sort of course I'd want to help him he goes no\nAnd then they say look what happened to General Flynn General Flynn is accused of lying to the FBI and the up here I didn't think he was lying to them\nAnd you just it's dumb to ever talk to any law enforcement without a lawyer that's what all my law enforcement people friends say\nBecause it's a crime if you lie to the FBI let's say you said something in the Senate Judiciary investigation and it doesn't exactly match up you could be charged with a crime of lying to the FBI it's ridiculous\nAnd you know the irony that says hey look hit hit companies coming and low right now is just to try to destroy the Trump with everything he can and it's just another another section in that play book but\nThe irony at the exact same federal law provision that says it's a crime to to lie the FBI is the one that says it's a crime to lie to the Senate and they're with their Netscape it's not just you know a similar penalty is exactly the same statutory violation so that's just not\nThey've been kind of pretending they're ... that I guess playing a little bit on people's images maybe from the movies of what the FBI guys to say that they somehow it's going to be a separate different thing what they're really doing here is there going down that same list to people\nThe Senate Judiciary committee had already talked to they're getting the same statement in some cases they might get exactly the same thing 'cause the FBI can't ... can't force them to talk to them especially if all you know as I don't remember that I wasn't there they could be dealing with taking the same\nExact statement from the same lawyers for the same the same individuals that that's ... that that is all we can no ... just because of the nature of the old investigation so the FBI isn't going to find anything you to hear that they're they're my prediction\nBy an IRA and that they don't have any other thing\nThey've already moved on I guess the ... and and that's the one that came out in the New Yorker piece and you know ... that's the one we're even the New York times that said they had attempted\nTo interview over the course of a week several dozen people they couldn't find a link a one to corroborate her story and then saying that Mrs Ramirez\nContacted former yo classmates asking them if they were called the incident and told some of them that she could not be certain Mr cabinet was the one who exposed himself which at that point tells me you know what are they investigating here if she's asked for the other ... she telling other people she doesn't know what do they investigating\nThem more shocking thing is even right and it's you know right before\nThis whole um ... most recent face exploded I think it was the morning on of the vote she actually her lawyer telling people she's not even sure it with him she said what how did he was in the room [laughter]\nI'm positive he adjusted his hands but everything they do it but I but I Can't say for certain it hit it and so it's even after talking to her lawyers for six days to kind of work up\nA her memory that she didn't have when she initially talked to the to the New York New York or could they also said she couldn't say for sure he was there when they initially talked to her I mean ... even if they cut about ... you know what go\nFor the FBI could talk to her and they'll they'll get their statement and I think if you look at the people if they're\nOnly going to take a whole new ones and they don't make any recommendations they'll just going to give very handover the information\nThat's it the the three ... and and maybe we'll get those three oh two we've been waiting for thrilled to forever as it relates to Bruce or and and Christopher Steele

dying every day a sea of a big premier tonight congratulations thank\nYou I really appreciate it when do people get to actually see it themselves and I know I'm premier night is not available to the

is a TV our yeah I just wanted to make sure you knew it was forty four minutes I work in TV I Know what a TV our is\nUm which is the point but it's sad because we're losing Seventy two thousand people literally a year because of the opioid\nEpidemic a lot of them are young kids\nI mean these kids you know they get and mom and dad or grandma grandpa was medicine cabinet biking and Percocet oxycontin and they think it's fun and the next thing they know they're addicted and there's no more supplying grannies medicine cabinet\nThen they're out buying it eighty bucks a pill and then they find that sells really addicted and somebody offers a ten dollar bag of heroin and now they're a heroin addict and there was set up as a rate is like eighty five percent if you're addicted to this garbage\nThey can't get off it and then the next thing you know they're going to buy a bag of heroin that God only knows who's putting it together and they drop what is the equivalent of three grains of salt that's how tiny we would be upsetting all inside of the heroin and these kids die and these adults or even die\nI think I think there's another point to the DEA chief was interview today and he made it very clear that the biggest threat to national security is the Mexican drug\nSo what's happening is it's not just that people in the article on the hill I saw that\nToo that John Solomon wrote it and and and John Solomon wrote that article at the DEA chief ... ... you know did this and and took some ... some of the statistics from the film that we did and just said you know\nThis is very serious and we're we're looking at it very closely but there's this huge misconception that the borders just about immigration when in fact the kids are dying on the other side of the border national security helps us both not an immigration issue it's a life or death issue not right or left life for\nI don't think anybody I don't know anyone else and media here that line by this life or death yeah no no

investigated\nIn every case there's no ... operation at all none and and multiple changes in stories at least two of the three cases and yet this this goes on and this lander\nAnd the I mean I just described a story about what Julie sweat Nick was claiming and now she has backtracked\nI don't even know why NBC whatever run an interview like this but they did run it even saying that while she gave U.S foreign names to investigate one's dead and the other one has no idea who she is\nAnd the other two people never got back to us so they can't corroborate any of this but they say they can and the lawyer keeps saying they can but she backtrack center story at what point does the man\nYou know how does Brett Kavanaugh to quote\nYou know infamously rate Donovan one saying how do I get my good name back or famously saying you know how does this go off a civil discourse in this country\n... ... okay you know I find it particularly appalling that some of these never Trump hers and\nAre these questions and then the entire democratic leftist apparatus had the audacity to make all these charges and slander and and destroy a Kavanaugh and his family\nAnd have the audacity to suggest that he shouldn't stand that independence out and that his feelings so with passion indicate\nThat he doesn't have the requisite judicial temperament this are on the United States Supreme court ... hair is righteous indignation is is to our rant which was totally justifiable than necessary in fact to preserve his position\nRight to they compare that to the twelve years on the bench when he had exemplary judicial temperament which is universally acclaimed I find their uh I find their analysis\nAbsurd on its face and shouldn't even be taken seriously this guy has grand you digital camera I Would hate to have that kind of\nGuy I how was somebody supposed how was somebody supposed to act if they're accused of being a serial gang rapists who drug drug young girls as a matter of course on weekends in high school how I mean what is the proper response he's supposed to go there and the guys I just didn't do that\nYeah Pete ...\nWho were falsely accused react exactly the way that Brett Kavanaugh did\nAh when you're agreed you sleep wrong you're angry and he expressed the appropriate to righteous indignation of an innocent man uh but the most important thing he said was I don't question\nThat ah Christine Blasey Ford was it some time and at some place sexually assaulted it just wasn't me so he's he's not calling her a liar or what is essentially doing is saying she is mistaken\nFor a variety of reasons she may have conflated to different\nOr individuals or she may be projecting based on you know some uh for some reason that we don't understand a but this was a man who sounded like he was being falsely accused into can damn him for being angry is to ignore human emotion\nOver the garden\nAt ... and contrast that with his response on the market in the column interview and I was watching that very concerned I thought he was a flat aspect he was very much to restrain and I said to myself\nAnd robotic if he doesn't quit holding himself that nobody's gonna blade and then I'm telling you\nNobody would've believed him if he had done that same thing but he finally somebody a coach them and by ... somebody told him quit holding back or he called himself and he was masterful because no matter how many people said why she was ... she was initially legal she was credible they they believe that\nCan in multiples when he testified in he totally indicated itself and it was a mashable reporter because I think it was authentic\nBut what a ... where does it go from here because um I have no I mean Jeff snowflake is Jeff snowflake who knows what he's running for president now and and headed up to Massachusetts New Hampshire I guess he thinks he's going to beat Donald Trump I I don't think this guy could get Fifteen votes at this point\nThen you have what Susan Collins we have no idea where she's coming down on this although she rightly said with Diane Feinstein did is unfair to everybody in the process and then you've got Lisa Murkowski I mean she was a a no vote when she was needed on numerous occasions\nYou know I to me there's only one answer and the answers thirty five days from now and that's when the American people have an opportunity to add more senators from West Virginia from Indiana from North Dakota from Missouri from Florida I'm from Arizona Nevada\nAnd but until then you know I don't know what happens I have no faith\nThat anybody really gives a rip that this man's life as been bludgeoned this family has been bludgeoned then there's there's no corroborating evidence for any of it\nBut I think we have to wait to see what happens in the FBI's report if the investigation finds nope plausible evidence against Kavanaugh this will not only helped to restore his reputation and solidify the integrity of the United States Supreme court at large\nBut it will also give a valid reason to senators like Murkowski and Collins a and Jeff Flake and somebody like Joe ...\nNo change next few days measurable team traffic here is Doug\nTurned ruin
