nine o'clock on Jennifer regret that live in the devil USC twenty four hour news center would W. at the top story this hour authorities actively searching for the county teacher who hasn't been seen in days after he was accused of an inappropriate relationship with a student\nThat could be better sponsor filed a missing persons report after the twenty eight year old was captured on security video leading an iPad with apologies videos to his family plus three letters on the doorstep the police reports that in those letters matters apologized for the chaos caused\nTold his family he loved him and was sorry for the image they may now have of him and lastly gave instructions on how his family should split his money he's\nYeah look a Jim Messina who was speaking of President Obama in two thousand twelve he was the campaign manager a for Mr Obama at that time and he said yesterday is and why did Senator Warren have to do her announcement with our DNA now he goes why can't Democrats ever stay focused and I think this Elizabeth Warren\nRevelation or lack there of will only hurt the party further because I don't see how you could ever say and many media outlets by the way Shawn said that this was definitive proof right I'll give you literally the the headlines\nThat feeling around that she's Ninety six percent European I mean at that one one thousand done twenty fourth she has perhaps maybe Native American ancestry of some type I mean but it is but her she literally personally change herself\nTo minority status when you ban and then at Harvard that she was billed as the first minority female professor there a Native American heritage that the Cherokee Nation has spoken out and said this is just outrageous they're out they're outraged by it\nDry it and that was a turning point right when they came out and said this is wrong this is inappropriate\nThis is a mockery then where are you going to say is attacking was with Warren is it still conservatives or is it actually Cherokee Nation but I mean that that\nThe headlines yesterday Associated Press Warren DNA shows I have Native American heritage a CNN Elizabeth Warren releases DNA test with strong evidence of Native American ancestry ABC News Elizabeth Warren relieve reveals proof of Native American ancestry again what proof\nThis so backfired on her ... typically when ...\nNation got involved and and all the mockery that that ensued from there this is going to follow or I Know people think that she is a front runner\nBut the fact that she lied about our heritage to advance her career I could see the signs are already at Trump rallies and twenty Twenty one one thousand twenty four just written and that's it because now this defines her and this is not something you shake very easily and suddenly she's kind of morphed into Hillary Clinton where\nYou can't really trust what she says and then on top of that she has no real economic message at outside of you didn't do that so\nYeah there you turn to see who the Democrats settle on right away and and twenty twenty because I think the left wing of the party is taking over and that's not the way you'd be President Trump\nOne of the things that I've been pointing out I don't know if you had a chance to look at the center for American Progress and it was a girl born by none other than John Podesta but they're running their reelection now\n... very revealing the Maxine Waters says they keep telling me not to say it I think keep saying I'm not a lot but I'm going to keep saying it anyway meaning impeach forty five\nSo they're hiding their agenda we learn that in this project ... tape with Claire McCaskill in her own words also but now we know that they're being told directly not to talk about their immigration and all you know a sanctuary\nPacks pack up punch says the four page memorandum [laughter] I'm like yeah okay in any way the New York times or obtained a copy of it and Democrats and strategies to prepare the memos that\nThe Democrat you spend as little time as possible ever talking about immigration itself pivot\nTo more fruitful issues like health care and taxation it's very difficult to win on immigration so nobody's talking about what they really are going to do their super Democrats too when they have to pretty much lie misrepresent\nCon be quiet about what it is they want to do how they're governed and and the types of agenda items they really have\nThat's not an enviable position to be and I mean ... all the criticism Donald Trump takes he's pretty authentic he made promises and he keeps them\nThat's the thing I mean when you look at the record right everybody focuses on the rhetoric of the president too much right\nYou look at the results and it's a completely different ballgame any president would kill to have a GDP about four percent unemployment below four percent right to something like seven point six million job openings that was that was reported by CNBC today I think in the country that's incredible Ninety eight percent of the ISIS caliphate\nEvaporated in Iraq and Syria when North Korea is no longer lobbing missile over Japan threatening Guam and the United states\nThese are all very substantial victories the trade deal he just did with Canada and Mexico I'm not sure leading here I'm Talking about the pillars of the presidency in terms of accomplishments Trump is winning right now you want with capital as well even that CNN did\nA segment last week John Avalon where he says the president is on a winning streak and the polls are showing it he's back around forty four percent forty five percent among registered voters member\nOf al ... and it was the most accurate and twenty sixteen has them at fifty one\nRight fifty one percent everything is trending upwards at the wrong time for Democrats when you go into the selection because to your point\nThey have no message like they had no message and twenty sixteen I don't know what Hillary Clinton's platform was outside of that guy is bad but for me so I can be the first woman president and I I Would say the same about Mitt Romney two thousand twelve I I think that I Can't remember what his platform was but I remember Joe Biden had bin Laden is dead and GM is alive hey that's easy to remember and it's\nA it was good enough right who was it will make America great\nAgain or keep America great again the Trump could run on his record and Democrats just go with personal attacks like they have a it it's going to be a long long election you know you're going to hear about how Trump some trouble like you did in two thousand sixteen but\nAgain a in till they have a message in ... Michigan Pennsylvania Wisconsin to win over those voters that see jobs coming back and companies coming back I unless they put up a centrist fiery centrist candidate but I have a lot of problems on\nThe one poll that shocks me the most the latest one out of Wisconsin had Scott Walker who I think that a phenomenal job in the state of Wisconsin and now he's always had notoriously close elections he's always had all of these groups and millions and millions of dollars pouring in from outside of Wisconsin that he's had to deal with\nNot sure if the poll is accurate but it has him down and that surprises me\nBut I think especially when you look at the Senate I I could see the Republicans again with three weeks away I don't have a crystal ball I always tell everybody play like you're behind and you're losing and you've got you got to make up ground and anything can happen between now and election day in Twenty one days but\nYou know I don't see Heidi Heitkamp making a recovery I think a Christian seminar is falling apart in Arizona I see a surge of just the right time for Dean Heller in Nevada which will help him\nUm I I look at these other races Donnelly now is beginning to fall back in Indiana Marsha Blackburn is emerging in Tennessee thank goodness Claire McCaskill I Believe this tape is absolutely going to help to feed her or if the people in Missouri if this is widely disseminated 'cause it's outrageous\nAnd the only Democrat that might be safe at this point seems to be Joe mansion in the Senate yeah\nAnd and the Senate in order to win that back you had to go through this narrow path if you're a Democrat through Arizona red state taxes red state Tennessee read stand\nBy the way up I'm going to he's up by eight in the latest poll I'm actually going to be down during a town hall within this weekend around the Houston area I'll I'll give up that announcement later in the week\nOh there you go yeah and and remember better or got more money than any cat on my gosh are eight million dollars I mean he's tattered already has a twenty twenty presidential candidate you know\nI I think we'll probably be twenty to twenty five candidates and that's not an exaggeration as Republicans and Eighteen but yeah that would've been a very big symbolic victory of ... somehow could've unseated cruise but that's going in the right direction for Cruz as well so the Senate you gotta think they're probably going to pick up three or four seats\nAnd now I Would have told you two months ago and like I don't see how Democrats don't win twenty three seats went back out and given the history Eighteen in the last twenty mid term I have got against the party in power by an average that something like thirty three seats bottle of sixty three seats in two thousand ten\nSo I was thinking you know what I Can't see that not happening now I I think it's a toss up it's fifty fifty and the Republicans keep the house and if that happens after all this negative press that President Trump has received Republicans have received to overcome that and keep all three branches oh my goodness\nBut I Will tell you I think back then you you have two things the fact that they have no agenda\nIs part of it the second thing is is that they're catering to a mob mentality and we saw that in the capital hearings and we've seen a post Kavanaugh hearings\nAnd you know when you say as Maxine Waters did about cabinet members and and high ranking officials in our government you create a crowd and you you follow them into department stores and gas stations in grocery stores and you tell them\nThey're ... they're not wanted here anymore anywhere anymore I'm like that's the party because they're saying it\nFor a media perspective it's funny because then you have even some anchors on CNN that are saying you know the people that chased Ted Cruz and his wife out of a Washington restaurant right they're not a mob and you can't say the word\nMom I'm not allowed to say the word mob All right stay right there will continue Joe ... he is the media reporter on the hill a will come back we're also the stormy stormy networks are a little bit quiet except for the president's tweet we'll get into that when we get back eight hundred nine four one showing your calls in the final half hour\nOf the program we got an awesome Hannity tonight we hope you'll join us nine eastern we're going to prove our point to you with all the videotape about how bad things are and what the real agenda of the Democratic party is if you give them back power three weeks from tonight\nRight

I'll be able to say the Republicans have held on to the house because you got up and voted\nAnd you made sure that Nancy Pelosi didn't become the speaker to stop the progress that we've made which is significant\nIn the past two years we now have instead of Thirteen million more Americans on food stamps under Obama eight million more in poverty and no president ever went\nOh an entire presidency eight years without a single year at three percent GDP Growth well I Hope you're going to support the for a million new jobs we've had since Trump selected eight million out of poverty and on for food stamps and he was elected four hundred thousand manufacturing jobs the largest tax cut in history\nThe the greatest amount of deregulation we've ever seen in in five generations in this country including literally now putting in position in place an explosion of American energy independence you know by allowing coal money to continue in West Virginia or Kentucky and allowing\nGas to be you know to fracking to take place in allowing add more to be open and pipelines to be built\nAnd putting up a let's see constitutional is on the Supreme Court in lower courts in the country I mean and

stopped\nBlinked capitulate as hostages home of remains have been sent home a we have nuclear test site shut down and now talk of denuclearization of the entire peninsula oh the president shouldn't challenge our allies in NATO even though they don't pay their fair share that benefits them\nTo have the the NATO alliance far more than us but we're paying Seventy two cents of every dollar and now they're the president say they need to step up and pay their fair share well now they're doing it\nAnd similarly Western European countries that have been unfair with us trade wise well if you don't say that you're gonna have a tear up against them they're never going to negotiate\nAnd the fear of the tariff has caused them all to negotiate that means more jobs at home look at you know look at the the the new deal with a Canada Mexico\nThat helps American workers in Ohio in Wisconsin and Michigan and Pennsylvania you know bringing back manufacturing look what it's done with the steel industry which is seeing a revitalization thank God jobs that are never coming back four hundred thousand manufacturing jobs all coming back\nWhy 'cause the president negotiate it you want to go

traffic issue as our team has been reporting for the last Ninety minutes let's go to our trouble in traffic right now on this Doug Trimble\nThank you very much here and I live in an odd twenty minutes ago north down down down down down about three or four children hodgepodge ladder truck\nThe Saudi consulate in Istanbul\nAlso have a Turkish newspaper reporting as much\nBecause she'll be did work for the Washington Post he managed to after visiting the consulate the lived in Saudi Arabia he's not an American citizen but he he wrote for the Washington Post for many years Saudi council and it can be heard on the tape saying during the show these tortured do this outside you're going to get me in trouble\nOr in another tape and unknown person again I Can't corroborate this I'm only telling you what the New York post and the British newspapers are reporting on one Turkish newspaper if you want to live when you come to Saudi Arabia being quiet\nAnyway returned to Riyadh on Tuesday I had a plan search of his residence part of the official Turkish probe into the show gave to some parents that is the the Saudi council he's back in Saudi Arabia\nMiddle East English language website holding a Turkish sources saying that there were no attempt to interrogate ... but that us Saudi hit team came to kill him\nSource told the site that his death took seven minutes forensic physician doctor Salah Muhammad al ... body listening to music as he began to cut to show these body while he was still alive\nIn New York Post Turkish authorities believe could show that he was killed by a special team of Fifteen Saudi officials though the kingdom the crown prince of Saudi Arabia denying that says these claims are baseless this report comes as Mike Pompeo met Wednesday\nAfter being in in Saudi Arabia now meeting with the Turkish president hairdo on and the Turkish foreign minister ... rubber arriving from reality where he said the Saudis promised a thorough investigation\nMike Pompeo on Wednesday refusing to blame Riyadh said he didn't want to talk about any of the facts a day after the president said there's got to be a presumption of innocence but he wants all the facts\nTop us deployment diplomat Wednesday refusing to blame Riyadh blah blah blah blah several of the members of the alleged hit team were found to have close ties to the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman\nSolomon according to a a photo by the New York times Turkish officials have shared an audio recording with the U.S in Saudi Arabia that they say ... was murdered by Saudi operatives of except the president say they didn't get any tape at this time\nYou have a pro government newspaper reporting that ... apple watch recorded the interrogation torturing killing\nWell I Would assume if that watch exist in this happened and what we believe that he might have been taken out and body pieces\nNot sure that they wouldn't take the watch at that point but before leaving reality Pompeo told reporters at the Saudi leaders made no exception to the ... who they would hold accountable anyway so now according to the British newspapers Hussein circus official Turkish officials have a recording of blah blah blah and that that in fact happened on the apple watch\nAnd you have some of the other people saying it's highly unlikely that can show that you could have broadcast signal from his apple watches it was too far for Bluetooth connection\nYou know I think what's happened clearly as the Turks and the Saudi ... had the ... why are they have transmitters and the Turks don't trust any diplomats that have been into most of the embassies most consulates in Turkey and they listen to what's going on\nAnd we'll find out in this case um my take I think it probably all happen but I don't think we should\nRush to judgment because the truth is going to come out probably sooner rather than later joining us now Dr Sebastian Gorka\nFormer White House advisers brand new book is phenomenal by the way

you agree with me that all signs point to the Saudis\nAssassinating murdering this guy in a a barbaric way that's what I'm thinking\nYou know there's a ruin in warfare or report from the battlefield must be questions or I think this man is that\nWhether or not these audio tapes exist is another question but it's absolutely certain that this individual was caught between two nations that wants to dominate the Sunni Muslim world\nThat's the way up to them and as one regime of turkey and the price of Islam Saudi Arabia and this man was caught in the middle\nHowever however this isn't the fake news we've got to be accurate this man was a journalist wasn't on American soil with that trying to spin\nWas a foreign national read them and it was a common type ... you wrote commentary and he has a long decades long history of ... the Muslim Brotherhood and there's also related to the figures Arab um see a lot of the twentieth century or non smoking so all of these things are total statements with factual\nWhat do you think a missed the hot but it's been a while my uh my friend Dan has good to have your back I Know this has been your life and your business for so many years\nUm my gut is pretty clear on this uh I think this man was murders and the most evil roof brutal way possible and I think that the president is wise knowing that we're going to get to the truth no there's no doubt we'll go and we're going to have the truth rushing to that point is not smart in my opinion\nI I agree with you uh look there's a lot of evidence that we have already we nailed it Fifteen Saudis\nTraveled on the Gulf Stream Arafat arrived it costs to live that day the show he entered and we know ... never exited the cause\nUm we do the makeup of those of the fifteenth out for them
