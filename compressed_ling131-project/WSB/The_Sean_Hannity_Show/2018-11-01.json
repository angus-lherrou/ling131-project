S. B.\nUm a a district where do people want to continue to the America forward I mean we had the lowest unemployment at forty nine years that you know and in orange county it's the lowest point that it it Nineteen years\nPeople have more money in their paycheck uh people are able to get jobs consumer confidence is that I mean we're really moving this country in the right direction that the choices clear do you want to continue living uh America forward or do you want to go back to the Obama era\nToo where are you at overregulation where you had high taxes where you had government in your life and I think it's a clear choice in what we're seeing right now on the early returns\nOr is that the Republicans are just as energized as the Democrats are and in fact in my district we have over ... fourteen point advantage on the ... the return over the Democrats\nSo we aren't seeing this so called blue wave that you hear about we see that our voters are just as an energized\nWell I think it look if you look at the Senate Republicans have decided advantage and a lot of these races where they're red states that support Trump by big margins\nBut the house it's just harder to figure and I don't know if people fully completely understand that there are a lot of headwinds a history runs against the party in power they have forty five retirements that's the case for example Darrell ISIS seat\nUm and I you know I'm assuming with gerrymandering and and the legislature out there in California they do everything they could possibly do to maximize the number of democratic seats from the state\nAnd uh so it makes a particularly hard for people like yourself that have done a good job and want to do a good job for the people ... and you're\nA state and in your district but the you know you're fighting against the state that has a Thirteen and a half percent income tax with a democratic governor of that or democratic lieutenant governor running for governor who wants to free healthcare for anybody whether you're a California resident or not whether you're a citizen or not\nIt's a very challenging environment and to be from California and representing California either or for reasons why we need to make sure our voters get out vote so that we don't lose any Republican seats we have fourteen members of Congress right now\nAnd the Democrats have thirty nine and found it is really really important that we called our seats we've got to turn the state around and you're absolutely right I mean the liberal policies that cannot Sacramento Jerry Brown and now possibly gather news that\nUh it is getting more and more for double to live in the state and we need to have it get to the point where that pendulum swing back and I'm going to continue to fight for my constituents that can can you to fight for Californians until we\nOf the ... you will ever have swinging back is people are so fed up with the regulations on high taxation of states like California and New York Illinois and New Jersey is they are leaving and they're taking their money with them\nAnd you know my only fear is when they go to Texas or Florida or the Carolinas or maybe a lot a lot of cases Nevada or that they leave the liberal policies with them when they leave and and don't bring the failed policies that they voted for in their states\nBecause if you look at it it's become unsustainable for young people in California they can't afford to buy a first home they can't afford the high rate of taxes unless like you were in Silicon valley making crazy\nYou're absolutely right and you know one one hope I have is that Supreme Court decision Janet's versus asked me where you know if you're a member of the union you no longer have to pay your is the unions can troll Sacramento and if we're allowed to have a couple of election cycles\nWe may start to see that money go out of the hands of that at the unions that may give us a fighting chance at some point in the future in the state of California\nWell I got to tell you something there is a fighting chance I Wish you the best out there I Hope people are paying attention Southern California you know have and this is the headline which I think it's pretty scary Michael Bloomberg spending millions or California Democrats and in tight races\nAnd one other article came out said literally spending ... million dollars just on Southern California so\nUh we wish you all the best is is Mimi Walters California's forty fifth district\nOr and I wish you the best on election day and Dana Rohrabacher and all these other Republicans in Southern California these races all will tip the balance of power\nAnd if you vote for anybody that's a Democrat out there if you swayed by these ads you're pretty much voting for below sea hope the people in those districts to understand that so anyway thanks for being with us\nThank you so much\nOr I Hope it works out for you\nNot fun running for office who wants to run for office these days\nAre All right let's get to our phones or we have so much going on today six days out of election day\nLet's go to Mary is in upstate New York Mary Hi how are you glad you called well New York's on the verge of re electing Cuomo and\nWhat was done a thing for upstate New York and the fact of Pennsylvania's takes all of the natural gas from New York and they were allowed to frack and you see the economy booming and the other side of that border and here we could be literally creating wealth beyond our wildest expectations pretty sad\nVery sad you know what's going on and I\nI I'm In that business as well for me that's ridiculous I I was talking to you a few years ago and matter of fact it was five years ago today on the health care as a situation because when they rolled out

I've had 'em\nThat are no longer covered and die yesterday I had to sit down to you might you have a Nineteen elections went up yet again\nAnd less coverage getting gang for tests and things that used to be covered and and just I Want everybody to get out and vote because we need to continue on our past\nAnd and and get rid of the Affordable CARE Act and uh you know overhaul of that\nUm and yeah I agree with you on that fracking point as well but I actually this was calling to talk about the health care\nWell I've got to tell you right now or it's everybody that is now on the Democratic side they're running on oh we're going to fix health care\nWe've got a ... I'm like you're the same idiots that gave us Obamacare keep your doctor keep her plans have less and fundamental ... it's been a failure and the fact that was true none of it was true was one of the biggest lives that were told them perpetrated on the American people\nUh but anyway Mary thank you I I Wish the people\nIn upstate New York would get the prosperity that they deserve it can be done to instantaneously if they would allow fracking up in upstate New York long before they were ever an advertiser\nI when I did my own research and I needed a safe for my valuables firearms I Need a safer important papers and I found liberty safe I now have eight eight of them\nAmerican Made leading the industry and technology innovation they have features like the middle of a military style locking bars to heat expanding fire seal second to none\nLiberty state make the best product the best built sleep on the planet\nProtect your money protect your important papers protect your firearms they now have twelve months interest refinancing on approve credit I got special deals going on right now at liberty save dot com liberty faith dot com\nProtect your valuables important papers your firearms with liberty say got a quick break we'll come right back more phone calls and much more coming up straight ahead Sean Hannity show [noise]\nBoating and America and America's first\nOf all I was\nOn Sean Hannity's show\n[noise]\nDo you study five five AM seven fifty double you asked me [noise]\nI like gene pool rated carrier ws be twenty four hour drive and he said a word DeKalb County W estrogenic chemicals earlier trouble on twenty east on before but all the roads still blocking just one white traveling type of the brakes\nAs you're used to Wesley chapel reduction sixty eight heading toward a Seventy one and putting overrode\nAlso seeing a crashing the clearing stages and Forsyth county on the highway twenty north down delays getting up to crush we're dry from a multi vehicle crash involving a sanding trucks this report brought you by the Georgia Aquarium key of imagination nights at George ... wherever you can skip the lines and the crowds when you visit after four pm while sitting over thirty percent\nBook in advance now at Georgia Aquarium dot org Steve Winslow ws be\nAll right so I've been telling you about my pillow it helps me fall asleep pastor and stay asleep longer well my friends at my pillow have done it again with the air mattress top are now you need to get this because it will literally changed your life in a positive way for ever now is Michael in Dell's exclusive\nThree layer design it includes my pillow phone for support transitional phone to help relieve pressure points and ultra saw patented temperature regulating cover\nI sleep better and better and better every night and also as a ten year warranty and it's a covered this washable and dry both made in the u._s._a. and of course back by Michael Dell sixty eight money back guarantee and right now you can say thirty percent when you go to my pillow dot com use the promo cold Hannity\nOr mentioned my name when you called eight hundred nine one nine six zero nine zero and by the way Michael give you two standard my pillows absolutely free call now eight hundred nine one nine six zero nine zero\nAnd his leaks from reaching the U.S Mexico border\nAnd add to Atlanta adds more and more express lanes more people are getting ticketed for using them without a peach past expressed leads along I Seventy five and ... and Cherokee county are still relatively new but people are already taking advantage of the system\nNearly sixty thousand drivers had cheated and then you click lanes on I Seventy five cents they opened in September so you must be the time it's nine thirty one\nAttention Medicare beneficiaries now is your chance to get a will care only one Medicare Advantage plan designed to help you get and stay healthy getting zero dollars or low monthly premiums plus great benefits\nLike free over the counter items dental and vision coverage get exclusive access to a large network a provider pharmacy hospitals and specialists open\nOh man and he was seven so don't wait let will care getting use the coverage am benefits you deserve on your journey to a better you call welfare now can learn more about your options at age seven seven to find here a nine to ... well care for G.

four than a King County literally discovered brand new balance that broke overwhelmingly for the Democrats and they counted up despite the fact that it was clear in that case\nAt least my reading of it that some felons and then that will do both people that actually voted and King County is a lecture and control systems have been sloppy but you had you know groups like move on and others you know paying for a recount other ballads and they found enough new votes\nThat were not counted to\nA well not conducted the voters to swing the election is that pretty accurate what happened to you know\nI actually think county had more votes than voters and the ... by a hundred and twenty nine votes or that you know he's eight million vote\nSlow down there how did you have more votes than voters and there'd be counted\nThat we questioned as well and the the the Democrat appoint a judge Shira decided that we were gonna have to have the votes for extra cash\nWell why wouldn't you just use a little
