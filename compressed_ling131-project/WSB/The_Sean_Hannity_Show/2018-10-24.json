of boarded a parrot pipe bomb attacks are they coming up\nIt just a moment first we have followed over this past Ninety minutes the funeral procession prevent murdered when that county police officer we want to get the latest on that so we'll start with Doug Turnbull\nAll around our\nWe know today suspicious packages pipe bombs that had been sent to Obama and the Clintons apparently and and CNN and others\nUm how many times yesterday on this program there was a story about George Soros apparently some divisive but putting his mailbox and I listen what did I say about George Soros yesterday\nMy statement on tape when they say what I said yesterday when it broke when the store story broke apparently an explosive device was found near at George Soros his home in his mailbox the New York times reported\nIn a billionaire left is called the list of George Soros doesn't like Sean Hannity and they find is a lot of groups to love the show to go away I Want to be clear with everybody\nThis crap has got to stop\nThis crap has got to stop\nThis is you know we we have an election and Thirteen Days and on almost I you could see this building and building and building and building Rand Paul was very outspoken somebody is going to get killed\nI was the person saying during the Kavanaugh hearings hey we we got to clear the halls this ... one of the senators is going to end up getting assaulted or worse\nYou got to clear the halls you can't let these activists you know getting in the faces spinning it Lindsey Graham holding up elevators screaming at Sanders ... when you can't let this continue because it's obvious what's gonna happen to somebody\nAnd and I haven't heard any of my colleagues on the left warning that this is a bad thing I didn't hear a lot of people on the left all that upset that Sarah Sanders and her children\nWere run out of a restaurant and then they go to another restaurant and they were followed over there for crying out loud\nOr the video of secretary Nielsen ... sitting and eating a meal and these left wing lunatics screaming at secretary Nielsen till she has to get up and walk out of the restaurant we have the video of Pam Bondi who's going to a movie for crying out loud and what she had to go through with a left wing mob\nAnd then of course Senator Ted Cruz and his his wife\n... they're going to sit down at a restaurant there run out right and they get right in your grill right in your face\nYou know it's an amazing thing that they keep doing this to women or guys that are with their wives it culminated this weekend this is now the fourth time that Senator McConnell has now had to deal with this he's just sitting in a restaurant with his wife Elaine Chao there just eating that's all they're doing\nHe's not working is on his off time some guy comes literally right up to the table to bang on the table and then just rips off some of the food from the table opens the restaurant door which is adjacent to the seat where Mitch McConnell is and throws the guy's food out in the street\nAnd then start screaming at the top of his lungs and then of course Kevin McCarthy's office gets hit with a Boulder busting his office window\nAnd I didn't hear anybody condemning any of this certainly during the Kavanaugh hearings nobody on the left said a word about their leftist activists they love the pressure that they were putting on Jeff Flake and and other people there they didn't say paying Feinstein wasn't speaking out Lindsey Graham getting spit on nobody speaking out\nThese incidents that have happened to these conservative women's I don't see the coverage hour by hour second by second\nYou know but if Donald Trump calls the news media fake news and they do give you fake news there is some truth to fake news and they just hate Trump twenty four seven you should have seen the yesterday the graphics because he said I'm not a global list I'm I'm an American first nationalist\nWell does that mean that he's a racist ... you know is he a white nationalist no he said he's a nationalist\nAnd his policies of the irony is all of the failure and a disproportionate failure under Obama's policies towards African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans and women in the workplace they were just disproportionately impacted by the horrific\nPolicies of rocket balmy sat there for eight years did nothing to curb the violence even at his own home city where people are dying now you have a few famous people\nThat have had these suspicious packages that had been sent and let me be very clear you know leading up to this I have been saying this is not going to end well\nSomebody's gonna get hurt I don't want anybody hurt I don't want any Democrat hurt I don't want any Republican hurt I don't want any American hurt I don't want anyone in the caravan hurt\nIt ought not be prices precipitated at the border because Mexico allows people to march you know three thousand miles up to the United states you want to avoid confrontations like this if you can\nWe had a pipe bomb suspicious packages sent to the Clintons home and chaplain claw similar package to Obama's home one to CNN New York headquarters and ... and apparently the one yesterday George ...\nIt was his home in Westchester New York suspicious package center Debbie Wasserman Schultz was office they're investigating one that might have gone to Maxine Waters\nOffice you know with all the rhetoric from Spartacus yet in their face holder kick them they go low we kick them\nHillary Clinton we can't be civil with them unless of course we win\nYou know Maxine what did she say get a crowd if you see them you get a crowd you follow them in a restaurant in department stores in gas stations and you tell them they're not wanted anywhere anymore\nAnd watching it happened to all these Republicans as any of this you know we don't know what the intentions are a lot of people are speculating what the intentions are um you know let me be very clear I Know I Know first hand what all of this is like\nMy thoughts and prayers go out to anybody that has to deal with this today I've had similar incidences of security in my life\nYou know Linda ... you know somebody that we both care for very very dearly a girl that worked for us for years she's been on the radio occasionally you know remember when we had the white powder scent the Fox news and she literally had to spend an entire eight nine hours in isolation\nBecause we thought at the time it was anthrax that was sent I don't get packages anymore and my life uh and and far worse in terms of threats it's sad but if you're in the public eye this happens more than I Will disclose here it's not about me today\nBut I Know many other conservatives that have had the same thing happened it'd be go back just three weeks ago maybe people born is alarms that\nWas it was from the minute the news broke this morning the media's on Wall to wall with report suspicious packages and you know that were sent to the Clintons Obama recall there was another one and you know I think it's a huge story I Do\nIt's a scary story but if you go back just three weeks ago how many ...\nDo you even know that race in letters deadly rice and letters were actually sent to President Trump's defense secretary James Mattis or FBI Director Christopher Wray our CIA director Gina Haspel and\nOther top officials in fact that story got so little coverage that I barely remembered it until I saw a report on one of the Web sites earlier today that it was only three weeks ago that that it happened here\nAnd then of course we can take it back to the ... the shooting\nWhen Steve skull east nearly lost his life and to this day he struggles and has had so many operations that barely were able to save this guy's life that day\nBut for the heroin hurt the heroism of to brave Capitol police officers that took on a guy with a rifle that ... had cover and walked in the middle of a baseball field it's almost a suicide mission to defend people\nI I never saw such heroism it was amazing\nBut you think of the rhetoric that we've been hearing in the buildup to all of this and everyone else has been silent this isn't about left or right\nWhen when we found out that the that still leaves the shooter happen to be a Bernie Sanders supporter Sean Hannity didn't go on the air and say I blame Bernie\nI just I did the opposite I don't know I eat can't hold Bernie Sanders responsible\nFor the actions of of one of his ... supporters you're not responsible for that\nBut the media today and their their reaction to this is so over the top so outrageous so disgusting Lee part isn't it just they're so quick to blame President Trump Fox News talk\nRadio you got this NBC reporter saying that these packages shouldn't be written off as the work of an extreme as fringe but rather mainstream Republican media outlets like Fox News and talk radio\nYou know this jackass maybe needs to go back and hear my history because I've got the tapes when Obama was president the you know whenever there was any threat to the president when the guy walked in the White House and we've got to protect our president doesn't matter what their politics are\nWe've gotta protect all our politicians retired politicians\nAnd they purposely do this for cheap political points my answer is I Want everybody safe everybody needs to stop and the silence is there's been silence it has been from the left\nWe have to unify we have to come together and send one very clear strong unmistakable message that acts or
