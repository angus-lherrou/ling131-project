[laughter]\nI always have an opinion [noise] um yes ah with psoriasis skin diseases I always think of the liver\nAnd so whenever I see itchy skin whenever I see breakout psoriasis I always start to think okay is it a liver issue and chances are days so that's why when you gave up the sugar it works so well because the sugar has to be processed and deliver into fructose has to be converted into glucose and it produces uric acid and Trey fatty liver and hold another show on sugar processing\nBut what happens is um you got to get that liver cleaned up\nSo from an external standpoint you can use a coconut oil extra virgin organic coconut oil and just rub it on the skin and that might help from the outside in but then we got to get it from the inside out that's why the sugar worked once\nSo there are certain supplements that I've I've seen work real well I'm for liver issues ... is one for example that worked real well to help deliver breakdown issues\nAnd I do this a lot with patients that are on medication because of medication can cause liver damage if they have a bad diet and um there's different types of liquid form that we we used a ... a company it's not a doctor Joe product we other companies as well\nBut if you call the office asked for Kayla or tower and asking for the milk that so we can tell you how to get it there and you want to make sure with any something that you want to make sure you getting only the highest quality\nBecause you're wasting your money to buy a cheap supplement just like you're wasting your money buying cheap almost anything in life so um but I\nCan I ask you if a if can I ask you a particular ... if they're good or bad\nOr rather not maybe all the I watch that somebody has a message on the on the website if you as a civic brand names we don't want to talk about them on on a on the air here um but you could set it can be through the Web site all into that for you\nAre but let's try that and I really want you to cut out all your processed foods you're fried foods or your bread cookies cakes donuts passed is of course those sugars um but anything that's going to cause liver damage and fructose as a real big one\n[noise] okay cool to among the drive through ... oh\n[laughter] so I ... well uh uh get the baked potato and get out of there so [laughter] um\nBut yeah when you start doing that and then I also had Dr Joseph ... support because enzymes are real deliver producers enzymes if we can take the stress off delivered by giving us some external source deliver then has the ability to start to heal so I Would take the enzyme support and have something rod every meal broccoli cucumbers tomatoes up their autos and raw foods going to help deliver a take the stress off delivers well\nAre they a good I\nLike so much for each call and uh yeah whenever I see skin issues I always think liver and most cases where right and it's interesting I was on Web MD the other day and I was just reading and they had a question about um a a dad you know if your liver is not working right and the first thing that came up skin rashes and ... and I went there you go everybody's got the same idea so that's good\nUm so folks

P. N. app so and I'm using ... and I'm Wondering how important is that I researched telling Larry either [laughter] and it's good his fat different is any free ones out there what kind of like can you shed on me that that's\nAll right well let's start at the very basics okay is that when you're on the public why buy everything that you do is like traveling right through the airwaves okay\nSo if you are typing in your bank account and your password your Amazon dot com has whatever it may be is that anybody can just pluck that out of the year\nSo and so the whole idea behind a VPN or what's called a virtual private network is that is going to use all this sophisticated encryption so it's going to scramble it all up so I was traveling in the airwaves you won't be able just pick it out okay\nAnd so the whole idea behind using the VP an app is that we're going to have this magical tunnel that you're going to use when you are scouting around in Europe where are you guys going\nUm we're doing um London, France Amsterdam and Germany oh how fun if I Can't wait\nI'm so excited for you know London you're going to make sure that you get this app it's put out by the London museum oh and so when you're ... this is like the coolest thing you're going to totally love Esteban when you are like standing in a say in front of Buckingham Palace or pick who daily square or whatever it may be\nIs that you hold up your phone and augmented reality\nSo you can see where you're standing what it looked like in say Eighteen sixty two\nOh my gosh oh it's so cool it's so cool\nAnd then the other thing are ... are you into like military stuff\nAh my husband is\nOkay there's a museum and I made the mistake and I didn't mean to go to this museum which means like a lot of people don't mean to go to the museum which means most most people don't go there and say is that is the imperial museum\nIs also in London and then of course in France make sure you take like a a cooking class for chocolate and ah it's just an old had us take like the right croissants and you know if you could do a food toward any of the city has been great I went back to your VPN so when you're sitting there\nHaving your tea and Crumpet or your wine and the souffle or whatever it may be is that I Want to make sure that the hackers in the bad guys don't get you so uh so you're right there are all these different VPN lose some of them I Can't say on the air 'cause it's like hide your\nWhatever uh then there's nowhere to VPN and then there's also freedom VPN which they were actually a sponsor of our show at the company by the name of F secure\nAnd it's a public company and this is the VPN that I use than it is free or like for example when I was in London last month and so it does slow things down\nA but if you want to be safe and secure and I'll put a link to this over I commanded a common that show picks buttons you can find it\nIs that is truly the best way to do and of course before you go tell your credit cards that you're going I mean you ... you know all the drill and then there's a there's another app that you need to get its called mobile passport beard we talk about\nThat I'm no okay you need this app okay just if you don't do anything else and\nGet them out okay All right so you leave the United states you're on your way back okay there's four hundred and fifty people on the plane right\nAnd they're all coming down this pipeline all go to go through homeland security or a border patrol now if you have mobile passport on your phone I guarantee you that four hundred and thirty four people are\nGoing to be standing in line and sixteen of you are going to be on the mobile line and you're going to get through in like\nThree minutes oh my gosh I have to have that you have to do it is just had to do it and so and it's like one of these things before everybody knew how to get pre check you know it was good to get free check but [laughter] but now everybody has pre check [laughter] so it's\nKind of like that same thing with this mobile passport and so when you get off the plane and uh when you land back in the states just look for a sign that says mobile passports here in Phoenix\nOr they actually didn't have a sign and I had to ask one of the border patrol agents like you know where's the mole passport and he's like oh that way you go I mean I went all the way to the
