S. B.\nYou're listening to the financial symphony they show that makes sure your financial plan hadn't I prefer to take him\nI'll come back to the financial symphony with a one and only mark boy your financial maestro adds a little group in line and visors services you know marks on the radio every week but he's also on television and the TV shows going really well isn't it\nFox five eleven o'clock on Sundays Fox five don't hold what you see on TV against us because I Know personally the TV ads another hundred and fifty pounds in your studio Frank [laughter]\n\nWhatever that eight hundred seven for nine four to eight eight is your number to call to get in touch watching TV show listen to the radio show we appreciate your being here today we have a request buying a questions that have come in first of all from Albert in Marietta\nAlbert says should I start my Social Security at the age of sixty to to help pay off my house before I retired\nOK Albert that is a loaded question there's a lot of factors when when the turn on your Social Security if you turn on your Social Security at sixty two years old you're talking about twenty five percent less Social Security than if you waited till sixty six sixty seven depend upon when you're full Social Security ages\nSo you're taking a twenty five percent hair cut by taking it early\nSo that might not make the best financial sense\nSecondly if you're married and you die your spouse's check who if her check is less than your jak her check would be less she would get a pay cut when you die if you're married and you're paying off the house the bottom line is the interest rate on that house may not be that bad\nYou're getting about an extra eight percent by waiting so I Would wait it out personally now I'm saying that with limited information here\nThe best thing you could do is come in and have a Social Security optimization report ran on your situation where we look at your all your your bills your expenses the amount of money you have saved for retirement what these Social Security would be at full Social Security and if you have any pensions\n... aware is all the income going to come from to sustain your lifestyle\nThat Social Security optimization reports going to tell me exactly when you should turn it on so that's what I Would recommend instead of just saying I'm going to turn it on when that sixty to take a cut\nOur next question here is from Diana who lives in Atlanta and Diana says mark I've heard about a strategy using life insurance to create income for yourself and retirement is this a legitimate strategy\nWell if you have the need for life insurance and most folks to\nAnd you have the right kind of life insurance this is a great strategy because there's a specific kind that I'm thinking in my head\nAnd one thing that we do have here at lawyer visors services or insurance professionals that no these strategies\nActually I have a lot of doctors who use the strategy because they're not able to do raw fire right and that's what I'm going to get to is that based on current tax law when you're drilling net monthly income out of that life insurance policy it's considered a tax free income\nIt's a loan against the policy and because of that is a tax free income and there's folks out here who cannot do Rafael raised today they're using this down the road as their tax free supplemental income to go along with their Social Security or go along with their tradition\nI already and I think that's great and then when you when you die whatever the death but if it is in there is what's going to be tax free to your family\nWhether it's a spouse or to your kids or to anybody you want to leave it to\nSome of these policies even go a step further on that if you got sick and you needed long term care you could dip into the death benefit while you're alive to pay for a long term care health care expenses\nI mean that's huge now there's things you got to take in consideration what is your health today to see if it's work this you can you afford to park some money over there I mean these are things that when we're doing our regular normal analysis\nThat we do for clients we can see if this is a viable alternative or makes sense for ya sometimes it is sometimes it's not everybody's situation Ron is unique so you want to have\nA unique solution as well\nBut you know all of these things we're talking about here on the requests law today\nYou know just by coming in and having a complementary review you can get those answers to those questions of any of this makes sense for you\nFolks all you got to do is pick up the phone we will show you the way and all you got to do is invest time because it's not going to cost you one red

okay in retirement based on how much you've saved the date pick us up on this offer again for all colors are calling next Fifteen minutes\nThat have two hundred and fifty thousand dollar save for retirement give us a call one eight hundred seven for nine four to eight eight will get the financial road map review absolutely complementary and one of our neighborhood officers it's a tremendous

voting Brooks live in the W. S. B. twenty four hour news center our top story this hour when that county police are still actively searching neighborhoods in snow built for suspects implicated in the death of one of their officers this afternoon Antwon Tony was shot in the neck\nWhile responding to a suspicious vehicles behind Shiloh middle school around three PM today\nFor the suspect that basically a fired from inside the car the officers didn't have their weapons drawn or anything at that point there were things are patrol cars and walking up to the stuff that you haven't even had not even made contact with them yeah going\nThat police are working with multiple law enforcement agencies to locate suspects in urging Nobel residents remain indoors fifty eight degrees peach tree street and neither one is uh should be seeing a lot lower temperatures tonight in factories warnings for much of north eastern Georgia Atlanta is most accurate and dependable forecast is coming up\nOr we have representative John Ratcliffe\nAt talking about fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson well he's now say Medicaid he's going to plead the fifth he's not saying a word anymore\nOr he was on Fox News Sunday telling Maria ... that Glenn Simpson is unreal legal jeopardy in all of this you also confirmed that the FBI has evidence that directly refused the premise of a ... a Trump Russia probe in other words if there's been and remains exculpatory evidence\nThat was a great piece by Jonathan Turley ... three reasons mother may not charge Trump with obstruction apparently not asking any questions about it but\nSticking exclusively to whether or not there was any type of collusion which we all know the answer to a you have one top Republican lawmaker now saying the FBI failed to provide a\nFederal surveillance court with important evidence well we don't that now for a long time and we know that\nFor Pfizer court judges or handed information that was supposed to be verified and corroborated ended up being Hillary Clinton's bought and paid for Russian lies that was put together by fusion GPS interestingly funneled money through ... from the hiring of Christ is Christopher Steele up our national he doesn't even stand by the information and the CIA\nAnd it was the bulk of information to get for Pfizer warrants against the Trump campaign associate in the lead up to the twenty sixteen race\nAll this comes down to some simple basic fundamental things and they never told the ... the judges that it was Hillary Clinton it paid for this information and it's unbelievable that this could be happening in this country but it looks like we're finally begin to get to get to the bottom of it at least I Hope so Jason shape it's just with a\nFormer congressman Alan Fox News contributor author of New York times best seller the deep state\nWe have Victoria Toensing a job to Gen above up to ... with us a thank you both for being here let's start with Jason shape it's because this is your wheel house and it seems to me that it doesn't matter what Congress request as they seek to do their job of oversight they're never going to get the information\nFrom the department of justice and they're not going to get people they need to talk in front of them under oath\nWell the hard part about when you issue a subpoena when I was the chairman of the oversight commission or maybe I can issue a subpoena but the only way to look forward to it for the department of justice and so the weight of the paper really isn't worth much because the OJ won't enforce its own subpoena the subpoena issue by Congress\nThat the name that people need to also militarized themselves with is Marco Wyatt market why it was ... he was capital for the dance the he was capital for Hillary Clinton he was capital for a productive group he was involved there\nThis this guy sits in the middle of a lot of these transactions and the movement of money and I think more and more you'll start to see his name along with you know or in some sense of all these others\nI think the fact that the Simpson is now saying Victoria that was going to plead the fifth and can get away with that make them come in and plead the fifth you know the idea that they could just threaten to plead the fifth and not have to actually go through with it I think it's important\nThey see making show up and went in\nIt's the TV cameras treat that said it's ridiculous to accept a letter from the lawyers and and I hope they send you are talking to your former French and telling them to get them are getting in to the Congress to take\nThe fed and I don't care if they're not going to I'm In ... because I think there are other ways to to figure out how to do it you've got a subpoena used the peanut first and then you negotiate later\nYou don't say oh my God you didn't show up talking trying to work it out now you have to think about stand peanuts and then you say you can't make it Wednesday then you make it Thursday that I Can't believe there's no ...\nWell I mean I'm trying to understand I mean the president said that there would be de classification and all the materials the Jim Jordan was just talking about would be an redacted and we'd have a chance to see the ... the gang of eight information the three oh two between\nA Bruce or and Christopher Steele and how they wanted a funnel that information straight into Robert Mueller's office uh Joe diGenova but you know the idea of why do I think even with you and Victoria's my attorneys\nThat I wouldn't get away with just saying oh I'm going to plead the fifth leave me alone now or or not handing over subpoenaed materials to Congress\nWell I don't think there's any question that Congress has dropped the ball on course to get some subpoenas but let me just say this 'cause this is really important all the names that you heard Michael fuss than Mr liar Simpson\nOr all those people they are key to everything that was done in the United states what's fascinating is what happened in the United kingdom which we that Congress has it and can't issue buddy subpoenas for we now know that the FBI\nAnd my six and the G H cue to conduct electronic surveillance of Americans said he said it on foreign soil without legal authority to do so\nAnd that information what fact conversations of George Papadopoulos\nWere intercepted and in the course of intercepted he goes compensation they found out that off the top of it was not interested in Hillary email or anything else and they never gave information to the fight the court\nYou know it seems congressman shape it's that every piece of the puzzle now is falling in place I think we now understand\nWhat the insurance policy was Lisa Page testifying that in the nine months of the investigation leading up to the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller that they had no evidence of Trump Russia collusion at all\nAnd by the way even her lover Peter Struck said the same thing he said well I'd be all end if there was something there there's no there there\nAnd then all of a sudden we find the media elite strategy that they discussed this with Andrew McCabe comes in James Baker comes in and other people come in and what we see is again it goes back to the Clinton bought and paid ... that dossier information has leaked out to the media creating the impression that in fact there was Russia Trump collusion\nBut they did it themselves they took the again it's it's all they were doing the leaking so that they can appoint the special counsel so that in the which one could be good begin I is there any part of the puzzle that isn't clear to you because it's getting very clear to me\nDo it is becoming a crystal clear\nAnd that's why Jim Jordan is exactly right\nThe people that were in that meeting and river the timing of this evening this meeting happens directly after a district Colombia's relieved of his duties but just before a Mr Mueller is put into place and you have to understand who's in that meeting what was discussed it sounds like bakers being most candid about what was going on there\nBut each of the people in that meeting should be brought in for its own their own deposition uh transcribed under oath or before Congress you don't have these five minute little you know after you have questions\nWhen you do this and I've been in these big go for an hour for the Republican than the Democrats get type than another hour for Republicans and you can really get in depth information\nThey would do it that way\nWell Victoria I think that's true and that's right and that's just an that's fair but\nThe obstruction continually I Will take a break we'll come back more with Jason shape it's and Joe diGenova also but Dorian ... with us I Want to remind you our friends at my pillow they have

[noise] twenty four hour news weather and revise and AMC\nBe willing to [noise]\nKnow Sunday afternoon I'm Sheryl Castro alive and the ws being twenty four hour news center new at three o'clock we're following a breaking news story out of Jacksonville, Florida the Jacksonville sheriff's office says it's six adults were shot with three people in critical condition the sheriff's office says that suspect\nWas driving a gray silver four door vehicle stay with WSBIU radio for updates on this developing story and this all happened near where the jak wars play\nRight and I um I think you kind of hit the nail my head I think one of the reasons people don't know as much about what the attorney general does or should do is frankly attorney general hadn't been doing the things uh that they're supposed to do what the attorney general is supposed to do it is the best way to think about it is um [noise]\nUh in three ways one year the top prosecutor chief law enforcement official for the state of Georgia so um [noise]\nUh you know I was a gang prosecutor unfolding county right before I got into this race um so when we think about that one of the things I'm Talking about is um I'm going to build for the first time in history of the state of Georgia and organized crime and gang division within the attorney general's\nOffice suite we don't hear a lot about gang and organized crime in Georgia and I'm sure it's pervasive everywhere you hear about like in pockets certainly did for years in New York City now you hear about it maybe a lot uh you'd also LA sixty seventies now maybe in Chicago but we don't hear about it so how significant is it\nIt is significant if you think about it this way I'm all gangs and organized crime is is a group of people to get together\nAnd decided that uh they want to make money off in illicit activity now that illicit activity maybe narcotics illicit activity maybe human trafficking human trafficking is a hot topic in Georgia but that's unfortunately become a hub for it\nYeah now you know I've heard that and I don't even know what that means you know it's like you know we we work term is you know and our earliest or just the right location for that to be as it is it really the physical geography that makes us that way\nIt is it is certainly part of it you know anytime you know our airport our interstates have brought a lot of wealth an opportunity to our state but with that comes um illicit activities will\nYou know we have the busiest airport in the world um that brings with it um narcotics you know our port in Savannah brings with it human trafficking um and if anyone's talking about human trafficking and they're not talking about organized crime this your first clue they don't know what they're talking about because that's who's doing the human tracking\nRight now there's not one assistant attorney general working on human trafficking there's not one assistant attorney general working on organized crime gangs and it's not like we're you know what I'm going to be doing is reinventing the wheel I mean in New York they've been they've had an organized crime division for almost one hundred years\nSo I mean isn't there a CBS like MCI organized crime unit I mean it just seems like right you see you see it on TV right but it's surprising that you would think that every state would have won\nWell and that's the thing is that you know obviously I was in the gang unit Fulton County there's you know there are capable prosecutors at the local da in local da's office is as well as in the U.S attorneys' offices and there's three U.S attorneys in Georgia but there's only one attorney general there's only one elected person\nWith statewide jurisdiction and it's that lack of leadership and coordination that his hamstring in our ability to combat this crisis and I'll think about it this way\nLocal DA's office is local agencies is all they can do to respond you know there was a shooting there was a drug busts 'em there's murder they respond collect evidence and they fought you know they go where that evidence leads to whatever prosecution\nBut without statewide coordination and leadership nobody's ... who are the most violent organized crime syndicates operate in our state\nAnd again it can dots being connected exactly just trying to deal with one event but not connecting the dots to the last ten advance right maybe would indicate something better\nAnd it's not the fault of the agencies or the local ... like I said I was a line prosecutor I was doing it it you don't have the resources to reach the jurisdiction the man woman power to be able to combat that you can only do that at the statewide level which is why it's badly needed why I'm going to build that division so\nThat's the prosecutor side I was in one writer ... chief prosecutor right to\nTo you are the only one you mentioned the tobacco litigation and opioid litigation you're the only entity that can bring a suit on behalf of the people that you\nHave the attorney general can the only ... ... is the only one who can brings you don't have to now if the attorney general is going to join with other attorneys general do they have to do it separately first at the state level\nOr can they just jump right into the group um you can do it a couple of different ways um and I say this because it seems like often there are certain like it's like the the New York state attorney general always seems to be like the leader sure and and then there's a lot of it like you know kind of jump on for the ride\nRight there are certain states that have taken leadership positions and pushing forward on certain issues you said New York\nFor the Republicans you see that at a Texas uh the attorney general there can packs and has been kind of leader on the right he's the one that you know led the charge on a CIA right which I Know we're going to get to it it's at some point um\nSo uh in sometimes if you filed suit in conjunction with other uh other states [noise]\nThis role of bringing a suit on behalf of the people in Georgia in Georgia right now we've not had a significant piece of consumer litigation on behalf of the people of Georgia since\nBack litigation in the nineties Twenty years I I Am\nAnd give me some examples of things that you would have put on that list right that that maybe somebody should have been paying attention right\nPayday lenders predatory debt collectors you know you ... the ... yet predatory debt collectors that um buy up I don't want to get too much into ways but they buy up small dead zone parking tickets and things like that they bought for pennies on the dollar and then they go about and collect at\n'em and that's how they make a profit they their their bed is they're going to be able to collect more than whatever the pay right but a lot of some a lot of times they use predatory practices to do that\nFor instance do call and threatened hey you're going to get locked up if you don't pay this okay well that's that's the legal the only person that can bring an action against someone doing that is the attorney general so that's a predatory debt collector\nPayday lenders that are preying on the most vulnerable in our society um to charge usually rates\nWay above um what is allowable\nAnd only ... percent thirty percent of good God much higher than that sometimes two hundred and three hundred percent route and so um you know anybody in the state of Georgia doesn't think that\nI'd be I Would challenge anyone to find someone that doesn't think that there are special interest that exploding Georgia's whether that's payday lenders predatory debt collectors\nPharmaceutical companies engaged in price fixing pharmaceutical companies engaged and deceptive marketing ... for instance any of those things that has to be the the attorney general and\nUm my own it in this race has donations from some of those entities that I just listed out\nAnd we haven't seen the action and the two years he's been in office or in the many years a prior to that so\nBecause somebody be pointing a finger at you and your donations to say yeah you know everybody dirty in this thing\nI mean they can try but they're not going to find any payday lenders predatory debt collectors pharmaceutical companies oil companies are not going to find any of that in my donations so they can do I mean there are open for the\nPublic or to look on I'm proud that I have um\nOver three hundred excuse me over three thousand individual donors regular people average donation to my campaign is quite love a regular people support in this campaign\nWere coming back we're going to get into beyond\nJust the top three will get to the third so we've got prosecutor and

general\nOf the state we're taking your calls a course for for a seven to zero seven fifty\nSo so Charlie this jump right in because obviously it's been\nI guess we're running on what eight years now for a CIA the Affordable CARE Act better known to many as Obamacare um\nUh and and the debate continues ... um what's interesting about his usually debates and when the facts replace supposition\nAnd projections and now we have the facts and we know there have been tens of millions of people who have gained insurance we have costs in various states which have expanded Medicaid\nAnd and and so we know what the data and it appeared to be a pretty resounding success that every major health care ... advocacy organization has supported\nAnd yet in our state we don't have\nA a ca Medicaid expansion right and so I Want to talk but ac first and and and what we know in the white behind it and how many states remain now because many of the quote unquote red states have already embraced expansion of Medicaid ... and the bigger sense then let's get to the Medicaid expansion\nSure so I'm\nRight now in specific to the attorney general's office um\nMy opponent or as you me and then every person in this state involved in litigation and in front of a federal judge in Fort Worth Texas to declare the entire Affordable Care act unconstitutional results of which would be [noise] not only would overnight\nFour hundred thousand Georgians lose a their health care because they're on the exchange um but a a a should say the ... the elected governor\nGovernor aimed would not be able to expand Medicaid the option would go away if my opponent is successful in his suit um and then the third big pieces that would cover but\n... and and and maybe for some clarity on the opposition the suit that that could bring down the A. C.

and\nFive and a um\n[noise]\nRight well it's it's it's due to policy you know I mean\nThings get better or to get worse depending on how much attention gets paid and why I've always enjoyed public policy is you know you can make big changes that have huge impacts on people's lives for better or for worse\nAh and and um\nWe've kinda gotten away from that in politics now people really kinda concentrate on the headlines in the short term objectives and we don't have much uniform vision or you know at the at the national level and you can just tracking all the way down and you know those what our goal\nFor those oldest me you'll remember things you'll remember when President Kennedy you know had the initiative you know for kids and how to and how they should be healthy and the fitness test and we put into place seatbelts and and then there was the anti smoking campaign I mean and when you think about the impact of those initiatives they were absolutely huge\nYeah and they change your life I mean you know this isn't really health related will kind of is but you know the national highway system when you know the federal government decided to build a national highway system it didn't say we got an idea about a highway system\nY'all try to figure out how to link it altogether through these you know all the states you know they said this is the national highway says we're going to invest in this because it's good for our economy and that's the same goes for health care and the Affordable CARE Act is a great example of that\nSo so you were you were a proponent of the Affordable CARE Act them and there's a lot of it's so complicated right because the ... the Affordable CARE Act that was originally proposed is not what is actually in place today and there's been so many changes are so many legislative you know\nTwo weeks to it but but in the end twenty more million people ended up having health care and health or health insurance that would allow them to have regular healthcare\nInstead of urgent healthcare right and a lot of the stats suggest that people are healthier as a result of it and and those people are also having less costs overall cost of healthcare\nUm do you really think that we're at risk of losing\nA CIA it depends on who gets elected\nI mean it it depends on who has control of the Congress it depends on who's making the decisions and and there is still this ... you know nascent political idea that somehow or providing health insurance for people and covering preexisting conditions is is not a good thing\nSo there there's a breeze drifting conditions it it seems like it's overwhelming Seventy plus percent ... and I'm guessing that for the thirty plus percent who don't believe in pre existing condition exclusion coverage um or inclusion coverage spending and how you would\nExplain that but but basically you're covered regardless of pre existing condition um that it when I think about whoever the opposed to that obviously doesn't understand exactly\nIn there they haven't looked around their family if they don't have a pre existing\nThey actually had a ... a couple of weeks ago and I it's like you know I said but there for the grace of God go why I said you know I worked as an oncologist you know doing patient care for twenty five years and every day somebody came you know I saw someone generally someone knew who I looked across the table and I said oh my God that could be me\nUm maybe it maybe it could be me maybe can my parent maybe it could be my child but literally these things happen and they're devastating um and and so you know part of that is not focusing on just your immediate but being able to have some vision as you said of a future and the things that you know where the risks are in the future um\nWe think about again that that help the community because crime impacts healthy communities transportation was a big issue for you and I'm curious about how you translate that in terms of helping communities\nOut you know transportation is a big deal I mean just to give you some practical example though you know I Lived in Washington DC\nFor about five years working working a and policy there and when I moved back to Atlanta I gain ten pounds in about six months and it was because I wasn't walking anymore you know in in DC I didn't have a car and I took public transportation or you know and it was crazy and it's like oh my God why am I gaining weight like to lose weight I got a good move back to D.C a good\nBuddy of mine is an attorney he was asked by his office if he

that you have if you don't have good sidewalks people aren't inclined to use them you're probably going to see higher rates of obesity it might be you know small amounts but to the individual it could really trigger you know good health or bad house\n... ... and again that and then you have that it's got the tip of the iceberg\nEffect because you've got then all those individual start to be additive when they start doing incur healthcare costs yeah and so on the individual level it doesn't look like it's a big deal but it becomes a big deal when there's larger numbers that's right um\nSo you were very instrumental in the ... but the bottom line was not just about kind of addressing I don't know what it was about to be honest and the arms of its original vision I mean what was it about
