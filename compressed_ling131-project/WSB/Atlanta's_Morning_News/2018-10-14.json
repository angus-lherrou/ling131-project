Nineteen people killed in hurricane Michael's a monster storm packing one hundred and fifty five mile an hour wind destroying hundreds of homes and businesses WSBIU news time five oh one [noise]\nUm but regardless of the world begins to react and then it spread it wasn't just a drop in the U.S will begin to see at the end of this a drop really across the whole international marketing people began to really wonder is this the end now if you're someone who watches the market you know\nThat right now we're sitting on the longest bull market ever OK ever bull market meaning the market has been up since two thousand nine you know we had the crash in two thousand eight but if you hit the bottom and two thousand nine and it began to recover\nAnd since then it's been up up up and we've seen some minor debts but the last few years\nHardly any significant it so people are waiting for the shoe to drop understandably\nBecause here's a hand a correction will come it will come it could be in five years it could be in five days no one knows but the market will take a turn and the other direction so people are waiting for that and depending on where you're at and your investment journey you're definitely waiting for that if you're close to retirement right now\nYou were thinking often probably about what happens if the market drops and so\nWhen the market began to drop and stayed that way or the S. and P. was down for six straight sessions that begins to be\nIncreasingly intense hit to the get every day of is this that change and then there's a follow up question there am I ready for this and that's what I Want to hone in on\nA project as if there's one thing that we can win with here this one area where this could truly be revolutionary can give you peace like you've not had\nBefore can make you confident about retirement it's if you let yourself ask that question am I ready was I ready for this am I ready for what might be coming I'm going to tell you exactly what to do with that we're not going to leave it up in the air\nOr we're going to dig in deep first if you're just joining us this is Chris Burns you're listening to more than money and we're going to break down everything that's happened\nThe last number of days the market took a significant\nA turn towards a drop and then it kind of stabilized on friday and that's where we sit right now and it might be that it just keeps on going up um but we don't want to miss the impact of this or really again not the impact globally but the impact on our lives on our journey toward the future towards your dream so\nAgain if you missed the first part of the show jump on my website it's my life is more dot\nCom and you can catch that okay so let's talk for a minute about\nWhat begins to happen days into this ... this one area specifically that I wanted to do and that is the desire for an explanation\nOkay did you start seeing explanations come out pretty fast\nI mean every single day if you read the financial publication of the wall Street Journal for instance read that and the market's down at all it's going to give an explanation for why it's down that's the best guess they can give but the reality is\nExplanations are usually worthless they're usually not help for them to tell you why when when the market begin to drop two different explanations came forward you might have noticed as if you're watching the first one\nAnd that President Trump gave he in but I saw people give it before heated and most folks that we are huge fans of President Trump went along with this and that was this was all the feds fault the Federal Reserve's fault\nBecause the Federal Reserve is raising interest rates because the economy is so strong they're trying to keep interest rates up so the economy doesn't overheat\nYeah of what the Federal Reserve is doing but when interest rates go up there is usually turmoil in the market there's a level of anxiety about inflation rising\nOkay so President Trump came out and actually said that this is the Fed's fault you got a lot of criticism because presidents don't normally say that but you saw a whole lot of people get in line behind in the here's the deal there is no shock or surprise here that he came out and said that\nBecause guess what politicians want to be able to give a reason that is not them for why things aren't going well it was a smart political play I Want to make sure you guys see it's not my fault if it was without the fed interfering what the fed raising interest rates everything will be fine this week it's the fed\nSo if you're unhappy the unhappy with them they're the cause of this let's shift some blame okay and then folks that that don't like President Trump gave it competing explanations well no it's not the fed it's it's a trade policy with China\nIt's the risk of a trade war\nThat's the issue and you're the you're the problem President Trump you're the one Institute in this trade where we have no reason for this but you're pushing it and because that's the whole the whole market's going to go down\nShe saw the suddenly these too boring explanations for what was going on and shock shark here right they lined up along political lines people like President Trump saying it's the feds fault the fed needs to back off\nNot presidents drums for people that don't like President Trump saying that was it's a trade deal with China that's the issue here's the problem with that nonsense it's that you can go back one month and look at both of those issues okay interest rates going up\nAnd the trade difficulties with China\nAnd we've been talking about them for months\nThere not knew there was this sudden change in fact if anything things look a little less intense than the trade dispute with China looked way more intense a few weeks ago it may become more intense again but it wasn't like something happened\nLast week that was crazy with that deal and the same with inflation we've known about the the the fed continuing to raise 'em raise interest rates has been known for months and months nothing unexpected it's happened there\nSo you're telling me we've known both of these things but all of a sudden last week those were because the market to go down no those were just convenient explanations for and here's the key for something that's unknowable\nThe market is not some logical college professor that suddenly says hey you know what I think we should adjust to a little bit and drop the market a little bit it's doesn't work that way the market is far more like my three year old\nTruly you need to understand the true nature of the market\nTo be able to respond well to it in the markets more like a three year old market toddler than it is some sort of logical institution it is reactive\nIt is instinctual and here's the key is unpredictable if my daughter wants to play hide and seek and I'm trying to chase her around\nAnd she suddenly darts left it's not because she sat and thought about the impact of that it's because you know she just had that instinct she's unpredictable and the market is that way you know why it's that way because it's driven by thousands hundreds of thousands millions of factors that is not driven by one overriding thing\nIt's just not\nAnd then you have the reality of the mob mentality of group think\nThat if someone starts to pull out of stocks other people go holy cow I should be pulling out too and you see this massive ripple effect in huge numbers of people are pulling out and they're not pulling out necessarily for any one reason is because that's where the mob is going\nThat's how the market works and yet every time there's a drop guess what we want to get an explanation for it this is something psychologists call the narrative fallacy maybe you've heard of this before the narrative fallacy that we humans desire order we desire to be able to make sense of something\nAnd so we regularly do this and everything it was a great article about this [noise]\nUh I don't even remember what was from unfortunately but I read an article a while ago about this and it talks about how we have this nature as humans to create a narrative whether it's in biographies we read\nWhere it tries to now make sense of someone's life and and give real concrete easy explanations of well they were raised this way so they became this way we loved that we love story we love things working out\nBut the reality is some things don't follow a set narrative\nIn the market hardly ever has a easy cause effect relationship but just doesn't\nAnd here's why this matters I mean you're listening you're going out okay that's fine who cares market was dropping it matters because if I Believe I can clearly define why the market is going down that impacts the way I think about investing right if I go well it's it's clearly because of trade war with China\nAnd I can look and see that then maybe next time I see\nTrade war brewing I'm going to become very conservative because I Know what happens when trade wars happen we have this drop in the market so\nThat cause effect can be very dangerous 'cause it turns from we look historically at what's happened we create a cause effect relationship and then we apply that to the future and now that influences the way we think about future investment decisions in them that is going to kill you that is going to destroy your long term investments to this the first thing to see here\nIs that there was no easy root cause for what happened last week\nThere was a whole lot of little things and then a whole lot of groups change in group mob mentality and suddenly we saw the market dropping in anyone's going to try to eat offer an easy explanation for that\nHas an agenda\nAnd no offense to either side the the the Trump folks saying it was a fad or anti Trump folk saying that was China a trade war both of them are just trying to find an easy explanation when that's just not reality it's just not reality\nAnd some of you were unhappy hearing that because I'm offending you politically because either way that's going to offend someone politically right because both sides are mentioned here here's the deal this is not political okay but the market dropping\nIs not usually a political thing certainly government economic decisions influence the mark and I'm not saying that\nThought am saying is that it's not as clean as just oh this person made this decision so there was a crops now you know what the market is a political the market dropped for all sorts of reasons let's not turn it into a political thing and leverage is a political weapon to hit our friends with\nThe reality is we need to learn from this because we don't know what's going to happen in the market please don't look at\nPresident Trump scheduled to visit the hardest hit areas of Florida this week at least Nineteen people killed in hurricane Michael the falcons will be

for by Chris Burns investors financial hey welcome back\nTo more than money this is Chris Burns thank you so much for joining us today listen uh we had a very important first half of the show we're going to continue it now because we're talking about the incredible lesson to be learned from the market drop over the past week things stabilize friday\nBut before you just write the whole thing off and move on with life please don't waste this week\nThey literally learning from and leveraging what you've learned from the last few days could change the course of your future of your retirement\nI'm not overstating the police here me don't waste the market drop of the last number of days if you missed the first part of the show go to my website it's my life is more dot com you can listen to this show and passed shows an Atkins\nIs key ask any questions you have\nAs you're listening and you can do that through the Web site um we answer questions every week folks and then and this is one where I Hope to get your thoughts and questions because it's really really matters gave we're going to dig deeper into this but again that's my life is more dot com to hear the first part of the show\nWhere I Want to go from here is understanding how you respond them how you can change your portfolio if you need to based on what happened the last number and it's because remember\nIt we've been sitting on top of a bull market here's a danger of that\nWay back way back ancient history in two thousand six two thousand seven right do you remember how you were invested back then many of you don't\nBut I bet you remember two thousand eight right two thousand eight everything dropped the market had the ... the worst drop since the great depression and when that\nHappened people became super concerned about their investments they became very worried about what if the market drops again are we ready for that et cetera because we lost so much but every year since two thousand nine since this bull market began\nThe anxiety and the fear faded a little bit more and more than I was so many people today that are taking a ton of risk in their portfolios and they don't even realize it\nBecause they're comfortable because the market has been up in that my friends is maybe the most dangerous thing that could happen right now is that you could especially if you're closer to retirement so we're going to talk about two different groups people folks that are within shouting distance of retirement are already retired\nAnd then the younger folks somebody younger I mean everything from twenties thirties forties people that still have a solid decade plus until they want to retire because it really is two different discussions both matter I Want you to hear both but it's it's the kind of different action points here\nBut if you're closer to retirement there could be nothing more dangerous than you having become complacent about risk\nAnd yet it'd be totally normal because the market's been up I mean amazing growth in fact it's kind of made us all feel like investment geniuses right I made a lot of people that come in and say hey you know I got an investing figure it out like give me your thoughts but just to understand I kinda know what I'm doing look at my portfolio the last few years is killing it\nAnd I don't want to make them feel bad but I Want to tell them look my golden retriever could've invested just as well over the last five years friend because it's not some magical thing to invest well when the market shooting up when they asked them be as well over three hundred percent growth\nThrough the ... since two thousand eight it doesn't take a genius to to see growth\nAnd yet people kind of stride and yeah I'm doing you know I'm I'm pretty good at what I Do I Know what I'm doing look anybody is good at what they're doing in fact the only shock has been people who have found a way to lose money\nOver the last number of years that's where you scratch your head and go that took some time it took effort for you to figure out how you would lose funds but if you're a four O. one K. your IRA you're an individual stocks are up don't tell me it's because you're a genius maybe you are a genius no sense to you\nBut everybody's accounts are up friend\nIt doesn't matter how well you do when the market's up what really matters is when it goes down which we know what's coming are you ready for that\nAre you ready especially if you're close to retirement\nAnd that's why I Can't say I'm Out of a annoy you to death but you won't forget it until I'm blue in the face please don't waste this week because it gave you a taste of how your portfolio responds\nWhen the market drops and so again like I mentioned before the break the first thing to do here is to take an honest look at how it did how do how aggressive are you in a in some of you listening you don't know because you weren't looking at it\nUm because you don't care about that very much or not you didn't even notice the market was down that's fine taking minutes a day and just log into your four one K.\nLook at how it's doing in your IRA and then some of you I mentioned this last time it's really hard for you to judge how your quote unquote investments did in the drunk 'cause you got ten different investment accounts you've been at three different companies you left you left her four one K. there you have a rough IRA that somebody told you was a good idea to start\nWhatever you've got all these different fun sitting out there and they're all invested differently\nAnd it would take you forty five minutes to log in each one of them and see how they did in the last few days if that's the case that's where I brought up the the incredible importance of getting an analysis done that shows you that groups all those together puts in every single investment you're in and can tell you this is the risk\nWhen we bring it all together 'cause that's all that matters\nI don't just want to know how much risk there isn't that four one K. you've had for a year and a half I Want to know about all the funds you've had before so you can make a decision about am I too aggressive and when I said too aggressive or not aggressive enough I don't mean that there is some right amount for everybody that's nonsense\nThat's nonsense right a lot of people come in and they say what is the right level of risk how much risk should I be taking I don't really know them yet and I say you know there is no quote unquote right level of risk across the board and all the risk is truly truly is based on your situation\nAnd I've talked about this many times there's two factors to figuring out your risk the first is how do you feel about risk the second is how is your plan feel about risk let's talk about that for one second here okay if you're close to retirement\nOver the last week it is critical stop everything if you forget anything else I said that they\nCheck your investments after this drop because you need to know where you said you need to know and my super aggressive is that Saddam it or on my retirement account is somewhere above Seventy right on my Seventy eighty percent inequities 'cause if you are and you're close to retirement\nThere are every once in a while people that should be that aggressive close to retirement maybe you have a whole lot of guaranteed income and you've got pensions et cetera and you go you know what I don't even have to rely on my investments\nMy grandparents are in this boat to get my grandparents\nThey have numerous pensions of talked about them before\nI'm literally or both of them have Social Security but then my grandfather has a pension from from teaching plus the pension from the military and my grandmother has a pension from teaching they've got five streams of income coming in okay it's more than they need every month so they never touched their investments they've never had to\nSew could they afford to be a little more aggressive if they wanted to be sure\nBecause that just really don't need those investments in less than a worst case scenario they can afford to have a little more aggressive but if you have\nTo if you're the majority of people today and most people listening\nThat are close to retirement or in this boat if you uh plan on having to draw from your investments in order to have income which is the norm okay then you really probably don't have any business being aggressive as you get this close to retirement the five years prior to retirement\nAnd that was it was far too moderate I said you really probably no let me take away the moderating words you shouldn't be that aggressive\nIf you have to take income from your investments and you're within five years of retirement you really have no business being invested aggressively\nAnd I would put that is really anywhere above about sixty five Seventy percent equities as you don't have business to be there\nNow there are exceptions like I mentioned like my grandparents most people don't have the business to be there but here's the problem\nWe don't realize that because we've been sitting on years and years and years of the market going up now it's snuck up on this\nCase that you need to understand the risk\nAnd if you're close to retirement even if you feel aggressive okay even if you're fine with going after it and you're fine with them to market going down and you didn't even notice\nLast week what was going on I really don't care if you're close to retirement that you personally feel fine with risk I care about what happens to your plan if the market drops I mean I'll be nice about it\nAnd I'm bumping you forty three year old in here younger people with more than ten years to work until you retire how did you respond this week because that is the test that is what tells you if you thought they strong impulse to move your money out then you need to know\nHoly cow maybe I Need to be a little more conservative\nSo that I stick with it not 'cause my plans in danger because I'm In danger of wrecking my plan by moving everything out if the real for real correction happens or if you didn't even notice this\nAnd you don't even ... you're not some of the ... are you heard about in your ads finally got years left\nThan you'd better be aggressive take advantage of that if that's your personality you should be more aggressive but regardless how did you respond then again\nAnyone listening right now if you sit and go you know I honestly hadn't even thought about it I kind of was a little worried but I saw the market came back up friday so whatever this that is wasting an opportunity to make sure\nYou capture this now before we see the real correction make sure you take advantage of this and adjust your risk either whether you're closer to retirement to make sure your plans going to be okay or if you're younger to make sure that you're taking full advantage of the market but you're not so aggressive that you're going to pull out now is the time to figure that out\nHow to me and my point and my aunt or if you want to do that I Would love to help you my team would love to help the arts all we do every day than it was hundreds of folks around Atlanta and around the country and would love to do that for you to help you figure out how do I have a plan\nThat truly is fit to my situation my risk tolerance my plan you know what I can handle what my plan can handle not just so I'll be okay not just so I'm not bankrupt in retirement but so that I can reach the dreams I have\nWhatever that is and if you've never done that before\nIf you've never looked at that it is such a a a feeling of peace and excitement about the future when you go from responding and reacting to a drop like this to feeling confident that the next time the market goes down and you can say with confidence I'm going to be okay the neatest call that I had this week\nWas from a client who retired just in the last few years and we went back and forth and his process I remember so clearly when he was in the process with us\nTalking about risk and him wanting to be more aggressive in pushing back and saying your plan doesn't need this aggressive in some fashion could damage it and we pulled back to us are reasonable moderate account and he called me a\nWhen the market was dropping this last week and just said hey I just want to say thank you for pushing on me here\nBecause I remember how stressed I was in two thousand eight when the market was dropping and when the market was dropping this week it just didn't have power over me that was\nAmazing it's such a neat often the feedback I get is not as excited we're worried they're calling in their ...\nBut it was so neat to get feedback from someone saying it just doesn't have that control over me what would it be like for you to look at the future and not have to feel anxiety about a change in the market or about a long term care issue something coming up on expected about a storm like Michael coming out of the blue\nAnd wrecking the southeastern coast right it's crazy how would it feel to know you have a plan that can whether that\nBecause that's what we do it folks every day if you want that jump on my website it's my life is more dot com sign up for a free consultation with me\nChris Burns with someone from my team to talk about your situation because if you want that plan that's what we do every single day my life is more dot com All right let's\nInto our lightning round of waxed eloquent enough here and answer some questions we got this week we'll get to as many as we can if you have a question about anything you've heard today or something totally different based on your situation where you'd like some advice go to that website it's my life is more dot com\nYou can ask anything there and we will get back to a lot of those we get to do on the show here first question was from Jan\nJan writes I heard all week that rising interest rates are hurting the market but you've talked before about interest rates going up being a good thing can you explain I'm Jen thanks for writing and yeah that's a great point so a number of shows ago I talked about interest rates going up it's not that it's a good thing it's that it's two sides of the coin\nOkay and here's the problem we tend to look it will use the market again at the market goes down and it's good or bad will no it totally depends on how you respond\nAnd on your situation right it can be great for some folks in terrible for other folks it's it's not just black or white and same thing with interest rates interest rates going up first of all I taught at the beginning of this show about\nIt it's not fair to say that interest rates going up as making the market drop let's just just not true it's it's a much bigger picture of not but\nInterest rates going up can be a bad thing in some ways right one way is that a ... for about mortgages for instance right of your mortgage mortgage rates are going up that's not great most of us would like to be able to get a mortgage\nSuper cheap like we've gotten in for the last number of years but there was a flip side of this I talked about a little bit earlier and that's the people nearing retirement or in retirement\nHaven't been able to get any sort of decent return on low risk money\nBecause interest rates are so low so whereas if I'm buying a house I'm loving interest rates being low if I'm trying to get a return on my money and I don't want to be aggressive I've been struggling because interest rates are so low two sides of the coin let me give you an example of this we just had announced this week\nThe new growth in the Social Security payments for next year so Social Security when you begin receiving it gets these cost of living adjustments and they have often been pathetic because they're tied to interest rates\nInterest rates right but this year they just announced that his two point eight percent it's almost three percent growth that's the best it's been in ... years since two thousand twelve okay why because interest rates are going up so let's wine and feel terrible about oh interest rates are going up\nYou know are the markets struggling because of that at the same time a whole host of Americans in retirement are going to get paid more this next year because interest rates are going up it's just not as simple as black or white\nAnd so the question is how do you capitalize how do you make sure your plan is ready Janet forever your ad\nFor rising interest rates because they're coming one way or the other um thank you so much for writing a great question next question is from Bill Bill writes\nI work with a financial advisor he manages our investments\nBut don't see any management fee on my statement how do you track dollars spent in fees buildings running and yeah this is super confusing one of the first things I Do with clients when they come and in fact in that first initial consultation um when someone sits down with us I sit and explain to them every way that we get paid\nAnd how they'll see it and where they'll see it and what it is because fees and payment in my industry has been opaque for so long and so many advisors don't ever talk about this and yet it influences the decisions they make so let me say in your case if you don't see a management fee on your statement\nHe is the one that put you in the investments it's probably because he got paid commission\nSo when I manage money for people with my for manages money\nThere is a ... a fixed fee that's paid for that management regardless of where we put them so if you're in stocks a B or C it doesn't matter which one you're in and we get paid the same amounts of flat fee for managing it\nSo there's no incentive to move you around but the other way people get paid in my industry here is for from commissions and that would be putting you in a mutual fund and then up front getting paid a big chunk of money\nBut they're not paid to manage it\nAnd that's not always about things not black or white but I'll tell you the danger is that I see often is that because I was paid that big chunk up front\nAnd now I have no incentive beyond that that besides my goodwill and being a good person what's keeping me managing the money well what is incentivizing me to do is actually to move you again in the near future so I can get paid another commission and I see this disturbingly regularly people come in and go I don't know why my advisors telling me to move\nMy money and even before I look at their statement I usually able to tell them\nI'm going to guess it's because it's commission account and they want to get paid again and unfortunately that is totally normal in our industry so most likely bill he's paid via commissions and that's why you don't see any funds coming out because you already paid a big chunk of money when you bought those funds which just means be very careful\nIf he comes back to you and says we need to move the money soon 'cause there is a dollar tag attached to that for you All right that's all the time we have that they listen if you missed everything else remember this don't waste this week the market dropping this week was a great time for you to evaluate am I ready for the real drop when it happens\nIs my plan going to work he will be back\nNext week with a whole new show in the meantime this is Chris Burns you've been listening to more than money please remember your life\nAnd your future are so much more than money and we'll see you next week\nWhen you ask me about ... er Cox media group station [noise]\nAt one of those twenty four hour news weather man from\nAbout five and am sent\nMe this\nMorning at six am I'm Robin ... live in the ws the twenty four hour news center with our top story this hour Georgia's winning streak comes to an end as the dogs loose to LSU thirty six sixteen\nIs not the most dominating last forever but it's close\nThey played better when I say I think that's easily said look at the state law that play more physical and we do they attacked us that's\nGoing to be smart does that show LSU rushing for two Seventy five of the most UGA has allowed I guess that SEC opponent for years they were they\nSafety Richard lookout both teams now six and one was unimportant by we coming for Georgia\nBe specific about everything but there are a lot of things in the book that are actually true\nThis is my feeling my feeling is that at some point someone's going to tell the story I didn't want to tell a story for twenty plus years and I said to my publisher you know let's just go ahead and tell it you know it's a fun story about the way it's not it's not an ... on the court but it's fun I mean it's it it deals with two of Harvard's most important books\nOne book was in the private library of King James to first and has two missing pages in it and scholars for decades have been trying to figure out where are those pages and what was written on those pages the other book is the last remaining book from John Harvard's donation his collection to Harvard\nAll the other books burned in a fire in the Seventeen hundreds and only one remained because a student and returned back to the library so these two books as well as the disappearance of the students trying to break into one of these mansions and the Nineteen twenties is the centerpiece of this mystery\n... what can you tell us about the story and what can you tell us about the title the ancient nine\nSo the ancient nine I'm as a group these men who comprise ancient I'm at form a secret society with in the ... decided so even the members of the ... which I was a member of even members don't know the true identities of who these nine guys are\nBut the nine guys are protecting the secrets that are buried in the walls of the club\nUm and I won't say what these secrets are but I Will say to use that for years students have tried to break into these clubs because they are believed to hold valuable treasures and artifacts and so these clubs are heavily alarmed\nCameras all over the place and fortified because people have now and my club Matt Damon is a member So Matt Damon the actor or came in after me and\nIf the guy gimme camel has no time for exactly that guy that [laughter] right\n[noise] um so ... was a member ... quick story\nWhen you have we hold events very formal events black tie event you ask was there was a ... in a club we hold dinners there we are managers have servants\nThey have ballrooms lunch rooms so when we hold these big dinners and all the lumps come back and black tie smoking cigars we actually have posters that had been drawn to commemorate that particular event and we all signing we autograph it with our years\nAnd So Matt Damon of course was a member so he autographed you know one of the posters and then Matt Damon became Matt Damon\nAnd someone broke in and stole his poster that he had signed and so after that you know you know security of of course was ramped up but for years students have tried to break into these clubs for all kinds of reasons because of these treasures\nSo the secrets especially in your club if you're a member of the secret society you know what the secrets art right\nIf you're a member of the you know those secrets but the ... of the ancient nine you don't know there's a group of men of a there's a group that's really controlling things behind the scenes that you don't know\nAnd these are real people today\nWho hold\nThese secrets who're titans of industry or in government and they've all emerged out of one of these final clubs like the one that you belong to at Harvard what\nWas interesting and what's unfair and I think a big one of the reasons why women should be allowed to join these clubs is that when you joined these clubs you have access to a tremendously powerful networking you can contact\nCEOs a fortune five hundred companies partners in law firms anybody because if because if they're in the club directory and you called and say hey I'm so and so classes so and so\nThen oh yeah they'll take the call put them through you know\nAnd if you know other students unfortunately\nDon't have that access so I personally believe that club dream more open even though I had a great experience\nUm and it was fun and some of the brothers are still my friends a lot of them are but I think that you know women should be allowed to join more minorities should be allowed to join 'em and it's a it's a tussle right now on campus and it has been by the way for hundreds of years um how do you get these clubs to understand that it's better that they open up and there are a lot of\nLot of guys who don't want them open and they and they fight it and um you know\nSo there were no women and your club\nThere were no women in my club but right now as we speak there was a huge debate going on within my club and others about finally admitting women\nHow many African American men were or are in your club when I was in the club there were four of us\nOut of about a hundred guys maybe four or five of us you know a which is not a lot you know I was in a club in the eighties uh but the first guy\nI think got an about Seventy six 'cause we have all the pork is on our walls of the classes\nAnd I went and found that first guy that got and had this big afro by the way and I I always want to and you contacted them to you know I Wish I I I always wanted to meet this guy never was able to get a find him you know I was just a a teenager I didn't you know and we didn't have Internet by the way then uh we didn't have all the tools to be able to\nYou know but I always wanted to know who that guy was you know but uh\nBut it's interesting you know and people asked me did you experience racism\nNot not a bit of I guess at that level you don't there was none whatsoever I didn't feel it and I'm I'm very sensitive I grew up you know my grandfather's\nFrom the south so I'm very well aware of you know racial situations and never experienced it but the main character in a book expensive colleges actually meet\n'em you know the son of a single mom who struggles and you know I hadn't like I said I had no idea what these clubs were what they were about and someone just decided to invite me to be a member and to this day I don't know why like why me because I don't I'm everything you're not\nYou know I don't have a legacy I don't have a name didn't have money no connections but I got to admit it\nAnd how has that how has that experience benefitted you as an alone\nI think that being in that club opened up my eyes to a larger world and to the power of connections I'm you know the ... I say in the book that the character goes is big talked to a party at one their lumps house and it's the first time he's sharing kids his age\nTalk about taking their fathers playing to the ... bombers for the weekend\nFirst of all I didn't know that there are private planes and these kids are saying yeah dad that using as plain as we can go to the Bahamas this is how these people live um and so it was my first experience of experiencing this and I think that it open my\nEyes open my eyes that there's a whole world out there of connections that you don't know about and that you should be aware of you may not be able to join that world but you should know that it exists and you know the playing field is not always level for all kinds of reasons and you should just be aware of that\nSo walk us through the story that you're telling in the ancient nine\nIn Nineteen twenty seven to get a trying to break into the ... mansion on Halloween Night one kid gets in and disappears\nFast forward to the eighties when I was there a this young black student is mysteriously punched or invited to begin the process of joining this club\nAnd his best friend ironically is a legacy his best friend is a white guy who's a Boston Brahmin whose family's been at Harvard for three generations\nWho is irreverent he will not joining one of these clubs just despite his father he does not like his father his father's very upper crust and he wants to be everything that his father is not so you have this black kid who comes from nothing who's being invited Mr posted it on this club\nAnd you have a best friend who is this white guy who knows all about these clubs because of his family but refuses to join in but what the white guy does know his name is don't and would do it and does know\nIs that the ancient nine had been rumored to exist for a long time and even he is curious to see if it exists so the two of them work to discover\nWho the ... is and what is the secret that they're trying to hide oh\nThat's very intriguing as very very strong tea [laughter] so uh how long before I mean we've seen we've seen similar types of stories the skulls jak white people that have network yeah social network that have\n... of course I'm explored these final clubs you think this is going to you know I'd be able to option this one out of all I just got an offer [laughter] see I Love making news on the show the book\nHas been out ah for less than a week and a big time producer has already asked the option to make it into a movie now I mean you know you never know what happens but I'm honored that she felt the story was so compelling that he said cinematography from a cinematic standpoint he could see it on the screen\nYou talk about these multi million dollar mansions and hidden spaces and dark places in secret society is all guys and and you can figure I can see the conflict in in there and and I'm sure there's conflict in your story what's\nThe latest tease us with a twist the character is conflicted\nTo be a guy from the other side of the tracks and joined us worlds he also feels guilty so there's also that level and there's a little love story in there of course which I Love he falls in love with a a very beautiful girl who works in the dining hall who doesn't have anything to do with him because he's a Harvard guy and he got he has to try to win her over\nA [laughter] they got all the elements are there so what did you learn about yourself after finishing the ancient nine\nWell I've always been writing fiction um since the blackbird papers back in two thousand four it's just that my diet books and health books\nHave been so successful and I'm grateful I don't want to sound on grateful about that but the problem with that success has is that your publisher want you to write more of them right so um so for years I've been saying to my publisher we got to publish to ensure nine this was a great story it's got to get out no one's written like this with about these clubs\nOn me it was five five AM seven of the\nDouble you asked me\nIf we get away with Dr with cameras\nI'm Candace Presley joining us also of course your host Dr Rick Ambrose a he has a leader in the field of vision who are using stem cell therapy to treat chronic pain with great success\nAfter Rick you're joining us by phone on your show today because you've been traveling around the area talking to people about\nThe amazing result that you've been having that correct\nYeah yeah I've just actually getting back\nFrom serving him Alabama a so\nFortunately I got tied up here for a while I was able to make to the studio a touch but uh yeah it's it's a wonderful experience or they get taught to people of different communities around this out at a ... a just a wonderful the steps that treatments are that can help them\nSo Dr Rick you're out in the community talking to real people who are experiencing real pain about the kind of help you might be able to offer is that correct\nYes um I I really enjoyed doing seven hours to talk to people different communities all around south south east so\nYesterday I was asked to Georgia today at the gap Alabama at a you know people\nWant to hear more about stem cell therapy shirt that this should be an option for them at a at a or that honor to speak with people at tell them a lot about all the different treatments redo it step so sport where we get our step cells problems at it's just so\nSo much people need to learn about steps of therapy at each you it bounces particularly which just shut up anywhere else that you do\nFor Dr Rick what kinds of questions are these people asking you\nSay people are asked me all types of questions you see the first ... water treatment covered by insurance edit socially up there so it shuts up get or other steps out there are a little bit of the ... at Fifteen Years is more people get treated for people\nFor people that how wonderful are treatments are that this will be a common occurrence of insurance to pay for it that way down about a single\nInsurance company pays for it it's a it's really sad and there's a lot of reasons behind that a lot of politics or ball a lot of ... companies don't like stem cells because that was issue if they come and there were profits\nThey make so there's things or hopefully change that but not they will take several years for that to happen [noise] ah other questions I get quite frequently are\nUm you know the shots ... you know these treatments comfortable and yeah it's true that is no it's a you know people are always surprised how simple it and usually the injections are are nothing like the usual treatments that she would get in your regular doctor's office\nUm people always ask me as well um you know what kind of ... which gallery too old you know people ask me if I Am I to alter the treatment and there's the answer that has no as well um I've treated people in there that are a hundred years old and older\nAnd I'm a fantastic thing about that as people get treated at that age ... seem to be even more powerful or more effective for them and that they they get more benefit than the average person so they they always tell me they felt twenty thirty forty years after after treatment so\nUh that's that's an amazing tracked trip people as well I'm the only people that we ... we don't treat that's a question people ask me who do not treat we don't treat pregnant women\nWould treat people a young children although there's a lot of research going on right now for autism may be a treatment stem cell therapy so were you know other research for that now where the signed me up more information about that and uh finally the group last group of people we don't treat or people with cancer\nThat is people have had your mission our in remission trip cancer or pets or radiation and chemotherapy in the past and their subjects from neuropathy or other problems so those are things to the country so are those are some of the more common questions I get for people and people ask me\nYou know do you have questions about their personal house\nHow about you know I got this problem I've got a problem with that a back problem with what you do for me that type of thing but\nUh so those are those are some of the things that we did I get questions about all those\nPeople are so interested in moving slowly wonder though\nWhere they're from you know where\nHow do we obtain that obviously we kept up from ... which is part of the of the port of a healthy baby into helping bomb and uh we have a special lab to\nObtain those for us so that that we use that a lot more of a protocol say I've set up in my office to\nProvide the best uh ... best care for patients so those are some of the more common questions we haven't been I Love the show people cheering during my presentations you know we we've talked about a new where the ... how do they work it will do a stem cells were the best probably easiest\nOf allergy I could tell people is that just sort of like master rebuilder so they\nThey go in there and they take a sip broken down house that's what is bad the cart you know the carpets terrible but ... bad the electrical is bad the roof is terrible and that's all there they'll look at the original blueprints to the house and they totally remodeling that make it brand new to it you would use for\nYou you ... minutes plumbing electrical everything that needs fixing it that house that's what they can do\nAnd that's how they work on our body so if you have a bad knee and do it in a direction\nAnd got bad arthritis and then they'll actually regenerate that tissue they'll take the arthritis away and they'll replace it with healthy cartilage healthy bones healthy sitting ... that should be there it's it's it's just an amazing of powerful truth that the ... people so\nAre the those are some of the questions people have to they when they come to the seminar that get answered and then we show some amazing patient testimonials for different health condition so people that have the problems we have a great testimonial about that uh people that have back problems that problems show people that people that have little office he\nUh he loves to show them a\nPresentation about that that they can see themselves from people that have half the treatment of how effective it it's um so that's basically it in that show will be covered during their person to check my talks\nTo do with the community that is specific talks for you know health care providers different uh people depending on what their their interest level is what they want to hear that those are the ones I loved it for the community because they get the sense of what conditions we can help and how they work and\nAnd then we also shows some slides of pictures of a kiss you both for tissue after a treatment so uh you know we have scientific slide show someone that's how the cartilage dream and he would have looked like before the\nQuake three months after you get a stem cell treatments so those things are pretty amazing in mind boggling and to be able to see that a person that's real powerful so that's why I really recommend people to come to one of our seminars or or watch a weapon or that we have produced that\nThey can see see these seminars and see some of these things and talk about\nSo Dr ... let's go back and answer for your radio audience some of the questions that people make handing your seminars and ask you so you said\nOne of the initial question right off the top ... he's the procedure is the treatment covered by insurance and the answer to that question you know but you have a solution for that one is that\n[noise] yeah well great you know that's another question ... people have 'cause they're financing available and uh we work closely with a company called care credit or people may have heard of care credit before because ... and using it for years\nVeterinarian step and use it for years so whenever you add dental work that insurance won't pay for she didn't have insurance for your teeth or if you ... need some type of work done care credits a company that allows you to to get those treatments that and they have a great program where they\nThey'll pay for your treatment up front that they can pay that back over many bugs and get a payment that sets your budget so a lot of people really enjoyed that especially if you're on a fixed income it can only spend a certain amount of dollars every month to Sicily can get treated I get to feeling better and actually get your life back in the you know that\nTake care of take care of business and a good example of that is I had a fellow who was\nIn my office in South Georgia he had a backyard tree and he used to work for UPS or to these delivery companies said and he couldn't work anymore because of his back and he couldn't afford to have insurance who couldn't afford to get surgery or things done\nSo it's not only was he in pain all the time that could afford to get it didn't treat but I'm no surgery things like that and so he stuck to it was terrible but we were able to help that we're able to do an injection office back and he was able to get back to work and now he's a\nMaking deals while he's paid off as a treatment and ...\nFactory people ask you the question about the stem cell therapy treatment and they ask is it painful because it strikes me when I met someone who is experiencing great pain all the time would worry that getting healthy might hurt as well and actually for the injection how long has the needle\n[laughter] good question what will people hate needles so that's why they always like at that question you know when they know that we use a needle for an injection that get concerned about that but um it's a very ... you know it's a short needle in a ditch and a half but the most heavily you know depending on where

eight eight eight four one one a while one\nYou know some relationships end\nAnd some seem to end more easily than others\nI was in sixth grade and I had a girlfriend her name was Catherine and we really made our relationship official when at the end of office grade year we couple skated holding hands at the local skating rink\nUnfortunately then we went on to sixth grade that was middle school and middle school things were different and middle school there was this guy named Dan and he killed his hair and before I knew it I was climbing into the school bus when one of Katherine friends ran up\nAnd told me that Catherine would be breaking up with me because Katherine was now going with Ben\nSeems to me that after you've couple skated with someone the decent thing to do is to at least break up with him face to face but Katharine didn't see it that way and just like that the relationship was over\nIt was less simple for a friend of mine in eighth grade she called up or boyfriends Steve delivered the bad news that they\nWould be breaking up but oh Steve he saw it coming a mile away and wasn't about to let this relationship ends so he had this boys to mend song playing in the background when she called till the end of\n\nLegs you go it son not to rule you\nBe long to me I be long\nTo you know with that song fleeing this break was so easy and maybe the breakup should never be easy maybe the breakup should always be hard\nIt was a time when a group of ... came to Jesus to test him they asked is it lawful for men to divorce his wife\nThis is a significant question\nBecause what divorce meant back in the time of Jesus was that a man could drop his existing family to start a new family in a time when only men could work unknown property\nSo if he decided that he would rather start another family he could just write her a certificate of divorce and can move on from that first family as though nothing ever happened\nHe could just hand her that certificate of divorce on her way up into the school bus and it was over she and her children would be without\nA home without a source of income and without an honest named to make their way in the world\nSo Jesus said to them because of your hardness\nOf heart Moses allowed you to divorce so easily but if\nYou have become one slash you really think they could ever be separated again\nYou really think a man can just walk away as though nothing ever happened do you really believe that a man can just pretend that the children never happened that the life he made didn't really happen that he can just hit the reset button and start all over again\nYou know what some people do but not so with God\nA scripture lesson from the book of Jose ah as among the most beautiful and the Bible but not only is\nThe passage beautiful it's powerful in the sense that the profit Jose ah is married to a prostitute and he is married to this prostitute to illustrate his point that if God is married to us\nThan it is a marriage just like a holy prophet being married to a prostitute\nThat have gotten married to me that have got married to you it is like a holy prophet being married to a prostitute\nCertainly any fair as the would have approved should God have wanted to issue a certificate of divorce given our condition\nBut Jose ah won't divorce his wife going where the prostitute even though she keeps returning back to the brothel despite who he's married to\nJose ah like our God just won't let the relationship in\nAnd Bible studies on this passage of heard women and men identified with God as the divine takes on even more human or superhuman attribute Cindy eleventh chapter\nSeveral years ago a woman named Mrs Jane and words pronouns that this is a mother talking here in Jose ah\nWhen Israel was a child I loved him\nAnd out of Egypt I called my son but the more call them the more they went from me yet it was I who taught at frame to walk I took them up in my arms\nHours to them like those who lift infants to their cheeks\nThis does sound like a mother to me or grandmother the guy and a grandmother who loves her grandson so much that's even love the little greasy hand friends they leave\nAll over her sliding glass doors and won't clean them off because of how much she loves the greasy little hands who put them they're\nThe kind of mother who can't help but by the little cheeks of her daughter\nSmell that little smell that only comes from her baby girl\nThe kind of mother or grandmother or father grandfather who remembers lining up the cheerios on the couch cushions so that the baby would pull up and shuffled down step by step cheerios to cheerio until little Israel could walk\n\n\n[noise]\n\nSaudi five five to seven fifty me\nFrom the corner of sixteenth and pastries
