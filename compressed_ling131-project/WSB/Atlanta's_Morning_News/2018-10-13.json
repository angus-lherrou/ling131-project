go more to Mac\nGood morning on al how are you good luck to you ... getting good in\nAll this uh this cooler weather long overdue but it energized fish specially bass oh boy\nIt's got to move in a\nLate summer dog days if you will always tell a tougher bass fishing I get a little bit of a ... a lot of suspended fish they're hard to target and that went on forever because of the state so warm we got this extended summer but now that this is ... we saw a change in last week they were ready to go but now\nThings are really starting to happen and that's the good news is energized bass fishing\nIf there's a downside to it or if there's a footnote to it the one drawback is we are this time of year as official scatter out you have this new and all that you might have ten different patterns or versatility\nIs going to be key because any changes because you have\nTo change it and now the ... should start rolling in a weekly your every five days and that changes things are kind of get a weather change and then you've got turned over to deal with but bottom line is the fishing responded well to the school and whether in here on the near particularly has energized our top or by\nThat's fabulous yeah\nThen you start and with the trial of Schreiber side look\nFor school and fish will start seeing those uh an area like the water temperatures are falling down into the seventies\nSo you got fish in a whole water column\nYou can have them anywhere and you might catch one where the pile on top brackets woman with a spoon and fifty [laughter]\nFinances over everything I had someone or during his fishing trip I just got back from was a marveling at uh the fact that he had this past summer he had called stripe or at a fifty feet\nAnd I didn't want to stage him but I said I said really ah when you go more you'll find out there are a lot deeper than that that's a nice time of need to look at the deep water [laughter] that's right we've got we've got one two summers ago at Ninety seven feet in\nNinety eight so you know the bottom I remember that fish for about ... uh-huh right shows you got to talk of the bill white spoon and Ninety eight feet of water and flour branch breakout\nRoad what are you got you got that memory down but it or I or what people what should the next couple of weeks now if not hiring you are or another guide or whatever the fish the lake what would you tell the weekend fisherman do you do it with me or to get some good old spotted bass\nRight question and all the activities are the bulk of the activity or is centering around lane like\nA ... okay I'm twenty five to thirty feet\nAnd there's a lot of ... near most area like people have sought rush on these all these hot spot ... top water over him if you just want to catch fish and all the numbers your bass fishing or ... or drop shots will be hard to beat for numbers inconsistency\nCatch bigger fish with the top water or if you have to pay ... around that rush you get the bigger bite my okay ... ... and look for look ... look at the high spots in the creeks are all the main like twenty five thirty feet\nAnd actually a lot of the stripers are oriented to the same places if you're ... you're just relying alive here you know where those areas or maybe put him winding down a little bit with a split shot and then cast stop or\nEven though you're the top of ... maybe twenty five feet you can pull ... out of water that they needed\nTo oh yeah he can be aggressive ...\nYeah she'll come and get it so that's the best the structure you on the key on and I think ah that'll plot a lot of like says well\nOkay let me ask you a question him by and large just as a general rule general ... observation will you use a bigger bait and be more successful with a bigger bay in the fall\nAnd spring\nLike so I think they'll feed on bigger base where there's lot baked or even bigger top waters and water still warm enough right now we're still in the upper seventies so you've got to they are pretty active they'll respond a bigger bite and they're willing to chase when you get in the spring and depending on what bar spring we're talking about water temperatures in the fifties\nAnd you'll probably find them respond a smaller bites better so yeah I think now bigger bikes are better I\nAgree also I figure I'll ask her lawyer with the top ... station mhm mhm so some of the ... always\nAlways enjoy your reports are and I hope you get some good reaction from it or have a say seven seven zero to seven one oh wait five on\nMemory lacking health and and they are and look like one to this morning [laughter]\nOh there was certainly a within the ramp fishing report over will send it over your Facebook page later on this morning so\nPeople get Neal Hey great idea so the ramp fishing report will be on O'Neill outside Facebook\nPage we will send over later my breath matter of fact thanks for calling them back\nYes sir I have a great weekend on the water in the field and joy\nYou bet there you go hey uh [noise] let's see let's\nTalk to a gym he's calling from Monroe, Georgia good morning Jim what do you say\nGood morning man I just wanted to say thank you very much professor oatmeal what for what you do for ... how are you a tournament count you woke me up one morning when I was going to stay in the\nBack side on the couch and you should get out there and we ended\nUp with this will be going on my six year and for the last five years what you said was very true\n... and now I've sort of crazy ideas now look for the windy days and even even study them more than I Do the other days but I still hunt pretty much about two eighty percent of the the hunting time and guns season so I just want to let people know that you really and truly\nFeel Bush doesn't cost us a thing it will listen and pay attention that's all we got to do well\nThank you very much that's a that's a confirmation coming from you that I value highly because as I say at ad nauseam\nThe more you know the\nMore you understand the more successful you can be in the outdoors\nIs or it makes it a whole lot more pleasurable sometimes you just sit there and watch unfold what you've already told us but to actually see it in action just this is like a missed implication\nThe surface temperature of the water at in the lake was forty two now I got to tell you uh\nTo me that combination of air temperature twenty four but more importantly the water do you have to you're forty two that's one of those days when you can look at your partner and say I think I got to buy because\nYou're not going to get me so how did we do and why am I talking about this in this fashion we're back to that expertise that the you'll that cast and why a professional can use every airline when you should be using like tax\nMaybe\nAnd that's this we fish for two hours in this very special place day the and I did I was in the front of the boat and I was using a\nA of a mob gee bulldog lures I think bulldog by a mob Jake and so was Davey same color\nIn two hours a week ... seven large mouth\nThat weighed thirty five pounds were it was fabulous\nI caught two from the front of a boat and Davey caught five from the back of the vote\nNow I think that's about truth Davey is at least two and a half times better than me\nAnd that's why a seasoned professional that goes fishing every single week year round king case just as many with ... tackle as you can with a lot to tackle but if you use light tackle you'll get more bites\nOkay let's talk now to Larry is calling from Atlanta own oatmeal outside good morning ...\nLaws do good and hurting his ... million crap normal ... to go ... well yeah\nWell he did he that he did go he caught a limit every day a man which was not

was talking about that around the eight o'clock hour the landscape in Croatia I'll tell you the truth the ... most of the plants we recognize that wasn't much that we didn't know is a little bit warmer there a little bit more Mediterranean the movie Georgia is\nBut the plant life the trees shrubs flowers and things you pretty well said okay that's the lists over there and that sort of\nUm some bowls over here and so it was pretty much to say the main difference of course in Croatia\nIs it is so long as the age ... see a dramatic citizen Twain Croatia and um Italy and so you had to I guess think about how the water had those facts of temperature of the water affects the landscapes next to the coast there\nStill is the lamb I'm rocky\nOh yeah yeah more rocky than here certainly um is huge I guess the Space Coast to the seashore says rocky you know I didn't mention this in the cold to anybody but you now\nIs that is that one of the cities we visited a which is the one that was the last ... make it was another city but we walk on this path up a real real steep hill to a castle overlooking the city\nAnd one of the things I noticed was that people along the path to take and rocks and stack them up into little piles single Ross one two three four or five cigarettes on top of each other\n... be a foot two feet something of a tall and others have found Ross with holes in them and had nailed them I guess is actually nails into the trees they're not good for the tree particularly but sort of an interesting effect\nUh in the landscape alongside this path so that people were using the rocky landscape there to do sort of quirky things just along this path to walk up to the castle and uh I thought that was pretty nice to talk for doing that\nWell they were building casts all on top to the you know\nAt the ship and everything yeah but then again you have that problem from a man I mean they're all the the guy that ... ... why not the land the landscape but dad that cannot accumulate water on top\nKill yeah good point because I said right the erosion is going to be done lower but at the top of the mountains where things are pretty high and then you don't have quite the effects of lots of water coming down the hill towards you\nKnow at ... because I always been fascinated with ... because people as much as they love why do we need Wilder as much we are afraid of look at a a you know the kind of pennies\n[laughter] you know there are places where the water can go because we still want to know from you know to the ground\nAnd the nominee this happened on the other parts of the Asian part of the world just last week or two and just thousands of people dead in Panama City the thousands of houses not to the ground by the force of water coming and going back out again unbelievable\nAnd credible yeah the lotteries and pour water we need water for us the water for our plans but water can be destructive and we have to learn how to um you know managed to structure this I guess of the water itself\nYeah well when you like Eddie ... out there in the wedding in the fall and then you probably deal in the air you know like those castle yeah ... you know didn't use the water would go up you know\nWhat are the things that we can go in the air and we've got to get out and just a minute and a cold but one of the things is an interesting about go into other countries and particularly\nCountries that do have the industry and the I guess the bills that really should build high rises is waiting to see a single single high rise in any way when we lose our grab or those cities along the coast who went to\nUm because for whatever reason they do have earthquakes can be one reason but there were no real tall buildings which makes it more scenic or\nSort of old school you know what it means is houses and buildings were five maybe six stories high and that was it was nice to see the ... of course many times or the tallest building in a town of the taller than the ... one of the center of town\nBecause of the when the when will destroy that flight Panama City the new building there has to be a round on top ten more you know uh because at that all those big he does a lot of when\nAnd an interesting thing is one of the city so busy to the streets were offset by the end of the street was offset by about twenty feet so you see along the
