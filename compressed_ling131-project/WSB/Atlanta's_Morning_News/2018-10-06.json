rush\nOkay\nNow unload your rival you're not going to shoot anything else that morning unload your rifle now you can start looking for the beer if possible\nIf there are other club members and you

should serve\nWe saw them circus of TV but we never saw traveling somebody's backyard that was\nKind of like the inside of your body you like it doesn't keep up with the outside\nExactly that's exactly right exactly and the inside of you but I was outside surroundings of your body Croatia was because you haven't heard beautiful it was wonderful it was fabulous\nAnd I think the reason for that is that um as somebody remember back in the early nineties Nineteen Ninety when Yugoslavia dissolved Yugoslavia was a confederation of a whole bunch of other countries over there so they knew in ... center and uh when it dissolves\nAge those countries that was part of it originally decided they wanted their part and not only that with the services that they wanted to bigger and more had more Serbia sort of living in other places around in a in a movie you saw the Serbians or aggressively sort of ...\nMoved into these other countries should take territory\nOf the country says oh heck no oh no you're not going to have the territory so they started shooting at each other and that was what happened in the Nineteen Ninety to ... big they wore conflict there and that was one of the most interesting things for us to see their in Croatia was a memorial to the war dead\nThat was armored vehicles with hope bullet hole in the doorway which you just imagine the driver was sadly deceased\nAnd it had a Memorial Day we've had still houses along the highway and a couple of places have bullet holes to the side of the house and the worst in over Twenty years\nOh my gosh so Croatia not having a whole lot of farming\nNor manufacturing or industrial anything left to export that had gone all in for tourism and that's why it's so beautiful to have this huge park says\nIt starts with a P I Can't pronounce to ditch if they have a park there there's water falls out the water to it is\nTwo or three legs ... cascade one for the other ... has five or six waterfalls coming out of it and you can walk down a\nA a wooden walkway kind of thing and see all his water hose it is gorgeous is gorgeous what is the weather like I just like here in eighty one you're in the afternoon ... minutes

the ocean or the age you got to see you should say nothing ocean with a B C\nAnd one of the neatest things was because we were in the city the water was relatively calm is like three or four times who just pull up to the side of the shoreline and anchor if he would jump off the end of the vote and swim swim you know a quarter mile go to the beach the all sorts of things one of my friends on the boat was\nLike pull up to a Beijing they said if you don't want to swim over to us about two hundred yards away what was going to go ahead and so one of my friends have gone ahead of everybody else was swimming toward the beach and pop their head up and thought oh my God is a nude beach and it was [laughter]\nShe popped up there was a whole bunch of people running around with that any clothes on and so she turned quickly to the right way over another fifty yards to a place where people who are close on the beach so it was a heck of a time\nWe're glad you're back we always knew that you and your ...\nWell I actually I listen to you it was the first week right John Mickey Mickey right and so I could listen to you there because we were at a place that I had a wife I could I should say
