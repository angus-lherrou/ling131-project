what's happening right now I'm at the border uh people are crashing the border so oh my goodness that's quite a lot\nQuite a lot of people how many did they say is and how many they say is in the Caribbean or ... originally it was four thousand I think is what they were saying I Know yeah I think there's ... there might be more than that\nYeah I think there's I'm just looking at all the different videos and uh yeah I think there is because\nI think like a snowball it's gathering people as it goes\nWell because one videos on is almost five minutes long and people are still going through they tore down the fence at two separate points and are people that are up on some of the statues directing them and where to go and pay for like five minutes people just flip through like a stream\nThat is a lot of people and and it was still going like it wasn't and the video just stopped\nThat's a lot of people\nThat's not just a small little contingency yeah I think four thousand was just an estimate and visually it looks more than that so what happens if they go to the border and they tried to do this stuff and our border\nOh I Know that there is no let's be real there are some people on the left I Would love that object I Would love to see you know the the the violent progressive is um they would like to just so they can say look at them look at our border agents attacking these people\nWell I mean it it they're good grief is is just it's just crazy\nBut there and they'll take up some time to get to get their Mexico but my goodness what is going to happen then so they're they're still I think are entering Mexico right now and uh we'll see what happens but am I going to sit in stupidity or an adult\nI mean the entire media\nHas been trying to point to Trump saying he was not a fan of fake news but trying to conflate it like you said the enemy of the people in the media which is not the case but a cost of doing the same thing at the rally last night here is is if it\nWas obviously whether or not whether or not\nOr you know boy I'm scenes of violence shows mortars is over out\nLoving every minute of is when the president was talking about us on the show me around us all was rarely\nSo him they're trying to conflate and it's so funny to that we see all the violence coming from antifa and in these left organizations Acosta crickets on that but because Trump's as something that he hates speak media accustomed gotta take it personally and everything that comes out of his mouth is conflated this way so that it's stupid\nYeah it's really

investment applications until the market recovers\nBecause Chris you talk all the time about not selling when the market's down like at the markets dropping I don't want to be selling the equities I haven't the only way to become more conservative is to sell them so what do I do somebody asked me this exact question a client came in this last week they had heard the show I did\nAnd we're reviewing their investments are there new client and we're talking about how aggressive there and I said I think you're too aggressive they agreed with that gave her on the same page I said I think you need to move to a more conservative portfolio they agreed with that but then they came back and said yeah but I heard the show last week\nI've read what you've been writing the last number of months and I know I should not be selling as the markets dropping so are we breaking that rule if we move right now into more conservative investments 'cause we have to sell equity is to get there I said that does a fantastic question and I think a lot of people\nAre thinking about that and if you weren't thinking about it now you are but it's kind of a conundrum right it's like a treadmill when can I say if I Know I'm not supposed to sell in the markets down but I'm too aggressive and I don't want to stay in this way what do I do with that\nAnd I tell you exactly what to do first if you just joined us you miss the beginning of the show\nI you're listening to more than money this is Chris Burns if you have any questions or if you missed the first part of the show jump on my website it's my life is more dot com you can get all the answers you want their listen to past shows it's a great resource again my life is more dot com so we're just talking about\nWhat you do if you are more aggressive than you should be you realize that you want to become more conservative but the market is in a downward trend right now do you wait for it to go back up\nAnd the short answer is no you don't wait here this again you do not wait here's why because it's going to sound contradictory what I talk about all the time is people that swing from extreme too extreme\nOkay a lot of people and I've seen this so many times of trust me it's a lot of people and they might not be you know a lot of people when the market starts to drop they sell everything or almost everything and they go super conservative I mean they take everything out\nOkay so now they've lost tons of money because they've sold all of their equities it's like in a garage sale right you're never going to get full value and then they wait until the market's going up up up up up again and finally when it seems safe and and the way they defined safe is it it's been a long time since I dropped which\nAlso means it's risen quite a lot they missed all that growth all that growth was gone they wait until super expensive end quote unquote safe in their minds and now they jump back in well this is the worst possible scenario you sold everything in a garage sale with no value then you wait until it was the most expense\nBeen re bought bought doesn't work\nThat wrecked your portfolio overtime but I'm not talking about some massive shift where we go from Ninety percent equity used to selling everything the going back to equities that my friends is market timing and that's what we want to stop we want to get off the treadmill of market timing\nBecause market timing is all about is now the right time here's here's the easy solution to this is the answer is if the question in your mind the words actually popping into your head or is now the right time\nIf that's the words coming in then you can already know the answer I Need to get off that that's not the question to ask\nLike that should not be part of the equation if you're sitting going is now the right time to get in is now the right time to get out should I wait three more months should I wait till the market goes back up should I wait till it drops a little more put my money and those are questions all surrounding the concept of market timing market timing is death to your portfolio\nThe reason you become a more conservative if you're sitting right now with Ninety five percent of your money in equities in stocks right this phenomena is paying your flying along in the market\nAnd you're too aggressive 'cause your plan can't handle that and you know you need to move back and you decide that moving back is like sixty percent stocks okay\nThen you go and do that now because that's what your plan needs now because it's the perfect time and the market\nAnd then you stay at that sixty percent\nBecause that's what your plan needs regardless of his next next week the market shoots up again and we hit new records or if it tanks and we finally hit that first spare marketing a decade right regardless of that we've now pick the risk you can handle and you stick with it the whole thing is removed from timing\nIs timing is part of your question then you're thinking through the wrong grid your strength thinking through this grid of trying to make it okay by waiting for just the right moment that moment will never come\nOkay so the question asked the way the way to figure this out is if you're going is now the right time that's not the question to ask the question to ask is is my portfolio built\nIn a way that my plan can handle the risk my plan for the future my dreams and a lot of you hear that right now and you go okay that makes sense\nThere's a treadmill there's this whole thought process or should I wait two more months should I wait three more months and again it goes both ways people are sitting right now there are people listen to this that are waiting to get into the market because you've been out for a long time and you go maybe it's going to drop a little more and then I can get in\nAnd there's people listening right now going I Need to get more conservative I'm going to wait maybe it'll go up again so I can get out\nBecause that's going to kill you it's going to drive you crazy it never wins over time dump that grid and moved to one that says how much risk in my plan handle move to that risk level now and then stick with it that should not change\nBut the only way you're going to know that right risque level is if you value in truly made a financial plan and this is where I get around this something that I talk about regularly whether it is with my from\nOr where the from you respect that does financial planning not just affirmed that invest money not just affirmed the talks about insurance but they have their investment licenses okay affirmed that actually does the based\nFinancial planning eight percent of the firms in the country of financial firms in the country or ... Sherry only meaning legally they have to work and your best interest and they do financial planning okay where they truly are looking at everything in your situation if it's done right are from when we meet with people\nWe go through a process to look at your whole financial world to help you know this is the level of risk that your plan can handle for you to go after your dreams\nWe take out the guesswork from that\nWe show you the data behind it how much of a loss could you handle and still be okay what happens if these things pop up in your life when we add an inflation and cost of living and the dreams you had when they put all that together and the ... or what kind of risk can you be taking and now that you know that and you're confident in that\nYou can make that move don't go with your gut here make sure you know from where I Am right now to where I Want to go that target in the future this is the devil of risk I can take in feel confident in that even at the market tanks next week\nAnd we lose this great bull market that I'm going to be OK in fact I'm going to capitalize on it 'cause my portfolio is now built\nTo respond when the market drops and so that I when I when overtime\nOr if the market shoots up next week great I'm In a good position I can feel confident in the risk I'm taking you only get there when you have a plan\nWhen you know exactly what you can do so if you don't have that right now and you're listening to me and you and you realize you have been on this treadmill of market timing it always is now the right time which will drive you insane it

Burns investors financial\nHey welcome back to more than money this is Chris Burns thank you for taking a few minutes with us this morning hey if you missed the first part of the show jump on my website it's my life is more dot com 'cause I answer the question that I think it's critical right now not the market has been down now for weeks straight it's not some crazy terrible drop at this point\nBut it's been down for four weeks in the midst of that some of you realize that you're aggressiveness level is too high but as you look at how your portfolio is responding\nYou should be more conservative because of how close you are to retirement and yet\nYou hit this quandary if the markets dropping right now is now the time that I sell some of the equities to become more conservative because\nThey're on sale right now they're worth less I don't want to sell them and lose money and that's a really good question because I talk regularly on the show about the danger of jumping out of the market when things are bad 'cause it's like selling everything you have a garage sale you're never going to get full value and yet the answer is if you need to be more conservative\nGo ahead and do it and then I explain why I'm not going to give you the full detail now explain why at the beginning of the show go back and listen to get into my life is more dot com and while you're there you can ask any questions in fact in a few minutes we will have our lightning round where we answer the questions you send in throughout the week\nUh we do that every week and so if you have any practical questions that are coming from the topics I talk about today jump on ask those questions and we will get an answer to you again it's my life is more dot com on\nLet's talk about everyone's favorite topic open enrollment now no one likes discussing this for a few reasons one because it insurance related almost everything you do it open enrollment is related to insurance right health insurance life insurance disability insurance\nAnd that's just boring not only that it's talking about terrible things that can happen to you\n... who wants to sit and go how am I covered if I had a life altering disability or if I die or if I get cancer I mean those are things that no one likes to dwell on and so the idea of discussing insurance is no fun any weight and you couple that with the worst meetings ever created right when you go to your opening Roman\nA health insurance meaning that you have every year I remember this I was at a company for years\nAnd this was always the worst meeting because inevitably what would happen as you walk in it would be tedious and boring and then not only that they were going to raise your premium every year and it would always be for the same level of coverage\nRight who likes hearing you are going to pay ten Fifteen Percent more this year for the exact same coverage is last year and oh by the way the raise you got is not anywhere close to keeping up with that so we're giving you a three per cent raise for raising your health insurance benefits by you know payment by ten percent\nA good luck you know happy Hanukkah or whatever it's just it's not the most encouraging meetings usually\nAnd yet they really matter and because of their so boring I find a lot of folks I work with kind of ignore them and just kind of rural and most people you can answer this for yourself\nMost people just kind of go with their gut on picking their benefits right if I asked you why did you pick this level of life insurance coverage through your company most people are like wow I mean it wasn't that expensive you know and it's just kind of do what's your diet which\nIs not the best way to make a financial decision because in the end as boring and terrible as insurance is if you hit a point where you actually need that stuff it matters\nRight and how much money you spend on it even if it doesn't seem quote unquote life that much money\nActually matters 'cause you could be taking that money and directing it somewhere else so before you just checked the box again and go on with life let's talk about this for a second okay now some of you listening to carry out here or not and companies at all your entrepreneurs you're self employed or you run your own company or whatever it is you don't have this kind of a situation you know you you buy all your benefits yourself\nThat's fine the principal here still matters okay a lot of people listening have the Stewart but even if you don't have it through work or you're retired the principles of how you approach is still really really matters let's talk about it for a second the first thing is health insurance okay\nThe basic option for health insurance most companies is your traditional twenty five thirty five dollar co pay insurance option\nAnd here is my best advice when it comes to insurance have you looked at\nHigh deductible health plans have you looked at them do you know what that is some of you know yes I've been using it for years\nOther have you go I have no idea I've never even checked it out let me describe really quickly what this looks like and why I like them so much and then conversely why don't currently use one okay so I'm going I'm going to give an example of why you should do it in and tell you why I don't do it 'cause there's two sides to that's why you shouldn't do it is it harder to\nHide adoptable health plans first of all the cost less in premiums\nSo high deductible just means if you had a major medical issue you'd have to pay more if you went to the hospital or the doctor for it okay to duck the ball out of pocket is higher but the trade off for that as you pay less per month so your premiums are lower but here's the interesting math of this okay\nIf you took the extra money that you saved from the premiums\nAnd put them into a very special account that you're able to open if you have a high deductible health plan an H s a that's a health savings account if you took that money the extra money you say is on your premium and put it into a health savings account and let it grow your math\nAlmost always works out better to do that hide duck to plan let me explain that for a second so hot as well planned gives you access to the special account H essay is\nBasically an investment accounts for medical purposes it's pretty stinking cool here's why you get tax benefits putting your money into it\nBut the most important thing is the money is growing tax free for health issues and you can use it not only this year but any years if you have an essay flexible spending account you're familiar with the annoyance of these as you got to spend the money that years that's why when I was growing up\nEvery year my dad would put money and that's why I say\nAnd then around November December if we haven't had many expenses suddenly we're at Walgreens buying all sorts of medical equipment or whatever\nBecause we've got to spend the money in the account right and you experience as an age essay has no time limit like that you could use and they just they account this year or in five years and guess what it's also portable meaning it can go with you even if you leave your job this is huge\nSo if you put the extra money let's say that just for the ease of math here you spend like a hundred dollars less per month because you pick that high deductible option but you take the hundred dollars and you put it in the age essay and you're saving money now and you can invest it you have investment options so it's growing in the market over time and then you don't have a medical need this year\nSo you don't have to spend the money if you did have a medical need you have a higher deductible but thinking then you've got more money in that account to pay that hired adoptable right now half and wins\nBut if you don't have a medical need now you've got extra money sitting in his account for the future when you do have a need even at that need is five or six or ten years down the road you're building a long term health medical savings account friends that's what I call flexibility and that is the bedrock of any long term financial planning\nIs flexibility because we don't know what's going to happen tomorrow\nWe also don't know what's going to happen in ten years from now so if I had the option of paying a higher premium every month\nFor health insurance and it's easier but I'm never going to see that money again if I don't have a health issue this year I pay more out of pocket\nIn those premiums I never got that money back or I could take the extra and put it into an H essay and if I Do have a health issue this year yeah I can pull from the ... to pay for it but if I don't I get to keep that extra money\nForever until I Do have a health issue down the line and not only that it gets compound interest so if I Do get cancer in ten years I now have this big pile of tax free medical money waiting for me that's awesome that is the bedrock again\nOf solid planning is flexibility so that's why mathematically that age essay plan almost always the best fit\nNow let me tell you why don't do one is it a little ridiculous but it's true I'm going to be honest with you all you need to know what's actually going on here I don't do on because it became a pain we have three kids we have major\nRegularly medical things right not major things regularly have reasons with three kids to go to the doctor we have lots of doctors visits and it became a real plant pain with insurance I'll be honest\nUm you know things similar to like you know non fancy savings account or a high yield savings account or a CD\nSo during the principles protecting in two years he's going to have a hundred percent liquidity now there's other options out there who start going down deeper rabbit hole on but we got to make sure that we're respecting the timeframe that he needs the money for and making sure that we're protecting it\nYeah it's always a dilemma that idea of I'd like to get some sort of return right now but I Need the money shortly I have to have liquidity those two things are really tough to figure out because the market might drop in the next two years and now you don't have the funds you need right\nYeah it's funny I mean we never we talked about investments there's usually three facets of every investment which is you know the growth potential um the liquidity and and the safety of it right so in this situation she needs safety and he needs liquidity so he's going to have to give up a little bit on the growth potential to make sure you can protect those two parts of the very need\nCarl thanks for your question right next is from Michael Michael says I'm forty five I'll be forty seven when I get my house paid in full which will just pause on that that's not normally well not I don't go out on my question is do I need to wait until then to start investing or do I need to start now\nThe way I see it is to get everything paid for and then started saving for retirement is that right or wrong well Michael thanks running and cliff what do you think well this one's\nA tricky one um because there's a lot of fast as they go along with this one and you know once again you know mending I'm Michael for the position that he's in right now um there's not many clients that we've seen that at forty seven\nYou know have paid off their house right so that that is and we'd be two years out I can understand how enticing it is to get that accomplishment done um but just from what you know Chris and I've seen in in you know and you know obviously in our history of doing this\n... those who decide to start saving for retirement when they get to retirement earlier they started the more successful their picture looks\nYou know it's the power that the compound interest over time right so you know what we're battling\nYears the emotional victory of paying off our debt versus the long term success of saving earlier so in his situation although it may be very difficult to to to take the focus off of paying off the house they keep you took a step back and tried to put some more towards his long term savings\nEven if it delayed when he actually paid his house off in the long run he might be in a much healthier situation all\nThis is the danger of black and white and and I think a lot of people that come in have this feeling of the number one priority is to pay off all my dad and the here that there's a lot of talking heads out there that say this is the primary thing you should do but the problem is that leads to this where\nEverybody's situation is different and the danger of saying I'm going to all my money to pay that off as what's your interest rate on the debt ...\nAnd people don't want to talk about that but let's say that Michael was only paying four or five percent for that mortgage\nAnd he's delayed putting money into the market will the market's up over three hundred percent last ten years\nSo you're saying you've gone he's he's not there is a bit in in any of that three hundred percent growth so that you could pay off that four and a half percent debt and there's a problem here that long term that's going to come back to bite you\nYeah I mean one thing you hear in our industry and and we talked about his all time is you know is healthy dead you know dead isn't universal so there are certain that's out there they're by all means there we're going to put a bull's eye on them and we're going to pay them off as quickly as possible sure you know for a client comes in through our doors and they have ... you know racked up a whole bunch of high interest credit card that\nWe're going to work really hard and putting a plan together to make sure they can knock that out you know that might supersede putting money into a retirement savings but when you start talking about something that'd be healthy debtor or good that which is you know your home loan\n... there are some advantages to ride it out first of all we're no historically the lowest interest rate market we've seen for home loans right so you're trading off a very very low interest rate mortgage\nFor the potential growth that you can get ... you know in the market so in this situation you may want to take a look at it but once again it's not right or wrong because there's nothing wrong with paying off a mortgage but in terms\nOf putting you in a good place for retirement and the\nFunny thing is you could play the sound clip in ten years and our advice may have changed because even the advice is based on what's going on right now as for my parents first mortgage there was Eighteen percent well at that point maybe it makes a lot of sense to pay it off right because you can't earn that much in the market over time but when we're sitting on historically low interest rates\nIt's probably not the best use of your money\nAbsolutely I mean you know it reminds me of a store that I had you know I used to tell clients a sit down into a family dinner one time with my uncle who's a retired\nActuary and\nAnd as you are calling it told me a very interesting lesson never to to have any type of argument about figures as an actuary but he said in the current climate that we're in he would give advice to a young person that he would never given before which is bar was much money as you can for as long as you can invest a difference\nYou know 'cause he was in a similar situation you were saying which is the first loan that he got which was in the late seventies early eighties\nHe was a double digit interest you got a Fifteen year mortgage that he worked hard to paid off in ten years because it made sense now he told me he's like I Would you know I'd get a thirty year mortgage and then we started going down you know the whole path of how inflation infected and everything like that it's just a very unique time right now and\nAnd this might not be the time to aggressively pay off a home loan it might be the time to to put stuff towards the long term retirement if possible\nYeah good thoughts hey Robert thank you again threatening alright this question from a ... a loft that was Michael thank you might go All right we'll go to Robert Robert says\nMy company is offering a voluntary severance package and I'm tempted to take it but I wasn't planning to retire for two to three years what's the most important factor I should be looking for to make sure we'll be okay financially Robert thanks writing and so\nOption for a severance package he wasn't planning on retiring\nBut if he retired now you know it's tempting as he's getting a good deal what should he be\nLooking at while this one's a this was a challenge uh there's so many factors that go into this um you know when we're sitting down with any of our clients obviously\nOur goal is to put a projected retirement goal on the board and say you know how how old is our plan to accomplish that and if we were to all of a sudden say can we expedite that that time frame or short and time for about two to three years it if there was a whole lot of variables into the equation of 'em so\nMy question the first thing comes to mind with Robert is would you would you truly be stepping out of the workforce completely\nYou know even if you took this severance package and you took the benefit would you see this is an opportunity to completely stop working or would you take it as an opportunity to a lot of our clients have done at certain stages of their career where they have a transition job where it's a job where they dialed things back a little bit and they they take a step back from their career and they do something an intern\nThey kind of leads them into that retirement mentality so a little bit more relaxing a little less stressful maybe not full time but that might be the gap that you need or something to bridge that that allows you to retire at the same time frame but not maybe press the same I'm\nA burden on your retirement plan as it would be if you completely stopped working\nWell and that's where income planning is such a big deal because you meet with people and they assumed the assumption is I have\nTo work until this year whether that's sixty five Seventy some be going in with ideas across the board but they have no clue why except for a hunch right and when you go through an income planning process suddenly you putting actual data behind that and now\nI've been amazed how many people have been surprised when Robert this could be you but we don't know so we see the whole situation at once I put all the data inflation and taxes and your cost of living and everything else\nYou might be way better off than you think you are like maybe that time you picked was pretty arbitrary just because you thought you were supposed to work till then on the flip side if you spend a whole lot of money in your dreams for the future you know traveling the globe every year well then maybe you do need to keep working for a few years but it's totally dependent but having the data behind it\nFor the ... exactly and that's and that's ... piece of the puzzle falling you know because we have clients that they wanted to retire at a certain age\nAnd their curiosity is also a little bit sooner what if it was a little bit sooner and it was a one which is called the cheese during the siege you retire now right and we plug everything in and sure enough there fine right and then they can decide how long they want to work after that point but if they know they could stop working today and be fine talk about the burden is taking off their shoulders everyday when they go to work\nPutting the yeah and just putting the data behind it so they can go I'm confident because of actually looked at multiple scenarios here\nI'm not sure when they were great question thank you Robert cliff\nYou're a genius or thank you for taking a few minutes and given your thoughts on the question and tell you if you were listening to this and you go that's me I'm In a situation where I have no idea what I Want to retire or I don't know when I can I just kind of have this hunch around it we would love to help you actually know that actually look at the data behind it what does it mean if you want that\nJump on our website it's my life is more dot com we can sit down with you helping make a plan and actually feel peace and confidence about your future again it's my life is more dot com for that free consultation with me Chris Burns with cliff with someone from our team to actually\nDig into this I think so much for joining us today will be back next week but you've been listening to more than money this is Chris Burns and don't forget your wife and your future are so

V.\nFollowing program is paid for by Dr Rick I'm realistic regeneration radio [noise] beer says regeneration radio when Dr Riggins ... one of the nation's leading experts on the use of stem cell therapy to relieve\nAmused by the um the\nDouble you asked me\nWhy should we should radio\nWith John ... was unconscious freshly in the studio with your doctor which ... is a leader in the positions are using them so therapy tree honey have with great success doctorates just to see you success story from the offices [noise] ah gosh the\nIsrael is a wonderful there's so many of those kind of hard to weed them out but [laughter] I'm probably one of the more I'm exciting ones we have\nA this week was the gentleman that was a severe back pain and um several week there's actually about five months ago he came to see me and and he could barely walk you could barely move\nAnd I'm used to came to get around and yeah so we ended up doing some treatments on his back and um we just saw him and follow up and he's like a new person now he's got his life back he's able to do all this activity has been able to do for for many years actually\nUm is being able to play those grandkids he was able to to drive again because it can drive before isn't so much pain and can move very well to see of cars were coming things like that so\nUm and he's he's got his life back this wonderful\nIt is great when people are able to come to see you to be treated and then for things to turn out so well we've talked before about patients who've come through Dr Rick with back pain and with knee pain and the other leg pain\nBut sometimes for people the pain can be very localized and it's just even hard to use the hands to do everyday things is is that something that is a common occurrence of people who are coming through the office so definitely yeah we see people\nWith with hand pain was was split or total pain [noise]\nUm and they've tried all kinds of different treatments and nothing's helped and um surgery you know there's definitely something they didn't want to do so the stem cell therapy was the\nPerfect option for them and uh they they do tremendous the you know we cure people have had pain relief their pain and a similar foot pain toe pain you name it\nAnd these concerns the complaints of the pain that these patients have is this again perhaps because of the arthritis that they are experiencing yeah\nUm some people have arthritis some people have other health conditions um that cause the pain so it's wonderful that we're able to relieve and leaving relieve the pain for them\nIs it something that is as localized as a single joint in a finger or is it in the palm of the hand when you talk about in treat patients who are experiencing this type of hand pain feel like what are some of the things that are complaining about what hurts and what can they do\nGreat question so it can be as simple as one joined us giving somebody pain or it could be the whole hand is the problem a ... um\nUm it's really just depends on the person and what kind of how severe their diseases and what kind of problems are having but we see something as minors will join into something like the whole hand as as an issue where the whole arm so we treat all and it works\nI think we have a a patient or someone who came through who was experiencing toll pain what can you tell us about this patient\nYes um well she she had pain for many years in her toe and it got so bad that you couldn't even wear shoes um so she had a tour of a loose handler flip flops something like that\nAnd I'm obviously that's not very comfortable to do and wintertime when it's cold out and so um you know she was miserable and and she had seen different positions and they want to some of them wanted to do surgery on her\nUm she just wasn't happy with that and she tried um steroid shots and things like that and nothing was helping her and um fortunately you know she came she asked we gave her some stem cells and our her pain is is relieved to she's doing wonderful and she was wearing shoes again which is a blessing\nThen ... I came\nTo the doctor and rising because\nOver the past year I've had discomfort in pain\nMonths ago that so unbearable that I finally decided I needed to go to the doctor they what was going on\nAfter seeing the orthopedic surgeon and\n... done I was told that that has\nHas bone on mom and my husband had been\nListening to you on the radio and doing a lot of research and he suggested that I come\n[noise] um the doctor's recommended surgery\nBut couldn't guarantee that at that\n[noise] so I came in\nWe were very confident that you could help me and\nThirty days out from that initial treatment with us down south I have all she used to that [laughter] and I'm excited about\nBecause anybody that has pain or discomfort in their feet knows that\nThe where she\nFor about the last minute all I've been able to wear flip flop I couldn't handle anything touching the top of my favorite because it was so painful\nI'm just I'm excited that\nIn thirty died I've already got pain ... I'm not a hundred percent\nI could not touch the top of my butt over my left\nUh it was inflamed and it was\nI couldn't stand she used to catch it\nHad to where she thought flip flops somewhere\nI Would get by maybe an hour to I'd have\nThough I'm within three days after my injection I notice that I wasn't having a shark shooting pain and the death of my pet but um after\nIt's gotten a little bit better and\nI'm I'm very happy that far with my results I mean\nAnd this day in time we want and then ratification and sometimes it's hard to be patient to wait for something to work but\nIn thirty day given me in my life of pain\nThe fall and winter coming on I'm excited about their habit of where she is other than flip flops [laughter]\nWell I've had these on than eight o'clock this morning\nAny death bumper and like that at all so\nI'm excited to you know do all day\nNormal she yeah [laughter]\nIt's been shown to enhance the the the stem cells and make them more now I'm not only more powerful and more active but they actually cause them to replicate more so you can even um have more stem cells by getting that therapy to so\nIt's um everything we do kind of builds on ... on the other treatments that we do in the office\nAnd um we just had amazing results with people as you know you hear every week we have the patience that word pain and suffering in a pain free now\nSo this is going to sound like a silly question but I Know someone in the audience just thinking this Dr Rick so if you're able to cure the stem cells overnight from the provider out in Utah so they're coming to you the effects\nDo yeah [laughter] they have a big FedEx truck pulls up and they bring him to us they're they're in a special package and uh they're kept on dry so the the cells are frozen and they're good for many years actually but we use them usually within a matter of days after we get a shipment\nAnd then how to use store them in your clinic\nAnd we have a special tank across preserved tank that we use that can keep the cells frozen forests so that's how that's how we store them in the office and then when we need them we thought them out and then we um use them along with other nutrients and fluids and things that we we have at the office and to help for for us with a self\nBut if they ... and they are not used they could go bad seat it's bureau yeah ... you don't want them to die now [laughter]\n... exactly um if they left out for more than like twenty minutes once they're thought out and they they can start dying so we're very vigilant about this whole process and making sure that everybody gets the right cells from the cells are viable in there um and they ... that these treatments work and everybody because of that\nAnd it's like when the cells are injected into an area where a patient has concern you're saying not only do they help in that one localized area where you may make the injection but\nThey replicate because here in New they're young and you said they're billions of them and then will help the patient to feel so much better\nExactly yup that just sounds too good to be true isn't it [laughter]\nIt sounds like it but it really is it's um I've been a physician for Twenty years and I've done I'm a surgeon and I've done all kinds of procedures on people written\nThousands of prescriptions but nothing is more powerful and nothing is safer in terms of treatment that I've ever encountered in my life so I'm I'm really excited for the future for to be able to help people to be able to get people pain free to get let these people get their life back\nAnd I'm I'm hopeful that in the next ten Fifteen Years that everybody will be getting these treatments that maybe insurance will finally cover these treatments and um you know that that will all be healthier and younger and happier\nIt looked as if you're a patient who was experiencing the tell pain as she was demonstrating that she didn't have any pain anymore just thirty days after her treatment and she still has three to nine months to go just as if she was ready to get up and dance\nYeah yeah she was and that that's what's so fantastic about the treatment um she she can word normal shoes she should have some swelling as well and that's gone away so um it's just a really fantastic how well they work and how they can heal and make people happy and\nShe's a I think she's definitely going to be dancing or his dancing you know nothing else he's going to be shopping\nAs well so we talked about the one misconception is that\nIt's an age old myth because the stem cells that you use are from the Wharton jelly they do not come from those aborted fetuses which the president outlawed you as you said in two thousand for their other misconceptions about the therapy that\nOther questions that people ask when they come in after having listened in red and done some of their own independent research\nUm it's funny sometimes people the kind of kid around about this they'll say oh am I going to grow an extra arm or a leg or you know they say you hear these kind of science fiction sort of stories from people um and and really um when people were using the amber embryonic fetal stem cells\nUm you know I think in some other research they were doing they were having some kind of weird interactions and things like that but there's none of that with the cells it them and they're completely safe and harmless and they all they do is peel us so they're they're like I said not only the most powerful treatment I've ever seen that the most\nSafe treatment I've ever ever dealt with so\nDo you find that the this therapy and the protocols that year pioneering sir are beginning to catch on in there are more practitioners of this medicine like you know\nThere there are um now the only problem with with that like I I'm excited to have more people involved with stem cell therapy in doing it\nUm but it's um there's always the right in the wrong way to do things so um my concerns with people that are starting to get into to using stem cells is um their experience with this themselves do they understand how they work at this you know what how you know what are the protocols you can use to do to treat people\nAnd I'm a lot of places they don't do any follow up for for with patients which really upsets me 'cause I think that's a huge part of the healing process is to follow people and and to make sure that they're on the right track and there's a lot like I mentioned a lot of\nDifferent modalities and things that we incorporate in our treatment and um so it's it's really vital I think to see people and we see people at a month after three six nine months a year and then in every year afterwards\nAnd that we want to make sure patients get better and and so if they're having some issues if something comes up and not sure what's going on we're always available to them and I'm with a with all these different modalities and different\nTreatments that we used to accentuate the stem cell therapy it's a it's been wonderful but I think that's what's um [noise]\nIf people are out there if you're in another city or state where our officers are located and he can't come see is that if you do see someone doing stem cell therapy just to find out\nAll the information you can whether it's the bone marrow or fat stem cells which a lot of physicians\nThat do stem cell therapy still use even though they're not very effective um and if the if how long this person has been using stem cell therapy where they know about the stem cells um those type of things are very important before um before you can choose the right person to work with your the right person\nTo have for folks to work with how do they find a\nCouple of different ways to find this we have a brand new website it's um southern stem cell Institute topped by ... ...

days he has spoken to us by a son\nWhom he appointed air of all things through whom\nHe also created the world's he is\nThe reflection of God's glory\nAnd the exact imprint of God's very bean\nAnd he

inherited is\nMore excellent then there's\nNo God did not subject to coming world about which we are speaking to angels\nBut someone who has testified somewhere from some ate what are human beings that you are mindful of them or mortals that you care for them you have made them for a little while lower than the angels you have crowned them with glory and honor subjecting\nAll things under their feet now and subjecting all things to them\nGod left nothing outside their control\nAs it is we do not yet\nSee everything and subjects into them but we do see Jesus\nWho for a little while was made lower than the angels now crowned with glory and honor because of the suffering of death\nSo that by the grace of God he might taste death\nFor everyone it was fitting that God for whom and through whom all things exist\nIn bringing many children to glory should make the pioneer of their salvation perfect\nThrough sufferings for the one who sanctify ... and those who are saying defied all have

institutions we can't find common ground he says\nOn which to respectfully\nDisagree [noise] the other side\nIs the enemy [noise]\nUh this article elevates something I think that we into it or we have experienced or at least we have\nObserved in our time\nExperienced or observe than a regular way even on a daily basis that we live in an age of us versus them\nTo be sure much has been written a\nOn this matter over the past two plus decades as to how we ended up\nIn this particular predicament much has been said about these things but I think in this month's edition of the Atlantic authors Amy chew a and Jed Ruben failed I think they put it succinctly\nThey wrote this the causes of America's resurgent tribalism or many they include seismic demographic change\nWhich has led to predictions that whites will lose their majority status within a few decades declining social mobility and a growing class divide and media that reward expressions of outrage all of this has contributed to a climate in which\nEvery group in America\nMinorities and white conservatives and liberals the working class and Elise everyone feels under attack\nActually keep coming we keep choosing each other\nWe're differences even when we don't see things I we keep choosing each other\nI heard from somebody this week there was sharing a moment of dissidents in a in a group they're part of a group that they love in the life of this church\nAnd the difference between that group I think in many groups that we facility that we are part of out in the world I think a group like the difference is is that despite there that the antagonism maybe or despite the descendants that they experience it over a controversial issue\nAfter that experience you know what they're going to do next week they're gonna come back together\nAnd you know what they're going to do today they're going to celebrate communion as one family\nThat is the difference between the church and the world we choose each other\nBecause God has chosen all of us\nTo be the church brothers and sisters to Christ our congregation I Believe I Believe this in these fractured\nTimes\nHas the vocational obligation\nAs well as the vocational opportunity to lean into this essential nature to claim it\nAs a foundational truth of our identity as ones created cared for and crowns by God and to share this message with our city to share it with our partners in Brazil and Cuban Haiti Jamaica and Kenya and clerks than and and then the entire world I think we have a vocational\nObligation to be sent into guard's mission to dismantle\nAll systems in strongholds where this essence and this foundation is not being upheld and in its place by God's divine Providence what we do is we build alters in the world we built tables in the world to demonstrate what God intends\nFor everybody that all people are welcome to Christ table and all people are to be received as Christ's siblings are closed with this\nThere is something that sort of like a ... the sermon for this church let's just speak very frankly like many of you\nDrive past three four five ten different churches to come here\nAnd part of what gets you in the room\nIs because what I just talked about is in the DNA of this church right I mean I see some heads not it's in the DNA\nOf the church and when we choose to be part of this community wanted to respond to God's call but too because there is something about all the things I just said that resonates with us on a deep guttural level\nHere is the challenge for us it's one thing to affirm all of this\nIn this space it's one thing to do that and we should do it each and every week we deal with each and every weekend warship throughout\nAll people are welcome\nIn this church but it's another thing\nTo carry out this identity in the world to let it shape\nYour relationships to let it shape\nHow you view other people to let it shape what you post on social media to lead it shaped how you think about your perceived enemy to let it shape your politics to let it shape how you vote\nTo let a shame how you spend money\nTo let it shape how you spend time\nIt's one thing to do it in these walls and we should\nBut it's something entirely different to carry out the sights as central identity in the world that's what Jesus did the essence of the gospel is that Jesus left the comfort\nOf heaven\nTo come to the world not you know for all structure but in the world\nTo bear witness to claim\nThis essential identity\nTo the point\nThat she died for it to die for it\nAnd God\nVindicate him that death raised him from the dead to prove once and for all the way to be truly human\nIs to embrace the fact that we are\nCreated cared for and crown by God\nAnd not just us\nBut every human being may that truce shape\nOur lives\nFor the sake of the gospel\nAnd for the sake of the world\nI'm In [noise]\n\n\nThe\nMinor league [noise]\n\n\nNa na\n\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\nYeah [noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nOh\n\n[noise]\n\n[laughter]\n\nThe good news or the gospel is that that loves do about\nThat we are not people are scarcity where people have abundance and we have something to share of what God has said each and every one of us through God's word which is is that there is something\nEssential to us that we are created cared for and crowns by God but a spare witness to that reality outside of these walls in our lives and for the life of the world and made a piece of God which goes beyond all understanding because your heart's in your minds in Christ may is peace

apartment capital application much less section eight or\nThey won't be able to get a driver's license without an id or insurance to drive a car\nThat they are attempting to drive with illegal ID do you see how this works but when you have a generation of people who have been lied to\nBy the hypocrites of their leadership this narrative works this narrative\nCells because there are two things that sell to people whenever it comes to politics are really anything any kind of a movement I just sat\nThrough an amazing night with senator of Vincent Fort and senator Josh ... of an evening was hosted by William Perry of Georgia ethics watchdogs\nAnd we were very lax environment it manuals tavern\nAnd we wanted to bring these two gentlemen together to kind of\nDissipate the hyperbolic partisanship this going on in the country and I really appreciated it because I have never been a fan of into for really for any reason primarily because I'm not a sanctuary city loving American Patriot Act\nAnd Mr Ford made it very clear that if he became our mayor he would in fact turn Atlanta into a sanctuary city\nWhich clearly were on our way to that now but what I realized about Center for that night is what I Know that all of us to be true\nThat if you will just sit and listen to someone\nParticularly about their politics or faith whatever whether you know face be damned whatever someone's an atheist you will normally here is because they've been wounded somewhere along the way someone politics\nAre normally informed by the most influential person in that person's life for men is normally their fathers\nAnd what I heard from Center for that night was it his hard working Democrat father who had to work two jobs along with the climate in which senator Fort was raised\nWhere he had to fight to even be counted as someone is what is still informs is politics today\nSo well I can receive that and I can appreciate that and have a better understanding and really kind of hunker down on my respect for him as a fellow human okay\nNot to mention a leader he also Greece me because we haven't moved past that some people will never move past their beginnings\nSome of you are in that position right now and there are other people who capitalize on that and that's why this narrative cells from the left that fear and anger or what Dr voters fear and anger those are the two emotions and that's\nWhat came out of that night between these two senators that absolutely agree on that [noise]\nSo all this dark money all the all of the fear they're leading they're leaving

you know was determined to see all the way through\nNovember two thousand fourteen we broke the news that Cochran self published this faith based book with the section on sexual ethics sharply criticized the gay community former mayor cars seem read fire Cochran two months later after city investigation found Cochran published the book without proper permission and then handed it out to subordinate\nAn advocacy group filed a federal civil rights lawsuit on Koch once we have over what he called unjust termination\nAnd pose adverse consequences against me for publicly living out my faith writing a book on my own private time and that was unjust\nRemarks were not reflective of what we value and we are\nStill mayor occasionally bottoms told us settling the case was basically a business decision there were\nMade by the for that question\nIs it would be paying damages litigation the one point\nTwo million dollars is not enough as far as I'm concerned and I'm about to be a taxpayer of the city of Atlanta\nSo on one hand is a Christian I'm celebrating because that is a victory because as I understand the story he did not go into work proselytizing he did not set up a table right outside of his office in demand that people come and buy a book or sell a book or any of that\nIt was a matter of conversation that he said that he had written this book and someone said well what's in the book and I see the book he brought a copy of the book I don't even know if money was exchanged for the book\nThe person raise it and it's like oh well okay so you know and maybe the person's gay I don't know\nThat like he said there were Seventeen other things lifted there but the one thing we're going to extract is the one thing that just that's just not who we are in the city and the city of Atlanta\nKeep in mind that came out of the face of the woman who sat on my show and said that God told her to run to become the next mayor of Atlanta so which is that Kesha like you either subscribe to scripture you don't ... cherry picking\nClearly because here we are shoving a scheme down the taxpayers throats right now I don't think that's very godly I could be wrong I don't know maybe it was lifted in one of the staff does probably lifted and one of the Seventeen things on the fence God\nAt least it isn't my Bible lying is to bearing faults witnesses to arrogance pride is too I didn't write it but I Believe it and I had a heck of a time trying to live it but I sure sure want to but that's not enough money for what he's been through\nThat man served and served well well he was he's been held by president he's been held by leaders all over the country as\nSomeone who led and lead well I don't think one person has come forward to say that he was abusive or exercise to any form of discrimination against them for their sexuality this is dangerous territory that we're in an ... theme of course he's going to stand by his decision because he still is arrogant as he was when he was in office\nSo that's not going to change in a in an orange jumpers not going to change that either sorry maybe our prayers will buy it and you got him line and Kesha wearing to it what else is ...\nThere's a license to Atlanta fire chief Calvin Cochran and hopefully you know his life will be an idea you know what I don't even have to hope for that I Know that that is true that God will restore the years that the locus of eating and whatever that one point two million dollars won't cover and the way of reputation\nPeace joy I Know with absolute certainty that that is the God we serve so moving right along speaking of pastors pastor Andrew Brunson was on good morning America talking about his time in captivity in Turkey still loves the Turkish I tell you he's better than my family because my family\nGreek [laughter] if it's one thing I grew up with but I had her a pet of generationally whatever I became like a born again Christian was my family's disdain for the Turks because that goes\nYou think black and white Scott about in the city of Atlanta [laughter] you've not seen generational separation until you talk with Greeks and Turks I'm just telling yeah All right go ahead\nBefore we went uh for the oval office we prayed together and my wife and I and I said we would have that chance to pray for him we believe in the power of prayer and we think this president means a lot of prayer every president does\nParents so we ask God to give us an opportunity\nTo spend Twenty years in Turkey and then October two thousand sixty [noise] they're taking a closer did you have a sense of what was happening\nWe were actually shocked\nAh we were arrested on our oldest son's birthday and this was for deportation than we were told that we were being arrested because we were in a threat to national security\nAnd within a very short time [noise] ah it became clear to us that this was unusual we weren't allowed to see a consular official and we were kept my wife and I for Thirteen Days with all contact with the outside\nAnd it just kept expanding ... [noise] so uh we we were really shocked because we spent twenty four years ah telling people to turkey where does this very openly and I've never had a problem", "show_name": "Atlanta's Morning News", "year": "2018", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "21"}
