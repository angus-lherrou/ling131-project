a ... here to stay and and I I tell people you know why was the effort if they're not causing the problem or is that problem can be mitigated by\nA reducing your do harvest or doing a combination of trapping a ... a ... in addition to reduce\nThe all of these guys on the way to the woods this morning are familiar with a coyote population wherever it is that there hunting\nMhm ... yeah yeah yeah and you know shooting from the deer stand I'm not doing you know a lot of good [laughter] might make you feel better but um you know I don't I don't ... she had a ... a okay Mitchell is [noise]\n[noise] what's the biggest violation that's occurring in let's say it's four thirty in the morning sunrise it's seven I guess ... biggest violation today the figure in the season the biggest\nViolation that really occur and unless that is the people hunting without permission may bakes legal now basically all of the state except for you know there'll be a maze and federal lands\nUm and there's a lot of violations that are more dangerous like your night hunting and et cetera but the one that ... the most is hunting without permission\nTo the gate and give me some examples of how far someone will go to have a place to hunt where they shouldn't be\nWell we have people that we know of going on the tax maps and um go up and find out whether it's owned by industries or anything else or if it's a private landowners out of the state and then they'll sometimes just take over the piece of property they'll even put up posted signs and keep other people out so they can honey legally\nSo they get a creative shall we say I\nI Would think so I Would think so you ah [noise] ah ...\nWe have a prep to anybody with questions or anything today what what would be a a surprising encounter in your career of Tim plus for fourteen or Fifteen Years is a game or and what would be a surprise encounter you like to tell us about\nWell we've that happens all the time I mean I dealt with one yesterday that I got brought a bay area and that he said fell off a cliff and got killed\nAnd you know I could have happened but a bears don't normally fall down cliffs [laughter] that's that's correct but\nAh so we run into a lot of ventures like the best and the funny thing about it some of them are true\nSo will the debate or have a bullet hole and you know it did and they actually I'm pretty sure he got hit by a car so I guess so yeah All right here's a question and then at that point should we do the following before the next break whether it's a white tailed deer or whether it's a black bear\nWhether it's private property wildlife management area whatever the case might be in the state of Georgia 'cause you can't comment about other states who owns that they are and who owns that mayor who owns that they are Charlie they blow the state of Georgia okay and the ... same like people in the state of Georgia we do not own these animals\nWe oughta individually yup right not until you put a bullet in it legally you know once you kill it legally you become the owner I see okay but there are let's go back to this guy who just hit a deer in the highway ... here in the ... or ran over that ... that are falling off a player who owns that bear\nWhoever finds it who ever find well basically there's a procedure now especially with a ... you have to get a form filled out that says it's a road kill bear and then you can have it legally ah\nWe have a state law that that specifically allows that uh people that that hit an animal that they have the right to to take that out on my home and consume\nOkay do they do don't they have to notify the ...\nThey have to notify my suggestion is if it's been an accident usually there's a police report a get\nA copy of the police report or get a card from the officer and those that says you know road kill or whatever that while you're covered when you care to a process or you don't have to put it on your harvest record or anything else because when you get to the processors they're going to ask you how you obtain this you know carcass\nRight and that didn't have a little bit older than him for one\nThing it doesn't have a bullet hole plus you know you're not supposed to have it unless you can prove who killed it or how you got it I see so like I said get something that says it was an accident and then you'll be clear well\nThese are burdensome regulations\nNo one in fact we wouldn't made several strides in recent years sexually simplify or regulations um you know we talked about a licensing being an issue in this last major overhaul last year by license system we\nWaving simplified our lessons structure how that's the other way with a lot of different license types in in great

and would ambulance crews and fire crews to do anything native wow so anything from protect them to um actually get them in and out is needed so uh the day are does perform a lot of extra\nDues that people do not realize oh they have well and I didn't know that Charlie and I'll even add to that and it's it's a you know things like these hurricanes it's all hands on deck we uh I I was down on hurricane duty earlier this week a solemn trees myself\nWe had a gay more than ... down there we had a fisheries biologist and fisheries technicians we had\nA non game invasive plant biologist down there working with us um [noise] uh all all hands on deck cutting trees every body to hold ... pitching in park staff of ... uh we all chip in in and get it done\nWell they are mark what do you think you're not surprised Ari\n\n... must be gone already but that's okay we got the answer the question always an intelligent a call from mark\n... visit a couple of things that we visited there during the first hour program is Fifteen after right now let me give you the telephone numbers for all for eight seven to zero seven fifty or eight hundred nine seven to eight to five five\nLet's go to eat first ... Charlie\nUh uh uh state whitetail deer deer biologist what the world are you do\n[noise] uh I Do a lot [laughter] feels it's a but it's all fun um I Love my job I a coordinate uh all of our data collection that I Do a lot of our analysis that helps inform our hunting regulations every year um\nAnd I do a coordinator disease surveillance would do a lot of uh of work with things like him Raj disease which were having a pretty bad year with this year\nI'm would do surveillance for chronic wasting disease and then I'll just you know I Do a lot of customer service work I work with with hunters are all over the state uh on land management given them advice\nAnd uh you know anything I can do to help the public eye I answer tons and tons of questions I get you wouldn't believe how many pictures I get emails either how old is this the ear or what's wrong with this year oh yeah I bet that all the power and let's\nGo to this how many deer and George you're walking around right now\nUh you know my gas and and I'm not joking it's a gas educated guess rather but um you know our our latest population estimates about one a one point two to one point three million\nAnd I know that sounds like a lot of deer oh there's no weather can be over a million deer in the state well we got almost ten million people so\nTen people forever deer and uh you know Georgia is I'm almost sixty thousand square miles six hundred and forty acres in the square mile uh what's that forty three million acres so you know a little over a million there doesn't doesn't sound like as much as I say\nMuch does the okay how many over the course of the season beginning today where we have primitive weapons and we already had archery now the rifle season opens this morning over the course of the season how many white tailed deer will be harvest\nOn average between three hundred and fifty and four hundred thousand\nOkay so we started with a million three or a million three and a half were going to harvest of a three hundred and fifty to four hundred thousand are those numbers correct with our habitat\nYes we are in the best place that we've been in my Thirteen year career with the with the deer population we we got a a perfect ballots with the deer population and the habitat as a whole\nYou know there's there's places that are within that that are too hot or too low mountains especially being too low on on the public land the ... at least but um\nYou know by and large on average we are in in a great spot we've got great quality dear oh we've got good numbers that we're ... we're in the golden days of deer hunting instead of Georgia\nOr before I get to a mutual with another question then we are where we are and it's good how long did it take us to get that way\nIt took a lot of years you know by the turn of the ... a sort of the twentieth century uh we had almost annihilated every year in the state uh through habitat destruction and market hunting and it took from the Nineteen twenties until Nineteen Seventy five which was our major uh restocking effort\nAnd then uh we didn't see the population get uh up to a good level until the Nineteen eighties and that it quickly jumped out of control remain over abundant until about two thousand five\nAnd we got a got it down ... down a little bit too low and then we brought it back up and the last five to five to six years and now we're in a perfect spot so it's been a a a long way and a big roller coaster ride with the deer population\nI Want to include Mitchell in a minute but I I Want to if we don't get before the next break but I Want to handle the following question [noise] how is it that you managed when you had too many here for the habitat how what two did you manage to put it back under control so baited question\nWell there are a couple of different things uh season linked bag limits and the number of the six days those are the major drivers and and what how we control the deer population than to do all of that you gotta have hunters ... as\nThe guy yeah otherwise you'd have to hire it done\nBut I Will we pay our we didn't have the hunters we wouldn't have the money to hire the exactly right well that's that's good so\nYou know I I think it helps the more you know the more you understand more ability you have to enjoy whether you're fishing hunting or whatever the case might be if a guy's on the way to the woods nanny knows how many here in Georgia and the role that you guys play maybe it it expands his vision\nWhile he's sitting in the deer stand watching the deer walked by and find out\nHow did this all happened\nAnd how long did it take\nI think it ah it allows that guy to uh enjoy the seasons more and it is opening day so a lot of ... in ... and then I asked how many people will be hunting\nThough their participation in the woods and the deer stand what would you tell them is the primary a message from from a game warden standpoint\nWe want to say have fun but we all want also want to say they say I saw it I Want to take that extra second and that's all it takes for you to think about what you're doing and put on the proper harness if you're climbing into it\nAnd pull your weapon up properly um if your fish and keep a life jacket close by just take that extra minute to think about your safety and the people with your safety because even though it's recreation it can be hazardous and it can ruin a good day if you don't\nYeah and how long has it been a search your memory now because I Do remember but I don't remember how long ago that another hunter was shot at or shot in the woods in ...\nI don't remember the date but we've had three stay on accents and shooting actually it's this year so\nAlready already well [noise] fellows a ... and follow up to that it's just deer hunting you're not saving anyone's life take the extra moments to be safe\nAnd you'll enjoy it more that's right and you get the as I said in the first hour you get to go home and live at it right very true okay thirty two after the hour for all for eight seven to zero seven fifty eight hundred nine seven to eight to five five so\nAre there how many three hundred and fifty thousand people all over the season how many are in the woods this morning opening day\nUh I don't know for sure but a quite a few quite a good percentage of over fifty percent of that three hundred and fifty thousand is this the best day\n[noise] ah well it depends on your perspective if you're in North Georgia and and your after or do they know that right okay it's buckled lay out a lot of the northern part of the state or won't they a couple more weeks and and ah do days opened back up and and then that'll be your diet for you to do man\nOkay All right here's the question and let's see it's thirty two I've got a got enough time to [noise] to handle this\n... pervasive question that a with a multitude of answers but I Want to correct when what determines the beginning of the ... in both the male and female species of white tailed deer what determines the ... states [noise]\nWell the trigger okay\nA tournament others there's there's there's a there's a a pre programmed that that\nThat controls the date but it's a trigger for that his photo period date I explain that okay so um what controls the the breeding date has got to be the the genetics of the animals and ... and as you know\nUh we have genetics from a lot of different areas of the country that we're all brought here to Georgia we got here from Wisconsin we got there from Texas\nAnd most of our restocking came from within the state our barrier islands so we've got\nUm a good a variety of deer but um you know our ... right and just from mid October too late December depended on where you are in the state and a lot of that is genetically programmed so\nWith that genetic program in those states it's the daily\nThe shortening of days that actually triggers that hormonal process that starts in the females\nAnd that hormonal process and the females as what triggers the hormonal process and the ... okay so um as as a as we lead the\nThe summer and uh males a testosterone starts to rise or their ... mineral laws and hard and then they shed velvet they start rubbing trees they start fighting with other books and that's a\nThat's a good time to say that there was with that in\nMind then my smart alec answer to the class that question people ask me so often is now a ... a windows ... that's the same times next last year that's right same time that same day\nWell a lot of people that the weather impacts the rut and a lot of things do right well the rut itself is not necessarily impacted but deer movement can be an eye off by a weather ah factors and that sort of thing but if you\nIf you look at uh like say you pull some a fetal aging data from those late season you'll find that year after year the ... rating dates are going to be the same and and the area that you're hunting\nOkay quick question quick answer is their second ... yes okay we'll talk about that when we get back at so that's a loaded question that most deer hunters don't understand\nBecause they don't look at it scientifically at all so we're going to talk about the second ...\nUh [noise] right now let me give the telephone numbers at for all for a seven to zero seven fifty eight hundred nine seven to eight to five five So Daniel and wait and Richard and all you guys if you'd like to hold on we'll try to get to your questions I promised a self serving a\nPromotion you can watch O'Neill outside

warm drain planning bulbs that if you plan of those soldiers that warm the bowls will\nThey grow for such a long time they totally exhausted themselves really and truly they exhausted themselves and don't have quite the pretty flowers in the spring that would have if you waited until the soil is just a little bit cooler until air temperatures are just a little bit cooler in the fall\nTo answer your question is it time to plant your balls right now yes it is\nThe second question what should I fertilized with you know anything\nThat you can put into the soil with them I think is perfectly fine\nBone meals you know grandma you use bone meal and used to be bone meal had a good bit of nutrition and it it has some nitrogen had a lot of phosphorus a lot of potassium in bone meal but the common ordinary everyday bone meal now does it have a lot of nitrogen matches what forces leaf growth\nAnd so ... doesn't have a lot of nitrogen and it doesn't really help the bulb all that much he hasn't has phosphorus but that the that much phosphorus in the ground\nSo I think any other kind of fertilizer specially formulated bald fertilizers you could use child release fertilizers like ... you could use the slow release natural fertilizers like a middle organized\nOr a highly zone one of those all those weren't fun but it's sort of less ... who in his early in the season for a vote is probably a lot better for it and I probably it is a lot better for it there's a fertilized late and that's the time when you think oh man I should be fertilized my balls is April the leaves wrote him a ball\nWhat happens in may all the leaves fall off to they have time to absorb nutrients not a lot of time to absorb nutrients from what's on the grounds you applied in April the time to put fertilizer down from bulls is now just for the plans above now is a great time to do it\nDuring now that you're both plan and get a fertilized with my friends you are going to have some good looking flowers next spring coming to the next half hour\nDavid and Mary animals though he's got to say go palm in a pot what's he gonna do with it now they've been obviously knows that they freeze in the

say go out\nUntil it gets twenty eight or below or do you like it was a big pretty pretty good for that to a temperature [noise]\nA lot of people do bring them in but as you know they get pretty darn big and so a out necessarily have to bring it in until it gets twenty eighth grade if you have room for eco head bringing in but I think you'll find to lay out for a little while longer anyway\nAll

flower auction Amsterdam for real that\n... death that they have and put it in our county\nYeah right exactly and the flowers from all over the world I mean flower growers all over the world shipped their flowers over light usually on an airplane to Amsterdam and answer them there's symbol of together and the flower brokers they buy them a bit on that you gotta auctioned off in the brokers are representing\nRetail people like when I'm like pike nursery like a local Kroger like your local a flower shop and they\nYou know get the flower after a day or so to brokers bid on it the here they are in Atlanta and Griffin and then from Amsterdam\nSo they all bad than like a you cannot do is those kind of flower isn't that\nA lot of them are patented flowers but not everyone I'm In a hundred and just some are patented summer not so I guess it just depends on which which variety than go to the auction\nSo it's that tap on the line and then it come from a girl after that that multiply\nAnywhere and in Europe could be from uh South America from Columbia even they could fly Columbia to Amsterdam and that's when I answered it back to the United states it could be in Spain and Portugal but they have a lot of flower going down there\nOr just anywhere the flowers are well grown where they come from to Amsterdam to be auctioned off\nThe variety that we have now because sometime we never thought of solid come to spring time there's always something new a common problem that Marquette isn't it\nYeah yeah yeah there's something blooming in January in South Africa as hide ranges and things like that in New Zealand to have lots and lots of HUD ranges and so the ... growers their shift their flowers to Amsterdam so you can have a pretty blue advantage in January and Lana [noise]\nOh I must
