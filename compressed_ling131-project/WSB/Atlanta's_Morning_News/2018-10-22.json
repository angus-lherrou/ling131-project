pending list as non citizens or their citizenship hasn't been verified which we have to do about Georgia law she wants them to be able to vote in this election\nAnd then she was caught on camera saying she wanted documented and undocumented bugs\nIn Georgia to be part of the blue wave to to you know\nAdvocate for non citizens voting and George elections is outrageous that that's more liberal than California and I think that's something that voters need to know as well or to really have the facts on both sides of this argument and then they can decide you know who they want to support for governor\nLet's move on to transportation an awful lot of folks sitting in Atlanta traffic right now who would love to hear ideas and how to make it ... what are you thinking\nWell look as a father three teenage daughters I have fault traffic you know trying to get to the metro area from where we live in Athens to get to one of our daughters ball games uh I've done the same trying to get home to see them play when they're in Athens when I've been working in Atlanta\nAnd it certainly is someone that's been working in Atlanta for eight and a half years being traveling just from my apartment\nDowntown to the Capitol man I've experienced the\nThe congestion that we have in the metro area in some ways it's a it's a good problem to have that our state's growing 'em is growing faster than we can build roads you know the the opposite of that if we were in a terrible economy or somewhere up in the northeast where people are fleeing in those areas in our\nDowntown buildings are being boarded up would not be a good scenario but that being said we've got to continue to move the needle and there's been a lot done over the last um eight ... seven and a half years under governor deals leadership\nUm many projects under way you know fully supportive of things like rapid bus transit up four hundred a lot of the inter change projects we have going on right now ... is

they're going to give our citizens are the best chance it relief or the best chance to get their goods and services from the market we've got to have a statewide transportation plan which I Do because\nEven if you're say a farmer or business person in South Georgia or up in North ... you know you got to have good logistics to get your products to the market\nYou know while congestion ... may be a priority in Atlanta and other parts of the state it's not so we need to governor is going to focus on all those things\nI think we can get the best of both worlds when you think of things like inland port trying to get some of our container traffic all the roads own to a rail system to alleviate trucks coming coming through downtown\nAtlanta you know looking at other projects that give us a ... passes around the metro areas for Trump's either on the west side of the state or on the east side of the state\nThey will have those drugs that don't need to unload in the in the metro area to divert the Atlanta there's a lot of that going on now very supportive of that but we also got to have and the governor when it comes to transportation that keeps\nMaking sure that will wear well rounded and look into the future\nUm especially on things like innovative innovation with\nSelf driving cars dedicated lanes for that\nAutonomy ... you know vehicle type things and and um that's going
