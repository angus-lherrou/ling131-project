I don't ruin a deer Huck she had a ... a okay Mitchell\nIs [noise]\n[noise] what's the biggest violation that's occurring in let's say it's four thirty in the morning sun rises at seven I guess one of the biggest violation today though you're in the season\nThe biggest violation that really occur and unless that is the people hunting without permission may ... illegal now basically all of the state except for you know there'll be a maze and federal lands\nUm and there's a lot of violations that are more dangerous like your night hunting and et cetera but the one that really occur is the most is hunting without permission\nTo the gate and give me some examples of how far someone will go to have a place to hunt where they shouldn't be\nWell we have people that we know of going on the tax maps and um go up and find out whether it's owned by industries or anything else or if it's a private landowners out of the state and then they'll sometimes just take over the piece of property they'll even put a posted signs and keep other people out so they can honey legally\nSo they get a creative shall we say I would\nThink so I Would think so you are a ... we have a prep to anybody with questions or anything today what what would\nBe a surprising encounter in your career of Tim bluster fourteen or Fifteen Years is a game or and what would be a surprising counter you'd like to tell us about\nWell that happens all the time I dealt with one yesterday that I got brought a bay area and that he said fell off a cliff and got killed and you know I could have happened but a bears don't normally fall down cliffs [laughter] that's that's correct\nBut ah so we run into a lot of venture is like the best and the funny thing about some of them are true\nSo well the ... have a bullet hole in it no it did and they actually I'm pretty sure he got hit by a car so I guess so yeah All right here's a question then at that point should we do the following before the next break whether it's white tailed deer or whether it's a black bear\nWhether it's private property wildlife management area whatever the case might be in the state of Georgia 'cause you can't comment about other states who owns that they are and who owns that mayor who owns that they are Charlie they blow the state of Georgia okay and the ... ... people at the state of Georgia we do not own these animals\nWe individually yup right not until you put a bullet in it legally you know what I Want to kill it legally you become the owner I see okay but yeah I in our midst go back to this guy who just hit a day or the highway ... here in the road or ran over that ... who owns that bear\nWhoever finds whoever found well basically there's a procedure now especially with the ... you have to get a form filled out that says it's a road killed there and then you can have it legally\nAh we have a state law that that specifically allows that uh people that that hit an animal that they have the right to to take that out of them all home in ...\nOkay do they don't they have to notify the county or airs nature where the\n... they have to notify my suggestion is if it's been an accident usually there's a police report a get\nA copy of the police report or get a card from the officer\nAnd those that says you know road kill or whatever that while you're covered when you care to a process or you don't have to put it on your harvest record or anything else because when you get to the processors they're going to ask you how you obtain this you know carcass right\nAnd that doesn't have to hold any for one thing well it\nDoesn't have a bullet hole plus you know you're not supposed to have it unless you can prove who killed it or how you got it I see so like I said get something that says it was an accident and then you'll be clear\nWill these aren't burdensome regulations\nNo when in fact we wouldn't made several strides in recent years sexually simplify regulations um you know we talked about a licensing being an issue in this last major overhaul last year by license system we\nWave and simplified our losses structure I left the other way with a lot of different losses types and in great things together to make it simple and you use the native wildlife management area license that's one that's gone every hunting license now has the privilege of hunting on public land\nOkay well uh\nI'll make this statement we go to a break and we'll handle it and a few minutes our wildlife management area stop me when I go wrong when I get back our wildlife management areas are under

supposed to be fun productive and you need to live so you can go back and lie about it\nThat's right and uh if you're out recreating a lot of people don't think about it but what all of these are heading this and the slice it take that literally extra ticket to think about what you're doing a good idea Charlotte\nWell let's talk about license fees you know we've got a user pay user benefits system hunters fun conservation\nHow we got our money from one or two ways our license fees and then a federal excise tax that some better than the cost of firearms and a musician it's about eleven percent these days I didn't know that much yes and uh it sounds like a lot but um I'm telling you\nThat's what that's what brought wildlife back to the side of Georgia and that's what keeps it maintaining now although the name of that act in a that is the Pitman Roberts tonight to Nineteen thirty seven it's been modified a little bit over the years to increase that but we all we commonly referred to as the wildlife and sport fish restoration program\nWe pay our own way don't we that's right for the benefit of all Georgia citizens and and and all Georgia wildlife that's right\nAnd for every hunting license sets bought\n'em and for those of you that that might be a an age where you still get a free license\nGo on and uh and bought that senior sport since license because then we can tell you every year for the rest of your life and we bring in fifty dollars of federal money for every license that sold had to be sold so any license that we give away doesn't count bright but\nIf it's a purchase license than uh than we get to count and we get to capture that fifty dollars of federal money on an\nAdult I buy the license to for the ... in principle I buy the license also\nAnd and that even though it's a nominal fee to get that once you're over a certain age it really brings in a lot of money to the to the un or to help manage wildlife okay\nAll right we've got another hour

Charlie uh\nUh a state of white tailed deer deer biologist what the world are you do\n[noise] ah I Do a lot it's a but it's all fun um I Love my job I I uh coordinate of all of our data collection that I Do a lot of our analysis that helps inform our hunting regulations every year um\nAnd I do a coordinate our disease surveillance would do a lot of uh of work with things like him ratchet disease which were having a pretty bad year with this year\nUm we do surveillance for credit wasting disease\nAnd then I just you know I Do a lot of customer service work I work with with hunters are all over the state uh on land management given them advice\nAnd ah you know anything I can do to help the public eye I answer tons and tons of questions I get you wouldn't believe how many uh pictures I get emails either how old is this the ear or what's wrong with this year oh yeah I bet that all the time right let's\nGo to this how many deer and George you're walking around right now\nUh you know my guess and I and I'm not joking that's a guess educated guess rather but um you know our our latest population estimates about one a one point two to one point three million\nAnd I know that sounds like a a lot of deer oh there's no weather can be over a million do in the state well we got almost ten million people so\nTen people for every year and a you know Georgia is I'm almost sixty thousand square miles six hundred and forty acres in the square mile uh what's that forty three million acres so you know a little over a million deer doesn't doesn't sound like it's like I say\nMuch there's no okay I made over the course of the season beginning today where we have primitive weapons and we already had archery and now the rifle season opens this morning over the course of the season how many white tailed deer will be harvest\nOn average between three hundred and fifty um four hundred thousand\nOkay so we started with a million three or a million three and a half were going to harvest of a three hundred and fifty to four hundred thousand are those numbers correct with our habitat\nYes we are in the best place that we've been in my Thirteen year career with the with the deer population we we got a a perfect ballots with the deer population in the habitat as a whole\nYou know there's there's places that are within that that are too hot or too low mountains especially being too low on on the public land the ... at least but um\nYou know by and large on average we are in in a great spot we've got great quality deer ah we've got good numbers that we're ... we're in the golden days of deer hunting instead of Georgia\nAre before I get to a mutual with another question then we are where we are and it's good how long did it take us to get that way\nIt took a lot of years you know by the turn of the ah turn on the twentieth century a way it almost annihilated every year in the state uh through habitat destruction and market hunting and it took from the Nineteen twenties until Nineteen Seventy five which was our major uh restocking effort\nAnd then uh we didn't see the population get uh up to a good level until the Nineteen eighties and then it quickly jumped out of control remain over abundant until about two thousand and five\nAnd we got it got it down ... down a little bit too low and then we brought it back up and the last five to five to six years and now we're in a perfect spot so it's been a a a long way and the big roller coaster ride with the deer population\nI Want to include Mitchell in a minute but I I Want to if we don't get before the next break but I Want to handle the following question [noise] how is it that you managed when you had too many here for the habitat how what two did you manage to put it back under control to ... question\nWell there are a couple of different things uh season linked bag limits and the number of the six days those are the major drivers and and what how we control the deer population then to do all of that you gotta have hunters\nYeah that's the guy yeah otherwise you'd have to hire at doing\nAll right well we pay our we didn't have the hunters we wouldn't have the money to hire the ads exactly\nRight well that's good so you know\nI I think it helps the more you know the more you understand more ability you have to enjoy whether you're fishing hunting or whatever the case might be if a guy's on the way to the which now and he knows how many deer in Georgia and the role that you guys play maybe it expands his vision\nWhile he's sitting in the deer stand watching the deer walked by and find out\nHow did this all happened and how long did it take I think it ah it allows that got to enjoy the seasons more and it is opening day so a lot of ... in ... and then I asked how many people will be hunting well\nThough their participation in the woods and the deer stand what would you tell them is the primary a message from from a game warden standpoint\nWe want to have fun but we also want to say they say I saw it I Want to take that extra ... and that's all it takes for you to think about what you're doing and put on the proper harness if you're climbing into its stand pull your weapon up\nUm if your fish and keep a life jacket close by just take that extra minute to think about your safety and the people with your safety because even though it's recreation it can be hazardous and it can ruin a good day if you don't\nYeah and how long is it being a search your memory now because I Do remember but I don't remember how long ago that ah another hunter was shot at or shot in the woods in ...\nI don't remember the date but we've had three stay on accents and shooting actually it's this year so\nAlready already well [noise] fellows a ... and follow up to that it's just deer hunting you're not saving anyone's life take the extra moments to be safe\nAnd you'll enjoy it more that's right and you get there as I said the first hour you get to go home and live at it right very true okay thirty two after the hour for all for eight seven to zero seven fifty eight hundred nine seven to eight to five five so\nAh there how many three hundred and fifty thousand people were hung over the season how many are in the woods this morning opening day\nUh I don't know for sure but a quite a few quite a good percentage of over fifty percent of that three hundred and fifty thousand is this the best day\n[noise] ah well it depends on your perspective if you're in North Georgia and and your after a do that no [laughter] right [laughter] okay it's buck only at a lot of the northern part of the state I won't be a couple more weeks and and ah do days opened back up and and then that'll be your day if you're the do man\nOkay All right here's the question is thirty two I've got a got enough time to [noise] to handle this\n... pervasive question it's a with a multitude of answers but I Want to correct when what determines the beginning of the ... in both the male and female species of white tailed deer what determines the ... dates [noise]\nWell the trigger okay\nTournament others there's there's there's a there's a a pre programmed thing that that\nThat controls the date but the trigger for that his photo period date I explain that okay so\nUm what controls the the breeding date has got to be the the genetics of the animals and ... and as you know uh we have genetics from a lot of different areas of the country that we're all brought here to Georgia we got here from Wisconsin we got there from Texas\nAnd most of our restocking came from within the state our barrier islands so we've got\nUm a good a variety of deer but um you know our ... right and just from mid October too late December depended on where you are in the state and a lot of that is genetically programmed so\nWith that genetic program in those states it's the daily the shortening of days that actually triggers that hormonal process that starts in the females and that hormonal process and the female's is what triggers the hormonal process and the ... okay so um as as a as we lead or\nThe summer and uh males a testosterone starts to rise or they're at lawyers mineral laws and Horton than the shit velvet I start rubbing trees they start fighting with other books and\nThat's a that's a good time to save the deer was with\nThat in mind the en masse smart alec answer to the ... that that question people ask me so often is now a ... a windows ... that's the same times next last year that's where I think that that same day\nWell a lot of people to the weather impacts the ... and a lot of things do right well the ... itself is not necessarily impacted but deer movement can be an eye off by a whether a factors and that sort of thing but if you\nIf you look at uh like say you pull some a fetal aging data and from those late season you'll find that year after year the ... rating dates are gonna be the saying and and the area that you're hunting\nOkay quick question quick answer is there a second ... yes okay we'll talk about that when we get back at so that's a loaded question that most deer hunters don't understand\nBecause they don't look at it scientifically at all so we're going to talk about the second ...\nUh [noise] right now let me give the telephone numbers for all for a seven to zero seven fifty eight hundred nine seven to eight to

and the amount of research effort goes into releasing these grasses most folks would be quite surprised with\nUm it's not just a matter of a new grass it generally takes it somewhere seven to twelve years before\nWe release of grass we have a nice ... educational are ... a research package that comes along with it so tough tough is is um [noise]\nUh requires less water to grow\nOnce it's
