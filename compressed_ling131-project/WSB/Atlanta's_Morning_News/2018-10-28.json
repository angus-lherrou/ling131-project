bought or just out we would not get it just ... we had to earn it and\nAs it should have obviously had we not had that happened um I think you would have seen way more intense scrutiny of the market does that that was kind of a secondary headline but obviously Michael coming in as it should be dominated the news and so that that took the pressure off a little bit of I think we would have seen otherwise\nBut regardless the world begins to react and then it spread it wasn't just a drop in the U.S would begin to see at the end of this a drop really across the whole international marketing people began to really wonder is this the end now if you're someone who watches the market you know\nThat right now we're sitting on the longest bull market ever OK ever bull market I mean in the market has been up since two thousand nine you know we had the crash in two thousand they hit the bottom and two thousand nine and it began to recover\nAnd since then it's been up up up and we've seen some minor debts but the last few years\nHardly any significant tips so people are waiting for the shoe to drop understandably\nBecause here's a hand a correction will come it will come and could be in five years it could be in five days no one knows but the market will take a turn and the other direction so people are waiting for that and depending on where you're at and your investment journey you're definitely waiting for that if you're close to retirement right now\nYou are thinking often probably about what happens if the market drops and so\nWhen the market began to drop and stayed that way the U.S and he was down for six straight sessions that begins to be\nIncreasingly intense hit to the get every day of is this that change and then there's a follow up question there and are ready for this and that's what I Want to hone in on\nA ... if there's one thing that we can win with here there's one area where this could truly be revolutionary could give you peace like you've not had\nBefore can make you confident about retirement it's if you let yourself ask that question am I reading was ready for this am I ready for what might be coming I'm gonna tell you exactly what to do with that we're not going to leave it up in the air\nOr we're gonna digging deep first if you're just joining us this is Chris Burns you're listening to more than money and we're going to break down everything that's happened\nThe last number of days the market took a significant\nA turn towards a drop and then it kind of stabilized on a friday and that's where we sit right now and it might be that it just keeps on going up um but we don't want to miss the impact of this or really again not the impact globally but the impact on our lives on our journey toward the future towards your dream so\nAgain if you missed the first part of the show jump on my website it's my life is more dot com and you can catch that okay\nSo let's talk for a minute about\nWhat begins to happen days into this there's there's one area specifically that I Want to do and that is the desire for an ...\nOkay did you start seeing explanations come out pretty fast I\nMean every single day if you read the financial publication of the wall Street Journal for instance you read that and the markets down at all it's going to get an explanation for why it's down is the best guess they can give but the reality is explanations are usually\n... they're usually not help for them to tell you why when when the market begin to drop two different explanations came forward you might have noticed as if you're watching the first one\nAnd that President Trump gave he in but I saw people give it before heated and most folks that we are huge fans of President Trump went along with this and that was this was all the feds fault the Federal Reserve's fault\nOkay because the Federal Reserve is raising interest rates because the economy is so strong they're trying to keep interest rates up so the economy doesn't overheat that's the idea of what the Federal Reserve is doing but when interest rates go up there's usually turmoil in the market there is a level of anxiety about inflation rising\nOkay so President Trump came out and actually said and this is the Fed's fault you got a lot of criticism because presidents don't normally say that but you saw a whole lot of people get in line behind and here's the deal there is no shock or surprise here that he came out and said that\nBecause guess what politicians want to be able to give a reason that's not them for why things aren't going well\nA smart political play I Want to make sure you guys see it's not my fault if it was without the fed interfering with the fed raising interest rates everything will be fine this week it's the fed\nSo if you're unhappy be unhappy with them they're the cause of this\nLet's shift some blame okay and then folks that that don't like President Trump gave it competing explanations and that was not the fed is it's a trade policy with China\nIt's the risk of a trade war\nThat's the issue and you're the you're the problem President Trump you're the one Institute in this trade where we have no reason for this but you're pushing it and because of that the whole the whole market's going to go down\nShe saw the suddenly these too boring explanations for what was going on and shock shark here right they lined up along political lines people like President Trump saying it's the feds fault the fed needs to back off\nNot presidents drums for people that don't like President Trump saying that was it's a trade deal with China that's the issue here's the problem with that nonsense it's that you can go back one month\nAnd look at both of those issues okay interest rates going up\nAnd the trade difficulties with China and we've been talking about them for months\nThere not knew there was this sudden change in fact if anything things a little less intense that the the trade dispute with China looked way more intense a few weeks ago it may become more intense again but it wasn't like something happened last week that was crazy with that deal and the same with inflation we've known about the the the fed continuing to raise\n'em raise interest rates has been known for months and months nothing unexpected it's happened there\nSo you're telling me that he's known both of these things but all of a sudden last week those or what caused the market to go down no those were just convenient explanations for and here's the key for something that's unknowable\nThe market is not some logical college professor that suddenly says hey you know what I think we should adjust is a little bit and dropped the market limit it doesn't work that way the market is far more like my three year old truly you need to understand\nThe true nature of the market\nTo be able to respond well to it and the markets more like a three year old mark a toddler than it is some sort of logical institution it is reactive it is instinctual and here's the key is unpredictable if my daughter wants to play hide and seek and I'm trying to chase her around and she suddenly darts left\nIt's not because she sat and thought about the impact of that it's because you know she just had that instinct she's unpredictable and the market is that way you know why it's that way because it's driven by thousands hundreds of thousands millions of factors that is not driven by one overriding thing\nIt's just not\nAnd then you have the reality of the mob mentality of group think\nThat if someone starts to pull out of stocks other people go holy cow I should be pulling out too and you see this massive ripple effect in huge numbers of people are pulling out and they're not pulling out necessarily for any one reason is because that's where the mob is going\nThat's how the market works and yet every time there's a drop guess what we want to give an explanation for this is something psychologists call the narrative fallacy maybe you've heard of this before the narrative fallacy that we humans desire order we desire to be able to make sense of something\nAnd so we regularly do this and everything it was a great article about this [noise]\nUh I don't even remember what it was from unfortunately but I read an article a while ago about this and it talks about how we have this nature as humans to create a narrative whether it's in biographies we read\nWhere it tries to now make sense of someone's life and and give real concrete easy explanations of well they were raised this way so they became this way we loved that we love story we love things working out\nBut the reality is some things don't follow a set narrative\nIn the market hardly ever has a easy cause effect relationship but just doesn't\nAnd here's why this matters somebody you're listening you're going out okay that's fine who cares a market was dropping it matters because if I Believe I can clearly define why the market is going down that impacts the way I think about investing right if I go well it's it's clearly because of trade war with\nChina and I can look and see that then maybe next time I see\nTrade war brewing I'm going to become very conservative because I Know what happens when trade wars happen we have this drop in the market so that cause effect can be very dangerous because it turns from we look historically at what's happened\nWe create a cause effect relationship and then we apply that to the future and now that influences the way we think about the future investment decisions in them that is going to kill you that is going to destroy your long term investments to this the first thing to see here\nIs that there was no\nEasy root cause for what happened last week there was a whole lot of little things and then a whole lot of group change in group mob mentality and suddenly we saw the market dropping in anyone's going to try to eat offering an easy explanation for that\nHas an agenda\nAnd no offense to either side that the Trump folks saying it was a fad or anti Trump folks saying it was China a trade war both of them are just trying to find an easy explanation when that's just not reality is just not reality\nAnd some of you were unhappy hearing that because I'm offending you politically because either way that's going to offend someone politically Rikers both sides are mentioned here here's the deal this is not political okay but the market dropping\nIs not usually a political thing certainly government economic decisions influence and mark and I'm not saying that\nBut what I'm saying is that it's not as clean as just oh this person made this decision so there was a drops now you know what the market is a political the market dropped for all sorts of reasons let's not turn it into a political thing and leverage it as a political weapon to hit our friends with\nEleven people shot and killed six hurt as a gunman goes into the temple says all Jews

hour news weather and traffic station news Ninety five five and I am seven fifty ws may depend on it\n\nOf that way back way back ancient history in two thousand six two thousand seven right do you remember how you were invested back then many of you don't\nBut I bet you remember two thousand eight right two thousand eight everything dropped the market had the ... the worst drop since the great depression and when that\nHappened people became super concerned about their investments that became very worried about what if the market drops again are we ready for that et cetera because we lost so much but every year since two thousand nine census bull market began\nThe anxiety and the fear faded a little bit more and more than I was so many people today that are taking a ton of risk in their portfolios and they don't even realize it\nBecause they're comfortable because the market has been up in that my friends is maybe the most dangerous thing that could happen right now is that you could especially if you're closer to retirement so we're going to talk about two different groups of people folks that are within shouting distance of retirement are already retired\nAnd the younger folks and by younger I mean everything from twenties thirties forties people that still have a solid decade plus until they want to retire because it really is two different discussions both matter I Want you to hear both but it's it's the kind of different action points here\nBut if you're closer to retirement there could be nothing more dangerous than you having become complacent about risk\nAnd yet it'd be totally normal because the market's been up I mean amazing growth in fact it's kind of made us all feel like investment geniuses right I made a lot of people that come in and say hey you know I got investing figure it out like give me your thoughts but just to understand I kinda know what I'm doing look at my portfolio the last few years is killing it\nAnd I don't want to make them feel bad but I Want to tell them look my golden retriever could've invested just as well over the last five years friend because it's not some magical thing to invest well when the market shooting up when they asked them be as well over three hundred percent growth\nThrough the ... since two thousand eight it doesn't take a genius to see growth\nAnd yet people kind of stride and yeah I'm doing you know I'm I'm pretty good at what I Do I Know what I'm doing\nLook anybody is good at what they're doing in fact the only shock has been people who have found a way to lose money\nOver the last number of years that's where you scratch your head and that took some time it took effort for you to figure out how you would lose funds but if you're a four O. one K. your IRA you're an individual stocks are up don't tell me it's because you're a genius maybe you are a genius no sense to you\nBut everybody's accounts are up friend\nIt doesn't matter how well you do when the market's up what really matters is when it goes down which we know what's coming are you ready for that\nAre you ready especially if you're close to retirement\nAnd that's why I Can't say I'm Out of a annoy you to death but you won't forget it until I'm blue in the face please don't waste this week because it gave you a taste of how your portfolio responds\nWhen the market drops and so again like I mentioned before the break the first thing to do here is to take an honest look at how it did how do how aggressive are you in a in some of you listening you don't know because you weren't looking at it\nUm because you don't care about that very much or not you didn't even notice the market was down that's fine taking minutes a day and just log into your four one K.\nLook at how it's doing and the IRA and in some of you I mentioned this last time it's really hard for you to judge how your quote unquote investments did and the drunk 'cause you got ten different investment accounts you've been at three different companies you left you after four one K. there you have a raw fire a that somebody told you was a good idea to start\nWhatever you've got all these different phones sitting out there and they're all invested differently\nAnd it would take you forty five minutes to log in each one of them and see how they did and the last few days if that's the case that's where I brought up the the incredible importance of getting an analysis done that shows you that groups all those together puts in every single investment you're in and can tell you this is the risk\nWhen we bring it all together 'cause that's all that matters\nI don't just want to know how much risk there isn't that four one K. you've had for a year and a half I Want to know about all the funds you've had before so you can make a decision about am I too aggressive and when I said too aggressive or not aggressive enough I don't mean that there is some right amount for everybody that's nonsense\nThat's nonsense right a lot of people come in and they say what is the right level of risk how much risk should I be taking I don't really know them yet and I say you know there is no quote unquote right level of risk across the board and all the risk is truly truly is based on your situation\nAnd I've talked about this many times there's two factors to figuring out your risk the first is how do you feel about risk the second is how is your plan feel about risk let's talk about that for one second here okay if you're close to retirement\nThe last week it is critical stop everything if you forget anything else I said that they\nCheck your investments after this drop because you need to know where you sit you need to know him my super aggressive is that Saddam butter on my retirement account is it somewhere above Seventy right on my Seventy eighty percent inequities 'cause if you are and you're close to retirement\nThere are every once in awhile people that should be that aggressive close to retirement maybe you have a whole lot of guaranteed income and you've got pensions et cetera and you go you know what I don't even have to rely on my investments\nMy grandparents are in this boat again my grandparents they have numerous pensions of talked about them before\nI'm literally a both of them have Social Security but then my grandfather has a pension from from teaching plus the pension from the military and my grandmother has a pension from teaching they've got five streams of income coming in okay it's more than they need every month so they never touch their investments they've never had to\nSew could they afford to be a little more aggressive if they wanted to be sure\nBecause they just really don't need those investments in less than a worst case scenario they can afford to have a little more questions\nBut if you have to if you're the majority of people today and most people listening\nThat are close to retirement or in this boat if you uh plan on having to draw from your investments in order to have income which is the norm okay then you really probably don't have any business being aggressive as you get this close to retirement the five years\nPrior to retirement and that was it was far too moderate I said you really probably no let me take away the moderating words you shouldn't be that aggressive if you have to take income from your investments and you're within five years of retirement you really have no business being invested aggressively\nAnd I would put that is really anywhere above about sixty five Seventy percent equities as you don't have business to be there\nNow there are exceptions like I mentioned like my grandparents most people don't have the business to be there but here's the problem\nWe don't realize that because we've been sitting on years and years and years of the market going up now it's snuck up on us case that you need to understand the risk\nAnd if you're close to retirement even if you feel aggressive okay even if you're fine with going after it and you're fine with them to market going down and he didn't even notice\nLast week what was going on I really don't care if you're close to retirement that you personally feel fine with risk I care about what happens to your plan if the market drops I mean I'll be nice about it\nCoke can of coke whatever and we're talking about the market and it's easy to say oh\nNo problem with risky brusque is great because you're not in it at that point but holy cow in the markets dropping now all of a sudden it really matters and so the question is for you younger person and I'm lumping you forty three year old in here younger people with more than ten years to work until you retire how\nDid you respond this week 'cause that is the test that is what tells you if you felt strong impulse to move your money out then you need to know\nHoly cow maybe I Need to be a little more conservative\nSo that I stick with it not 'cause my plans in danger because I'm In danger of wrecking my plan by moving everything out if the real for real correction happens or if you didn't even notice this\nAnd you don't even ... you're not some of the ... are you heard about in your ads finally got years left\nThen you better be aggressive take advantage of that if that's your personality you should be more aggressive but regardless how did you respond then again\nAnyone listening right now if you sit and go you know I honestly haven't even thought about it I kind of was a little worried but I saw the market came back up friday so whatever this does wasting an opportunity to make sure\nYou capture this now before we see the real correction make sure you take advantage of this and adjust your risk either whether you're closer to retirement to make sure your plans going to be okay or if you're younger to make sure that you're taking full advantage of the market but you're not so aggressive that you're going to pull out now is the time to figure that out\nHow to make my point and my aunt alright if you want to do that I Would love to help you my team would love to help the ... all we do every day than it was hundreds of folks around Atlanta and around the country and would love to do that for you to help you figure out how do I have a plan\nThat truly is fit to my situation my risk tolerance my plan you know what I can handle what my plan can handle not just so I'll be okay not just so I'm not bankrupt in retirement but so that I can reach the dreams I have whatever that is and if you've never done that before\nIf you've never looked at that it is such a a a feeling of peace and excitement about the future when you go from responding and reacting to a drop like this to feeling confident that the next time the market goes down and you can say with confidence I'm going to be okay the neatest call that I had this week\nWas from a client who retired just in the last few years and we went back and forth and his process I remember so clearly when he was in the process with us\nTalking about risk and him wanting to be more aggressive in pushing back and saying your plan doesn't need this aggressiveness in fact it could damage it and we pulled back to assert reasonable moderate account and he called me a\nWhen the market was dropping this last week and just said hey I just want to say thank you for pushing on me here\nBecause I remember how stressed I was in two thousand eight when the market was dropping him in the market was dropping this week it just didn't have power over me that was\nAmazing it's such a neat and often the feedback I get is not as excited we're worried they're calling and they're full of anxiety but it was so neat to get feedback from someone saying it just doesn't have that control over me what would it be like for you to look at the future and not have to feel anxiety about a change in the market or about a long term care issue\nSomething coming up unexpected about a storm like Michael coming out of the blue and wrecking the southeastern coast right it's crazy how would it feel to know you have a plan that can\nWhether that because\nThat's what we do it soaks every day if you want that jump on my website it's my life is more dot com sign up for a free consultation with me Chris Burns with someone from my team to talk about your situation because if you want that plan that's what we do every single day my life is more dot com All right let's\nJump into our lightning round of waxed eloquent enough here my answer some questions we got this week we'll get to as many as we can if you have a question about anything you've heard today or something totally different based on your situation where you'd like some advice go to that website it's my life is more dot com\nYou can ask anything there and we will get back to a lot of those we get to do on the show here first question was from Jan\nJan writes I heard all week that rising interest rates are hurting the market but you've talked before about interest rates going up being a good thing can you explain I'm Jen thanks for writing and yeah that's a great point so a number of shows ago I talked about interest rates going up it's not that it's a good thing it's that it's two sides of the coin\nOkay and here's the problem we tend to look it will use the market again at the market goes down and it's good or bad well no it totally depends on how you respond\nAnd on your situation right it can be great for some folks and terrible for other folks it's it's not just black or white and same thing with interest rates interest rates going up first of all I taught at the beginning of this show about\nIt it's not fair to say that interest rates going up as making the market drop let's just just not true it's it's a much bigger picture of not\nInterest rates going up can be a bad thing in some ways right one way is that a ... for mortgages for instance right of your mortgage mortgage rates are going up that's not great most of us would like to be able to get a mortgage\nSuper cheap like we've gotten in for the last number of years but there's a flipside of this I talked about a little bit earlier and that is that people nearing retirement or in retirement\nHaven't been able to get any sort of decent return on low risk money\nBecause interest rates are so low so whereas if I'm buying a house I'm loving interest rates being low if I'm trying to get a return on my money and I don't want to be aggressive I've been struggling because interest rates are so low two sides of the coin let me give you an example of this we just had announced this week\nThe new growth in the Social Security payments for next year so Social Security when you begin receiving it gets these cost of living adjustments\nAnd they often been pathetic because they're tied to interest rates interest rates right\nBut this year they just announced that his two point eight percent almost three percent growth that's the best it's been years since two thousand twelve okay why because interest rates are going up so let's wine and feel terrible about oh interest rates are going up you know are the markets struggling because of that at the same time\nA whole host of Americans in retirement going to get paid more this next year\nBecause interest rates are going up it's just not as simple as black or white\nAnd so the question is how do you capitalize how do you make sure your plan is ready Jan forever your ad for it\nRising interest rates because they're coming one way or the other um thank you so much for writing a trick question next question is from Bill Bill writes I work with a financial advisor he manages our investments\nBut I don't see any management fee on my statement how do you track dollars spent in fees buildings running and yet this is super confusing one of the first things I Do with clients when they come in fact in that first initial consultation um when someone sits down with us I sit and explain to them every way that we get paid\nAnd how they'll see it and where they'll see it and what it is because fees and payment in my industry has been opaque for so long and so many advisors don't ever talk about this and yet it influences the decisions they make so let me say in your case if you don't see a management fee on your statement\nBut he is the one that put you in the investments it's probably because he got paid commission\nSo when I manage money for people with my firm manages money\nThere is a bat flat fixed fee that's paid for that management regardless of where we put them so if you're in stocks a B or C it doesn't matter which one you're in we get paid the same amount of flat fee for managing it\nSo there's no incentive to move you around but the other way people get paid in my industry here is for from commissions and that would be putting you in a mutual fund and then up front getting paid a big chunk of money\nBut they're not paid to manage it\nNo that's not always about things not black or white but I'll tell you the danger is that I see often is that because I was paid that big chunk up front\nAnd now I have no incentive beyond that that besides my goodwill and being a good person what's keeping me managing the money well what is incentivizing me to do is actually to move you again in the near future so I can get paid another commission and I see this disturbingly regularly people come in and go I don't know why my advisers telling me to move\nMy money and even before I look at their statement I usually able to tell them\nI'm going to guess it's because it's commission account and they want to get paid again and unfortunately that is totally normal in our industry so most likely bill he's paid to be a commissions and that's why you don't see any funds coming out because you already paid a big chunk of money when you bought those funds which just means be very careful\nIf he comes back to you and says we need to move the money soon because there is a dollar tag attached to that for you All right that's all the time we have do they listen if you missed everything else remember this don't waste this week the\nUs maybe about ... er Cox media group station\n[noise] twenty four hour news weather and traffic\nFive AM's\nAsked me to\nNo good morning at six o'clock I'm Robin ... live in the ws feet twenty

Sanford performing arts in community center I Want you to talk to us about drums\nIn the show that that I live about I'd do with them and I said let's say or the drums give us joy strength and make it so just lose weight they tell you how much the drama means to us I mean in in our tradition always say uh we've got a song for each and every occasion\nIf we're morning in the death within the family we've got a song that we'll we'll see and that's the way to play the drums there wouldn't be the Louds were ... you Lonnie and then you get a chance whereby if the best we celebrate life\nSo there will be a celebration whereby everybody's celebrating and\nEven though the ... guy with the jobs I mean that's how that's how he does with African term so to as I Do I mean it's very very significant and he tells a lot a lot of stories I mean in the olden days we didn't have cell phones so you couldn't communicate to the next village\nBut if there was like it has something you've thought that maybe\nYou're saying the olden days Thirty years ago [laughter] yeah yeah yeah so ...\nThat's how they communicate that I mean if you play us up in ... then the other really who do that okay this is a myth age instead of sending kids to go maybe for the days to get the only hours because you've developed very mountainous country in some regions of South Africa like\nUse the Atlanta Fed's very Montini has and then we we get funds regions like the bed real where we've got the beautiful ... mountains so yeah that's where the drum Kenyan very significant to you know I used to it and we tried to present because those are the ones I'm playing with in the show\nWe we we went through the muscles\nWe go to the bushes got to see the ... that you need to do what gave you want to do leads doesn't fit in three that you need to go and Trump police to defy a do all the proof system than any of the ... or the un says those ... and all of the land\nIn and creating from other\nFrom other us I mean God gave us all those things for us to use what that's what I'm saying we grateful to the\nBreak what do you enjoy most about this opportunity to live your dream and to perform here in Atlanta to celebrate the one hundredth birthday of Nelson Mandela in a program such as this\n[noise] I Know it's a great opportunity to to be this part of um [noise] to to to celebrate that the nest in Monday like it to beep beep beep beep equal paternity as a a a a on a Tuesday and also a\nI'm grateful that I'm I'm here in Atlanta is this is a beep beep beep beep continent and a big city ... we've been talking from New Orleans now and we go into a pilot's mom so\nI'm On that and um I took them caught and also add up to and mom taught in ... for believing in me for believing on my talents that but it gave me it's a great great opportunity\nAnd it's just to add on the on the bride just said I'm going to look\nWith us and it's all I've got you'd be surprised 'cause I mean we watch most of the TV I turned the TV like a housewives of Atlanta well also like to Linda Couch idea I mean like we're having you know the Tyler Perry just got a studio yeah I mean he's very beacon TV so we'd also like to come and lend a few things from them\nOn me or somebody five five AM's seven the\nDouble you asked me [noise]\nWelcome to today's edition of regeneration radio with Dr Richard ... I'm ... studio with your hosts doctorate he is a leader in the field is divisions were using stem cell therapy to treat pain with great success after Rick I'm sure you have somebody came into the office in great pain and left feeling super good yeah\nUm that's the daily occurrence thank goodness and um we're very very fortunate to do if we do the best feeling in the world to be able to help somebody feel better and get it out of pain and and\nGet their life back so I'm you know we have numerous examples every day and every week but\nI'm probably one that sticks out more is a patient that had something called fibromyalgia where they were hurting all over and um this person that seemed a bunch of doctors and\nTried all kinds of treatments sport and wasn't getting any success with anyway and so we um then they also had some arthritis issues as well so we we sat down and talk to this person and we went ahead and did a stem cell treatment and um\nAmazingly enough after a period of a few weeks they're paying was gone for the first time in many years and so it's it's stories like that but just make me happy that I'm a physician and that I'm doing what I Do and I love helping people so it's it's just the best feeling in the world Dr\nRick in a previous program we were talking about the stem cells and how you keep them in a very special freezer because they have to stay cold stay frozen subscriber lives that's very critical\nWhen you pull one at the small vials out of your freezer and you're ready to for lack of a better word ... them so that you're able to use them how long did that take\nUm usually you can let them thought room temperature and that takes maybe about Fifteen minutes or\nSomething as will hold them in our hand to kind of speed up the thought process a little bit yeah not doesn't take too long but um again we want to be a were very strict on our protocols to make sure that the the cells are frozen and kept frozen till we need them and then\nOnce they fall we use them immediately so that's all part of the the process to make sure that the the cells are viable in that they they do what they're supposed to do once\nYou begin to move into this groundbreaking area of treating people with chronic pain with stem cells did you have to pursue any additional education or training I Know you've developed a number of protocols they as we say you're a leader in this field and you're having great success with all your patients but I'm just wondering about\nAnd I'm sure our listeners are wondering about any additional training that might help yeah\nYeah um unfortunately right now there's not a a residency in stem cells so typically when doctors go through training and they want to specialize in in a certain area you go to a training in a certain hospital or a certain city\nAnd you learn all about this this ... of these are this field but unfortunately I'm Sam ... such a a new field plus\nI'm a lot of doctors just don't know anything about stem cell therapy so I'm so there's no there's no such thing as a as a residency in stem cells survey thing I've learned I've had to learn on my own\nI'm Talking to other stem cell experts other doctors we go to meetings um together and we we talk and there's lectures on different topics that we discuss and\nAnd then um you know there's a lot of research going on all around the world was himself so there's articles and journals I reviewed daily [laughter]\nAnd so there's a there's always lots of work to do but it's so it's all self taught basically for the most part but but it's a wonderful um you know it's a it's an amazing process and um I just so thankful to be doing what I Do\nYou develop a number of protocols that help your patience to recover so well so the treatment is begins with the injection or the idea of the stem cells but there are other things that you ask of your patients in that your patients will do which enhances their recovery correct oh definitely\nI'm so usually I'm just one of the we we tell people several things but one of the first things we tell people is um for the first thirty days um wants you to um stay away from a group of medicines called and sets their non startle anti inflammatory drugs\nAnd there's a whole bunch of medicines that fall under this class um ibuprofen is want to leave as one goody powders\nUm there's some prescription and says as well that um\nPeople take 'em that have taken for years like toward all things like that and saw that whole group of medicines the reason we don't want people to use them at least for thirty days as they can interfere with cell replication\nSo in the first thirty days after treatment when we treat someone this themselves on not only do they start healing with the anti inflammatory properties that they have but they they actually replicate the actually double triple quadruple in number\nAnd so um anything that can interfere with that process we we definitely frowned upon so that's one thing we tell people I'm another thing that we tell her patient says um\nTo stay away from steroids because I I I think we've had this discussion in the past before too but I'm steroids are terrible for our body um\nThere's two types as anabolic ... anabolic is the ones he can associate with weightlifters that try to get real muscular but the ... those are the ... the court is owns that the shots that physicians give people every day\nAnd it drives me crazy that people are getting these shots because they I'm not only do they not work very well for the most part but they they can actually damage to issue so they actually can make your bones weak they can make your bones break they can make the muscles week they can make the muscles tear that can make the cartilage ligaments the tendons all these dishes tear and weak\nAnd so um instead of helping people you're actually hurting them in the long run why doctors tell you this um I think it's just been a standard treatment for the last fifty sixty years and so I'm In unfortunately they it's just a simple thing that does help some people get some pain relief\nBecause the steroids are an anti inflammatory um\nProperty or a treatment but they have all these nasty side effects with them and the other thing that they can do is they can actually if you're a diabetic they can make sugars go sky high out of control\nUm they can actually I've seen people developed diabetes after getting these steroid shots and um when you give someone a shot of of steroid or cortical steroid you um you can affect their adrenal gland which is on the on the part of their kidney the top of the kidney\nAnd um that can cause all kinds of problems for your whole body so um those are some things that we tell people to stay away from it in terms of medications and drugs um we don't want people drinking excessively we don't want people smoking I mean usually like to limit people to one drink a day and if you do drink red wine that\nPossibly is the safest and the best type of alcohol for themselves\nUm and then we go through a whole list of nutritional things that people should be doing so um we've mentioned this before and some of our previous episodes but um we really encourage people to be on a dairy free diet 'cause there's a lot of\nPeople a lot of it lactose intolerance other issues from dairy products\nI'm gluten is another thing that we tell people to avoid or stay away from because\nI'm ... years ago we had no idea that was a problem that that we discovered there were some people that we're deathly ill from gluten and those people are have what's called feely act disease affects their their small bell and affects the absorption of of food and nutrients in the body\nBut it can make you deathly ill at the same time and even if you don't have silly act as easy no tolerance to gluten so there's a lot of folks that have that\nAnd um that can cause inflammation that can cause pain in your joints that can cause all kinds of issues too so that's something that we recommend people stay away from\nAnd then um and then we go through a whole list of natural healthy supplements that uh we really think can help enhance the treatment and help people in general if whatever problems and a half so what\nAre the benefits of some of these supplements that you are making that\nYeah there's several that are wonderful I'm an example of on that we recommend is something called alpha Illinois a casket or LA\nAnd um it's been shown to help people with neuropathy or nerve damage problems and and help 'em with the healing so anything that we can use its natural healthy safe along with the stem cell therapies that we use we you know we be highly encourage and\nI'm so there's a whole list of different things that we recommend for our patients when we go through all that when you come in for treatment in consultation\nI Know one of the things that is a part of the protocols with respect to the stem cell therapy treatments you will recommend that your patients take advantage of the hype of air oxygen chamber at your clinic as quickly as possible after receiving the stem cells tell me audience why that is so beneficial to the patient yeah\nUm many years ago they were ... there's research that was done showing that if you had stem cell therapy and then you were treated with hyperbolic oxygen that actually um enhanced the potential to potentially allergy or the potency of the stem cells and actually help them replicate more so that helped them a double triple a number more so\nUm it's a it's a wonderful treatment and um it alone can help so many health issues it's if it's a totally wonderful amazing treatments so about something that we definitely offer all our patients and and we encourage them to do if they can't\nAs these new stem cells begin to replicate in a patient's body can you end up with too many\nNo that's the problem is is when uh we we just we don't have enough and and um but when we're born one in every ten thousand cells in our body is a stem cell um and so when you think back to when you're a little girl um when you're three or four years old if you were running and he tripped and fell and he got a scratch or cut on yourself\n[laughter] I agree it's a it's crazy the kind of things that you know we've been doing with surgery for many years putting the screws and wires and rods and people and um it's just so unnatural and and there's so many complications and problems and\nUnfortunately I hear people that tell me they here they are more in their in more pain after\nThose surgeries and they were before so I hear all these kinds of things from our patients I'm\nSo it's so gratifying so wonderful that there's this new amazing therapy out there that can help folks don't have to have surgery to opt to go through all those risks and complications potential complications of surgery um\nAnd get this many minimally invasive safe treatment that that works it's incredible\nDoctorate oftentimes people will say well I Need to do this that or the other before I can go do that\nIs there any kind of preparation that a perspective patient needs to do before they give your office to call to make an appointment for that consultation and likely for a stem cell therapy treatment um but we\nDo a lot of education on site so when somebody comes to see us and gets a consultation ah we we spend an hour maybe to some times of people going over what kind of diet they have what they're doing for\nActivity what you know where their pain is coming from where they're taking for supplements\nUm all kinds of things that we go over with people and so um there's really no you know I it it never hurts to be more educated so if any you know you have our listeners if you want to read up on words jellies themselves or\nUm all the different types of stem cells and things like that so it was great 'cause I was thinking more informed the patients the better so if they have really good questions whenever people come in and asked me\nBut um you know we we do all the educating on site and afterwards so um and we do a great thing about our treatments is that we take care of our patients that um we not only you know see when you do your treatment but we'll see you a month later three six nine months a year later and then every year for however long you like\nAnd I'm just want to make sure that every single person that we lay on my hands on or that we see gets better\nDr Rick I Know in a previous episode a patient described reviewing the X rays of of the focus she had a a toll extreme tell pain pills X rays in your office\nWe review them all the time so people will bring 'em you know usually they've seen two or three doctors before they even come to see us so they may have old or him or her eyes are all plane X rays of their knees or their back or their hip or whatever problem they're having or people that come in with\nUm auto immune diseases or problems are neuropathy they'll bring us all medical records that we can review and all that is very helpful um\nAnd so we do that all the time every day and I'm the one thing though that that we do is we have ultrasound um imaging in my office and that's very helpful to to see the tissues and the joints if we need to and um to determine you know where the injections are are best place especially with the hip\nUm and the nice thing about your sinuses completely safe is no radiation from it there's no risk of damage to your body or the stem cells I'm In the past which was really\nReally crazy to me was that a lot of physicians that did these older techniques with the bone marrow or the fat I'm stem cells they would go if you go through the surgery to get maybe five or ten thousand cells\nAnd then they use a X rays to and inject the the sperm cells and when you use X ray radiation you're you can actually kill the stem cells that you're trying to inject into people so that just didn't make any sense to me whatsoever that\nThey were they were doing this and that's probably why a lot of these treatments are very successful but I'm\nIn a lot of things and fortunately physicians don't tell people whose X rays are very dangerous that you should really limit your exposure to them um because uh you can actually develop cancer from if you get enough radiation from from X rays so\nUm what what I tell people especially if you can avoid any X ray or a void is C. T. scanned because there's probably fifty times the amount of radiation in a C. T. scan than you would get in the plane chest X ray so\nI'm as much as possible avoid that and ... are very safe um wonderful technology\nAnd again as long as you avoid the contrast that they might want to use with the MRI you'll you'll be fine you have to worry about radiation or are getting sick from the test doctorate how can perspective patients find you [noise] um easiest way to find us we

it's been serving Jesus Christ for a hundred and twenty five years ... some of the history of university Presbyterian with us\nHistorically Austin has been divided east and west along the last thirty five court or a east Austin has been um the place where it to be blunt white people didn't want to live for a long time University of Presbyterian Church was founded in east Austin and then around the turn of the century began to\nImagine what a ... look like\nIn the burgeoning university area as the University of Texas was beginning to expand and grow\nAnd it was alongside a number of mainline churches that planted that moved implanted deliberately along Guadalupe along what's called the dragon often uh to do of angel is I'm a university student so\nOur mission statement for years was that we were serving Jesus Christ at the University of Texas in Austin and that\nThat spirit stays with it as part of the history mhm what has changed for us is the neighborhood around us ah it used to be the case that the university Presbyterian Church congregation all lived\nIn West campus and an Old West Austin and Terry town for kind of neighborhoods that are immediately surrounding campus as Austin has grown and has pushed out dramatically and at the university campus has grown or the congregation has become much more desperate and so part of our\nDNA and now it's just the degree that people drive to come to a church we I mean home a destination church which\nIs wonderful in many ways because that means that the folks who come and worship with us really really want to be there mhm has challenges in terms of how they consider programming and scheduling and how we program around rush hours but that that's part of the character that's changed for us\nWe'll make your sermon today is based on the Old Testament reading for this Sunday job chapter forty two would you read the passage force\nYeah this is Joe forty to one through six and ten through Seventeen\nThen job answer the lord I Know that you can do all things and that no purpose severe as can be afforded\nWho is this that hides council without knowledge therefore I have occurred what I did not understand things too wonderful for me which I did not know here and I will speak I Will question you and you declare to me I had heard of you by the hearing of the year but now my eye sees you\nTherefore I despise myself and repent in dust and the ashes\nAnd the lord restored the fortunes of job when he had prayed for his friends and the lord gave job twice as much as we had before then there came to him all his brothers and sisters and all who had known him before and they ate bread with him and his house\nThey showed him sympathy and comforted him for all the evil that the lord had brought upon him and each of them gave him a piece of money and the gold ring\nThe lord bless the latter days of job more than his beginning and he had fourteen thousand sheep six thousand camels a thousand yoke of oxygen and left the house and donkeys he also had seven sons and three daughters\nHe named the first ... the second ... and the third carbon cook\nAnd all the land there were no women so beautiful as job's daughters and their father gave them an inheritance along with their brothers after this job lived one hundred and forty years and saw his children and the children's children for generations\nAnd job died old and full of days [noise]\nMan we look forward to learning more about this ending of the book of job and your sermon home repair one oh one thank you for sharing it with us thanks for having

printed term a transcript cause toll free at one eight eight eight four one one deems a why one\nI used to live in a slowly collapsing farmhouse\nJust a few years back in a small town in rural Virginia My family and I were renting an old two by two that at some point in its long and undocumented history had clearly suffered either the slow but the ring of the foundation or perhaps it had been partially washed away by floods but the result regardless\nWas that the house was slowly sinking in on itself\nThis had our idea of ill effects note toy cars would stay put when you set them on the floor and furniture along the outer walls of the house had to be carefully selected so that it wouldn't fall on top of us\nHanging pictures to the local level which was never my specialty and the first place became nearly impossible\nBut mostly after a while you just got used to it a few extra hooks would align the pictures a few extra boats would secure the furniture\nAnd for the rest of it\nLike the time during one particularly cold winter that the heating ducks just snapped off from the vent underneath the living room for the rest of it we just relied on that most elemental repair tool\nWe just use duct tape thank God for duct tape it couldn't fix the foundation but at least it can make the heat work and without duct tape I don't think that place would have ever felt quite like home\nOf course duct tapes reputation precedes that you don't need me to tell you this these days duct tape has a\nBit of a magical reputation for household repairs sure but also for construction on a grander scale\nA quick glance online will honor its dozens upon hundreds of uses I'm sure a quite an imagined by the folks who first put duct tape into the world\nWe've got duct tape as a fabric with which folks have made everything from everyday wallets to prom dresses\nWe've got something called duct tape a clues and therapy and which duct tape gets applied towards and the left on the skin for an extended period of time though the results of this treatment are somewhat in dispute\nNot to mention of course the many many ways in which duct tape has become a repair tool for projects far beyond its original imagination like as a tarp that covers storm damage or is a patchwork fix holding up a street lights\nAs a cradle for a car bumper as the cruises down the interstate even as a quick fix wrapped around the wing of an airplane as it seeks to the skies\nYou don't need me to preach the gospel it's pretty well tested the world breaks all the time in our old house wasn't the only place with a crack running through the\nFoundation good thing we have duct tape to patch it all back together\nIf we're honest I think that's what this story feels like here at the end up a long hard work of the book of job\nIt feels like a patch job\nThe book of job is a curious thing it starts with two major chapters of exposition God makes a bet that job will stay faithful if God takes everything away and so God takes everything away\nJob's a state disappears job's children die job's body fails job is left with nothing\nAnd then we have thirty nine chapters in between thirty nine chapters of poetry thirty nine chapter supplement thirty nine chapters of argument thirty nine chapter is a\nJob and job's friends and God going round after round after round over who gets to be angry\nAnd who gets to be in charge and who gets to complain and who does God thank God is to make us suffer and this way and the Hooters job I think he is to question or wonder or struggle and why of course why do bad things happen to good people I Know why does the world have this crack\nRunning through it and then in chapter forty two that dark chapter of that's the last one in chapter forty to the story comes back and it puts a little duct tape over the crack calls a day\nJob relent and then the needs of the guard who had destroyed his life and the first place\nI had heard of you by the hearing of the year but now my eye sees you therefore I despise\nMyself I'm repent in dust and ashes it's an ending but not a very satisfying one\nLike job has been on hold with customer support for hours and hours and finally they pick up and tell him that actually the fire that erupted inside his computer and burned down his house really is his fault and eventually he just says well thanks for listening\nAnd hang up the phone\nAnd then of course God does restored job's fortunes his wealth comes back it's a state comes back\nOr right the last say ... twenty seven Fifteen peach tree road

in the worship of God\nOur first reading today is from the gospel Luke you might fall along and your few Bible on page fifty five of the New Testament [noise] hear the word of the lord [noise] now every year his parents went to Jerusalem for the festival of the Passover\nAnd when he was twelve years old they went up as usual for the festival\nWhen the festival was ended and they started to return the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem but his parents did not know what [noise]\nAssuming that he was in the group of travelers they went to the day's journey [noise]\nThen they started to look for him among their relatives and friends when they did not find him they return to Jerusalem to search for him after three days they found them in the temple sitting among the teachers listening to them and asking them questions and all who heard him were amazed that his understanding and his answers\nWhen his parents saw him they were astonished and his mother said to him child quiet you're treated us like this\nFather and diving searching for you in ...\nWhy were you searching for me did you not know that I must be in my father's house\nBut they did not understand what he said to them then he went down with them and came to Nazareth and was obedience to him to them [noise] his mother treasured all these things in her heart\nAnd Jesus increase the wisdom and a New Years and then the

Need to be baptized by you\nAnd do you come to me [noise]\nBut Jesus\nAnswer John let it be so now for it is proper for us in this way to fulfill all righteousness\nThan John consented and when Jesus had been baptized\nJust as he came up from the water suddenly the heavens were open to him and he saw the spirit of God descending like a dove and the lighting on him\nAnd the voice from having said\nThis is my son the beloved\nWith whom I Am well pleased friends this too is the word of the lord\nSaying ... to go [noise] what'd you join me in prayer [noise]\nAlert break open your word a

[noise] I'm In [noise]\nWell this is\nA sermon series and our first in focus Sunday school series are motivated by our long range strategic plans we are seeking a journey that will help us explore and investigate\nThis notion of servant leadership and idea we introduced last week both in the sermon series and and the first and focus Sunday school lecture because we want to begin as a larger congregation\nAs a larger church family what we want to do is have conversations about leadership in this particular way\nWe believe that the model of leadership that Jesus has sets before us as the exemplar of what it means to be fully human what it means to be a faithful leader we believe in Jesus as an example is that of servant leadership\nSo when we talk about leadership in the life of our congregation we want to do it under the heading of servant leadership now one of the guiding principles of this series a sort of\nInvolved that notion that leaders are born\nLot of people you hear them talk about when you ask them our our leaders born or made many of us have that instinct that leaders are born\nThere's something natural there's something in Trenton stick in their life some quality some characteristics some way of being that automatically by default makes them a good leader and and what we want to say in the series is yes there are certain\nCharacteristics there are certain qualities there are certain preferences there are certain world views that were just sort of born with\nThat's a instinctual orange trends in our life but we also want to make the case that leaders are made\nBecause the leadership principally as about developing context appropriate competencies to lead people into a particular task or a particular purpose\nAnd because context vary from station to station from locale too low Cal leadership isn't just a one size fits all what it takes the lead let's say in a non profit world may be different than what it takes the lead in a for profit world do you need some\nDifferent competing confidence is sure there are certain trends are things that a leader may bring the both places but there are certain skills [noise]\nCertain competencies that we need in these particular context and so from a Christian perspective when we talk about the Christian faith what we're talking about when we talk about context where our leadership is boring world leadership emerged as what we're talking about is both the church and the world\nSo our context as Christians when we talk about leadership when we talk about serve and leadership in particular we're talking about leadership in the life of the church and in the life\nAnd using Jesus as this model what we're saying is you don't have to be necessarily born with this\nIn order to be a leader in these contacts that actually by the grace of God by the Holy Spirit we can develop certain competencies certain skills certain habits that help us lean into this vision of what it means to be servant\nLeader so that's the essence of this series we're gonna talk about competencies we're gonna talk about habits we're gonna talk about skills that we've learned from Jesus himself that we want to investigate that we want to explore that we want to consider when it comes to our leadership life as Christians\nOur servant leaders have life within the church and out in the larger\nWorld now if we're going to have that conversation and we're going to talk about competencies we're going to talk about skills for going to talk about habits I think we have to begin with one particular idea one particular skill and that's this servant leaders are self aware\nServant leaders are self aware people\nHave you ever heard of the the the mirror self\nRecognition tests or the red spot technique experiment ever heard of this if you're if you're in a childhood development child psychology or you may have seen this before have you studied animals you may have seen this test before it was developed by a guy named Gordon Gallup who is actually a bio psychologist\nAnd he worked with chimpanzees and here's the experiment [noise]\nHe went and that's the size of chimpanzees put them to sleep and he would create\nThis uh alcohol solvent odorless tactile lists of die that he would put on the forehead or on the brow\nOf the chimpanzee so the chimpanzees asleep in this room he puts the dot on their head and then he brings a mirror into the room\nAnd God sees somebody\nWho needs to be about gods business Jesus\nIs absolutely clear\nAbout his ideas\nAnd he and his purpose and the gift to the Christian that he gives us to give to give to the world is a gift of grace that says you are that person to\nAnd servant leaders are aware\nBut here's the reality even though a servant leader wants to carry that image into the world wants to present that identity into the world wants to present and live out that purpose into the world we don't always do it correctly\nWe don't always get it right and here's what makes I think someone who's a servant leader and self awareness different than somebody doesn't possessed this gift or these skills are these competencies here it is the servant leader to self aware and miss that they're wrong\nHow many of us need to admit sometimes that we're wrong\nThe Serbian leader admit that they don't always bear this purpose in his identity into the world they admit that there are other purposes and other identities combating for their allegiance\nAnd they admit that\nThis isn't the image that are always project sometimes I'm projecting out of self centered and sometimes I'm projecting out of pain sometimes I'm living in an identity and a purpose that is about what the world wants to me and not what God wants to me\nIt's just people who are self aware servant leaders who are self aware confessed they seek God's forgiveness and there were stored in the renewed to live into that identity\nOf fresh they fundamentally servant leaders who are self aware fundamentally understand themselves to be children um gospel Lovett of God\nAnd they understand themselves to be about the business of God's\nPurpose in kingdom and when we don't get it right when they don't get it right\nThey made it\nBig knowledge it that's what the servant leader does and seeks God's forgiveness [noise] to show up in the world again\n[noise]\nThere's two parts to this sermon and the second part is much shorter than the first [noise] uh it's about stewardship and it's about the way in which self awareness naturally leads to stewardship because here it is in logical terms when you know who you are and what you're\nSupposed to do\nRight\nWhen you know who you are and you know we're supposed to do the third part as you should go do it and and that's a stewardship is stewardship say is is is it having an assessment of my gifts in my talents in my skills and say okay got how am I going to live out my identity how am I going to\nBring about your business you're working them in the world how am I going to do that and I and I steward that in the world and I seek to do that in a way that that that helps a ... that right and that helps but but portrays a deep deep longing for that identity and for those purposes to be no so I asked the question what do I have\nWhat is God put me in charge of so I can live out my identity and I can live out my purposes and up close with this illustration because I think this was this example is one step before us that uh it it's so\nUh presently about stewardship and the life of our church so presently about this idea of living at our identity being a part of God's purposes and using our gifts to Stuart Stuart those gifts for God's purposes and and that is what I'm thinking of is is our project ...\nIf you're new to the church I encourage you to Google and if you've\nBeen to the church and haven't read a lot of stuff recently about this I encourage that Google it up but for those who've been around even paying attention who have financially supported the ... I'm so grateful to share with you that we've raised already and basically one month's time the quarter of a million dollars\nThat we want to give away thanks to this congregation that we want to give away to empower social entrepreneur ...\nYoung people principally that big ideas to change the city and to change the world we're going to give a quarter of a million dollars a way to about a handful of those\nSocial entrepreneur but there's a process where Ninety applicants apply we just close the application for Ninety applicants there's going to be a screening process that brings them down and once we get to pull a semi finals well have about twenty twenty five semi finals members from the congregation\nWill come along side of those individuals\nAnd there'll be trained to be navigators\nAnd purrs and to bring us some expertise and skills into their lives so these are individuals in life in the church that have finance background marketing background\nOr human resource background business development planning a strategic planning leadership skills that we're going to leverage these gifts stew or these gifts in this congregation\nTo help the social entrepreneur is get their C leg now here's what's amazing about this project because I've had these conversations with people already just a few months and\nThey have said to me people from this competition you know\nI'm really good at finance or I'm really good at leadership development or I'm really good at developing people I'm really good at developing strategy but I've never been asked by the church to use those gifts\nFor God's purposes I've never been asked that\n\nI use them out in the world they use them to make a living as for my family to get to the church to give the things I care about but the church has never asked me to use those gifts until now\nAnd we're over already a hundred people who have stepped up and if you want to know more about it come to me after worship I'll get you connected to the right people\nBut here's an example of where we see our gifts we see what we have to offer the world and we say it's not just about making money it's not just about my ... my own needs are supporting my family's about participating in God's\nBusiness in the world participating what God wants to do in the city and beyond\nThat stewardship when you assess what you have your experiences your gift your strengths and weaknesses and you say God I Want to use these to be about your business to be about your kingdom friends as we seek to lead like Jesus may we'd be self aware\nAnd may we'd be stewards of all the God has put us in charge of not just for our own sake\nBut for the sake of the gospel and for the sake of the world may be so [noise] I'm In [noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\nWell you asked me about ... er Cox media group station [noise]\nThe one who is twenty four hour news weather and\nTraffic and AMC\nMe to\nNo good morning it's eight o'clock I'm\nRobin ... live in the ws be twenty four hour news center with our top story this hour he walks into the synagogues through an unlocked door says all Jews must die and start shooting eleven people killed six hurt one man in critical condition at\nThis hour gunman Robert powers forty six years old locked up this morning after the feds say he opens fire on people praying inside the temple in Pittsburgh President Trump orders flags to fly at half staff\nThis wicket act of mass murder is pure evil [noise] hard to believe and frankly something that is on imaginable\nAnd those are the things I'm covering while everybody all freaked out about quote bombs that never went off and yeah it's awful and scary and it is terrorism 'cause someone's terrorized and it's horrible and dumb we all know that right [noise]\nUm but in the meantime you have things to pay attention to the midterms because the bombs are going to go away and you cannot afford to be freaked out particularly in a state of Georgia because they're coming for you\nComing for our state you got to know that between allies in states he's campaign which I won't bemoan you can go to our website check out the podcast on all of that with regard to voter suppression which now we know is not true that she'd support it apparently she thinks she supported anti gang legislation which\nHouse representative Bert Reeves completely blew right out of the water right on Facebook you can go read that on my page as well or his\nSo why's why's why's more lives because that's really all that party is left with at this point and there's only one reason\nTo undermine door liberty so innocent in the case of nationalism I'm a national it's I Love my country I'm a patriot and I believe that the number one cohesive characteristic and culture of the country is liberty pretty simple and I'm white so again I guess that makes me a white nationalist now\nSo that really blew my guard up this week though and watching a press conference Mr fees cracking up\nWatching a press conference between the president and you know no I'm not sorry Jemma Costa CNN who's that dude he needs a life\nFor real okay and we're talking about the Caribbean and the prospect of there being terrorists in the caravan which for most of us who can add two plus two and it actually equals for\nThose probabilities make sense 'cause\nThere's no proof or anything like that could very well\nThere could be flying monkey somewhere on the planet but there's just no proof that okay\nThat's Anderson Cooper and that's cute right that's hyperbolic it's kind of funny there could be flying monkeys kind of smart but it's\nKind of ... right catches your attention especially for bitter people who just cannot get past the fact that he's our president and I thought to myself I literally my head exploded in the station whenever I heard that when I saw that clip and you've got you've got\nJim Acosta saying he just kept diverting the conversation and and there there could be there could be people there could be terrorists in\nThe food was there\nAre a little\nFurther [laughter]\nIf you look at what's happened with ...\nOkay this is during the press conference and and you've got Jim Acosta setting a precedent up for not for the fact that that all of us want to hear about he's setting them up to basically take a soundbite which is what Stacey Abrams did her campaign did just last week the a\nRolling Stone magazine takes this one moment and Brian Kemp campaign at a an event that I was actually at so I Know that this whole thing is hogwash\nAs we say here in the south and they took one snippet of something that he said about you know\nIf we're if if this happens with her voter turnout you know clearly we don't want people to vote for her dug the part of being an opponent hello called healthy competition but they stopped the conversation right there instead of\nInstead of playing the entire clip which said Brian went on to say as they should they should show up\nTo vote we'd rather than vote for us but if their right to exercise their vote and we want them to do that that part was left out of the conversation\nSo then the whole world blows up with a false narrative and we've been dealing with false accusation on my show for the past two weeks and if you can't tell I Am absolutely inflamed about it because I hate people that bear fault witness\nHate it and if they are so important because because what Anderson Cooper what have you believe is that flying monkeys\nCould come out of this guy to there could be but there's no evidence for that either but what really happened was the president was being ... and he went to answer the question and so he invited vice president Pence into the conversation to say hey you just got off the phone with one of the big waves of ... what did he say about terrorists and the caravan\nOf us were [laughter] miserably\nWas grocer the summers are cooler so most of us are so so what are some of the America intervene prevention of perverse or servicers from coming into our country's every conceivable [noise]\nThose are with both from the middle east for rowing was for the
