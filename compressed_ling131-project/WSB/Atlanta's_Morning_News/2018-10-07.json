I'm going to myself I messed it up when the market's up\nPeople think it's good and they rush into it when the market is down people think this is bad and they get out of it and because you know that you have incredible power to win okay because you know that's what's gonna happen if you have that in your mind you can do the opposite\nHalf of success in the market is just doing the opposite of what you see everybody else doing it's not always true there's times that's a bad idea but a lot of time it's just going against the crowd here because guess what\nIf you have a plan\nThat is built to say hey if the market's up\nI'm taking as much risk as I possibly can while still allowing my plan to work okay so I'm I'm participating in it and if it drops guess what I'm going to do I'm going to maintain the same risk I have an average dropping I'm going to buy more I'm going intelligently by\nThese less expensive stocks that are on sale now what is your plan was built to do that automatically\nWhat if you had a risk level I met with somebody recently\nUh it was actually a woman and her husband her husband didn't make it to the meeting so but she was the one that controlled most of the finances and so we're sitting and talking about investing and she said I'm super nervous because I'm retiring and the next few years and my husband and I are both are we haven't really looked at our investments\nWe have all these different things scattered around they had two or three different IRAs opened up they had previous for one case I'd never moved so that you had all this money sitting all over the place and they said we really don't even know or she in this case that I just don't even know how aggressive we are and I'm worried the market's going to drop and I said that's totally correct\nYou are totally in the right place because we need to look at your total risk\nAnd many of you listening right now do I have no idea what risk I'm taking or you just don't know but she said I Want to know the risk taking and that's step one understand what risk you're currently taking it's really hard to do that when you have multiple accounts spread all over the place\nIn her case part of our planning processes\nWe did an MRI ... tongue in cheek we called our financial MRI where we look at the investments all the holdings you had in all of the accounts you have we put them together and we show you the historical return of those and the risk you're taking to be in them for a lot of people it's the first time they've seen the actual\nLevel of risk they're taking that it's not a gut thing of I kind of feel like I'm aggressive it's what are you actually doing based on real data over forty years gates at a very eye opening thing and I showed her this\nAnd said you guys are pretty risky you're invested about eighty percent of their money was in equities and you can think about it this way very simplistic Lee the amount of equities you have is a lot like the ... in your car if you have eighty percent equities it's like you're driving an eighty miles an hour\nAnd that might be fun but at the market drops right you might crash heart [laughter] okay and so in her case being close to retirement that's pretty aggressive\nAnd I said here's the deal we need to pull back from this now that we know what the risk is we can show you how to pull back from that risk to pick a risk you feel confident in and her question is key here the reason I'm telling you this story\nIs she said well with her response to that was well with the market looking so questionable going forward maybe we should pull back more right now and then we can take a little more risk after the drop\nSo in other words and that sounds very logical right hey maybe you thought this before hit the market looks like it's dangerous to me right now it looks\nLike it could drop right now so we're going to pull back more so right now we're going to be more conservative and then the moment we see that things are safe again we're going to jump back in even more and take advantage of growth a lot of people think this way\nRight that is based on a market dropping is bad\nMarket going up is good philosophy when you start seeing yourself through this run in the opposite direction run in the opposite direction because here's the problem just because I\nHave a gut feeling because well you know we were in the longest bull market in history it's got a job at some point and that must be coming soon maybe I should pull back really hard right now there is zero evidence here there is zero guarantee of what's going to happen in the market could be up for four more years and you've lost four years of growth you need to have\nBecause you went super conservative and then in four years when it does drop and you go okay I think it's going to climb again now's the time to get in and then you pick that wrong just maybe the drops gets even worse\nAnd you get back into the wrong time and you're on this treadmill of market timing and oh man I'm just waiting for good things to happen in the market because you're thinking about it as a good or a bad instead of saying no how can I\nReact in a way that wins either way here's what I told her we're not going to pull back harder than you need to we are going to figure out objectively regardless of what the market does what risk you can handle in a worst case scenario let's say the market drops and I started showing a historical numbers here\nYou know if you if ... if you were in this kind of portfolio the market would drop and you lose twenty percent\nIs that working for your plan\nAnd we pick an amount of risk that we can handle so they in a worst case scenario the plan still works\nNot based on the fact that it's the longest bull market in history and so the the end must be near\nNot based on while I'm nervous about the trade war right now with China because we don't know how those are going to turn out we based on something objective in true that we can believe in which is hey this is how much we ... that are my plan can handle lose\nSo I'm going to invest based on that\nNot based on what swirling around me\nSo now I'm taking the most risk possible which means I'm capturing all the upside of the market keeps going up I get all that upside and I feel great about it but I Know in my mind if it drops I'm going to be okay but now the flip side is true because we follow that up was saying not only are we going to take the risk you can handle we're going to maintain it and we're ready to capture grows\nWhen it happened so if the market drops when all my friends think that's a bad thing and in her case\nIf we pulled her back from about eighty percent risk\nWe were going to pull them back to about a sixty percent risk level it the market dropped\nWe would automatically start buying to keep her at that sixty percent risk level in other words\nHer equities would be dropping in the ... we would take from the the bond portion which wasn't dropping and buy more of what was dropping to keep her at sixty forty that's confusing the key point is this\nWe're going to keep her risk the same and we're going to automatically by as the market is dropping while the rest of the world's ... runs and screams in cells while the market is dropping here is the point we're able to do all that\nBecause we don't look at that drop as a bad thing we look at it as an opportunity\nAnd we don't look at the market being up right now as our chance to capitalize we only take the risk we know we can handle it the worst happened\nSo because of that we're not based around timing and we're not based on good or bad\nWe're saying we're going to capitalize whether it's up or down because that planned succeeding is the key that is the most important thing to us if I'm saying all this\nAnd you've never heard anything like this before\nIf you're sitting right now scratching your head going we're going to change my investments you know I I'm I'm hoping Chris tells me when the market's going to drop to that you don't know there's all these warning signs out there if you're living in that cycle that treadmill of fear in the end of last week was hard for you because you saw the market going down and you thought oh this is terrible oh no what is it is\nLike we talked about last week what if it is in October is just a bad month\nThe boogie man's coming for my investments in essence Rikers is just bad\nAnd here we go everything's going down if that's the cycle you're living in that anxiety will never give you success overtime success comes from\nCreating a plan that's outside of your emotion that's outside of how your guts feels about the market that says we can succeed no matter what the market does if it goes up we're going to win if it goes down we're ready to win as well ready to capture growth\nThat is what you need to be successful I'd done that with hundreds of clients are team does that every single day it is such a freeing thing to get off that treadmill of anxiety and market timing and up as good and down as bad just leave that thing behind your friends will wonder when the world's

the show where the lowest unemployment rate literally in in decades since Nineteen sixty nine\nA and not only that the longest bull market in history you've heard us talk about this before so\nLongest bull market ever record earnings for companies lowest unemployment rate holy cow we're living in a remarkable time and so that makes most of us\nGo wins is going to end [laughter] it's a remarkable time until it isn't right because it's not going to go on forever we know that and it gets kind of annoying when you listen to the show because when things are good I talk about how they're going to be bad at some point when things are bad I talk about hey how they're gonna be great at some point because the reality is we live in cycles\nRight and financially we live in cycles too but here's the key what can you be doing right now in this remarkable time in this incredible economy to prepare for when it's not remarkable\nAnd if you don't think that way if you go hey stop being a naysayers stop being a pessimist I don't want to think about bad things if that's your response to that than you might be in trouble long term\nBecause they're all of human history this has been a constant theme dumped back a to a bottle lesson friends will talk about this before I used to be a pastor years ago I was a pastor or I taught a many thousands of kids all about the Bible so we're gonna do bottle lesson or we're going to the story of Joseph\nAnd the Old Testament which was a a an incredible template for what this looks like\nBecause Joseph ... was born into a time when Egypt was strong and it was a good time and economically things were going great remember Joseph has this crazy dream\nWhere he dreams he's in jail for us to reasons we won't get into that but he dreams about the reality that there's going to be bad times ahead lord gives him a vision God gives them a vision for this and he goes and tells the pharaoh and says look we need to store up grain we need\nTo set aside the wealth some of the wealth of all we have right now for when things aren't so good\nAnd Farrow does this and it saves the land because then they have a seven year drought when things are terrible and it's a time of famine and people don't have anything but they've stored up all this food they have all this excess sitting that they said and so they're okay\nAnd you've heard that story a million times but how do you apply that to your life right now that's the question I don't care about your faith I don't care what you believe the wisdom of\nThat story echoes in reverberates across humanity for thousands of years because we're in a time of plenty right now what would you call the longest bull market in history it's a time that we see your gross the\nInterest on your investments has been astounding how have you used those dollars what have you done or you successfully employed right now are you sitting at a time when you have excess income and you have over time have you had a good job unemployment is low that means most of us are working\nRight do you have investments that have been growing over time how have you stored up four times that aren't so good because I tell you what when things get bad we saw this in two thousand eight we saw it in droves okay when things got really bad people started saving money so it's fascinating when you look at human\nAgain it's kind of like we talked about earlier just like you can predict human behavior when the market's up that people are going to rush into the market because they go I don't want to miss out then when the market starts to drop people are going to sprint away from the market because they go holy cow I don't want to participate in the last and how devastating those patterns can be\nTo your long term investing success but yet they're totally consistent right the same thing is true when we look at patterns of behavior for times when we have a lot in times\nWhen we don't have a lot or right when as a culture we have a lot when we're in a time when the market is growing people tend to spend more people tend to be out spending that money and that's good for the economy and it's fine to spend money\nBut are you saving it you know when we see saving rates go up when the market drops when the economy drops\nIn two thousand eight and ... and the great recession we saw people spend less money now that makes sense because you go ... well we had to tighten the belt tried\nBut it's not just that it's not just that people are spending less because maybe they lost their job\nIt's also the people who are still earning the same amount of money or looking around and going holy cow I got to be ready what if things get worse what if I lose my job but if the market doesn't recover we've got to tighten the belt here and so they have more even if nothing has changed about their situation\nSo let me ask you personally when you went through two thousand eight if you're old enough that you were working at that point ten years ago\nOkay some of you actually lost her job she lost her house at cetera but a lot of you listening didn't see any change in your day to day life you kept working you kept earning what you needed you still had more than you need to perhaps but did your habits change\nDid your spending habits change did your trips that you were taking the vacations that you plant does change\nA fascinating thing about human a character and decision making that when the overall environment is one where there's there's fear and anxiety we tighten up and we start saving and we start being more careful about what those dollars are going\nAnd when the overall environment is one of plenty we say yeah let's go spend that extra dollars extra dollars even if nothing's actually change about our situations that listen please hear this I'm not about to tell you so therefore what you should be doing is living under this incredibly tight restrictive terrible environment right now that is not what I'm saying in fact\nIf you listen to the last show we did I talked about the importance of having what I call an opportunity sun and opportunity fund or something that is literally a guilt free spending account okay it's a ... it's so important in my mind for for you to have a long term success\nFinancial planning that you not save every dollar that you not be so restrictive at the world is miserable I'm never forget the client that came in he and his wife were sitting there they were in a great place for retirement I showed them how great it was I showed them how their income was going to be fine and she turned to him and said\nWell can we finally go out to eat every once in a while\nAnd on the one hand that very a very conservative personality thrifty personality had gotten into a place where they were okay on the other hand it clearly went over the top sometimes\nWe're even if they have the funds she never felt the freedom to spend them so it's important that you have what I call an opportunity fund to to actually make saving for fun things part of your plan and if you've never heard anything like that before\nThat that is so critical it is it's just like Benge dieting when we say we're I'm never going to eat a desert again yeah okay well how long is that going to work for you brother so you gotta have balance and you've got to have fun built into your plan but often we go to the extreme\nIt will change how you feel about the world it will change your ability to respond to a crisis there is no more swapping a credit card number Eighteen percent charges that you carry over you were ready to handle life if you get fired you walk out you know you have Ninety Days with no issues and it's a different level of freedom\nFriend you need that three month first up\nThe emergency fund that's the first layer second layer of liquidity though okay let's say that you have that emergency fund and that's great but you're also carrying that you're carrying high interest that right now\nThat is limiting you if the economy turns around what happens when the economy turns around suddenly maybe your pay is cut or you lose your job you have to look for a new job and you had these really high expenses because of the debt you're carrying when you pay off your debt it's adding more liquidity not literally\nYou don't actually have more dollars in your savings account but you have less than expenses which gives you more flexibility so the second step is pay off the bad debt I'm not going to dig into this and are some people want to argue about what's good and bad that look\nIf it's over ten percent over nine percent it's bad debt okay if you have two or three percent loans out there whatever I'm not primarily concerned with you're paying off your student loan that's that ... percent right now\nBut if you're carrying eight nine ten Fifteen Eighteen percent that pay that off when things are good paying off now when the economy is strong and the incoming strong so that when it's not you're going to be OK not just for principle some people think we talk about paying off that because you just should the Bible says pay off your debt well great OK practically\nSpeaking it gives you freedom it gives you the ability to function and live and be happy even if the economy takes a downturn\nPay off the bad debt which you have the emergency fund once you pay off the bat that\nDon't then throw every dollar in your four one K. because there's no there's such little liquidity they're put up to the match in your four one K. but build a wrong IRA if your income can handle it in other words if you're under the income limits for off IRA\nThan you can can contribute to one and guess what it is the liquid or what you put it in his liquid and so if you put in fifty five hundred dollars a year if you're under fifty under the age of Fifteen but I'm fifty five hundred if you're over fifty can put in sixty five hundred a year you and your spouse if you're married\nIf you fund a raw fire I guess what the contributions are liquid the growth is not put those contributions can be used flex simply\nThink about think about all of that\nFlexibility and freedom and liquidity you've created if you follow this plan and again I'm not even saying you have to save more necessarily\nIt's just shifted instead of putting all the money into the four one K. which is not liquid until you get to retirement changed that make sure you build an emergency savings plans stopped the four oh one K. if you need to\nMake sure you pay off the bat that didn't put money in a raw fire a along with the match here four one K. so that again if life happens and it will\nIt will happen for the overall economy things will turn around\nOkay it will go downhill it will happen for the market the market will drop and it will happen for you outside of all that you're going to hit something in life that's going to knock you on your tail and if you've created this kind of financial strength through flexibility through layers of liquidity now you can handle that\nAnd that is that is that is invaluable right you can't put a price tag on that and it's not because\nNecessarily save any more money is because you say it intelligently so two steps of your friends\nTo be ready for when the market is not so up for when the economy is not so great to two steps are first of all make sure you're saving and you know how much you need to save but secondly man save intelligently save in a way that creates layers of liquidity\nSo you are ready to respond in an instant that is where financial freedom comes\nAnd that is where the ability to truly believe you can reach your dreams as burst it's through that if you don't have that\nPlease take a minute jump on my website it's my life is more dot com and sign up for a free consultation that could be with me Chris Burns with a member of my team\nBecause we want to see you have a clear awareness of what you mean to be saving so you know without a shadow of a doubt we're doing what we need to do to get where we want to go we're going to reach our dreams but secondly we're going to do it in an intelligent way so we're ready for life happenings\nThink about the freedom in the piece that you feel if you know that some place and you can have that again if you want that free consultation it's my life is more dot com we would love to meet with\nYou All right we're going to move into our lightning round that's where I answer the questions\nYou've sent in throughout the week and by the way\nIf you ever questioned based on anything you heard today jump on the website this is your chance to engage and say how does this apply to my situation it's my life is more dot com you can ask anything I Will get back to you and again one of the main ways we do that is on the air through this times our first question comes from Jill Jill writes\nMy daughter is five years old and I want to start at college fund for her I heard somewhere that if you have a four one K. account you can roll it over to a college fund is this correct\nOr Joe thank you so much for writing and so no if you have a four O. one K. you cannot just roll that into a college fund and there's different things going on here first of all if you are currently working and have a four one K. where you are working\nYou can't move that out if you're under fifty nine and a half it's going to have to stay as a four one K. where you're working okay\nBut if you've already left the company then you can roll the four one K. into an IRA and this is probably what you've heard you can use an IRA which sent in the individual retirement accounts\nFor college expenses okay you can't rule that into like a five twenty nine or with or not a lot of terms here five twenty nine and a college savings account okay you can't roll your IRA into a five twenty nine\nBut you can use your IRA whether it's a raw or a regular IRA\nFor college expenses once you get to want your kid is old enough for college and they wave the penalty now with an IRA you're still going to an income tax if you pull money out of it\nBut they'll be no penalty you usually have a ten percent penalty if you pull money out of an IRA before you're fifty nine and a half but they wave that penalty if you're using it for college so two things are first of all yes you can use an IRA but not a four one K. for education once your kid is actually in college\nBut the other thing is you can open up a college savings account for your child the five twenty nine is a college savings account but here's the deal is talking about this and the show or to the last week um if you are if you have limited resources\nAnd you're not currently putting as much as possible into retirement savings I Would recommend you open what I just mentioned earlier I Ross IRA because of rough IRAs flexible so you can save money that could be used for your daughter for school but then if she gets a scholarship because she's a genius you can use that money for retirement\nAnd all along the way you have liquidity 'cause the dollars you put into it not the gross\nBut the dollars you put into it or flexible you could pull them out if you needed to so that's a much more flexible plan and I liked that a lot more than just throwing money at a five twenty nine Jo thanks so much running in All right we have time for one more question because I went I went to longer earlier I'm Sorry I'm Sorry\nOur next question is from Pete Pete says I'm a firefighter and considering retiring in the near future I'm In my fifties and I have a four fifty seven plan by current financial advisor is that I can rule that into an IRA when I leave is that something you would recommend a beat thank you so much for writing in thanks for your service we've seen a lot of uh\nFirefighters and just people serving the community to come in because it's early in the morning you're listening to the show so thank you to everyone listening who is serving the community in that way oh here's the will be a\nI Would be very cautious about rolling your four fifty seven to an IRA there are times to do that but you're four fifty seven carry something totally unique that no other retirement plans can offer and that's that it does not\nHave that ten percent penalty if you take it out when you're under fifty nine and a half so I don't know the details of your situation if you have a lot of other liquid money's sitting out there that you can use towards retirement\nIf you retire in your fifties like you're saying that maybe you don't need to pull from the four fifty seven but most people that's not the case okay so if you roll the four fifty seven into an IRA now it takes on the restrictions of the IRA which include that penalty\nFor pulling money out before fifty nine and a half so it'll be very dangerous for you to move into an IRA unless you're sure you don't need that money\nAgain you've heard me talk about flexibility I Love retaining flexibility most likely it's better to keep the money in the four fifty seven so you can pull dollars from it without that ten percent penalty\nInstead of locking it up and an IRA but that's certainly dependent on the rest of your situation because that's all the time we have to thank you so much for listening in if you have any questions or if you want to sit down for a free consultation just go to my website it's my life is more dot com\nYou can ask anything sign up for that consultation\nListen to past shows again it's a resource\nMy life is more dot com here this is Chris Burns you've been listening to more than money and please remember your wife\nAnd your future are so much more than money and we'll see you next week\nYou asked me about doorbell er Cox media group station [noise] twenty four hour news weather and\nFive and seven fifty\nOne\nMorning at six am I'm Robin ... live in the ws the twenty four hour news center with our top story this hour I just\nCongratulated him I said congratulations there was\nWell thought I mean who would've thought a thing like that could have happened what he's been through\nPresident Trump calling Brett Kavanaugh after the Senate votes fifty to forty eight to confirm him justice Kavanaugh has been sworn in by chief justice John Roberts and retired Justice Anthony Kennedy in a private ceremony\nIs that you never have to be a justice is what happens after the trauma that's happened I'm\nI'm married to accountability is what happens after the trauma has happened justice\nIs that you never experience the trauma and the first place so even when officers get arrested in something like that that's accountability like we used to live in a world where\nThere's justice for like people are in over ... you think about New York city Ninety percent of the marijuana arrests in New York City a black and brown people you and I both know Ninety percent of the people who are smoking marijuana in New York City I'm not black and brown and that's just not true\nSomething else someone else is in the news that you know and was back on the national front page and last a few weeks\nFormer president bronco bomber who gave that very thing rebuke to the president when he received that award in a University of Illinois a couple of weeks ago so is he back is that going to help the party's caused going into November and now what are your thoughts on the maternal editors\n... everybody needs a little dose of hope and I think that he provided an effort people my ... when we met with him and the push continues then I I think that for a younger generation the idea of just voting for voting sake is just how low idea that like\nYou know I'm One of many people who voted my entire life I still got dragged on and police department by my ankles I still got started with ... with us in that primary voting was in the span of the year that just like he'll do the things we think about voting is like one of many tools in a toolkit and we should be able to build a house with as many told as possible so we should vote\nWe should be in the streets we should run for office we should do all of those things so I think the more and more than a President Obama and Michelle Obama start to help people think about the issues that should animate the vote I think that will be more effective I think the idea of sort of just voting\nIs not really a motivator that speech though where he sort of the first time he sort of comes out in like Trump\nIs bad you're like thank you write like we knew that were happy you said it though [noise] um but I Do think there's an opportunity leading up to November to how people think about the issues right so you think about in Florida are there are two million ex felons they can't vote it will be the single biggest re in franchise amount of voting in the history of the country and\nLike we should talk about that rate and Louisiana how many people on a\nJury twelve twelve the alternate in Louisiana only takes ten of those people to convict a felony or you can get them to life without the possibility of parole it's like a wild system and if in in November people have the opportunity at the ballot to change that to make all too well be needed to vote for you\nTo be convicted which is happening in forty other states right now right so they're all these actual things that people should be mobilized to go vote for and not to vote against this guy why don't more people notice\nYeah I don't know I think that sometimes a what makes it to the\nThe specially the folks who do vote because if we are to look at the playbook that the candidates used in both parties there's an understanding or an expectation that more senior people will vote and will do consistently in once you've condition them to vote your way that's what they're going to do\nWith your generation that is entirely not the case and as you just said it's not voting against somebody's got to be voting for something and not just voting because y'all said vote\nYeah I don't know why it has been broken ... you know I think that there I think some of it we think of activism is organized story telling and I\nI think that sometimes ah we've not figured out how to tell the best stories and and the best way um but you think about you and voter id in this ah in this state it's a Georgia requires a a record of every name change that a woman is bad for your like an older if you're an older woman who\nHas had a set of name changes like you have to document that from what I Do like that doesn't make sense right so part of this is how do we peel back the system to help them the the way that the inequity in the address is actually kicked into it um and that's why I wrote a book that's why you're talking to you a because people don't know\nWhat is it that you're wanting readers to take away from the book I\nThat people look at the book I Hope that it allows them to reflect on our own experiences better hope that they learn from it so like the top to the police out that you like\nWalk away being like wow I just didn't know rate you obviously you know the place of killing people you don't need me to say that but there's like an undercurrent of the way the system functions that I Hope people walk away knowing and then with a lot of the other chapters I Hope that people are able to take their own personal experiences and think about what they mean a larger context\nAnd talked to was about ...\nTo this idea that that as they started with somebody being like would you meet with Trump and I was like you know I don't know if it's my job to tell the bully to stop bullying me as somebody shut down the beliefs I Believe but I don't know if it's my job to walk up to the bully and be like hey I'm a real person it's like\nI think the ... you're a real person and is choosing to act that way anyway so it was just a meditation on what does it mean to fight back him and why\nWhat are you thinking about twenty twenty would you ever run for office\nOh so I Would run for office again a not for president right now and that seems\nLike there's a crowded feeling a lot of great people I'm interested in people like Cory Booker\nI'm interested in seeing what ... does you know they say Deval Patrick my run\n'em I've talked to Terry McAuliffe on the pie cast it you know I I think he is probably running so there are a lot of people who I think it'll be a crowded field when I think about who window and who animate the base it will be again somebody who is not running against Donald Trump is somebody who is running for a different version of America\nYou write about all these great things in the book and we look ahead to to not only to the mid term elections to the twenty twenty elections and right now there is this rush to put Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court\nYou know I think that there's so many people have been waiting for a fight you write that like the right has been just running over people's lives Trump is an unapologetic about doing whatever you want to do and the left is sort of like\nPerforming this high road and it's like the reality is that we have to defend the faith rehab and we definitely have to defend the moral space that we hold\nAnd we have in the in the fight before and it was like finally like he's coming out swinging ... came out swinging at the hearing and it's like we need more of that right that they are like humbling us and we're just like we're not going to be the bad guy it's like no people want you to fight and I think that that was a powerful the sequel to stand up in that way\nThere's a sense in and correct me if my perception is interactive that the part of people is certainly much larger on the less\nThan it is on the right but the leaders of the right has more direct control or buy in from that constituency whereas on the left it's it's a big tent so everybody's welcome and we don't want to send anybody so as you said when Cory Booker picked a fight it was like how I can get behind that\nIs you think the the last in the Democratic party's ever gonna figure it out and get it fixed\nGetting to the difference in the right and left in this respect is is it the right to set a different uh they are employing\nA different tactic when it comes to telling stories so the rate is rooted in the south Asia\nTo the right there just recall the writes them and make America great again it is about recall in memory it's for us it's like you know we've survived that part of America and we don't want to go back to it\nBut what you see Trump in administration during this is using all of that imagery the attack on black athletes like he's just using this because the hardest work of it is already done we already know what the symbols I mean we already like that's about taking it back to a time [noise]\nOn the left we are engaged in this deep imagination at the world we're fighting for Islam we've never seen before so you think about this idea that everybody has access to health care you've never seen that I've never seen that before\nWhen you think about every kid being able to read and re you've never seen a I've never read that we are always engaged they make believe and that's how she just like a harder story to tell the harder story to get people behind because I'm trying to convince you of something you never ever felt in touch just seen and heard before\nThey may not believe it could ever happen right where the ... like we know we're we're like they know or racism looks like we know or racism looks like and they just inflamed that for a base everything on time so I think that the the work is just different on each side but I'm hopeful again I think the who runs against Trump who wins will not be somebody who is just running as\nWill not be somebody who's just running to beat him it'll be somebody who's running to like usher in a different version of America and certainly one of the things that people love about Bernie and I remember meeting with Bernie\nBernie has mastered the what will shake him how great the Bernie can tell you very clearly like what the world would look like if he was in charge you like to how we get there you know shaky\nHillary was really good at the how in wasn't as effective in telling the story about the what so her plan about the how was perfect when you heard her talk about like what America can be just like didn't resonate with people like to watch just didn't resonate as much with people and I think that whoever beach Trump will be somebody who is mastered the what\nAnd I think I Hope somebody who's figured out how to talk about how in a way that also makes sense to\nMe the ... election was a rebuke of the Obama presidency\n[noise] you know\nIn some ways yes but I'm also mindful of the ways that voter suppression works in the country right so the Trump didn't win the popular like more people did not vote for Trump to that is true right though like we won the popular vote\nBut the way we've set up the system either one based on like equity or just that you think about the voting rights act getting gutted right there like this election came on the heels of all these protections around equity injustice and race being stripped away so I think some of it was definitely like a\nThere's a set of America that it's like we're tired of all this talk about race injustice and the police and they were like making their voices heard\nI'm part of this too is that you know the the right words for decades to build an infrastructure that will weaken voting you think about Wisconsin people talking about low voter turnout with confidence like well yeah they gerrymander the entire state so it's not like people didn't want to vote is that they couldn't really you think about in your you think about in Georgia or is\nThat like if not for the random reporter who wrote about closing those polling places like none of us would have ever known to think about all of that that's happening across the country that like\nA broadcaster doesn't know about and a reporter doesn't know about it and nobody treated their boat and not to experience the\nWe just had polling some of the first pulling going into the midterm elections right after Labor Day anti here the different analysts discuss what's going on state by state by and large the conservative analyst will argue that\nTo us about who you know any us to have an extra special gift with us this morning um everybody who listens to W. B. knows this person\nReally need to say a lot more of them were happy that Belinda skeleton\nWith us today allow everyone do Belinda you have been a guest on er generation radio with Dr Rick ... before but you guys were having a conversation I'm told recently were you shared some things with Dr Rick and what happened\nWell he had a patient in his office they would just want to get a little more information about not story and I was happy to share it with them and I want to share it with the audience it was about three months ago that I went in to a doctor and Prozac and I was suffering from joint pain from Lynn\nAnd um it effected me starting about fourteen years ago I found out I had life says um right after I found out I was pregnant with my youngest ... and I\nStarted having severe joint pains and my hips mainly but in my knees and shoulders and I've just been suffering with is and and a couple of years ago started getting cortisone shots and\nThat would help a little while but of course it would wear off and I would a wake up in the middle of the night and excruciating pain and\nIt was just not getting any way late I couldn't sleep at night to slip through the night or ... years because of this pain so I went to a doctor and brothers that he said we can help\nThis is something that we tackle every day and I got\nThe stem cell therapy an IV form because it was um all over my body and in several joint and about three months later I was lying on the show and I said oh my gosh I'm not in pain anymore this is amazing I haven't\nHad to roll over and it's just and\nTake Advil and medicate and it just it just hit me that that\nI Am not suffering any longer and this is all because of the stem cell therapy that I had an doctor Ambrose ex office so I Am willing to shine his shoes anytime he needs me too\n[laughter] so Belinda tell us what other life limitations where you experiencing as a result of the loop us for goodness more than a decade\nI really couldn't participate in well I couldn't sit in the form play with my kids when they were growing up and costs my legs um I couldn't I'm\nRun as far as I wanted to and play with them when they were younger I missed out on a lot of their younger years in activities that they were doing that I just couldn't keep up with them because of the pain I had\nWith joint and I feel like you know I missed out on so much and I wish I had had this done\nI'm immediately I Wish I'd known about this fourteen years ago because I missed out on a lot of their childhood the cause of the joint pain but now I I'm not going to miss out on anything else from this point forward\n... did you know that the stem cell therapy was an opportunity to treat patients like Belinda who suffer from lupus\nOh definitely um there's lots of good research showing the ah the ... will work with any type of joy pain or or autoimmune diseases like lupus so um you know it was more than happy to have to be able to help the lender\nOf this because I knew she was suffering for such a long time and then also just being able to help other people that\nKnow portrays so many people out there just have no idea that this therapy is available and the powerful and how safe it is well there's\nNot only is a treatment powerful and able to get your pain free but it's the safest or even you could possibly think of is so minimal to know side effects with it so um it's it's just the the perfect treatment in my opinion something was going to revolutionize medicine in the future\nSo willing to what habits there are activities have you decided that you're ready to re engage now that you're not suffering from that joint pain that had bothers you for so very long\nWell more apt to get up and and move and I have a new puppy who 'em up and walking him constantly I'm I have a ski trip planned I'm the first of the year and I haven't done that\nIn years um because I always dreaded and activity like that with my kids because that's something that would be so painful for me but now I'm looking forward to it because I Know it's not going to be agonizing for me to get down the slopes and just in ... and now I'm looking forward to it\nSo you're going to go skiing how long has it been since you've been on the slopes\nIt's been at least ten years [laughter] people better look out\n[laughter] Dr Rick how many of your patients or are you able now to provide the stem cell therapies for chronic conditions that causes the joint pain so the lupus\nDoes pretty well anyone who comes to see us as a candidate is there's\nI'm very few exceptions really other than someone who's pregnant or um someone with active cancer where you know so that's another condition we're a little aware more aware of but other than that um you know really the therapy can be for most anybody and it's it's so powerful as I mention and\nAnd so I'm so safe at the same time it's just it's just really to me the perfect treatment for most ... most problems\nAnd I say Belinda you would probably agree with that\nAbsolutely conscious I feel like I'm a walking billboard\nOr ... and stem cell therapy I was just that a function\nOn the other day and the lady was complaining about her shoulder and\nI you know I just started just mouthing and just going on and on about what she needed to do and I just happen to have Dr Ambrose a card in my purse and pass it along to her because I feel like no one needs to suffer any longer with chronic pain when there is a a source of\nHealing that is available to them and ... you can get your life back\nAnd you said that you received the stem cells for the lupus treatment via ivy therapy correct yes exactly and what was that experience like for you\nYou know kind of it was you know a typical ivy and I sat there and play it on my phone for forty five minutes so I could have had it done and the lunch break\nA it was nothing and then I got and a half of ... chamber\nAnd Dr Ambrose it can tell you about the ... chamber and it's just that's like a little um piece of heaven right there you can get in it and it just a pure oxygen and you can a play on your phone take a short nap which I did and\nThat just reached even eight and helps the stem cells go throughout the body\nAnd helps things just work a little bit better\nMy sense Belinda and Dr ... chime in you can't say enough good things about this treatment regimen correct willing to\nI really feel like anybody who's suffering and when you get our age kind of you know that things start to\nThings start to hurt you you have accidents and enjoy it start to wear out and you you just don't have to endure that on a daily basis and accept it any longer and live with chronic pain when there is an answer to these problems and it's it's a simple\nA shot or an IV therapy and it can take your pain away for life it is a one time deal\nDr ... why don't more people know about this especially people who are suffering from chronic auto immune disorders as Belinda has for fourteen years with lupus\nYeah I'm unfortunately there's very few people in our medical community they're aware of them so therapy and how powerful it's become how and how safe it is all these all these factors\nI'm being you know traditionally trained doctor for years um were exposed to every possible type of drug that you know like we we have drug reps would come and talk to us everyday to three or four four of them sometimes they're more\nAnd more training is based solely on drug therapy and so um you know about them hoping in the future there's a lot more education a lot more people including physicians are going to learn about themselves so powerful and see if they are and how they can help people like Linda and in many many others that I've treated the\nReally miracles happen where they're crippled with with pain or problems when they're able to get their lives back so\nIt's it's a the most rewarding thing I've ever done as a physician and I'm a truly love and believe in in the therapy and um you know we have special protocols that we use in my office like the upper chamber and other things that\nThat help our patients get better on top of the sense of therapy as well so\nUh what kind of data things over my last Twenty years of working with anti aging in stem cell therapy and put it all together and now we have a some

Kavanaugh\nAnd so we have grown our mission we still include that historic mission but now we see ourselves more as an educational organization\nAnd the problem today is biblical illiteracy here\nAnd in many cases biblical at least apathy if not outright antipathy\nTowards the Bible so we want to help enable dialogue our mission is biblical literacy understanding and dialogue now so we create Bible study resources are we host events where there can be dialogue between\nChristians and atheist and people have different Christian traditions are different faith traditions all based on the Bible and our views of that but to help people realize that there are\nMany ways to look at it are tagline is one book many voices\nWhich reflects the many voices both within the Bible but also the many voices of interpretation and the many voices who turn to the Bible in faith mhm or not in faith ... who turned to the Bible and somewhat or who turn away from the Bible\nAnd you mentioned the resources the Massachusetts Bible society has produced an amazing series of three studies for individuals or groups called exploring the Bible with both leaders guide and student book\nAnd you don't have to be in Massachusetts to access your resources how do people find out more about the Massachusetts bottles society\nOur website is mass Bible dot org\nIf you look for the exploring the Bible tab mhm on the menu it'll give you a descriptions of the various books\nBut they're all easily available on Amazon setting all in all those edition so often that's usually where people get them they can buy them from us but most people just buy it on Amazon and go the materials are inexpensive there's no like enrollment the ... like some series has\nUm we don't even know half the places that are doing it we\nWe know there are sold but people just by the money Amazon and go\nIf people really want to review the series also on the mass Bible dot org website you can request review copies and we're happy to send those out no obligation and you can look them over for yourselves before deciding\nWell and your sermon is based on the Old Testament reading for this Sunday from the book of job would you read it for us\nI Will just reading is from the book of job chapter one verse one and then chapter two verses one through ten\nThere once was a man in the land of whose whose name was job that man was blameless and upright one who feared God and turned away from evil\nOne day the heavenly beings came to present themselves before the lord and Satan also came among them to present himself before the lord the lord said the Satan where if you come from Satan answered the lord from going to and fro on the earth and from walking up and down on it\nThe lord said the St ... have you considered my servant job there is no one like him on the earth uh blameless an upright man who fears God and turns away from evil\nHe still persists in his integrity although you inside me against him to destroy him for no reason\nThan Satan answered the lord skin for scan all that people have they'll give to saved our lives but stretch out your hand now and touches bone in his flash and he will curfew to your face\nThe lord said Satan very well he's in your power only spare his life\nSo Satan went out from the presence of the lord and inflicted load some sores on job from the soul of his foot to the crowd of his head joke took a ... shirt with which just scraped himself and sat among the ashes\nThen his wife said to him do you still persist in your integrity curse God and die but he said to her you speak as any foolish woman would speak shall we received that good at the hand of God and not received the bad\nIn all this job did not stand with his lips\nAnd we look forward to learning more about this and your sermon the real question of job thank you for sharing it with us you welcome [noise]\nAnd if you'd like to listen again to today's program or readers share transcript Iran Robert's sermon visit our website a day one God or\nWork for free printed sermon transcript cause toll free at one eighty four one one why why\nIn this story job is not shall we say winning in chapter one he loses all his material wealth his servants are killed by invaders his livestock are killed by fire and a tornado knocked down home with his eldest son killing all of his children\nThat's one terrible horrible no good very bad day [noise]\nBut bad days like that never seemed to come by themselves and job's not winning streak is not over\nHere in chapter two he wakes up with every inch of his body covered and painful sores and we find him understandably just sitting in ashes scraping his skin with a piece of pottery\nHis wife swings by to tell him to quit with all the integrity already and just cursed God and die than his French show up to tell him it must be his own fault\nYou would think this tale of catastrophe and suffering would resonate with people more\nIf we live long enough many of us experience some version of this where through no fault of our own we suffer enormous painful loss and like job it comes in waves\nThe economy tanks and we lose our jobs are home our business or maybe all three [noise] our loved ones are taken by disaster violence or disease\nAnd those stresses take their toll on both our emotional and physical health until we end up depressed and sitting in the ashes wondering if God either seas or cares\nBut despite all of those points of connection a lot of people avoid the book of job some forget that this is a story that begins with the Hebrew equivalent of once upon a time\nThose readers take the literary device at the beginning literally and think God actually is awful enough to bargain with Satan and do all those horrible things to a job for the sake of some grand lesson\nNot my God they think and move on\nOthers have entered the story and are right there with job wondering what God is going to say to a blameless man who's been absolutely pummeled with disaster for no good reason okay God save those readers why do the innocent suffer\nThe weight with Joe ... dozens of chapters and then are furious when God finally appears in response to a job's pain with pages and pages of I'm God and you're not\nThose readers frequently site this as one more example of why they believe the God of the Old Testament doesn't measure up to the gods portrayed in the New Testament\nIt's true that the question weighing most heavily on job and his friends is the question almost all of us have why does a supposedly benevolent God let wonderful good people hit the skids why doesn't God's step in and protect the righteous from harm\nIf God doesn't do that then what's the point it seems to us that life to work that way\nDo good receive God's protection do evil ripped God's wrath\nAnd it seems that way too a lot of people in the Bible also including job jokes friends and king David who calls to God and so I'm twenty six vindicate meal lord for I have walked in my integrity and I have trusted in the lord without wavering\nBut if there's one thing that's playing in this life it's that for whatever reason life doesn't work that way it's not a quid pro quo system\nSigning up for the faith journey is not an insurance policy it's something else entirely and that's something else is sitting right before our eyes in St opening salvo in the story of job the following its from chapter one versus eight through eleven\nThe lord said to St ... have you considered my servant job there is no one like him on the earth uh blameless an upright man who fears of God and turns away from evil\nThan Satan answered the lord\nAnd joke the your God for nothing have you not put a fence around him and his house and all that he has on every side you have bless the work of his hands and his possessions have increased in the land\nBut stretch out your hand now and touch all that he has and he will curse you to your face\nI'm sharing Miller next week on day one we're delighted to have with us the Reverend Joe ... senior pastor of first Presbyterian Church in Marietta, Georgia sermon is entitled when

the dead the scars of his crucifixion we're still in plain\nView\nAnd so it is for any of us this day facing the enemy facing the flood facing the snakes of this world no doubt they have done their work on us\nThey've done their work on us they've\nDone their work on the world they have left there mark but they have not been victorious says the song is\nThey have not won the day they haven't put
