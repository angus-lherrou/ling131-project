I Believe in customer service I Believe in talking to people live on the phone I really do\nAbsolutely well another person mark says I went to a dinner seminar with a financial adviser and found them to be very entertaining and engaging much more so than my current advisor\nShould I switched to this new guy\nWell what's entertaining and engaging [laughter]\nI mean [laughter] I mean is that the criteria they just do like comedy show or the song and dance and maybe if I mean you know what does that mean [laughter] or you know you can have someone who may be a good communicator but then again they may be slick talking yeah\nSo you know one thing that we really really hard on and I and I do regular appearances here in Atlanta on TV and\nAnd we talk about how important it is to work with a fiduciary\nAnd if a do Sherry should always be looking out for your best interest there is no broker in the in that person's ear saying you need to sell this product you need to make sure you know you use these funds because these funds make us more money where we get a kick back from these funds\nI mean there's big companies big banks big firms out here that actually get a kickback from mutual fund companies if you use their funds are you kidding me yeah how can that be\nThat's what's best for the client so you know the way I look at it as don't get caught up and all that make sure that when you're talking to a person who doesn't mean that that person is bad because they are good communicator it just means that you got to make sure you ask the right questions how do you get paid for do share those things\nHere's another question for you and I think this is really a legitimate question a lot of people problem we have this because people tend to move around I like my advisor but I recently moved to a different state and I'm Wondering if I should be working with somebody local instead\nWell yes I think there is some value to that and we see that a lot here especially in the Atlanta area because we're such a transient city just this week I've had to folks to families\nBoth from Michigan by the way I mean I don't know what it is about Michigan maybe it's just not a lot of migration south but\nBoth of these families one has had a long term relationship with their financial firm and really the financial firms that are really good job for him when we did the analysis I really couldn't find anything that I dislike the what the firms doing\nBut they had come to the realization that it made sense to work with someone local\nAnd they you know they told the financial advisor because they were going to be here in Georgia for the rest of their lives is is there\nThis is where they're gonna retire that they needed to\nShift from you know just the investment firm to more of a whole list the financial advisor that's going to put together a retirement plan an income plan we call that our financial roadmap that's literally going to sit there and look at health care issues\nHow do we pay for those extra health care expenses that's going to look at the tax sufficiency of their portfolio that's going to manage the risk and volatility so that you know the closer they get to retirement or in retirement\nTheir portfolio doesn't look the same as they were when they were twenty thirty forty years old because one thing we cannot allow that have happened is loose thirty forty percent of that portfolio and in some cases you won't be able to retire you'll have to you if you're already retired possibly go back to work\nTo make up for the ... huge losses that could happen in the stock market so it's sometimes it makes sense to work with someone local\nHey let me just say that um you know a lot of people find themselves in that situation and I'm Glad that a particular person you were just talking about this couple came in and they found you to talk to you about that yeah they\nThey interviewed several firms um but that you know they end up choosing not to because they knew that the plan we put together you know one thing I Do run I think a little different than people here in that I talked to this is what I'm this is what I'm hearing from folks who come in is that we explain\nThings more simple I'm proud of that I'm proud when someone says you know I understand what you're saying no one's talking over my head\nAnd then another thing I hear is not only do you tell me what you do\nBut you tell me why you do it yeah that's important I think people need to know why we recommend what we recommend and I think by explaining that there's more of a comfort level\nMhm okay one last question I Want to throw out here and in our greener grass on the other side conversation market the market crashed and I lost a ton of money in my portfolio is that a

have to talk to anybody today you'll get a call back and then you can look at your calendar and all that kind of thing\nWas talking about finishing the race and by that I mean getting through retirement can be a lot like running a marathon\nMarketing to Europe marathon runner yourself yeah right here being sarcastic yes I Am [laughter]\nBut not like you're a marathon runner [laughter] Europe or is it must have a marathon runners on here in our dream about it there\nAre some things there are some similarities to marathon runners and folks who are getting ready to retire so I thought we could talk about some of the similarities are first of all you don't just go out of here in London Marathon without thinking about it or without preparing for it\nThere's a great deal of planning and preparation that goes into that so you can do it and the same goes for your retirement planning\nYeah you know when you think about it I Do have some friends who are runners and they loved the run and they're constantly training\nYou know most marathoners will spend I'd read an article one time at least six months and training before they even think about it you know mixing in days would light runs and some days long runs and they simulate what a marathon would be so that they're ready for what it when the when the time comes\nYou know ... other days that might be doing shorter fast run sprints and things like that\nIn your retirement plan you should have different buckets of money invested in different ways does the same thing you trained differently you need to have your money invested differently because there's different things that your money is needed for so we talk about having a rainy day bucket of money you know that we can get to it's at the bank\nYou know unfortunately it's not hardly earning any interest but that's why we don't put a whole lot there we just put enough there to take care of emergencies and\nYou know I like to say a rule of thumb but if we lost our job we need to have six months worth of income in there you know to be we can get our hands on\nYou know but anything above and beyond that unless you have something you're getting ready to buy or spend it on you probably need to have that invested so it may be something that's more conservative maybe interest and dividends something that we can get some higher interest but we can get to the money if we need to we also need to have\nSome money put away more long term was a long term ten plus years we need that money to grow because of the like you mentioned them you know your retirement is like a marathon\nTo me a retirement as a thirty year window\nYou know I Want to see my clients go all the way the age one hundred without the fear running out of money that could be thirty five to forty year window it is a marathon so we need to have\nSome money growing long term to keep up with longevity and to make sure that we're gonna have money when we get into our seventies eighties nineties or whenever\nYou know and then we also need to have income buckets buckets where we can supplement our Social Security even if we have a pension and maybe a smaller pension or maybe there is no cost of living on your pension and we need to be able to pull income interest and dividends or you know maybe some structured income to supplement\nThat Social Security check it's critical that money does it need to be risky we need to have that money more conservative because the last thing we want to do is be drawing income from a bucket of money that's losing money that means we're locking in law says that will never get back every time we cash a check\nSo it's critical that we have the risk under control we can have some risk in some buckets but some doctors need to be safer so when we have folks come in we talk about the power\nOf having different buckets of money where you don't have all of your eggs in one basket we've heard that term forever don't put all your eggs in

better and you might eat after eight hours it's going to digest the meal for eight hours after eight hours your body starts to utilize fat\nSo many people say I just can't lose weight I just can't
