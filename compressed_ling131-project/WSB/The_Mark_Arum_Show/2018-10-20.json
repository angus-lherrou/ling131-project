[noise]\nWell I was I was looking back and I felt so a proud to be in that position I mean two schools fighting it out we just come off probably the most emotional when ever in the rose bowl and I kind of incredible and so you know six days later we're playing for what all so it was almost surreal\nBut uh I I was just so proud of of our kids that left it left everything they had on the table you know congratulations Alabama for executing at the end but\nFor us to be in that position a I think all of our fans were so proud and it didn't end up like we wanted it to but you know ...\nWe were there and we were in the game and competing to last second to the game and as bad as we'd love to be in that same position and maybe a take care of business at the very end this year but it's so difficult to get there and it all starts so the game on that's all you can\nFocus on right now well best of luck this year thank you for all your leadership and these areas and I'm\nRichard you're listening to lens on business runs you buy all universities that have business school I'm Richard Land listening and Greg merits of athletic university I\n\nMean\nYou've been listening to an encore presentation of lens on business with host Richard lens season two of lens on business begins in December in the meantime listen to our past shows that lens on business dot com that's L.

September or early September was right around a hundred and twenty dollars a share\nI so if you got to buy a hundred shares that will cost about twelve grand and so what's important to understand is that as the market started to fall or we started losing the technology sector because this stock sits in the technology sector there's been up to to make money when it fell\nAnd so shorting was short selling would've been a really good opportunity for if you understood what to do and so clack Kaylee sea in early September trading at a hundred and twenty bucks a share now here's the thing that a lot of people get confused on\nHow can I make money selling something if I don't already own it in other words how can I sell clack if I don't if you buy at the store with well that's the beautiful thing about the financial markets that are broken will allow us to sell shares of their inventory into the market before price falls\nWith the goal of us than buying it back and giving it back to the broker at the price fall so let me give an example on black let's just say in September eighth of tens of right around that time you decided to use the clock was going to fall in price and you went into the markets and you said I Want to sell a hundred she has a clock\nNow it's a hundred and twenty bucks a share so your broker would basically say okay we have inventory that you can sell and we'll let you utilize our share of clock to sell into the market at a hundred and twenty bucks a share so what we're doing is we're going into our trading platform we're executing a short sale\nAnd what that does that sells a hundred shares of ... into the market at a hundred and twenty bucks a share on our behalf\nNot understand we don't own the stock broker owns the stock they're allowing us to utilize their shares to sell into the market at the market price which was a hundred and twenty so we do that now we're considered short the stock\nNow here's what happens we believe prices gonna fall well here seven weeks later class at Ninety and it's it's actually happened so we using a real world example at clock at Ninety you decide at night and you're going to bite back so when you go

by the cuts in slices in places and then we'd ... rate is going to get that you'll see a real reality when you go to the faces exactly\nDon't forget to check that out she had one of the things that you know it's key when you're trading investing as managing your own money a lot of people out there the average guy who's working for corporate America or the lady who's you know\nWorking out by the corporate ladder you know they have four one K. is they have maybe some old four one K. they moved to ... the average person's not managing their own money and that's paramount when it comes to having long term success in the financial markets let's take a moment let's talk about what that means really to self directed self manage\nWell the problem is many people don't they they're sophisticated enough demand you're on Monday 'cause Wall Street has I'm convinced of that maybe they think it's way too complicated and it's really not a hard process which you understand it\nThe key thing is is is if you don't learn how to control your own money then you've got to have money under management are going to pay exorbitant fees it's amazing that\nAnd the average four one K. people will pay over a hundred and fifty thousand dollars in fees over the course of a twenty five year four one K. think about that folks hundred and fifty grand goes to some Wall Street firms some entity\nGoldman Sachs citadel UPS CIA crafted their those trust you have your phone K they they wrote the charter they wrote the prospect is\nAnd you pay them and you pay them whether you make money or not\nThe only guaranteed return your phone case the fees that you pay here's the problem most you don't understand the fees 'cause you sign the paperwork with the lord you\nWith the match the company match so when you sign up for the four one K. they offered you the company match you went whoa that's free money chip it's not free money because now you're going to have to basically put your money into a position where somebody's going to manage it you got to pay a hundred and fifty thousand dollars or more in fees over twenty five years and you can only make money in one direction\nThink about that you bought that you you you were all in and the reality is is is those fees are going to crush your ... your long term profitability they're going to hurt you badly overtime and what we see is that when people learn the skills of self directly you take that bucket of money yourself\nAnd there's not a complicated process to do this you can learn the skills of self directing and you can profit regardless of direction and you don't have to pay those fees which long term gives you a much better chance of hitting those financial goals\nWell and that's the key it's long term being able to set up a plan that's going to be able to work for you now be able to work for you later and ultimately get you to where you want to be chipped there's a lot of people out there if you ask them one day when you want to retire and their answers now that well what are you doing now to get ready for retirement and the thing they're doing nothing there's this there's working\nWell the average American is way short financially I've ever been able to retire at their current standard of living see that's the real issue\nAnybody can retire but can you retire at the lifestyle that you currently live the lifestyle you want to live\nAnd the real problem isn't the biggest issue with the baby boomer generation is that they're worried about run out of money before they die so the system that you're in for one k.'s managed diaries has you worried about run out of money before you die now I have students at all like ... that's been six to ten hours a month managing their own nest egg they manage their own IRA\nAnd they make decisions in that and those decisions are built around trying to make one percent a month thinking about that if you can make one percent among the mock goes up down her side we can do that consistently over time you put that compound and calculator it gets powerful\nAnd the problem is is that many people can't make one percent among because the market goes down they don't profit they lose they needed to go up for them to profit and ultimately because of all of this turns in price or the marketing these fees they never hit the goals\nSelf directing learning the skills to take control that bucket is essential to long term success and more and more people we're seeing this Adam\nAre coming out of the woodwork saying I Need to learn how to control my own money because the mass of my account says I'm going to run out of money before I die the Math Doesn't work and I need to change the formula and you know that former means no chain that formula means\nSelf directing taking control that bucket and making the decision just suffers who cares more about your money then you you should be in control of it you should be making those decisions and ultimately you could hit those long term goals if you get the consistency and that kind of ... monthly returned that we're focused on\nAnd that's key the long term goal that long term goals are gonna separate you from the masses online training academy they have a class specifically on self directing now if you're a brand new to the market or you maybe you've been in the mark and you've never thought about managing your money yourself until now\nThey have a class specifically on at this is a five hundred dollar value class we have a few seats to give away the listeners if you have money in the market for one
