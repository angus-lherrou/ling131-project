conference this afternoon confirming the rest of fifty six year old is Caesar say I think he's just sending more than a dozen package bombs to democratic political figures he's described as a troubled lunar who showed little interest in politics before Donald Trump became president President Trump says he knows the pipe bomb suspect was a supporter but\nThey'll play though and look at what happened was that was sort of a different bar lurk\nYeah they looked like a legitimate gene now you know that we we thought before the season you know what do we know but at the prognosticators that they get All right Florida you know maybe a seven and five kinda team they're nice in the country Honda\nYeah they're nice in the country and damned ball and it's got to get some kudos for this of course we're only midway through the season but I interesting statistic that I saw this week is that a Florida committed to the season Florida over the previous since two thousand the beginning of two thousand tendencies in Florida was sixty and forty one\nMississippi State over that time I think was sixty ... thirty nine was Mississippi State over the previous eight seasons had a better record than Florida did\nAnd let's not forget that the ... bulldogs were playing in the west yeah they had to play Alabama Auburn LSU every every year old miss had some good teams in there yet um whereas Florida was playing in the east\nSo the fact that ... been able to come in and flipped out immediately when you think about the success that he had with far fewer resources and and not quite the talent based on not surprising and I guess the speed with which he's done it is what's surprising\nWhat what I like for Georgia going to this is a they're coming off the by week you know they get the by week before Florida so we can kind of forget what happened down in Alice you what happened in LSU Kevin butler or what exactly\nOn down there well it's\nIt was a learning session unfortunately and it's the kind you have to go through when you have a young team and that\nYou go into adversity and you don't respond well and that's exactly what happened uh there's no way to take this uh this pig it was ugly and uh we got um physically beat up front but I think\nYou know if you take that the right way and you hear coach smart talk about it and his staff\nPreaches it on a daily basis it it's not what happened it's how you react in Georgia\nAs a great history of reacting under Kirby you know we've had some uh battles that first year but we'd always come back and improve some part of the game obviously last year we bounce back from a a tough beating\nAnd all burned and you know as fans were expecting that same kind of turned around so\nI think the team can learn from that I think the team\nCan build from what happened last year and apply it to this year\nAnd they're going to need to because this is going to be a physical football game\nI Know coach Mullen's as convince just team the only way to beat Georgia\nIs to out physical them and they did that down and LSU or so there's good reason for Georgia to take notice and to be on game or else it will um suffer another defeat\nKevin did you see anything down there and LSU that kind of alarmed that might not be that might be an issue the rest of the ... working at all these mixed\n[noise] no I think it can be fixed Jay you know you don't ever want to say I didn't see the team bounced back properly so it's going to be a reoccurring thing each week I I really believe that Kirby in them address that and they\nHave that resilience in their coaching they have that resilience and the and the attitude of the team to go back out there\nAnd not do what you did before um and a lot of it is stuff that we did to ourselves and you know you look at it but dropped passes penalties turnovers if we do those three things this weekend it will be an ugly weekend for the University of Georgia the team\nThat wins the turnover battle will win this game and I really believe the field position coming off special teams in this game will really really play a big factor\nMark herring Kevin butler Neal Honda Williamson and Jay Black review in the big game tomorrow down in Jacksonville uh both teams into the game six in one but if they are both old when seven out of this will be an important game obviously because it's the rivalry but we've got the added fact now this is going to be a factor in the SEC erased the SEC\nEast race because the winner of this you know pretty much take control of the division oh no doubt well Kentucky's still a factor because Kentucky beat Florida and we have to play Kentucky next week\nBut we we take whoever wins takes that huge step forward Florida is still going to hope then that we can be Kentucky for them if they were to beat us and if we when we have to be Kentucky so I guess either way the winter of ... of tomorrow's game\nIs hoping the Georgia Kentucky yeah absolutely and and and that's where I first time that both teams are in the top ten\nOh no first time both both been ranks is twenty twelve and first time I'd been a ... yeah there you go in ten years\nThat's unbelievable so you know again but to go back to this but we we preview the season before and and I as a bulldog fan I'm certainly not an expert but I looked at Florida in Kentucky and didn't think those would matter much in the long term the scheme of things but these are two big games right here\nI thought Jay hitter really well and and Jay and I of course we travel together with the team work together a lot during the season and we all talked about how the experts were all saying oh what's the south Carolina game that's the one that's going to trip of words vastly and then it became Missouri with drew lock that is going to be one 'cause you know Florida and Kentucky they're terrible\nAnd brushing them aside in this case they say that then the season happens then you get punched in the mouth\nI Know and everything changes right Mike Tyson once you get popped in the mouth yeah you have to change the exact game plan changes may you know clear\nBulldog supporter I approve and Florida is terrible but that doesn't really happen [laughter] so it is nice and Kevin I think you'll agree it is kind of nice at this game is kind of back to something where you know it's an FCC east eliminate or\n[noise] yeah it is I mean I talked about how exciting it is just to play in the game I don't care if you come in over nine and nine and no\nI'm this just adds to the excitement and\nAdds to the I guess the intensity that both of these teams are feeling right now the night before the game um you know not only are you playing for the bragging rights and certainly you know all the alumni and all the fans and the pageantry that goes on for this game\nAnd you play for your fan base but now you're playing for an S. E. C. championship or this game means something so it's even taken another step up we've got game day here we've got the SEC Network here are the national attention is on this game tomorrow\nAnd they want to see who the heck\nThe Georgia Bulldogs are and the most exciting thing for these guys when they're going to sleep they have a great opportunity to march to take a big step forward\nReal quick guys before we get out of here and you guys need your sleep for tomorrow because we are pre game show tailgate show starts at ...\nI Will be eleven thirty with Kevin butler and uh just answer for adults ... gave him an auto takes we'll at twelve thirty from the sidelines of when I went out T I Am a bank field or\nThe guy I don't know I still call it the gator bowl well Arizona side of the gate or all\nKick off at the gator bowl is at three thirty PM a real quick around the horn we'll start with the UJA black Georgia wins this game if blank\nIt runs for more than fiction orange care really got to run the ball better gotta have three more months while he's in a running\nAll right how Neal Honda Williams in Georgia wins this game if\nBlank if we can protect our quarterback because Florida has got some fierce fierce pass rushing ability and we need to give Jake from an door Justin field yeah\nThat's a whole 'nother matter Kevin butler Georgia wins this game if like\nGeorgia wins this game if Blankenship makes\nOh Kevin butler star of the show starve the show I Kevin thanks as always\nEnjoy the time down in Jacksonville uh bring us back to a victory Honda always a pleasure thank you thank you ... you're not going to bed yet you're going to stick around started I Need you more alright special bulldogs preview or the dogs taking on the Haiti the gators tomorrow\nOr our coverage starts at eleven thirty AM kick off at three thirty what it would always a surprises me if you know for me I've been here\nSince Ninety six it's the Georgia Florida game for some reason the gator fans called the Florida Georgia game which is ... to me it's Georgia Florida people no doubt not Florida Georgia\nDoes he that's that doesn't roll off the top [noise] I'd ah we'll be right back hang tight it's the friday edition of them are guaranteed show [noise]\n\nSeven Eighteen ethical re carrier WSBIU twenty four hour transit or look at why the USB GM came right lane remains walk and Henry county Seventy five down down at highway one thirty eight eggs to two twenty eight that has you delayed back tomorrow you side we Nineteen forty one\nAs an alternate they are also on the ws B team came crashing block any left lane to defy east bound the outer loop\nAt Riverdale road access sixty taboo to break through the area checking don't tell connector not too bad but still on and off the brakes Seventeen from South down from seventeenth street don't die twenty more than just tap the breaks through the gritty curb this report brought to by usa life insurance company\nHelp secure your family tomorrow with usa a life insurance for less than you may think is a usa dot com provided by usa life insurance companies San Antonio Texas a Mike shields WSBIU\nWhen you asked me mark ... every morning and entertaining talk every evening many hands are so many years harem does a local daily talk show more\nLazy way of making everybody feel like you're in your money or time mark\n... is plugged in every day until nine Ninety five five and am I mean when you asked me [noise]\nLocal ram dealer is committed to giving you a great deal and right now during rammed power days well qualified growing less use of competitive vehicles get a ... some of the whole new twenty Nineteen ram Fifteen hundred big one group got four by two\nOr three Seventy nine of mine for thirty six month with three Seventy nine to assigning tax cut a license extra\nGo to rent trucks dot com to find your overran dealer and get great deals on trucks worthy of your reputation and right now well qualified current legacies of competitive vehicles get a little ... on the all new twenty Nineteen ram Fifteen hundred big one group ... by two or three Seventy nine a month for thirty six months with three Seventy nine to assigning tax cut a license extra George dedication goes\nAnd I'll say hockey is in custody in Florida waiting a court appearance there before he'll likely be moved to New York on charges that could keep him in prison for many decades if he's convicted also today more devices were found in California about stone ABC News\nStuff man puts out a non lethal hit on his wife now he and the people he hires are facing heart prison time he'll take\nAround there was angry that his ex wife had a new boyfriend so from prison he plotted with his buddy ...
