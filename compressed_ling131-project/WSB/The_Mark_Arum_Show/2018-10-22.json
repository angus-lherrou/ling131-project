it was a good time I'm All right so that was quick weekend recap uh I Want to talk about first out later on the program ... going to\nBreak down that breaking news I'm In good accounting of the officers shooting or that was a big deal today but this story hit close to home to meet this morning I'm\nOn channel two actually news Audrey washing it was on a story you know how I feel about waffle house guys right that that to me I'm not a very religious\nPerson but to me that the ah waffle houses a a is a sanctuary\nWhere they welcome all religions all creeds all colors all nationalities it's it's it's basically a church in my opinion and someone had the audacity to shoot a waffle house cook\nIn DeKalb County this warning and that this story drives me crazy age will be shooting people but especially the hardworking cooks at waffle house\nA so this this story really bugged me so are joining us live from channel to actually knew she covered it for the uh\nFour or five and six PM shows good friend of the program Tyson Fernandez Joyce how are you tie hey Mark I'm good long time ago see by the way you got to come in the studio once in awhile I really do we're now we're ... tamales here this evening so we go to let's go great together\nDelicious they're delicious together a speaking a delicious waffle house I Love the waffle house it's my second home and this this story really bugged me that a cook at the waffle house got shot what happened er and where this morning\nWell this is going to buy you a little more because I spoke to an employee who knows the cook and she said he is the nicest guy he's actually working at the house overnight to just make extra money because he started it don't it lasts he started at the top of that will just\nSat but basically this morning for thirty am somebody walk into the waffle house I'm living a gun\nAnd you know what are the money now this is the part that we still need more details on what exactly happened\nEight the cook try to stop it I'm not sure but I Know that the gunman shot to cook and got away with the money and then increasingly enough were sitting there getting ready to go live at four o'clock and you see police pull up\nAnd just the way they pulled out they\nPretty much box this car and it was like a green dodged challenger ... state date they parked in a way so that he couldn't get out and so\nThe guy gets out of the car but it looked like it was a planned meeting and so he gets out there talking to you on that couldn't\nHear every word because it can't be on the property that we heard him explaining where he was and what happened he basically told police that somebody shot at him last night he shot by law I don't know what I'm saying is Ottawa out somewhere else but next thing you know\nPut his hands behind his back and arrested him so then his mom told up and she says you know what's going on here\nThey talk some more they take the guy to jail mom comes over talk sweat off camera and just said\nThat the police do you like he lied to them about something and she knows that he did not Rob the ... you would never do anything like that but they feel like he lied to them about where he was or what happened until I call the police\nThey confirmed that he is that possible witness and they arrested him on something separate\nSo I'm Still working to figure out what that\nIs that just carry on ...\nDoor right then ... you know yeah the whole thing to hear more details will be you know we're waiting for that\nTyson Fernandez from channel to actually news joining us on the program talking about a waffle house cook that was shot early this morning in DeKalb County eleven hundred block of Columbia drive do we know the condition of the cook ties ya\nHe's stable he's doing well um I don't know the details that to you know exactly how he's doing but the waffle house ... a lot from House spokesman and also the police said that he could have pulled Julie ... stable condition\nAlright the good news and you're going to continue to follow the story because at that arrest is interesting the fact that oh hours later they this guy was up for questioning and they arrested him it might ... might not be related might be something else but certainly in and we're the only\nOne there so you don't stay on it\nFresh eyes so I got to ask you a question as as New England girl a you know I'm from Connecticut you're from Massachusetts I don't hold that against you for the most part but ...\nBut we don't we didn't grow up with a waffle house um so I came down actually the first time I ever had it was driving to spring break and a off of I Ninety five stopping off lots and then this is the greatest place ever not opposite absolutely loved it have you embrace the waffle house as as\nMy goodness Middle Eastern Asia and you know we used to drive places they'll actually go out we stopped at a White House it so funny when I talked to other people about it and you're like really excited about my\nWe only get better ...\nExactly I remember the first time I went to waffle house and I'm like I can have steak and eggs for six dollars this is the greatest place adverse so orange do that in the morning\nOh exactly so listen here's the next question there might be tougher V. answer because I Know you're you're ... you're an amazing shape I'm assuming you you watch what you eat what is ... waffle house order typically\nOoh I like the one where I get the reason chose rambled eggs with cheese Jay sometimes if I'm feeling real healthy I'll do the tomatoes otherwise out very well and I got drink water 'cause I\nLike yeah ... that's a legit order I liked that ordered a tire she always a pleasure my friend hopefully we'll see assume\nYes I Love talking to you like\nTo take care type Tyson Fernandez from channel to that's a strong order did she do you guys have a a set waffle house order now do you mix and match or yeah\nYeah it just depends on the road and then at the time I go to thing I don't think I have like a go to I Want to have\nAt least a waffle I usually get a lot of ever ordered awful though really no I I get awful five percent of the times on there it's rare\nThat to my dessert that's breakfast desert you know [laughter]\nBut I I usually get one of these are two my my two standard orders depending on what I Want to do I get the all star breakfast with cheese eggs because that's the best value it is\nThat's where you get the waffle the hash browns or grits or whatever and then I get welding and bacon and I don't eat it but I take it home to my dogs and I'm like Superman when I Walk in with that waffle house little bag with the bacon in there\nI'm like a God and my dogs they I literally could be like go do the dishes and they would go into that that someone my second order is a two egg and cheese sandwiches scrambling and cheese sandwiches with ... rounds cover\nThat that's a that's my order\nDeb I'm On an even know what the ad on the only logical houses posts concert food okay in the middle of now yeah you can't drive home yeah or had a good walk behind you get one egg white and now I get a waffle and bacon and water that Oh nice yeah All right I Love it I don't trust the beverages ... like just can be a water\n[laughter] give me why I sometimes get an orange juice but do you take the girls there do they like ... ah\nI don't know if we've ever taking them really taking them to use the restroom\nBut [laughter] not to eat is called the facts yet I'm taking a waffle house yet I Want to talk about this 'cause I I mean really
