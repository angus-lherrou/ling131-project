the nation senators representing forty four percent of the population will have prevailed over those representing fifty six percent of the population\nIf Kavanaugh is confirmed on a party line vote\nYou all the Supreme Court is not supposed to be reflective of democracy in any way shape or form\nI mean the reality is that for the first hundred twenty four years of this country more than half of our country's history an unelected United States Senate confirmed the unelected members of the United States Supreme court\nYou you understand those\nThe Senate until Nineteen thirty really for the election writing fourteen the Senate of the United states was not elected it was it was chosen by state it typically governors who nominated senators who were confirmed by members of the legislature of the states\nAnd they went to Washington one of the arguments for changing it was because state elections were all about who was going to pick the senator\nNonetheless the senators were completely elected you could not recall a senator nor could you vote for senator\nAnd those elected senator picked or at least confirmed the president's nominations of elected judges do the entire federal court system the idea that went on for a hundred twenty four years\nIs only since then been the case that elected senators\nActually do the\nNomination through the confirmations of elected Supreme Court members see the Senate and the Supreme Court were never supposed to reflect democracy that's what the house of representatives for the house of representatives is is supposed to reflect the will of the voters the synod is to reflect the will of the states and the Supreme Court is to reflect the law\nIs only after we have introduced politics into the election of senators that we've
