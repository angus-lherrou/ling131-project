that\nBut one of Atlanta it's great companies um they have seven thousand employees today State Farm will continue to grow in Atlanta and the Atlanta Hawks organization we reached an agreement late this summer to rename the brand new arena State Farm arena and\nThis Saturday we want to welcome everybody to the neighborhood and have a free event where folks can come on down the the building

basically a new arena nasty\nYeah we we've struggled to find a word that really tells people how much we've changed everything transformation renovation are great words and when people walk in the new building and they go oh my I didn't realize it was this extensive\nSo here I go every square inch of the building has been changed there's nothing that's the same from the past\nFrom the floors to the tiles to all the new features it is a brand new building and we think it's a building for the next generation of fans because it's got so many unique assets and nobody's ever seen before\nTalked to me

[noise]\nIt's fifty three after the our area you're ... or ... or his new book is out them\nI started reading it I got a couple of ... a courtesy copy last week\nA it's essentially on how ... by being as tribal as we become and particularly by focusing so much on line a we're losing the ability to be good neighbors to each other or who agree to disagree on topics\nAnd he calls out Sean Hannity in part of the book uh for some of the things he Andy has done and of course Hannity's going after him but what I I really do get\nIs the level of hostility and hatred from Trump supporters been test does not like the president I don't like the president either a I think he's a man of of immoral character er\nAnd ... has been rather prominent but here's the thing he votes with the president Ninety percent of the time and the ten percent of the time that says doesn't but with the president is often on minor things there has not been a single major initiative the president has tried to get to the Senate\nOr been says hasn't supportive whether it's spread capital or tax cuts or repeal of Obamacare or even on immigration been tests aligned with the president and supports building a wall\nAll this other border and yet the amount of Trump supporters who were convinced that demand opposes it\nIn Haiti in in ... this is why tribalism\nMakes me so frustrated in these shoes not even with the president these days with all of his supporters\nDo you you can't agree to disagree on that you can you can say you will vote for the president\nI think I probably will in twenty twenty\nBut yet I'm I'm not going to go out and apologize for the dumb things president says he had no business colon uh his porn star mistress a horse race\nAnd ... but you can't do that any more than ... says unafraid to do that and people really didn't want to be of a sudden it was either so that I shouldn't conservatives want people to be in the Senate who don't want to be in government who feel compelled to go up there to say no and stuff\nAnd it was one of the other big criticism from Trump supporters about says that will be just a duty to sponsor major legislation\nYeah I think that's great I I\nI Wish more senators wouldn't sponsor major legislation to kill all the bad stuff that comes from the house representatives which is what he does\nUm it it is very much seems like the Republican Party now is the majority party in the country but there is a significant part of the Republican Party that wishes that it was more ideologically pure than a majority party can be and listen I Am an ideological purist I'm a conservative\nUm but I don't have the Republican Party that's support services and Ben Sasse is more conservative than President Trump\nHe's not out there trying to grow government is not other tried to\nUh bankrupt the nation is not other are trying to do the strong men in Washington routine where Washington his his is the be all end all I I like that I liked the fact that ... been test looks on Washington very skeptically and thinks that neither ... nor the president should have the powers that are the windows right now\nIt just it it's very frustrating to see that little ... and just see friends of mine and talk radio ... that they agree with you should like Ninety nine percent of the stuff they agree on but oh my goodness he says bad things about the president thinks we become to tribal so we got to show that he's actually right on the tribalism stuff\nAnd he really is we are ... all of us I and I'm guilty of this as well so emotionally invested in what happens to

I mean it's ... I think because ... yeah that's the thing like eating eating human is illegal\nLike human pieces right yeah\nIt was too I think it was twilight zone or one of those shows it maybe it's a movie I don't know this guy a murder or this or he owed money he learned a little diner and he murdered the guy that he owed money to a put them in the freezer and he started serving them as stakes\nNice and it was like his diner was struggling and they blew up like ... about this all these people came into this at a diner against his amazing steak and with the way to keep killing more people to ah yeah anyway um so I I was just blown away by the story I did a lot of weird things as a kid a lot of weird pranks but I Would\nThat never ever ever thought of another level that is another level we would never have occurred to me to to bake those into ah into cookies and given the classmates ... it really makes me wonder what I got to talk to their parents yeah you know what I mean\nIf they have parents\nMaybe they're orphans now grandpa Joe took care of it [laughter] yeah so so we can go a number\nOf ways on this topic um I I Want to start with your an initial thought of this crazy story I mean that's that's crazy so there's two ways to attack this\nUm I guess this is considered Deborah a prank right ... yeah All right so we'll talk about high school pranks what's a what's the best highschool prank you ever pulled are you ever saw polls and on a more and more but issue um where where do you want your ashes scattered if you want to get cremated do you want to get cremated long ago\nWe ... we have thought about it yeah because we don't know where the girls are going to end up sure I mean all my family's all our families usually from Texas so we were all living in Texas I Would just be buried there yeah\nBut says we're kinda here in Georgia I don't know if they're going back to the same kind of weird so we've I've toyed with the idea of ... you're talking about according to mom wants me to be married but I was like what does it matter you're going to be dead anyway\n[laughter] true [laughter] I mean what does it matter a murder cremated he wants to be buried next to you as you I mean it doesn't make any sense ... ... per per per arguments so it was like mom a longer list and I apologize or your your roots son Ben ... seemed like a guy or gal that wants to get cremated not bury\nYeah I don't like the idea of writing and the earth ...\n... where do you want to get scattered it official or something and you know I'd probably be smoke distaste\nJealous [laughter] how do you do you have an idea where you want your ... on the ankle\nI like to travel to some places that I've been to that I really enjoy it I get a chance to whoever was going to be scattering about just cool places\nPlaces around the ... yeah so they could make it a job for them to contact Venus around looking for a single ... theater has chuckles\nOn our getting cremated yeah due in Montana Gen to ...\nShe's not from Montana yeah but she doesn't like it down here [laughter]\nI go to a low teach guy so that's our kicking off a the show this a crazy crazy story out of California where these high school kid baked their grandfather's ashes into cookies and gave them to their classmates\nGreatest pranks ever pulled in high school and where would you like your ashes scattered photo for seven to zero seven fifty one eight hundred ws we talk on Twitter at ...
