um ... you know it would have ended with me but when I was like oh let's do it you know\nSo she goes to target and makes these amazing boo baskets next color copies of the blue thing that you've got to stick up whatever like\nShe she's a teacher so she loves projects like this so I'm I go ahead and you pick two uh two neighbors that you want to do shit okay I like this person and I like this couple blah blah blah so she does\nI wake up in the morning I come out we have another blue basket on our front porch and I'm like that's weird because we have the sign that says we've been booed right\nSomeone read gifted are blue basket [laughter]\nMaybe they just didn't like it knows they took stuff out\nOf the some of his tough out they took some they took the good candy out they left the scene in there\nAnd let the candy corn yeah they live with like candy so like half the stuff them I was sitting there is now back on our front porch\nAnd I'm like what what's going on it's obvious that you've already had yeah there's a line on the door as we've been moving in the midst it it's a big sign what obviously they did it like two in the morning that's what I'm saying 'cause at three in the morning it was there so maybe they didn't see the sign\nWas there a dollar limit on the big basket might neither do I do maybe they took some stuff out and said okay you gave too much here's the rest of your style\nAnd there's no rules or anything running this is all off the cuff kind of stuff this this never happened\nBefore like to get my in my address [laughter] I didn't even know\nWho they are just showing went to to people's houses the goal yeah he went back to them see how long that goes back and well that's the thing to do it now but now\nSo that person that re gifted the Buddha basket\nThat the the chain is is caught a little bit because I'm not doing it again [laughter] you know yeah so what do I just take that half a basket and put her on someone else's door now now I say give up it's done right at the onset of a thank you I mean it's a sweet you know for normal people that this is the sweet thing for people that like people\nYeah ... maybe you were supposed to be watching out and then give the breast to somebody else I honestly maybe I don't know maybe that's what they do my is good at following directions I think she you know a new I mean she got these fancy little\nPumpkin baskets and she put time effort and money to this thing and if you have to ask for me to reimburse or yet which is I'm curious about but so we're at there's many layers to this story that I find weird the fact that this thing actually exists this blue basket\nGiving tree and that someone would actually ...\nI Want to say somebody did that in our neighborhood last year\nBut I don't remember it being around Halloween I remember being make another holiday but I don't remember\nIf it was a Christmas or Thanksgiving or something like that are you close to the re gifting part like well that that's where we are going to talk about because I Love reward if we're going to talk about re gifting week 'cause I had my mom just a couple of weeks ago when I Want him to get I get told me a story about their uh\nTheir wedding yeah and [laughter] and I there is someone read gifted not the gift that like it was I think it was a cousin or cousin got married\nAnd then my mom got married like six months later and the the cousin gives my parents a wedding gift it was like a\nI don't know gravy boat or some some freaking ridiculous like that the handful you know we'll never use and it was like a nice gravy boat but inside was the card you know hey dear Jane and Dennis congrats on your wedding or vi\nAnd totally they re gifted the gravy bought from their wedding six months earlier so I Want to talk about we're going to talk about Halloween but the the are the rules and re gifting and and and some\nRe gifting stories I'd love to hear Chuck I re gift so much\nThat Twenty years
