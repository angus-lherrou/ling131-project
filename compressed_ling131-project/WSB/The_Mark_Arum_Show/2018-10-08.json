I have access to any type of healthcare I Want in the world\nWhy would not be doing the best ... in my opinion for what I have got a knife and my back I Want a surgeon I got a brain tumor I Want a neurosurgeon I got a hip replacement I Wanna orthopedic surgeon\nBut if I can get you will and keep you well chances are you're not going to have to go down that route and that's why so many attorneys attorneys for car accidents gosh we get those all the time because they know that we're not just going to run them through a male and this\nMe people go to somebody's mills they're called and they go in there and they get some hot pack slapped on them and they burn insurance through them and they run up this huge bill and the patient comes to me and says doc I went to them and I ran up this huge

dressed socks older than you are [laughter] All right so a couple of things you want to look at it you take any medication now I'm not\nOkay 'cause things like acetaminophen if you take acetaminophen for pain acetaminophen drops your livers production of ... ... is a chemical it's a it's an antioxidant uh that helps detoxify chemicals out of your system\nAnd so I see there's a lot and people start taking you see them enough and they're not producing ... when I got to get them on a good ... supplements and then their memory comes back the other thing we have to look at it then you have good circulation to your brain and if you've had any hardening of the arteries well that can be an issue\nI'm In a lot of sugar\nRain can become insulin resistance meaning if not utilize sugar as a fuel anymore and that's what many people believe now leads to things like Alzheimer's\nSo if you're doing sugar you have done sugar bread cookies cakes donuts passed the sugar sodas ice creams yeah I've got to cut them out now on his Morrow on now I don't recommend Dr Joe's nitric oxide support the increase circulation to the brain are always always always super greens and essential source I mean that that goes without saying\nUm and that's on the website Dr Joe dot com the ... vitamins help the brain work pretty well too and if that's the ones I take some telling you what I take because this is how I keep my brain sharp some older than you so super into central source B. complex adrenal support and nitric oxide\nThat's where I've had are now do you have any neck pain or headaches now I Do not\nPerfect 'cause if you have a pension or a blood vessel in your neck that can be affecting the memory as well\nAnd we know nothing like that\nOkay and I would start there but you got to give up that sugar get on the supplements and let's see where we go with that it should happen pretty quickly you shouldn't notice in a couple of weeks some of that turning around and if that okay that one

office we look at the nervous system we look at the digestive system and we look at their diet we want to cover all three bases because that's what we get the best results with and that's why people come see us\nSometimes patients come in to say doc I just want to talk about nutrition okay and then I take a case history on them and it turns out they do have other issues they have acid reflux or they have headache so they haven't done that so they have ... could have done this a painting their foot and we check 'em out and then we say listen what you want do you want to get it all fixed

hard\nTo digest texture soy protein tastes like meat I guess I haven't had beaten thirty two years um it tastes good but it's really hard to digest\nAnd so she was having allergic reaction to these protein she couldn't break down properly and so what I did was I got her off to the food I think what's causing the reaction I got her on some Dr Joseph digestive enzymes and this is my thing if you're going to eat cooked food I recommend a digestive enzyme\nA lot of patience with a lot of people listen to the show I I'm an Indian background from India\nOr because a lot of Indian or are

wasn't ... as he rented available\nAnd so the food how to cook to make sure killing all the pathogens totally get that but if you have access to raw foods broccoli cucumbers tomatoes avocado salad I recommend you do it\nBecause of raw food has something called enzymes and as you get older your ends on levels drop\nSo what can we do get those ends on levels backup you can eat raw food and if I eat a cooked meal like fighter Indian meal which I Love I'll have Dr Joe's ends I support I'll take a few Dr Joseph Fins on support tablet or castles to give me the enzymes helped break down and food\nAnd

I I think my pain as nervous you of course it's a nerve issue if the nerve is dead you wouldn't feel any paid\nSo you gotta look at the nervous system and find out why the nervous system is firing off a on it uh unnaturally so anti inflammatory diet again always comes up and it was a new study was a Garrett from Harvard\nYeah Harvard there Harvard health has a new article out on the limits to prescription drugs\nYeah you're a ... this is I tried to tell people about there's this one or the ... the the most to the doctor can prescribe you apparently is seven\nDays of a prescription for any kind of ... and that's the most nuts and some states right now do they try most states mostly yet so and and some of them can only prescribe you three days worth yeah\nAnd if you if you're a chronic pain patient and I have been I I have an injury and my neck that it's a chronic pain issue and when it acts up I have to get traction and a half to a chiropractor care um and I have to get my uh I'm a super reason essential source I'll double dose on that'll take the nitric oxide and that helps bring the pain down\nA but so the opioid crisis is just getting out of control and people they they can't get the opioids so what they're doing then is there going to heroin many cases and must tell the story while ago a friend of mine's a dentist\nAnd we were chatting and now when we first became friends you know what do you do you know your merits and I'm not married I said are you married he goes well my wife of ... passed away and young guy my age\nAnd I said well what happened and I'm like an idiot I asked that question right he said no no she says she was in a car accident was prescribed opioids the doctor said no more she became a started going out in the streets and got heroin and she got her heroin overdose and so here's a classy guy very well to do wealthy intelligent his wife was college educated\nYou don't know if you're going to become an addict or not that's the whole thing with the opioids any other addicting drugs is you don't know it's so they're trying to limit the amount of\nThe opioids that prescribing but if you're in chronic pain sometimes you need something done and this is what's driving me nuts\nThey're saying we're going to cut back on an opioid prescriptions what are you gonna do for these people that well we're not going to get many ... what do you do for these people that well the opioids are off the table\nSo that's where we come in and that's why this show today is so timely why won't my pain go away so start looking at things like chiropractic care in fact the state's attorney general's\nSent a letter to the president of the insurance companies and they said listen guys you're wasting a lot of money paying for things that aren't necessary and people become addicted to the opioids why don't you try paying for more things like chiropractic care physical therapy counseling\nDietary work she's almost things I've been talking about so that's on the doctor Joel's right column by the way I joke about that but all things I put the Dr Jones right column I've been talking about this for thirty four years now\nAnd now the state's attorney generals are telling the insurance companies presidents you're going to save money you can save people's lives if you cover more\nOf what they call alternative therapies I don't like to call it alternative therapies but that's what it's known as the ...\nSo I was right and that's why so many people\nWalking to our offices and the Atlanta area of officers in Marietta delusion Stockbridge because they're tired of being sick and tired and they want to get well and many times the doctor said listen I Can't prescribe many more drugs I lose my license\nIf it's an opioid drug and so that's

I mean forty Charlotte shot in the face with her elbow\nI should sign up for that that's like me at a concert [laughter] it's like a ... it was just like it's almost too violent for me I was like how like one of that one of those albums would knock me out till Tuesday that's how this one girl just taking it like planning on my elbow anyway\nSo the main event is McGregor and some Russian guy\nAnd um I I didn't have a dog in the fight I guess I ... it it's I Would normally really catch the Russians McGregor is the Irish in these kind of ... yeah I didn't I just wanted a good fight so I'm ... column regret I call them a great hunter camaraderie or hear 'em loses he gets choked out\nLike you could tell you the whole fight he's losing the other guy was dominating and then it gives them a the sergeants slaughter sleeper hold and perhaps out and then all hell breaks loose so apparently again I'm not a big er and then may UFC fan but apparently the lead up to fight was pretty severe like McGregor was mocking this dude\nThe ages of religion is family he through like a chair to their boss I don't know it's a Dali and it broke all the glass yeah yeah it's kind of like you know professional wrestling kind of stuff you know you're right but the Russian do didn't take it that way and he went he jumped over the ... gone\nOut of the act of gone into the crowd and started fighting one McGregor trading partners like he went off in this huge crowd in this huge arena and then people jumped all the security goes out to him which we know scaring the building that people start jumping in the octagon a beating up on McGregor\nIt was it was insane just it was way better than the fight yeah that but I thought it would make sales and get a show about what I mean that's all you missed out of the doubt as if I was kind of boring as far as I'm concerned because it was mostly\nUm the the Russian do sitting on the Greg around the corner and just you know like wearing them down yeah I'm into that until the sergeants laughter sleeper hold and then it was over all the excitement was post fight and it's a big controversy that the gaming commission is holding their purses they're not getting their checks whatever um but I\nI was like fearful for the people in the stands because\nSo you've got counter Geiger who's\nConnor Conor McGregor who's calling McGregor and just making them up or you Conor McGregor brother who's from Ireland has all these Irish fans in there and they're drunk and they're rowdy in there and then the Russian guys got all the Russian fans in the arena and they're drunk and they're rowdy\nSo once once the fight leaves the octagon you know there's going to be fighting the stance because these two guys just beat each other up there to respect of countries don't like each other\nAnd I was I was literally fearful for\nThe people in the stands and it reminded me of something that I went to I went to the Riddick Bowe go a lot of fight in Madison Square garden years ago do you have this queued up or do so it's a lot of who is like polish in and Riddick Bowe who's an American brother it's similar situation they fight\nThe fights over in chaos starts raining down in Madison Square garden\n[noise] [laughter]\n\n[laughter] [noise]\n\nThat's\nEnough La Guardia so that's why it was well I Can't believe how long ago this was before I moved to Atlanta July eleventh Nineteen Ninety six Madison Square garden so girl I I went to college with worked for Madison Square garden got us these great tickets me and my buddy raven were big boxing fans is fantastic gray fight and then\nOuter chaos\nAnd I'm like eight rose man I'm exaggerating I'm within twenty rows of the ring okay you know I mean it was good really good like she worked for the arena so there were ... but now it wasn't that close yeah I'd be but I was close I wasn't in the upper decks\nAnd despite spills out and you've got\nThese these polish do in the stands and you've got the brothers in the stands and they it's it's\nAll all out\nMay lay in the state like west side story west side story basically it was unbelievable and I\nFear for my life literally I'm I'm like I I you know if I get into fight I've gotten into fights before one on one but I don't enjoy but if it's a part of life right may lays or not riots or not a part of my life\nSo I was with my buddy raven who's six foot seven black dude and Sherry who is the girl that got us the tickets who's about four foot eight white girl and I and\nI left that [laughter] I've I've got out of that I feel like rain right out of mess Madison Square garden I mean I went out side the arena I was like I Am not getting stuck in this and this is before cell phones\nAnd I was like I just met raven back at his house in Brooklyn I was like I I'm not even waiting for him to get up so I literally\nFeared for my life at that ... a lot of fight after the fight have you ever feared for your life in a situation where something similar happened in Atlanta this weekend where\nThere was a a concert in someone thought they heard shots fired and the whole crowd just ran out\nSome of those people absolutely feared
