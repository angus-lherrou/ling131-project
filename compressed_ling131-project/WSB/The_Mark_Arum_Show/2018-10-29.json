so if you change your diet\nAnd you get on a good diet many times to blood flow spinner and\nA good example is this when I donate blood I uh I put my like my arm out there and I donate blood and the comes out about twice as fast as the other people in the room\nAnd I'll tell them they all tell the taxpayer say listen keep an eye on me I I I come out of my my my bag fill up pretty quickly ... you're talking about and I'll be like hello take a look and they're like wow that's really amazing so when you have a good diet your blood is thinner naturally\nFlows through the arteries and veins more effectively so that's why if you go down a plant based diet you're going to cut out the saturated fats in the meat and dairy products which actually clumps of red blood cells together and prevent you from carrying oxygen so you get tired\nAnd a good example of this is go out and have a eat the way I tell you do for a week or two how about that a lot of fruits vegetables nothing seeds Dr Joe super ... central source nitric oxide if you want circulatory help\nAnd then after about a week or to go out and have a couple of spices the pepperoni\nCheese pizza what's gonna happen you'll fall

lot of it has to do your circulation because if you're not having good circulation you're not carrying oxygen you get hired so I'm not saying you could replace your blood thinner with a plant based diet but chances are if you do go to a plant based diet you might not need the blood thinner\nSeem either some ethical play there so yeah I've seen it many many times with patients on a perfect example is myself included because the blood flow so much so much easier through my ... [noise]\nSo I'm not a big fan of of genetically modified foods corn and soybean the big ones um those there's a lot of other genetically modified foods are but the corn and soy the big ones because those are the ones that are in so many different products so let's try to avoid it if we can you don't want to get to lose\nIf I'm wrong camera so I I like to you for men and a lot of you know but if I'm right which I Am then you'll say maybe I should listen to everything Dr Joe says you're probably right about that\nI think I'm a little bit about uh oil is cause I cover a little bit about this awhile ago a vegetable oils are promoted to the public health officials medical establishment dieticians oh you got to do those ... those those are piling on saturated fat guy to do the vegetable oils\n[noise] not happy with that\nIf you duties oils that are high and omega ... fatty acids omega ... fatty acids in large amounts cause inflammation in a perfect world you should have won omega ... fatty acid to one omega three fatty acid in your diet Americans have twenty twenty five omega six is to want to make it three in many cases\nAnd so what's happening is you have this inflammatory reaction peanut oil\nSafflower oil sunflower oil canola oil corn oil soybean oil\nAnd the problem is that a lot of these oils oxidized they go rancid very easily and when they go rancid they can get into the blood system in irritate the lining of the blood vessel walls and kind of talked about that a little earlier\nAnd that can be very harmful to your brain and your heart so most processed foods contain one or more of these oils and you should only\nCook with avocado oil coconut oil or olive oil and if you'd stocks to smoke if the oil starts to smoke I guess what it starting on rented it don't oxidized so never ever let your oil get that hot that it's actually starting to smoke\nIt's an increase your brain productivity and and capacity you might want to add to mark\nThe oil's mix it well\nAnd the tumor is a wonderful antioxidant and prevents a lot of oxidation docks oxidation Iran city\nSo that's a neat little trick you can do it just takes him to work an added to your cooking oils\nAnd it'll change shouldn't change the flavor much at all and I think it'll be pretty happy with that little trick there see it's all about tricks and that's why I created super greens and essential source I had to come up with an easy quick inexpensive way to get massive doses of antioxidants and nutrients into my patients\nIn Athens if so we have an amazing opportunity for you were

large\nAnd it's that sort of a five year right now\nI Know in the news broke over the weekend um they they said that the crime scene was just terrific inside and it's going to take a long time to to you know a map out exactly what happened um is is the building still closes the investigation still going on in the synagogue\nAbsolutely FBI agents here now\nThey lead the investigation or they've been coming and going very subtly very quietly in and out of the building the building itself is still roped off by police tape\nA and there is still a law enforcement presence here but nobody seems to want to bust the rules here everybody just seems to want to come to pay their respects requires some very cheerfully isn't it and that sort of move on last night there was a vigil at the soldiers and sailors memorial hall of the University of Pittsburgh campus a that was a huge affair or will it\nTwenty twenty five hundred people they packed the building the rafters and another but this mark\nIt was on hold\nAnd another several hundred people were out on the lawn in front listening to the central on speakers from from from the building and uh it's a one lady said that you know at one point everybody wants to put up their brothers because it really started coming down but nobody she said nobody left\nYeah I notice that the er at Longoria I don't know if you watch football yesterday now but at the Steelers game there was a lot of signs and the crowd showing support yogurt strongly stand with Pittsburgh um sadly pie you you've covered a number of of uh you know really tragic\nNews stories in your in your long career um Pittsburgh as a whole um that you know we we you know they seem salty there are people they seem\nLike a group that that can't that you can bend it but you can break 'em ... once you got to Pittsburgh what was what was the ... just to you know just getting into the city and then how's the city has a whole reacting not just the area around the synagogue\nEvery where I've gone people know what happened it's not like you know people just didn't turn on the TV everybody knows everybody says what a terrible tragedy everybody says they everybody says I never thought it would happen here this this is something that happens someplace else you know this is not as big a ton of Atlanta it's\nA it's a cosmopolitan town but it's nowhere near as big as bad as so they feel this sort of small towns thing and they say that they're just they're shocked that had happened here [noise] and yet\nEverybody I I met him and he really catch the sentiment right everybody on that was like we're Pittsburgh strong people knock us down but we'll get up and look it up as one and it will move on\nHere certainly I don't know if you know now maybe you can you can check around in in your reporting\nSo this allegedly happened during a race or a baby naming ceremony at the synagogue so I was very surprised when the victimless came out and it was all you know people north of fifty years old\nAnd I was very happy that there were no children that were killed do we know if if that is true if there was a baby named ceremony and do we know why ah thankfully none of the victims none of that that killed or injured work kids because normally there'd be a lot of kids in a ceremony like that\n[noise] you know mark actually there were three services going on here there are three different congregations that a beach here at the tree of life Senate got the building itself there is the tree of life congregation to others uh\nAt one of the conservative\nOne is worth of docs a services going on watch all of a ... at that time uh and so the debt\nBelong to each of these congregations are there was a baby naming ceremony that was scheduled I Believe for ten o'clock the shooting started a before that at about nine fifty for nine fifty five but the first started with one calls came in and so what I was told by the FBI is that there were no children who are hurt they could\nSay if there were any children present it at this point we just don't know\nAll right P. combs joining us live in Pittsburgh you got up there so quickly Pete I appreciate your time on on this horrible horrible story do you know how long do you plan on staying up there\nYeah I think the president is coming tomorrow marks a so we'll be I'll be here tomorrow and I'll probably come to Atlanta and wants to I Hope\nI maybe would sort of my wife maybe we can check back with you tomorrow then if they if there's an update on story absolutely free she had as always be thanks buddy you buy meant taking their used W S P\n... live outside the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania which uh yeah that my my weekend was ah was going fine until that happened that that that hit me\nPretty hard um I I Want to do something here that I'm might seem a little weird yeah unorthodox um\nAs as you well know I'm I'm a Jewish man and um this uh I I can imagine longer if if you know something like this happened at a church of your combination that would be pretty hard and when we do um what what I Want to do here and I want to handle this I'm In a unique way and and\nHere here's how I Want to handle this and this might not work\nTo get any calls on this but if you are listening right now and and you are anti Semitic if if you don't like the Jewish people\n'cause obviously a lot of people out there that are like that I've experienced it uh for a lot of my life ... nothing as severe as as the shooting there in the synagogue but I I Want to have a a a civil conversation with people that don't like\nPeople have my my religion I I'm I'm not I'm just here to listen on and we can ask each other questions that it'll be a total civil conversation I just want to understand because maybe if if I Know why you hate us\nMaybe maybe we can fix why you hate us I just I don't understand it you could use a fake name you can change I don't care you know whatever but if you truly are are anti Semitic and and you think that a Jewish people are evil I truly want to hear from you and and understand I Want to understand you're thinking\nI Want to understand why you think that um that we are bad people uh it's that's the only way we're going to learn\nWe're not going to learn any way you know I can guess why you think um that my my religion is is evil and that people are evil so and I'm again I'm not going to attack you are not going to yell I I'm good I Want to listen to you I Want to know why you think that uh my people deserve to die\nOr if it's not that extreme why you just don't like is in general not saying all anti Semite they're going to go into synagogue in and kill eleven people but you know there there's ... there are a there's a segment of the population that just doesn't like us you and I just I Would like to know a better understanding of why\nAgain you can use a fake name I I'm not gonna you know yell at you and not going to argue with you I just want to hear you out and and and maybe by listening to you I can get a better understanding of of what's going on so um that being said\nFor all for eight seven to zero seven fifty one eight hundred
