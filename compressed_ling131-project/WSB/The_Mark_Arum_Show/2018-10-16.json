social experiment cause feet spring's even nicer than me oh yeah like that guy will say Hi to you know Hitler's nephew whatever he was so nice [laughter] so ... says Hi to this kid\nAnd gets nothing one yes never said nothing head down and you know he did he ... he was one who's had to walk and pizza hey good morning\n... nothing he at least make icon nothing can you hear I don't\nI Know I'm going to tell you how he I I I Know he hears or at least you can speak so I was like what a great social experiment am relieved like\nThe kid just doesn't hate me right like he didn't even acknowledge ... can be friends maybe he doesn't like people like I Do well but ... says how do you I Would have you know you don't go out of your wait it out you know acknowledge people what am I said I guess someone says Hi you say I so I was like wow that's kind of amazing that\nThis kid disc Pete's sakes no one doesn't acknowledge Pete's breaks he's the he's Santa Claus he's the greatest guy in the world\nSo we watched by the same thing I'm like wow where and I can't tell springs is you know I Can't be like did you did you notice that you know 'cause I'm like a I was so wrapped up last thing I Want to get out of it I talked to him tomorrow about it okay and uh 'cause again I don't I mean who knows\nBut so that was around nine and I just stick around to tend to do an interview and as I'm leaving the kids in the hall again and someone comes around the corner and like cut them off or whatever\nAnd you are and the person who was like oh excuse me he's like oh no problem so the kids can talk okay and I think you'll hear yeah still today there's two developments on this on this a social experiment he disc Pete's springs and I I heard him say no problem to someone when they said excuse me when they almost bumped him at all\nI've I've found this to be prevalent with millennials yeah I ... and again I don't want to stereotype them but I guess I Am um there's there's other people there's like a sales assistant girl and she's she's pretty yup then she'll at least say Hi if you like force it you got\nTo go up in front of her and she yeah she but otherwise she's like ... doesn't want\nI think it's a a social well they're not even on their phone no it's because they come their phones so often now they don't have the ability to like look I that's why I don't even blame the millennials so to to for this um affliction because that they were brought up I mean there two years old and their parents gave them\nAnd I've had to play with their whole lives have been in front of screens little screens and they know that they don't have the social skills necessary to say Hi to the chubby Jewish traffic report in the morning when he says Hi do eight mornings in a row [laughter] take no one taught him\nOh hey say like I blame his upbringing is basically what I'm saying yeah I'm not ... not negligent not the case that will not acknowledge my existence flat or how long have you with your\nDad about four and a half year more than that really yeah I thought was more than that now so anyway ISIS added ... ... very shy girl I'm just keep to myself ... at the floor and go right to the audio and\nWhenever I Would say Hi to that like when you fill in the morning saying come on in Iraq I mean like you would acknowledge me you're not a ... you know whack job they just like ... and I again I like this this I Know there's some people on the spectrum that might have this issue\nBut not all the millennials in the build them are on the spectrum though they have this this thing some are where they weren't taught\nAnd maybe that's fine when you're in high school and you're in college you you don't have to be social but if you want a career like something his business community is is you need to be able to communicate\nIf if God Forbid them ever this kid's boss ceasefire day\nOne and I am a friend request don't believe me I have no idea is name what department of the work and I have no idea [laughter] he comes in and do the work you're yeah I see it every day\nSo he walks in comes in the first floor walk past the break them in the bathroom ... takes a right down the hall like he's going to come in here on the left like to go to ... office and count as his office and then he disappears into the ether I don't know what I'm On that at that time that that was like yeah\nAnd I get I'm twenty five at the most you know little guy um and just refuses where he he shot down in ... springs good morning\nThat's crazy [laughter] emitted by anything that's the guy I\nKnow you've got an attitude and I say it's like Mark here he looks at me as I don't even say good morning Dick I don't want to deal with that you can say on our restaurant\nYeah you can see his face and it's so funny you brought this up because this morning I had to take my daughter to school because they had doughnuts for dads you know walking through all these kids are coming up like hey lily hey Louis and she's ... I don't know if it was because she was with me but she was acting kind of stuck up she'd be like hey this is talk about\nAnd I was like hey these kids are like telling you how to be like that out and get some of them were like hey hey you're trying to get her attention and stuff I'm like don't let them do\nLike say Hi to one which I did say high but it's like no I like ... an attitude you know yeah ... added to your daughters the cool girl that's the thing I guess there there are seven kids up there and we're like not have been trying to legal\nWith you I was like oh come on my mom told me that it or is this a weekend when I was home because we drove past my old nursery school and my mom's like yeah the first day in your nursery school is two and a half years old and my mom's like ... you know all the parents are walking him into the first day and my mom's walk issues I got up and walk in and I was like\nNo no I'm good stay here [laughter] so I like it a very I I don't remember being like\nBears to my parents but it bears have having parents right like I remember like in only one yeah in a second grade like hey I pick me up down the street you know do we have it for the last two years so I get theirs they ever had these little picket ... that are not the restaurant but little quirks but this little son of a gun\nI'm going to say I'm going to try to take a picture of in the hallway tomorrow yeah just to show you I'm not going to post or anything but I Want to show you guys\nBut a atlas gotten better off the air to you but I was like wow All right so this guy is a jerk it's not just the cause I get it he might dislike me it happens I don't I never did anything knowingly did anything this kid may be hooked up with his mom and\nBuck head in the late nineties or something you know ... yeah exactly that guy broke my mom's heart you know maybe there's something like that\nBut I don't I never knowingly hurt this guy that I that I think I really hope that the back story\nThough did you know we're all yeah is literally it's like you've cooked up by more yeah more than ... his job purely just to get back mark you made out by ... for do yeah I never called [laughter]\nFor some weird reason his mom told him that yeah exactly which is a whole year level where we're looking at W. H. B. radio now that Saddam Hussein mark here [laughter] I met out there for twenty minutes and still does he got he said he called me the next day never heard\nThat would be actually a decent ended the story but I I was I was I felt vindicated this morning so here's what I Want it again I don't wanna stereotype all millennials but in this building at least\n... you know the ... girl yeah she was saying that the anybody have to jump in front of ... and to get her to acknowledge otherwise she'll just walk right past you don't even look you could stare at her she won't look I think it's a generational thing\nWhere where millennia again either they're like Alex Holsworth and rainy they're fantastic millennials oh God mating outgoing social like they're very they're often ... millennials but I think there's a segment of the population\nOf millennials that don't have that social skill set to you can't even they can't even say hello or good morning and I just want to know if that's just in our building or you're experiencing that in your work world as well for all for eight seven six zero seven fifty one eight hundred W.
