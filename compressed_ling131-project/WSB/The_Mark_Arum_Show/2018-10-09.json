serious this is before we get back to to what's going to happen to the paint him on the coast\nThe impacts on on Atlanta our weather here\nOut will we see anything and and if so when do you expect that to ...\nOr going to start getting some more uh showers overnight to tonight that are in directly related to the circulation around the storm but\nFor the most part of the impacts here we're going to see those increased tomorrow afternoon and especially tomorrow night into Thursday morning that's when we'll get to the most widespread rain and some are\nEmbedded thunder storms as well\nUh but it does look like a the strongest winds will stay a wealth of the south of Atlanta\nOr looks like the highest risk for power outages are looks to be south of the line from say a Athens to ah the Griffin area\nA south Georgia is looking at some very strong winds so uh fifty sixty miles an hour a day just to the south of ah making and a further south of that though actually get some at least ... to about Seventy four miles an hour which is a minimal hurricane force even in South Georgia\nSo governor deal to claim the state of emerging emergency that is mostly for the south\nGeorgia right yeah exactly a from a let's say for making the southward uh that's where most of the damage or the flooding\nAnd the power outages are going to be occurring\nNow the the ... show listener on it it's widely known the the most well heeled listener of talk radio everyone that listen to this show has a second home on the beach\nAnd the majority of them are in the Florida Panhandle um how worried should they be about property damage and and what Michael can do to the coastline down there\nYeah obviously depending on just how close to the beach they are but anywhere from a around Panama City uh all the way up through the Big Bend area that's the that's ground zero for this storm and I keep in mind the strongest winds expected to be up around a hundred and twenty five miles an hour\nThose hurt in an area that are only around a twenty two maybe fifty miles wide a bright where the guy comes to shore\nUp the remainder of the coastline will be looking at a wins that are more in line with say a severe thunderstorm that you might get a up here in the Atlanta area or during the summertime so it's not going to be widespread a constant a hurricane force winds\nBut it's going to be widespread enough especially given uh the warm up and the summer we've had here and started fall\nThere's still a lot of leaves on the trees and uh so the wind is going to be able to grab onto those uh and that's going to be part of the big problem\nW SP meteorologist Kirk mail is joining us here in the ... talking about hurricane Michael you know during Hurricane Florence ah they've added the Carolinas the biggest in hindsight the biggest problem ah was flooding it was not the highway and it was the flooding it was the constant rain the slow moving storm um this looks like a totally different stormed in that correct\nYeah it certainly is if there's any saving grace to this storm is expected to be a fast moving her and not stall out or the way Harvey did last year in Texas or the way of Florence did a last month so this one's expected to come ashore and then as a front in the upper level trough in the jet stream comes swinging\nAt it is expected to accelerate to the northeast and end up off the east coast or by the time we get into a probably a Thursday night or early friday morning\nGet three now any chance it goes up or down before it hits land yeah but ... yeah\nThere is a it's very common to have a fluctuations over the last twelve hours of the storm so it could end up ratcheting up a little bit and then I could go down if we're lucky or just before landfall but as of now\nCategory three hundred and twenty five mile an hour sustained winds is the call I'm\nFinishing up with the Kirk malice one final question Kirk as this thing makes landfall Longoria and I are going to hunker down on
