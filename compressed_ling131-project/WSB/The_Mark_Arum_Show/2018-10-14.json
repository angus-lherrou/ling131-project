what we're talking about today is hardly the arteries cholesterol buildup and what causes it and we had a caller called didn't want to get on the air how do you lower cholesterol well the easiest way to lower cholesterol is go to a more plant based diet\nSo you want to eat more fruits and vegetables nuts and seeds high fiber is going to be really important for you and somebody called in a on a stream that we're doing about a global out of what happens if you recall that are removed\nA that's a big issue so high fiber diet which is why plans a lot of vegetables a little bit of fruit not some nuts and seeds now I don't I Can't eat a lot of nuts and seeds because I gained weight and I have\nA patient of mine she had lung transplant and she had cystic fibrosis had lung transplant and her doctor told her to eat as much as she could to maintain her weight and didn't matter what it was in sugar and ice cream and cakes and cookies and when she first got under care with us she was eating all these foods she already had an autoimmune disease and she was sick\nAnd she was game maintaining her weight\nBut she was sick all the time and I said what if we can put on weight with healthy food as opposed to not healthy foods because I'll do whatever you say I Want to stay alive so we got to reading a lot more nuts nut butters almond butter cashew butter not peanut butter I'm not a big ... omega ... fatty acids which can cause inflammation\nAnd she's eating a lot of nuts she's eating a lot of ah the ... of fatty foods I got olives and other ... and she's putting on the weight and she came in the other day and she was so happy and she said my doctor said I've put on enough weight they don't have to put me on an IV\nAnd intravenous and uh she said I'm really excited and I said well I'm excited for you\nTo sew with nothing see just be careful 'cause they can build up or they can put your weight on now nuts and seeds and plants do not have cholesterol in cholesterol only comes from animal products\nSo if you're gonna have a Cato there's no cholesterol in there\n[noise] so how do you lower your cholesterol you go to more plant based diet if you don't know what to eat go to my website Dr Joe dot com and we have a SoundCloud and we have YouTube channel one is downloadable just audio the other one's audio and video and we have a show on there called so what can I eat and

what can I eat has absolutely no charge it's free\nAnd when you go to a plant based diet cholesterol usually drops and has been so much research on plant based diet and reversing heart attacks is that it's really indisputable same thing with type two diabetes and going to a high fiber diet that there's so much research now well documented peer reviewed research showing that if you do change your diet basically what we were talking about every day\nMany people with diabetes type to come off their medication or people in cholesterol normalized cholesterol levels and don't stop\nYour medication do this\nAnd then get it to the point you don't need medication that's what I always try to teach himself and that's all on the website Dr Joe dot com if you have a health care question give us a call for for for for Dr Joe and that number refer to my office is what I'm not on the air so we're talking today about hardly the arteries\nAnd what causes it and we talked about inflammation\nIf oils oxidized if they become rancid or they can oxidized an irritating it get into the into the ... cells the wall of the arteries and blood vessels and causing inflammatory reaction\nAnd when that inflammatory action a curse not called macro fascist come in ... when I Want to say it and they gobble up the oxidized oils\nAnd that that starts to create this inflamed area where the body starts laying down cholesterol to encapsulate the inflammation\nThe body is protecting itself it's very good\nSo the oxidized oils are caustic and they kill a lot of the macro phages which then when they die they can release the toxic chemicals they have inside and that kind of like a garbage truck\nAnd those talks the chemicals and are released again so you kinda get caught in this cycle and if the stable plaque if the the body lays down his cholesterol around it and it's stable that's great but if that cholesterol becomes loose and breaks off that's what we call a blood clot and once again we said earlier goes to the heart to heart attack goes to the brain it's a stroke\nSo you got problems there so if the plaque fails to in case the information that's when it starts to break off and cause problems the oil is still caustic it triggers blood in that area\nToo quietly and now we start building up this the the narrowing of the blood vessels\nAnd that's not a good thing so what caused this problem we talked about free radicals wetter free radicals come from how 'bout infections obvious infections but also sub clinical infections what's the sub clinical effects you're not aware of it\nIn fact I had a a root canal done many years ago and I've got the little metal rod up and my two ... you know in into my gum and if you take an extra you can see them as real clear\nBut the problem with
