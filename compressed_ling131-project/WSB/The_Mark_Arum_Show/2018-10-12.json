stuff with me on my Twitter and I think it's pretty interesting the or lawyers come or the seems to be suing over their own twenty sixteen settlement with Georgia over its lawsuit against that exact match law\nAnd what are the things that I mentioned if you miss it earlier is certainly that you are able to still vote whether or not they'll vote will count will be based on whether or not you can resolve the discrepancy\nBut a couple of data points that were shared with me is\nIf the data on voter registration applications fails to exactly match the data on the DDS or as I say databases applicants will be added to the rules as ending with no deadline to correct a mismatch well that's not technically true according to the story I've got the law requires to do it within twenty six months\nSuch registering ths will be able to present their Georgia's driver's license state id or other forms of appropriate id at the polling place to be able to cast a ballot which you can\nBut if there is not an exact match it will be a provisional ballot which may or may not get counted so the first person out there mark thanks for sharing that with me there's just a little more detail to it because you can't\nHave a legitimate ballot go through if you don't have a legitimate id at the time you show up at the poll and if you haven't fixed your application and you're showing a problem sure you can cast the ballot if you've got a state id or a driver's license but\nYou've got to make sure that you realize it's a provisional ballot which may or may not get counted at that point in time All right I Do want to get this very quickly a street or or basically I'm an essay by Thomas\nAh lights and actually this threat what I Want to get a no not that one I got a I've got to move into a different spot here we go is that we have from Dennis Prager and I thought it was interesting is especially as it relates to yesterday's talk about mob mentality and about violence and about ...\nLess thinking they can get away with calling\nKanye West all these horrible despicable terms and feel like it's okay and the reason it is is today we watch these leftist mob screaming profanity use at professors at deans they shut down conservative and pro Israel speakers on campuses\nThey routinely will we witness left wing or protest and block highways bridges scream in front of homes of conservative businesses and political leaders\nThey surround conservative tables at restaurants shouting and chanting it them stealing there's science dancing knocking basically a breaking the law or the minute you lay hands you're talking about not just a salt but battery\nConservatives don't do these things we don't close highways middle seventies that left wing politicians and we don't work to ban speakers at colleges we actually want to hear what these guys are going to say and the debate them\nSo why did leftist feeling titles of these things according to the author of this post Dennis Prager\nBecause they have thoroughly rejected middle class Judeo Christian values left is are the only source of their values leftist only believe that they know what's right but they believe they are also morally superior to all others\nThey put themselves on such a high moral plane they don't even consider themselves bound by the normal conventions of civics and decency leftist don't need such guidelines\nBecause to them the ends justify the means you do whatever it takes because in the end you're getting what is actually rights you know which right it's important and the fact that everyone

little surprised that they haven't the explosive plays aren't there in the running game but there are a lot of the Big Roads have come from wide receiver ... coming around me and that that's surprised me a little bit and I'm I'm a little surprised that with all the depths that they have\nI don't know who the go to guy is right now\n... correct I don't know you know last year it was clear it's ... ... has got the hungry and you got there getting me that\nThere are so many beep last level players on this team which is good but you don't quite have there's a guy yet and I I Do want to you know who's getting that ball on third and one\nAt five yeah when you got to have it or right now it's or third Nate when you got it for all yeah you\n... ... ah I thought a NATO would have a bigger role this year I I just thought you know as a safety valve is a guy that can move the chains thirty ... were you looking I thought he'd he'd have a bigger number it's and it's still\nA running team yeah I Do not has got to block yeah and he's the past catching ability is there but\nLike there's so many wide receiver option they have you don't need the tied in to go out there all that much\nToo many chefs in the kitchen is without can be good now excuse you know their Nate who are we going to who event\nAnd I met him who you're going to stop yeah so it's you know George is probably not going to have a receiver the gang of eight catch a hundred and fifty yard game\nA larger Holyfield ... probably not rushing from one nine yeah but if you went to when\nI'm all what does that all that matters that is all that matters Georgia's want 'em all so far six you know you can hear the game here on your home with the dogs uh tomorrow pre game at\nEleven thirty kick off at three thirty ...\nYou're

have had annoyed okay good I think that would be [laughter] ... down to New Orleans um Braves season wraps up your son trust park or for the are the two home games the first postseason games ever in Central Park history a versus the crowd I made it seemed watching it on TV that was a very rock is crowd I liked that what is the only light\nAirs on day was fantastic and it was it was nice to and you could say politically whoever you want to what's Tomahawk chopping chance but when\nIt gets going and the music doesn't need to you know push the crowd to do which is\nA very intimidating yeah in fact I'm I'm almost convinced that calls Walker juvenile walk Ricky patriotic says I don't doubt it and then he got a little he had like a momentary brain but for two batters or yeah it was walking the pitcher and then Robert ... saying hello playoff\nEventually cold atmosphere so I Would imagine you know the break the games I've been to a Central Park\nThey haven't been like that kind of atmosphere so I never get a sense of what it is like when the places rock and that place yeah definitely definitely rocket\nA that being said or the Braves lost the Dodgers Dodgers are better team I don't think there's any question here this was a I think you said a plane with house money for the for the Braves no one expected them to be in the playoffs yeah this was not\nOne of the Braves postseason under achievements yeah it was a proper achievement correct the Dodgers were better at one sixth grade divisions there the defending pennant winners\nThey have a three hundred and eighty million dollar payroll\nMillion dollar payroll and the Braves don't yeah and that's in the you know when you have when you pitch for rookies on a roll off series you're probably not going to win it's it was raised in\nThe future is bright for our Atlanta Braves I'm coming back next year the twenty Nineteen version of the Braves um I I Will talk about another show who who we might see in a Braves

don't know if he comes back because you've got so\nMany young pitcher yeah but I mean he was you're saying you're saying is that it was you know you're yeah ... yeah I'm ... the comeback yes he comes back we have another year and a half back mark ...\nYeah so Nick mark ... I'm sure the Braves would like to have him back I'm and I'm sure he'd like to be back with the Braves aren't gonna be able to pay a guy who had a career year\nOn this late in his you know well the Braves might pay for a guy who had a ... year but not at the yeah because the fans are hoping and this is where you want to see liberty media delivered yeah\nThe battery was built to raise revenue got ... Bryce Harper Mandy Machado are available yeah the Braves actually get into that chaos and dish up the money I don't think so I'd be shocked if they do yeah but I'm not ruling it out\nSee I Would think the brings would like to get market gets back but it seemed like the blue jays is going away over pay 'em there and the Braves you know they shouldn't pay him Eighteen million dollars a year for two years which is probably what he'll get on the market right now so I'm assuming unless ... says hey hometown discount I'll come back for nine mill I don't think he's in the race uniform next\nYear and if you want to win the pennant no sense in a market because he can be offensive yeah you know he's a he's a seven eight and six and a winning team he's not he's not a ... a lot of female say he's a ten well [laughter] probably through probably too much in the morning or yes there is not attend\nThe exactly um wrapping up a W sport's director Jay Black catching situation what what do we have going in ...\nFlowers is been resigned yeah he's coming back hurts his duty has not okay that's another place weren't\nYou know are you hearing what the real motto yeah that's kind of the other guy that gets bandied about and that would be all he had a great year and the Marlins you know they could use bras and yeah they're sellers so there's no the possibilities with his team are endless the question is does limited media come off the hook and say All right let's go forward here's some money to do it\nBy going forward to the rest of the baseball playoffs are ... what do you see shaken out World Series wise\nI think the astronauts said the red Sox let's let's hope I mean I mean I'm ... yeah no I'm In the uh the uh anyone but the red Sox the moon around her moment in I'm In the last ... or ... or the final game\nWas that a Tuesday night yes yeah I'm Kim real give us a ride and it was a little exciting but yeah\nAnyone but the red Sox right now\nI like to see after his brewers I liked the brewers a lot of funding to watch\n[noise] I think the John I'm going to say the Dodgers finally get their World Series yeah really I think they're going to the world series rematch I think the Dodgers get them All right for the first one since Nineteen eighty eight\nW sb ... director Jay Black we'll see you in ah Louisiana yes Saturday tomorrow\nPre game at eleven thirty kick off at three thirty for mental room I bring home a win\nAnd some great food stories do lack you know some of my fondest memories here in the twenty plus years I've worked at W.
