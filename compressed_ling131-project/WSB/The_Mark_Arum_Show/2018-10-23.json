S. B. T. V. W. S. B. radio all the radio stations here in the Atlanta Journal constitution get together and ask listeners and readers to provide aid to those in need and the latest was for Hurricane Matthew\nMichael ... hurricane Michael yeah right\nWe have one too many storms every year and this hurricane season we had to we had a Florence which really soaked the Carolinas we activated the convoy of care as you accurately described mark to um\nYou know invite all of our audiences to bring much needed supplies to people who are genuinely in need and\nWe thought that this series of storms in twenty eight team would be similar to the series of storms that happened in twenty seven to remember that\nHurricane Harvey just kind of took out Texas is a category five and the damage was so great we activated that convoy and we took\nWater which was what they really needed most into Texas and then Irma came through our area last year and what are my did to Georgia was it knocked our power out and I think the worst thing many of us had to deal with was you know probably having to take a shower in the dark for a couple of days yeah\nSo thinking okay well maybe this is what this is going to be this year in twenty Eighteen we send a convoy into the Carolinas after Florence Michael comes through and totally ravages southwest Georgia and it's one thing to say it ravaged a part of our state it's another thing to see\nHow devastating the damage\nAnd the destruction is you know they say they're just some things that you can't unseat that's it and the damage that and this happens to be one of the most economically disadvantaged ... it's ... it's real and it's the people who live there don't have much to do and what little they had now has gone\nConscious freshly joining us in Studio she I headed up the convoy of care for hurricane Michael which really a savagely destroyed a large chunk of south Georgia you're in here because not only did you help get all of the water supplies and tarps but you went down to south Georgia with the convoy and saw first hand\nThe devastation that was was happening there paint me a mental picture of of some of the things that you saw down there\nSo we took ten full tractor trailer into three communities in southwest Georgia and we we went down with state patrol escort blue lights took us the entire way that was just something and then when we roll into this neighborhood as small neighborhood\nAnd we were in a church parking lot at Mt Zion Baptist church right off of\nAlbany Albany, Georgia in okay boulevard and we pulled and to watch these truckers drive is one thing because not only do they go forward but to watch somebody back up an Eighteen wheeler backup three side by side in a church parking lot like like they're backing up you know our previous [laughter] quite\nAn as they're backing in the trucks and we I wrote down with mark went in our photographer who went down yesterday and there were a cross there's the paved parking lot at the church and then across the street from the church there's you know the grassy area where you have your overflow parking\nThere were hundreds of people some in wheelchairs people of all ages there were children there were you know thirty something adults there were senior citizens who had been impacted by the storm and they were just sort of standing in the parking lot all polite leak quietly lined\nUp they were waiting for you waiting for so that was my next question like how do you even you know a set up the delivery and who do you talk to down in South Georgia and say hey we're coming we tend tractor trailers full of stuff how does that work\nOn my partner and all of this you're inside the building has been mark when he channel to investigative reporter and he had been in Albany and in ... which is in ... County Georgia and then we went into Decatur county also with two trucks last night\nSo he'd established relation God he's covering the initial damage with a pastor Mt Zion Baptist church now we have a listener interviewer who works for Fulton County\nAnd is it a lot of Albany State University ... that's in the community that\nPart of town also seriously impact she connected with me and that's how we were between the two of us able to arrange the two distribution points in Albany we'd worked with the Georgia emergency management agency to identify where we were going to drop at their warehouse\nWhich was today story it and hopefully last me about that because it makes me cry okay I don't mean asked me about it because it makes me cry but it is just really really sad\nBut there may be something more that we we we asked folks\nOkay and and to be fair I thought there might be some uh some fatigue because the ...\nBut we were there is yeah gone to the well so many times with ... asking our listeners and viewers to to provide help accomplish care uh but this this one was our home state I mean this this hit us hard here in Georgia and again I'm Amazed by what the listeners did ten a tractor trailers what the folks down in South Georgia\nHow grateful were they when when you roll up with those those big rigs full of supplies for\nSome of them you saw they were like they they raised their hands in the air like yes you know the calvary is here help is on the way there were tears\nA there was a tremendous amount of emotion I talked to one lady I miss Thompson and I asked her how how her house was impacted by storm\nAnd she said they were very very scared and it blew through and that she'd already gotten a heart for her roof because there's a hole in her house right now but they did ripped off the windows in the back\nAnd only eighty five percent and eighty five of the big number but only they're still Fifteen Percent of the community there where we were yesterday who still do not have power\nElectricity so you don't have any power whatever's in your refrigerator is gone yeah absolutely and why we had a I mean it was a beautiful day yesterday weather wise and why it was nice and Chris and cool here when we got there it was hot yeah it is still feel like I'm more time out even though it's October in Georgia and\nIt's you know so that they don't have air conditioning the food's gone out of the fridge\nThey're really in desperate need\nYeah and we and you know a lot of the attention from the national media\nOn a hurricane Michael was focused on the the Gulf Coast and what happened in Mexico beach in the panhandle we didn't really get a lot of exposure what happened in South Georgia so I think it's very\nAdmirable that ah that's where the focus for this convoy of care went a ... what were some what were some of the supplies in those tent trucks like what did we exactly delivered down there\nWe delivered and hear things that you learn working on a project like this you can put twenty four pallets of material inside of fifty three foot tractor trailer at so you can do the math there with ten tractor trailers with twenty four pallets portraying hundred and forty there you go easy Matt so smart [laughter]\nSo we we had water and lots of bottled water and we had diapers and baby needs and whites and personal hygiene products and\nCleaning supplies or and with our partners at caring for others miss Shockley what she's able to do in her ministry and her non profit organization here she's got relationships with people that make really nice quotes okay and the seconds and whatnot are delivered to her so we were able to take\nClosing everything from Fox underwear the essential shirt or you know some suits business tighter I mean we do a little bit of everything for everyone and then of course the non perishable food items because like I said if you get nothing in your fridge and you need something that's going to spoil so we had a lot of peanut butter and crackers and things like\nThat what's the infrastructure roads open I mean are they making progress clearing trees and debris that kind of things that\nGet ... yes slowly but surely the community is able to function I mean the ... the roads are open you can travel some places you still need a police escort to get into or out of but by and large people can move around okay but I mean they're still dish the personal off the personal damage\nLocal stores like Wal the Walmart and in all ... those back open now are we\nI we didn't drive past it okay I didn't see it and when we stopped for food and yet we did stop at a couple of truck stops and yet we bought a lottery ticket so nice [laughter] but um uh by and large some things are ... are beginning to open up but it's very very\nSlow okay good news ... we can you hang out with more segments yes I ... a director of community affairs for a W.
