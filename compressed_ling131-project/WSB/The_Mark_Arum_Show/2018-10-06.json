mud\nI think we was like in mud and we grew and as the years later to see that uh you know it affected people when people have accepted our music and the stuff that will be brought to the culture is a blessing and one part of me that they have you with the axe was it is\nTwenty five years ago I'd be like you need it you know I'm a 'cause I was like I felt like\nThat something else you got to see the real you've got to smell it sometime I and I think it was able to music and one other thing I Will say that was I Would think that was special about ... who\nIs in a corporate is so many things up culture mhm so I had a kid that told me that he lo will because we used we talked about comic books hadn't karate ... movies of course that was a big element or somebody was like ah do your job play chess it made me feel ...\nAnd the coolest thing that happened to me I was doing his movie man with dying if is right and I needed this character\nCalled poison died and the only guy\nThat the studio wanted was Daniel ... who is a big star in an age he's he's big in America as well but he was super big in Asia\nAnd they were like you never could get you're not going to get I'm sure\nAs so I had a

inspect the decade to vote for the recording at two votes as it wasn't until we got the opportunity to get into a real studio and um\nAnd I got the you know the budget\nAnd the time to sit down and focus\nThat I took some of things that could have been demos a mixed face and I crafted them into songs\nAnd the funny thing about that is that uh\nI was like a monster like my hair was on comb my lips was super chat [laughter] yeah I made under ...
