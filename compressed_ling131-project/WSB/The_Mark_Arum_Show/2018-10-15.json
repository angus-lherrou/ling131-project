nutrition based and I said that's great so hopefully we can work together I didn't get their cards I should have and hopefully we can work together on that because I'd love to work with patients like myself I mean hey I'm living proof\nAnd when I teach post graduate classes I teach doctors or they get credit and every year doctors have to take so many hours in a post graduate classes and when I teach that I always have pictures of my eyes decides\nFor my eyes my right now and I show them that\nEven though you were told this is not reversible here's proof that it is and we talk about that with heart disease and a lot of conditions if you get a normally functioning nervous system uh normally functioning digestive system and good nutrition in most cases we get excellent results not all I can never guarantee anything I can never promise anything but I can tell you after thirty four years we do pretty good work\nAnd as chiropractors patients come to us for the main reason is pain neck pain back pain shoulder pain\nAnd my doctors are really good at getting rid of that stuff because on their patient to Garrett's their patient my producer here and so we want to make sure we're getting the best treatment possible\nBecause when I'm On the table I'm not I'm not Dr Joe anymore I'm Joe the patient and I want to make sure I'm getting the best care available in my doctors are pretty awesome at that so that's why if you want to make an appointment you go to my website Dr Joe dot com or\nWhere you can give us a call the number is eight for for for for Dr Joe if you have a question call that number now and we'll get you on the air if we can if you have a good question and if you want to make an appointment when I'm not on the air you can always dial that number eight for for for for Dr Joe I started keep taking some callers hear James how can make your day better\n[noise] hey how's it going I don't know so I I was\nListening to you you're talking about like lowering your like bad cholesterol lower cholesterol in general but where I started doing was a friend of mine is interesting is that my cholesterol cholesterol Amy Hi right a have a job on them that it can a firefighter\nFire ... or so of course you know we have a diet that doesn't help us All right\nSo I got myself a very clean diet but\nShe told me to start eating tons of aid and she said you about the next day\nOr do I have another checkup here shortly or how to check up shortly after her only get to do that and my numbers completely okay\nUh so I I I I Can't have a a a vegetarian diet or a lot of hype diet but they don't have a high a I Can't do it but to have that one of my diet for\nOkay though like what what's your what's your thoughts on behind that [noise]\nSo the question about eggs or question about protein I missed that\nOne of about ... because you're talking about the rich get richer and the ... diet okay but I mean like you know I I had tremendous result oh the longest time we were taught ex were bad and I it's hard for you to believe that when I had the results of\nThe truck but if you're gonna eat eggs make sure they're organic because you don't want to get the ... the pesticides hormones of steroids that they give you the ... the chickens um you want to make sure that they had a good diet because if they feed them rancid soybeans or rented a flak seeds you get the rent city into the egg and we don't want that\nSo if you're gonna eat eggs I recommend organic only and the fact that eating the eggs change your cholesterol levels hope that the reason we have no the bad cholesterol levels it could be a liver issue too and if you eating more plants more\nFiber that can help clean up the cold and clean not deliver so if you're going to eat eggs just make sure they're organic and like I said that that that's a a call and find what you're doing that's that's perfectly fine\nAnd if you need more protein you only need about eight percent of your total caloric intake protein anything beyond that\nHas to be filtered out through your liver and kidneys [noise] okay so that's why I liked that high high fiber high plant based diet which is going to be the best thing for you and you're going to do the eggs I I support that as long as you'd organic how 'bout that\n[noise] that sounds perfect I own my own chickens are kind of works out like they they I let them for free and if you\nActually you have you're raising your own you know what you're feeding them and you're not feeding them process commercial junk and you know rented soybeans and things like that so perfect\nBut I appreciate it\nYou know Jay for each call\nIf you have a question aid for for for for Dr Joe Joe how can make your day better\nUm I have a question about plant based burgers that sort of thing still basically some much process is that a different kind of process or we talked about process food\nAnd now I'm not a big fan of the process of vegetarian stepping off the air somebody called them with question on that too um if you're eating a lot of processed foods it's better than the non profit then then the process ... foods\nBut it's still a lot of salt they'll have soy beans in there they they used ... D soy protein which freeze up ... acid which five time going to cover that today and how that can create free radicals in your body\nSo a lot of the veggie meats I'm not a big total fan of a sudden less processing you're going to do the better\nYeah right I mean obviously you're trying to get away from just eating uh Bush everyday\nExactly you know and that and and and it took a transition what what most people do is they'll transitioned into the process veggie meats and if he can meats and that's great and then they'll say I don't feel good when I eat those what if I just ate light or what if I just had more fruits and vegetables oh gosh I Do feel better that and then you transition out of that so\nIt's kinda like a rite of passage when most people change your diet so as long as you know there's an end game to it you're fine\nOkay they show which I call folks have a question for for for for Dr Joe my website Dr Joe dot com on their over a thousand hours a podcast you can also ordered\nSupplements please if you're going to do nothing else at least to the super crazy essential source but the nitric oxide for circulation most of us at the fishing it'd be complex adrenal support\nProbiotics very important as for your immune system all that's on the website Dr Joe dot com and you can call the office and he for for for for Dr Joe and make an appointment when I'm not on the air officers in Marietta Duluth and Stockbridge now what are you going to be right back [noise] let's\nSee it up for Special Olympics Georgia and they're twenty six thousand athletes\nTo thousand Eighteenth on the golf classic It's Tuesday October thirtieth Eighteen holes at the core just sitting down creek in Roswell\nFood prices styling auction proceeds go we're sending our Olympians taking in competition grab your for some and sign up for right now as Special Olympics G.

years\nDid you really need to do or what we all know what I Want\nTo hear about this what ... ... let's hear trucks work is your story first yeah when I when I decided to get into radio and I went back to school like twelve years ago\nUh the only job I could get was working in shipping receiving it fears in Missoula, Montana and I worked that I work with all the way like a warehouse or yeah it was ... yeah it was a big warehouse I did was on box stuff\nAnd get it put out for the uh for customers out on the floor or whatever has worked for shipping or seen Missoula, Montana yep and then I finally worked my way I work there long enough I worked up into appliances which is a sweet gig 'cause that was all and then you're in the store yes they let me in the store and you work on commission yeah he had a lot I mean a lot of money working here's a couple\nOf years ago I went to the Sears up in Cumberland and I walked in and it was right after I got on TV and um and I walk in\nAnd this guy comes up his hey what's going on as I Do you work on commission he goes yes I'm like I you're lucky man I Need a fridge raider oh why a dishwasher I Need a washing machine and I ... was for that yeah he's like I'm I'm going home at nine AM today oh yeah yeah I made\nThat guy's native year yeah because he must he was so happy he's like yeah are you serious especially refrigerators they were big commission yeah you want to sell all my wife is in one shot nice yeah this guy so you worked at a at Sears as well in a yeah in Austin, Texas in the state yeah so what did you do it's years our small ticket tools\n[laughter] oh yeah basically ... old yeah there are some gas and already who came in and said hey I needed a need to finish the ranch or do I need a Philippe said yeah I ... it was like all the big items like the generator ... lawn mowers and trains are they wouldn't let you touch those well you weren't really supposed to go over there and it was all there is a territory was frowned\nUpon kind of thing in our area to get yeah but\nIf the thing was the loophole was somebody went over there and there was nobody there were they were all days\n... asked me like hey I Want to go by that law and more\nCan you get it for me to ... and you could do it where they kind of like you know was in high schools no no no I was already graduated it was I was I had gotten a job and radio and it was part time and I've worked with that at a liquor store and at the radio station\nAnd see what was that was the outfit when you guys worked at Sears just khaki you have him in a blue shirt ad wherever you're as mine was a green shirt but now yeah because you were ...\nYeah as a red green and red Yahoo mall ticket ... they they changed green to like lawn and garden but the guys want to wear ... and a Deborah ... or ... or ... years yeah\nWhat did you do there Laurie jewel yeah he's\nRight when he gradually I had to lay down and I moved up here and I didn't know anybody to know anything about the city and I just needed a job and the easiest thing I could do is retail\nSo I just walked in there and you know they they weren't happy friendly Ron Wyden pick me happy from Harold is you know the same thing and worked on commission sold a lot of jewelry I mean I made enough money there that I put a down payment on my house no\nKid that we see time very yeah did you get hourly as well as his yeah really and condition or what were you making then you know like our I\nDon't remember now is more focused on the condition 'cause you could check how much you were making throughout the day tea can log in and see how much you've already made and you're like All right when they get to this part and then it gets our slack\nNo kidding yeah yeah that's why he's the guy said eight to nine o'clock yeah yeah no kidding oh\nThat's fantastic yeah so All right I Am so uh this is not all but I'm very intrigued\nBy this um so ... uh let's say long ago where he goes in to buy his wife a hundred dollar pair earrings from the Sears jewelry counter yeah what what is dead green making on that purchase\n... usually say hey I Want to look at this and then I'm like yeah these are nice but\nYeah I don't understand up yelling I get that but what if he does by a hundred dollars ... would you mind it\nI think it was like ten percent hell\nIt's whether I was so good to have all the commissions were anywhere from five to like eleven percent so I buy a nine dollar ranch from\nLittle ticket Longoria and you get nine bucks a a Ninety cents yeah\nOn top of your eye so I'm really stocking stuffer as were great I always go over there and save some extra dollars you sell a bunch of little kids to moms that are just want to fill stock all on a ... going up selling on ...\nBut I don't know any of the schools was the best that I don't endorse that but [laughter] yeah no idea they were like oh yeah that I Need at that one hundred and Nineteen\nYeah sockets that that was funny so this has nothing to do its ears but if you go in and this happened to me the other day I Will abide by a label maker and studies maybe I don't know what it was called but studies will show if there's three separate items that she bought a middle price wondering expensive one\nEver owned by the middle one ... because no one wants to cheap one\nAnd you're like well how much better could the expensive one being ugly be so like seriously like retail outfits do this they know they price it accordingly so they're like if we need to move on to this one in the middle because people will say well I don't want the best that I don't want the worse so I'll get the middle and and they worked\nOn me to label maker I have no I I didn't know anything about the other lady on my I'll take the one in the middle purposely enough\nMayans is the way they had refrigerators cheapest to most expensive no matter where everything was that oh we had to do is moving into the middle of two and a half files and then just the price and it was south that was where he went ... everybody avoided the outside I\nEverybody went to the middle so when you finally needed like we really got to get rid of their for dirt actually moved to the middle and adjusted price accordingly and it was ... we did all the time that's\nUnbelievable now I Know I was going out of business I heard you\nKnow [laughter]\nLike that doesn't say much for years hiring policy you three guys worked there do you remember what your hourly was\n[noise] I Can't remember I was working three jobs at the time so I couldn't tell you yeah I I didn't have a series in my town\nBut I remember getting the catalog every year oh yeah the big thick one and my dad's not a tool guy so I I don't actually every member going to a Sears very often I couldn't even tell you where where everyone was bullet Sears meant a lot to me was when I was in college because the first credit card ever got was this year's card\nAnd I remember when it came in the mail out is like brand new shiny I never had a credit card five hundred dollar limit them like this is the greatest day in my life so it's so through college\nIf I needed something I bought it at Sears\nLiterally clothes books what appliances\nUm utensils whatever TVs in multi beside good TV there but that was my lifeline\nWas my fears credit card and they to this day make the best they had the best T shirt ever it was um um I think it was called Thomas Henry they were extra large extra long 'cause I got along torso\nAnd I still wear in to these to this day twenty five years later they stopped that the company that made them one out of business so they are not available anymore I'm always looking on ... Amazon foreign cars they last five years and they're still comfortable in their perfect size\nSo to me my my uh best memory of ... years was in college that first credit card I stayed at the for three hours I'm like I'm an adult now this is great like it's so beautiful this and this was the last four years\nNow my ... I still have the Sears car but now it's like your MasterCard so I tried anywhere but at the time so if I had a hot date right to ... let me get those genes that damn vast\nAnd you know it was like the first Wal Mart you could almost get anything pretty money yeah yeah he was so that was that was some great I had no idea you guys all through work there I Want to talk about fears is a declare declaration of bankruptcy and uh and your memories of of an iconic brand new United States\nOr which which may no longer exist it means a lot to a lot of people still talk about that the catalogue the credit cards Longoria little tool guy what did they call you a little longer to get small alumni area [laughter] we might have a new nickname\nSmall ticket Longoria for all for eight seven six zero seven fifty one eight hundred ws we talk on Twitter and Instagram at mark ... says movie Monday so long ago is playing a movie soundtrack throughout the show at the end of the show if you get with soundtrack it is you don't win a prize pack guy hang tight we'll be right back on WSBIU [noise]\n\nSeven twenty the gory carrier ws me twenty four hour trapped you know travel advisory look at why the ws ... downtown at Pleasantville road exit Ninety big looks like five ...\nOnly the ... and getting by right now heavy delays building in the area also travel advisory Fulton County pie for highways southbound\nAddress in dry WSBIU ... let me know all links are blocked there and crash reporting don't tell you that you're Seventy five eighty five south down at cordless reacted to forty nine a\nRightly blocked in the area this report Russia by marathon wherever the American robe takes you Merrick marathon can make the trip better when I Do for a trip some more go to miles that meeting dot com to find out how mirror thought the only the American spirit I'm Mike shields W.
