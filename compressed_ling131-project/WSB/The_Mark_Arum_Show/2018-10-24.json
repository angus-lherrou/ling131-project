four hour and use the center\nPackages that within two two former Democratic presidents a number of Obama era officials and the New York offices have CNN they contained what appeared to be pipe bombs and the feds say they may not be the only one said BCS Aaron ...\nSaid there may be more devices in the pipeline the bomb squads have alerted law enforcement partners about the similarities among the six devices because they want everyone to know what to look for the devices arrived in ordinary manila envelopes the package delivered the CNN also included a smaller envelope with white powder\nEarlier today President Trump condemned the incidents but he stopped short of calling them an act of terrorism Dario all their ABC News\nAlso died as a result of one of the packages he was convicted of sending\nA bomb was intercepted en rendered safe as they say in a bomb tech parlance in downtown Atlanta at the eleventh circuit building and another one intercepted after a miraculous sequence of events at the end up ... pi headquarters in Jacksonville\nFlorida Roy moody was executed earlier this year in his early eighties as the oldest man uh put to death in the United states or since the\nDeath penalty will a re instituted a in this country\nAnd obviously you follow the Eric Robert Rudolph case\nYounger years are humbled at a channel to to break the story of house arrest and I spent a lot of time wandering through I remember the mountains of western North Carolina uh on the trail of Rudolf with the law enforcement coalition that was hunting I'm\nSo with years of experience in dealing with with the bomb in cases like this any initial reactions to what we learned today about uh about the suspicious packages that were sent\nYeah you know the forensic ability of a\nBomb techs and federal authorities and and state and local authorities also ah to piece together\nWhere are the components of a bomb package come from a well blow your mind you know I mean\nTo be able to tell from uh the marks on nails for instance if it's a bomb package where males were used to increase the shrapnel effect uh not only what factory they came from but what tool bench they came from\nAnd what time on wet day wow uh they came from a be able to track or what kind of powder or was used if powder or was used\nUm I remember in the ... case\nUh one of the key breaks came when they turned his wife a as a cooperating witness and ah to her testimony in cooperation they were able to a link a piece of paper that came out of one of the bomb packages to a\nA copying machine and store in Kentucky\nWow a and that was a couple of decades ago yeah it was so mad at her yeah right how far they have come since but also\nThe ah ah the Rudolph a case and you know one thing that it had in in common with the moody case frankly was the arrogance of the bomber or you know\nAnd ... ... one of the best lawyers and Georgia was Roy Moody's court appointed a defense lawyer the guy was accused of attacking the federal judicial system when that same system is trying and he had to have a top flight lawyer\nA and he wants commented on how a a a a male bomber ... is not a face killer you know they they kill from anonymous distance and if you think about\nHow much hate it takes a to assemble a bomb package or and get it delivered by the mail or some other means of delivery a ... for that\nUh anonymous type of ah expression of hate ... a ... it's a it's a horrible thing\nAbout mark Winnie from channel to joining us in Studio I'm I'm Glad I'm Glad you were able to to impart some wisdom on on the breaking news today but the real reason I Want you to committees the story we're going to see tomorrow night on channel two and I'm I'm sad that Chuck's gone today because truck from whitefish in Montana\nUm might be involved in in this case for perhaps um Montana license plates\nCosting Georgia taxpayers' money basically what exactly is going on here mark\nSo if you look at the next McLaren or Lamborghini\nOr Ferrari yes that passage which do you have visited for our airline but I've got the land but yeah I think that as soon as\nYou in ... cat on a highway or street across metro Atlanta significant chance it could have a Montana tag on it uh and it is often because\nAh in Montana and they don't have\nThe kind of sales tax in ... tax sure\nUh that we have here and so you can save big money by going to Montana are going to\nA service and there's a cottage industry of outfits that have sprung up to service these kinds of arrangements you create what's called an El Al see a limited liability company\nA and it doesn't have to that company doesn't have to make anything that have to sell anything it exists basically as a pass through\nThe title your car and under Montana law as it's been explained to us and nobody seems to be disputing us there's it's it's legal\nQuestion is is it legal in Georgia if you lived here thirty days\nAnd not register your car in Georgia in Georgia yeah so I think a lot of folks and this is causing shockwaves\nInside the exotic car community already from what I'm told by an expert in that realm\nAs word of the investigation by the department of revenue and perhaps the investigation we've been doing has spread by word of mouth and digital media at in that tight knit community\nSo for example um because a lot recently changed uh basically if you buy a new car now you're paying most of the tax up front\nSo that that's that's that changed because he used to be the yearly ad alarming represented whatever 'cause I went through that recent when a car so let's say I'm Deborah green is buying a five hundred thousand dollar Lamborghini if she was buying it in Georgia getting titled through Georgia a registered in Georgia what what\nKind of a tax bill paying when she\nHeard I think that your official actually told me I have million dollar limbo would be about thirty five thousand dollars\nSo that thirty five thousand dollars they should be into the Georgia tax coffers but it's not because dead green is going to whitefish in Montana and having a car registered there\nThat would be the contention of the Georgia department of revenue special investigations unit now this has been apparently of some concern in\nStates across the country that have tax structure is more like Georgia is a more which is the vast majority of states but my understanding is this is the first time that law enforcement has\nActed on this scale this aggressively to say hey guess what\nYou're breaking the law here yeah nobody has been charged yet but there is a criminal investigation underway involving a couple of folks who we're told have between them purchased dozens\nOf of exotic cars a\nThat's a good that's a ... uh yeah yeah that is that\nWell so George revenue guy told me that Georgia literally loses million wow plural a year to this phenomenon\nThat's that's ... and you know it's like he told me said look you know our roads still got to be paid for them you know\nThe law enforcement officers to patrol those roads\nStill got to be paid a there are costs that the rest of us bear sure you know now\nThey exotic car folks I think it might have a you know they might have a different argument that might look at it uh definitely I think some of them do although one guy that we talked to one of the people at the focus of this investigation said\nYeah I checked with lawyers here in Montana you know uh in in the course of doing this I thought I was legal if the department of revenue is saying ah I Can't do this I'm going to change\nYou know I'll I'll comply interesting art so to the moral of the story of what talk we watch it on channel two actually news channel to actually news at six part one and then we have a follow up our planning for friday the you actually went to Montana to go to Montana\nWe talked to the officials up there they're very cooperative uh we went to one of the firms that involved not as quiet and no doubt to another one that does this do they gave us an inside look let us in the door [noise]\nUh and that's what we're trying to bring on friday great work as always mark a
