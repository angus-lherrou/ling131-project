you have a\nA loan on the home you're buying the lender is going to require that you buy a title policy and owners policy also sometimes known as simultaneous issue protects your financial interests in the event that there's ever a successful challenge to your legal ownership of property\nAnd it happens very rarely which is why the premium for owners title is so cheap but if it ever happens\nIt

if you co signed for an apartment lease does that show up on your credit report\nNo only if the person you co signed for defaults then you were hating life like you cannot imagine I Want to make sure

ahead and see if you've got a credit score established if it's a good one\nGo ahead and apply for a credit card and that way the car loan will have leverage just what you want it\nOr enjoy wants to

critical but you look at the big picture and say wait a second we're not even getting to the policies you just trying to stop a guy from being president\nWell yeah I mean I'm interested in the ideas and I I really I'm grateful that Trump has said a lot of truth things out loud when nobody had the votes to do that you know are we we have a right to secure our borders and every trade deal we sign is not\nFair just because it's a trade deal like the other side she live up to its obligations just obvious things that nobody was saying and I'm I'll never stopped being grateful that she said those rise\nBut to me I've never been you know what we'll do a politician unlike some of them but but really it's about the idea of what's best for the country and my great frustration is that no one's even talking about it it's like ... capital get drunk in college while we playing along with us\nSo so I wasn't really as into politics then as I Am now a as you were when when Bork was up for yeah makes you will never forget it but here's the thing\nPeople didn't like his ideas they act like they didn't like what kind of feels like Martha Stewart ... that's such a good point and it was all it was a fun debate so you're angry and people aren't and it's not fair and that's fine and I you know do I think it's fine in the big picture a guy who was nominated they went out there is this is how I feel they didn't like the ... and somehow they manage to bore can\nGet it now they're going after him and saying okay he's got twenty five years of a really good track record and we have free time he

scenario he makes it on the court this was about ... the Supreme Court\nFive vote conservative Supreme Court this is about dealing jeopardizing our United States Supreme Court something that we were told in the past we should not be doing but this is what this is about so if they should if Kavanaugh should go on the court they want him to be damaged goods because they want any rulings that come from the court to be damaged\nAnd piled onto he's our president\nHe's not our president he's not with Jay he didn't get the majority of the vote the Russians stole the election this plays into ship a

like our president and win the popular vote and the Russians took out Facebook ads so what are we left with\nWe're left with one party that has a very clear picture of what it wants which has power as willing to do anything to get it and is openly among other things racist attacking an entire group of people based on their appearance the opposite of what mom Luther King spent his whole life

chance that may be getting as high as fifty three votes\nOn Kavanaugh if he you know if they stick to the terms of disagreement maybe courting a couple of Democrats so this is an important gambit by Mitch McConnell and he doesn't want to jump a jump the gun so here's the four day process number one you file culture\nWhich is where you move to end debate by that stay one\nBy rule that has to lay over for one day so that date to on day three whatever day that might be that close to petition the term of art in the Senate is it right but and it's available for a vote\nThat's the vote to cut off the filibuster and under the new uh\nProcedures and the Senate it only takes fifty one goes to end the filibuster on a Supreme Court nominees that's what happened last year with the of course and then if you have successfully voted to cut off debate invoked cloture on the cabinet nomination on day three than the opponents get thirty more hours to run out the string\nWhatever they want to do on the floor they want to come and debate they want to jump up and down and whatever they want to do they get thirty hours which triggers a confirmation vote sometime late in the day on day for so that's where I'm saying if this starts on Wednesday\nThe procedural vote would be friday and then the confirmation vote would be Saturday under what McConnell said yesterday that is this week\n[noise] okay chat a couple of things to move all the extras knows and you're ... where you've noticed\nIs Mitch McConnell have the type of relationship with Murkowski in college where he could just go up to her and say how close are you able to yes what do you need hey Jeff I saw you in Boston yesterday well what do you mean I'm trying to read between the lines on what happened to I don't get surprised again so I mean do do they talk like that isn't it really down to that\nThey do talk like that and and it comes down to the math and I've said this many times before the math is the math is the math you know had a lot of criticism by conservatives of Jeff Flake over the weekend they said oh you know he delayed the capital nomination let me flip the coin for just a minute had Jeff Flake not gotten to a yes in committee\nThey would never had a chance of getting to fifty one fifty votes level at fifty one votes and as I spelled out maybe as high as fifty three\nMurkowski and Collins said let's run the traps on this FBI report we might even be able to court a couple of Democrats and that will get us across the finish line potentially had Jeff Flake not done that they wouldn't have a chance to confirm Brett Kavanaugh because the Math Doesn't work the math is paramount in the Senate\n[noise] got ya so I Want you here flake yesterday and you know that he tends to go with who is with so he's hanging out a lot of Democrats lately and obviously doesn't have security in the halls and changed his vote it seems to take him at his word in Fifteen minutes so here's what he said yesterday in Boston cuts six\nThat does no good to have an investigation that just gives us more cover for example we are relieved to find out where we can find out [noise] or we have to realize that we may not be able to find out everything [laughter] are we gonna do some investigations\nAre we on route to a Folsom investigation especially with the president told the FBI to do yesterday Spanish go where it has to go just wrap it up\nWell that's going to be very unclear here not just in the past couple of all but says this was coming up here\nThat Lisa Murkowski has said that the FBI is doing the investigation and I'm going to wait and see what comes back I don't know what will come back now let me just throw you know a monkey wrench into the gear boxers here for about ... there is something that comes back in this report\nAnd it raises more questions and you know McConnell has been critical critical of the Democrats saying well you know I bet that they will come back in ... the goalpost it's very possible that he could have Republicans\nAre certainly Murkowski and Collins and say wait a minute this raised another question and we're not to not say yes yes Senator McConnell that is possible will that happen I don't know but again that's why the math is or if you don't have and here are the four senators were really employ Collins Murkowski on the Democratic side of the aisle Joe\nManchin of West Virginia Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota you need to get at least one of those for to get the fifty so what I just told you about a potential scenario with college or ...\nSaying you know I don't know what this has to be ... report means or this or you know satisfy my concerns here that could throw a monkey wrench into the system\n[noise] yeah possibly if it comes back but do you believe that we're debating on high school and college the end of all your years can you believe we're debating this\nIs it that's the remarkable thing here uh you know I mean ... but they keep in mind what the focus was in that hearing on Wednesday it was on here\nIt was on sophomore references and the high school yearbook even Kavanaugh said you know we're on barest by that your book it's like something on a fast times are rich not high his words\nA ... you know and even you know the ... the United states yesterday started talking about it you know he said he was a bit surprised at how much Kavanaugh talked about is like a beer\nOr you know I I'm going to give you some history here in Nineteen eighty nine George H W. Bush nominated\nFormer Republican Senator John tower to be defense secretary this was early on and Bush is a ... you know first year Nineteen eighty nine and the Senate defeated that nomination which is remarkable to defeat to nominate from their own party\nThere were allegations woman I think there were allegations that he wasn't conservative enough but the other issue was alcohol\nAnd so we've been there before now that was of course alcohol abuse alleged alcohol abuse on behalf senator tower when he was ... he was a welder Washington quantity I don't think I've seen it go all the way back to the high school and and what people were doing with alcohol and their high school and college\nNot only that she had programs we talked to the ... or ... or a A R guru of Capitol Hill Chad or your ... senior producer but not only that we're not even talking about Brett Kavanaugh in the nineties were in the next century two thousand which I've ever academy in Nineteen eighty [noise]\nSo ... always doing that day maybe who knows I\nYeah and here's the ears of art will say I went back and looked at you know before we were hearing these allegations he we're figuring out when Christine Blasey Ford when Brett Kavanaugh would have been at high school and then I kind of look back when I Need a hill worked at the ... you see with Clarence Thomas\nAnd so those allegations against a Thomas made by hill happened in the mid eighties and of course that hearing was in Nineteen Ninety One\nAnd so they were looking back somewhere in the neighborhood of seven to eight years so in other words and people said oh it's hard to remember and everything else in Nineteen Ninety One so the issues we're dealing with now happened several years even before\nThe hill Thomas stuff that's what makes this so remarkable I mean it's hard to believe that it in Nineteen Ninety One people are saying oh it's hard to put this together because it was so long ago the allegations were addressing now in twenty Eighteen happen even before the hill Thomas stuck\nSo the way I understand I talked to a couple of ... just today one on television went off\nAnd are they going to get back paper so if you go and talk to W. were Amir as these the Yale freshmen who said that she drank so much has remember a lot of it but now you go talk to you when you and the FBI and you're taking her testimony ask some questions\nDo you just going to hand over that to the Judiciary Committee and then I'm going to go talk to a maybe a Debbie forwards best friend okay fine a doctor for his best friend I go do that okay here's what she told me and I'm going to hear that over so they do all the interviews and follow some leads from those interviews but they don't make conclusions\nThey might even they might not even have a summary at the bottom of the page so then you're going to see Blumenthal said this is the worst thing ever read and you're going to see a Cassidy say I have no problem with this at all\nSo we're going to be back where we started\nVery possible but that's why if McConnell thinks he has the confidence of Murkowski ... Collins we're both\nThey'll pull the trigger on this because then you get you get to the fifty maybe fifty one vote it doesn't matter what what Blumenthal says uh and then it becomes a political question is this an issue\nWhere Republicans overplay their hand and it hurts them at virtually the terms or is it an issue that Democrats overplay their hand and it hurts them it virtually ended it or or or did it it ... off the base on the Democratic side\nOr did it Jennifer based on the Republican side that's what's what's unclear\nA that is the risk of doing this so close to the term elections one way or the other and\nAgain you know it is a political question uh you know it it says nothing in the constitution about what the process is to get there on a Supreme Court justice you just provide advice and consent you don't have to have a hearing I reported how they didn't even really have a modern confirmation hearing in the way we think of it if so Nineteen fifty five you didn't have\nHave the nominees even showing up just to listen to their hearing until the middle of last century\nUm you know so there's nothing that is that is by the book of how you have to do this the question is whether or not you have the votes on the Senate\nFive so through quick I just to recover recap we could be hearing as early as today the FBI is done which I'm sure Democrats will be up in arms if a then Mitch McConnell would make a move on cloture at which time we have to wait how many hours before we get to the point where you can have a vote\nMr Trump said the life of judge Kavanaugh was now in tatters moron Jamie's blog at W.

know I mean it's\nJust a little William Rehnquist a spelling test we're not out of there we confirmed Tim without knowing what he did in college and and\nUh who was it that said you know George Washington was nominated he will get the president and then and then immediately all these people all these Democrats went crazy and sort of picking apart George Washington's life and actually proved to point\nHere is ah what Donald Trump brought up yesterday on Kavanaugh and he wanted to talk about the historic trade deal and by the way he's not wrong he's not it's not hyperbole this is a huge trade deal the president brought home is going to affect wages is going to affect relations it's going to affect other trade deals down the line and it looks as though the Canadians caved\nIn the president's to go shooting brought him to that point\nYeah and and it just to go to the press conference that was it it was so delightful uh every politician no matter what would have just completely cave when reporters started demanding to talk about cabinet or\nNot President Trump he doesn't care he ... it ... it he just doesn't\nCare he's willing to uh pick those fights in say no I'm not answering your questions we're going to get through what I Want to talk about and then we'll talk about what you want to talk about and\nWe live Rose Garden he said this about cabinet I finally started to answer some questions and I think he's been remarkably measured unbelievably measure to this entire process cut three\nBut I can tell you I watch that hearing and I watched demand saying that he did have difficulty as a young man when spring the one question I didn't ask is how about the last Twenty years have you had difficulty last Twenty years 'cause nobody said anything bad about him and many many years\nHow about thirty five years and not no not Twenty years thirty five years\nYeah so so Republicans led by Trump and and Chuck Grassley really have handled this thing very nicely was one of the I think one of the you know basically Democrats put out or they bought a bunch of lottery tickets\nA and one of them was that a doctor Ford would go out there and Republicans would overstepped\nAnd they would make her look like a victim all over again and ... yeah exactly they they they were going to trash or Trump was going to send out a tweet about uh the way she looks or some crazy thing and it was going to like a cruise his wife yeah yeah\nAnd some some terrible thing was going to happen and it was going to crystallize the moment and it would go from being what it is now being some eighty twenty issue that you know Republicans are terrible\nRepublicans have done such a good job of taking her seriously and giving her all the space and all the time she needs to say what she she wanted to say obviously a you know we were talking about in the break you know I found that the testimony to be compelling\nOr I found a Kavanaugh's testimony to be compiling a and when you have you have that sort of situation all you can do is go to the other evidence but all the other evidence destroys your story but\nMichel who the prosecutor was hired by the Republican I'll give you that but she was ... she was not ever adjusting her delivery to the five minutes and in the end she said it's not he said she said because they she said didn't deliver in that we don't know where we don't know how she got home we know how she got there we don't know who invited her we don't know where it took place\nIt was weaker than he said she said but the thing about the Democrats are accusing\nOr this or this woman or being some sort of partisan because she's a Republican prosecutor\nI'm Sorry every prosecutor in this country ... you know there's not a federal probably every local prosecutor in this country is an elected prosecutor there there are the vast majority are either Democrats or Republicans and they are slaves to justice they do everything they can they are not joined us part is in ...\nThe vast majority of them aren't they they stand up for victims every single day and the idea that one of the talking points from these Democrats right now\nIs it oh she's a Republican ...\nYou may never see her that she looks like a part of an act\nIt is the her question was as as a profoundly like respectful and a pointed and and we wish you the only person in the whole place that that came off as ... as truly truly just wanting to get to the facts of the story did you the most trustworthy\nPerson in a in a way which I thought we weren't getting that she never even after bright capital question how do you know that it's him\nAnd and and and the fact ah the ... the fact that the Democrats on the committee were so upset that a Republican field at her\nTo ask the questions are just proves a whole nother gambit that they were going forward just they wanted to stay political they didn't want to go into effect based question I I Want\nYou to what Alan Dershowitz said about her who you're being deferential to\nShe was totally and completely incompetent in terms of asking cross examination question 'cause she has little experience for example the main issue now is whether or not she recognized Kavanaugh correctly she was never asked\nWhether how well she knew him how many times she encountered him before they asked\nHow close was their relationship there was nothing that could raise questions about whether even if she believes she's telling the truth\nShe may have missed identify so she just did a terrible job and I think the Republicans realize that and they can they're right in the middle but it was a very bad choices while here\nIs a Trump going after the people that he could not believe we're treating Brett Kavanaugh unfairly especially with the skeletons in their background to\nLook at some of these people asking the questions okay [noise]\nLook at Blumenthal he lied about Vietnam he didn't just say hey I went to Vietnam no no for Fifteen Years he said he was a war hero he fought in Da Nang province we call them ... Richard downing stick them done that he never went to Vietnam and take a look at Cory Booker\nHe ran Newark New Jersey answer the ground [noise] he was a horrible and they're looking Dianne Feinstein you're telling me about time\nDianne Feinstein knew about this two months earlier it was confidential until the hearing was over after the hearing was over they went public you know why because
