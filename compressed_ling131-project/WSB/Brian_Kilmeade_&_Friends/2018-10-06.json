question for me that has come up twice\nIn the last few months and it's obviously somebody's being pitched right now tell me\nI was just wondering if you have an opinion about whole homes surge protection\nOkay so I had the funniest thing recently I asked last time with this question came up\nI later was talking to a guy who's an electrical engineer and I asked him about that and I said hey is this something you think people should do and he said no I haven't done in my own home and I don't recommend that people spend money on it I said but what about the issue if\nIf you know you have all these expensive electronics and homes now and he said well I just have the um surge protectors the really robust ones for each important piece of electronics in my home\nSo instead of doing a whole house he used on the individual ones and only one who I truly engineer is not and they'll be all the only answer you should do but it's really interesting that his reaction was so strong\nAgainst the idea of doing whole house I I have no specific reason I'd say absolutely do whole house and it's a lot cheaper for you to think of it like zoning 'cause how many expensive electronics the actually have in your house\nChanges it that average I was mostly concerned about like the bigger appliances\nThat's what I heard of that you know your oven your washer and dryer that kind of thing\nI guess they could blow and a big surge in a house but that's not something that I've ever had somebody bring to the table\nOkay well that's helpful to know\nSo I Can't tell you because you know this is we're stepping a little bit out of my area will actually a lot out of my core area of expertise which is why when this came up before I went to consult someone about it\nAnd I are you being pitched by your power provider for by an electrical contractor\nNo no one's really pitching I've just read about it and so I thought I'd try to find out whether this is worthwhile worth the investment or it's not something I should worry about that I hadn't heard anyone saying about kind of protecting things individually so that's a different approach\nAnd how much is it to have the whole house\n[noise] you know I haven't gotten a call but my sense is when I looked it up somewhere between around two hundred and fifty and four hundred and fifty dollars if you have an electrician do it\nYeah but then you've got the electricians labor to\nWell I think that would include I think that would be the ... I think\nThat we had to hold the actual lower than the last caller and oh the price that's why I Would check to see what it would cost to just to be able to you so much cheaper to just do the surge protectors protecting your key electronics you're listening to the Clark Howard show my\nRenowned medical correspondent and endurance race champion pop are not empty people ask\nMe how to keep competing at the age of Seventeen healthy living is important which so his pain [noise] if you have pain you can't train sewing thrills I discovered salon past lie to keep less this unique topical pain reliever contains too safe and effective anesthetics nothing has worked better for\nSalon ... plus cream or wrong [noise]\nAttention all authors page publishing as looking for authors have you written a book and want to get it published he's publishing we'll get your book into bookstores and for sale on line at Amazon apple I do and other outlets they handle all aspects of the publishing process for you\nBringing ... publicity copyright and editing got eight hundred five zero one thirty six eighty nine now where you're free author so they should get that the ... or one thirty six eighty nine for your free author certainly should get again eight hundred by zero one thirty six eighty nine\nThat when you ask me about ... er Cox media group station [noise] twenty four hour news weather and traffic five and am seven fifty\nMe\nIs twelve midnight on Charlie O'Brien up and give us be twenty four hour news center GOP story this our own coming Saturday Night and a half and number two Georgia hosting Vanderbilt ...

three alleged die witnesses identified by ... remembered as\nThe third refuse to cooperate one of ... close friends from college so\nThat's where we're at ... so you would think Democrats would feel as though\nEven though they're not going to vote for him anyway and it's all a uh it's only an exercise in futility in the big picture he's the hope was that people like Susan Collins\nCenter mccaskey Republicans all all as well as the specially Jeff Flake would feel as though they didn't investigation and their nominated a guy that doesn't have an ugly history back to high school not talking about an ugly twenty or thirty year old a bread Kevin uh we're talking about a teenager\n[noise] so with that comes investigation and with them comes some outrage believe it or not Democrats should the surprise of few perhaps our outrage or about the investigation some even using expletives to describe it which I find unbelievable\nUh they do not like this investigation and wasn't thorough enough you have Chris Coons who I always thought it was a moderate and rational says it was a not thorough enough they wish they had more time more time can you believe that the one that's\nMost interesting Senator Joe Manchin he says they have to go to a separate room to look at all the information so he says he's got to go back today to finish it off here's Joe mansion being harassed cut forty\n\nSo look me in the eye a rehearsal line he was well here in the number two why would she tell you how she's got to vote and what makes you think that every woman that stands up and says I've been sexually assaulted deserves to be looked at his innocence there is somebody the other side who says they're innocent\nSo because he looks at this thing with a fresh set of eyes in every situation or a sober Lee by looking at everybody's background it does it mean because you're a woman saying I was sexually assaulted that you're a hundred percent right we saw what happened with Virginia and the Rolling Stone story and the woman that claimed that she was raped\nWe know what happened with the Duke lacrosse case either just high profile cases that were flat out fictitious in almost\nRuin lives for no reason but for Senator Chuck Grassley he has had enough he is chair I think he's been phenomenal\nHe's chairman of the Judiciary Committee and he says it today is a date to vote and what is the schedule\nReal simple if they're going to convene in twenty minutes\nThey're going to get together that's when this whole thing is about to start and then at ten thirty they'll start to vote and then they'll they'll get the votes in theory according to Republicans deaf culture ... suit which would set up a vote tomorrow\nFor passage of Brett Kavanaugh now if Susan talented Murkowski if ah if flake and Manchin all decided no it's done they can lose one that's all they can lose is just one vote here is Lindsey Graham cut to\nAdjust their problem like this as evidence of that [noise] all manufacturing [noise] senators and requested background check out what their [noise]\nAnd listen if you want to read what how they feel here's what Susan Collins sent did yesterday she spent over an

know all about a ... because his corruption investigation uh yielded a hung jury he was not exonerated and then he was reprimanded on the Senate for how humiliating censored and by the way he is now in a tougher fight then thought in the\nVery blue state of New Jersey where despicable clown he is to make that type of statement insulting the FBI on this note\nThere forty five pages of interview

now\nBut the FBI did talk to two of the three alleged eyewitnesses they were told about they identified by were mere as the third refused to cooperate\nSo we'll see uh we notice anybody who let that skip to abuse the intelligence it took over an hour for everybody mccaskey reportedly imagine already went back to re read it this morning\nAnd um it's a Democrat to walk out and says you joke nobody else really says is a joke this can truly considering whether they should vote for him and not including mentioned mccaskey college in like within a colonel Allen West is here he's no stranger to

we're seeing here on Capitol Hill\nWell good to be with you Brian the dramas all about one thing and that's too bad uh this nice of justice to be seated by president Donald Trump and to delay it and hopefully a windows ... terrible lectures and then keep it delayed until two thousand and twenty that's been very evident and Senator Lindsey Graham\nSaid it quite specifically the Democrats came out and said that they're not going to support\nAnyone that President Trump put forward as a matter of fact the fact that he made that ... that will fill in the blank side that was you know whatever the name was they were going to stand against Chuck Schumer came out said that I Will stop this nomination so they're looking for anything\nThat they can have and we all knew that they wanted an FBI investigation but at the FBI investigation did not guilty was also the outcomes that they wanted that they hit pretty determined they were going to say that it was a waste that the investigation and you heard senator Menendez a terminology\nSo we had Senator Grassley on Fox imprint an hour ago\nThe chairman of the Judiciary Committee who happened to be on the Senate for just going through Brett Kavanaugh's credentials\nHe also said this about what he still wants to get from Dr Ford so he is not satisfied that he got a candid testimony he does believe she was assaulted she just doesn't believe was by he doesn't believe it was by Brett Kavanaugh cut thirty one\nAnd you do believe that there's a problem with Dr Ford's collaboration with the Democratic party what paper work do you want to see that you haven't seen yet what do you see in terms of their communication\nPolygraph other things that that she talked about for the Washington Post surgery can talked orange and post them out in the yard and talk to us\nBut you didn't and she's upset she wasn't we interviewed do you believe that the woman that wanted her anonymity kept now one more time\nWell the person wanted the anonymity kept a back in August went out and got the polygraph tests and hired a lawyer so saying that this was all a very much so premeditated look around the bottom line is this there has to be some\nType of legal consequences for people that bring it up\nThese uh unsubstantiated allegations of accusations that has do cooperating evidence do cooperative written assist whatsoever if that does not happen at the end of this episode at the end of the day that means that the Democrats go right back into the oil avail draw from this ah draw water\nAnd do the exact same thing again this has\nTo

absolutely zero zero corroborating evidence to support these allegations as a judge Kavanaugh or I'm going to be there to vote for you pass needed\nSo his challenges his his daughter's getting married Saturday That's when the whole boat is going to be for his confirmation and the question is are you going to need the center for Montana's vote Republican and he says yeah I'm going to find a way they

Dr Ford is the act which after all she's from\n[noise] yeah I mean I understand how you getting cynical but we even did Senator Grassley says she believes she was assaulted he just doesn't believe it was Kavanaugh and no one could corroborate the story but I don't think we should say\nUh you know as gospel did you think that she's an actress because she's not I mean she's a PHD psychiatry so she's highly educated\nI agree um be comical about it bought bought something did happen we all agree on that but the Democrats are the one making this part of this whole scenario which she I honestly think she doesn't even believe that that one I'll have to\nDo you believe I'm looking at the headlines we drank with Kavanaugh don't confirm him so these got classmates were friendly with them and they said he was drinking in college so I don't want him to Supreme Court bench ...\nAnd and and and Mr west that was just on you refer to Richard Blumenthal this real that's that's\nThat's a nickname for Richard or Robert listening on the tune in Aspen Tampa hey Robert\nHey Brian good morning how are you\nGood I'll be in your area I don't want to pressure you but friday night on ... on October Nineteen hope to see there\nAre you with that but only well great I'm just wanted to call it you know and I will grill\nQuiet see better Graham basically lose it um I really think that the Republican activists November election eight to come together and they need to start prosecuting all these people that are just so and I'm going way back to call me to the doctor or there's a lot of\nGrass in the state they need to start biting down because the problem I think that like I'm at all this power but they don't do anything with it and I think they need to start doing something with it can make a\nQuick thing on the Russia investigation now would be to find out what James Baker said he was a former FBI attorney who just quit he used to work shoulder to shoulder with a six foot nine inch James Comey I he basically said an\nExplosive testimony or that it was the Clinton team that dropped off what they say oh it was information on the Trump team co according with the Russians\nThe Clinton team or a Web by Michael Saltsman who worked for a person a Perkins in quote we are ... that law firm that all over this story\nA which was um and he was a prosecutor up cyber crime in the criminal division of the department of justice or he evidently dropped off a lot of information\nA a busy work cyber security on the Trump team\nSo he dropped it off to the FBI and with Trump became president truck developed after the president won the election when he was president elect\nSo the Clintons working behind the scenes dropping up intelligence according to make sure the president's got some type of pro hanging over his head which you have to say is effective this whole thing is beginning to unwind\nBanks Robert or let's go out to Julie listening in serious in Kentucky joy\n[laughter] hey hey what's in your mind when\nI just I Hope I'm right in saying that something that I think everybody's kind of miss here with Diane Feinstein she the one lake is teaching document

will be willfully blind because they will the ends justifies the means we will hold off on this seat\nWhen the Senate and get somebody on there that we like or keep it empty and I'll do whatever it takes to make that happen if she had turned over this name and kept her down in ... the accuser which we now know is Dr Ford we would have gotten to the bottom of this\nAnd maybe it break a cabinet

American people average Americans and the Republican and Democrat\nThere is a ... a year earning for civility\nThere is a urine and for fair play every nobody wants their private space to be invaded a particularly because of the political point of view\nAnd and and I think a lot of folks put themselves in ... like me can you imagine if I was Ted\nIn that restaurant and someone came Yellen's so close to me that ... was coming into my face and my wife was there and my main my child was there how I Would react I would've broken a wine bottle up with the guys hadn't gone to jail for it or they're they they did some things you just\nDo I mean do you have to have some kind of a rule following\nAh yes I wanted Merrick Garland but guess what the Republicans control the Senate that's just the way the constitution or a band aids so I didn't get Merrick Garland but here is Brett Kavanaugh guy twelve years on the DC circuit a terrific judged by all accounts\nA wonderful life for a boy scout\nLeader a coach or a church a regular and all the rest of that every you know the fact that he happens to be pro life\nCan't ... can't be an exclusion\nOr from the high court is otherwise qualify which he is and it's constitutionally qualified sub substantially substantively I qualified Trump is constitutionally mandated to do exactly what he did too bad I I think that the Schumer and and what I find sign had really what they did\nBy holding that Dr Ford allegations until the very last minute and the nice thing that poor guy in the back the way they did I think that it was so shameful that was so blatant that was so obvious that this had the exactly opposite to the intended effect\nSo we just do this I don't have the taping yet but I'm just reading and Marco Rubio just got into the building he was just trying to answer questions about Brett Kavanaugh a man he will support after reading this the FBI documents who confirmed it\nHe just got shouted down by protesters moments ago will take a look at that Joe Manchin a man who's really on the grill he's sincerely trying to go through the document\nI Believe the Joe Manchin has got the best opportunity for him and his career who cares if Schumer invite him to the next ... get away he could go out there are places in the boat place the boat and he'll get six years in West Virginia\nAnd he could honestly be the most important person in the Senate from Iranian he ... himself from the change of his party he's on a red state so he's not going to pay the price locally\nAnd you'll be able to walk in and be ... by the president and by Schumer who always need him he was Joe mansion yesterday being harassed trying to be rational costs forty [noise]\n[noise]\nLook me in the I I Am looking at you he said obviously staring at her she's got a few does stayed lines wants to make every man look like a sexist after Jeff Flake was ambushed he looks like Republicans have decided to fight back\nI I agree that they are they are about time fighting back and fighting back on the issue of civility as a you know rather than the substance of the issue I ... just on substance how 'bout that unemployment rate today\nI mean at three points that represent lowest in forty nine years I mean that's what the headlines should be and now let this guy get voted let the Senate vote I think it will be fifty one\nForty nine I don't know what mansion is going to do a Susan Collins is definitely telegraphing that she will vote to confirm him I I I Would bet you that Lisa Murkowski also votes to confirm him uh\nThey they listen to their constituents but they've got to do the right thing there's nothing in anything we've heard about Brett Kavanaugh that should disqualify him despite the fact that I didn't like is a is wanting a performance ah you know that allowed Matt Damon to market myself that\nNight lineup so up so effectively I ... I think he'll settle down on the high court and we'll be fined judge and the issue of roe v Wade\nWill be something that but the next generation right\nHe argued and I think that you'll you'll see some some movement and that will not please everybody\nOkay look real quick on you you the lowest unemployment since Nineteen sixty nine\nA manufacturing competence in an all time high I Know to tracking poll and a friendly pull in in ... but it's a fifty one percent will say this or the president also shrinking government even though the deficit is growing\nA government cut one thousand jobs in a month they're down sixteen thousand under President Trump ... while unemployment drops\nHispanic unemployment has a record low by the way Hispanic and I'm\nI I think as I Am a Republican but I'm a Republican because I grew up in in big cities\nAnd I've seen what Democrats have done with big cities with encouraging a a kind of a ... me to hand out kind of a culture Republicans provide opportunities for people to pick themselves up by their bootstraps make themselves a better life\nThere is no social program that is better than a job when you see Hispanic unemployment at historic lows African American unemployment at historic lows that is social progress that is a a program that is far more effective in changing people's a lot in life than any\nUh give away program it's it's ... and\nYou know I I I firmly believe that the principles that were on now it giving a employers the confidence that they need to expand\nWhen they expand they hire more people as the job demands\nGrow so two salaries will re will rise I Know you disagree with me but I think the minimum wage should also be elevated to Fifteen dollars an hour a you know that's a that's being in the middle of the road\nClub but if your dad what if your dad owns a diner right now and you told you said you just got off television dad uh I just wanted ...\nI Want a minimum wage goes to Fifteen dollars an hour he whacking the side of the head he can't afford that you know small by margins are\n...

H. I. O. in Dayton, Ohio hate when\nMaking more and Brian hey let's get right to the chase is two things here one we need to stop looking at things from an emotional perspective and start looking at things from a logical commonsense perspective\nHaving said that why would capital and not be voted in ... as qualified if not more qualified than anybody studying French right now\nAnd everyone thought that and yeah I was actually refreshing to hear Democrats talking about they don't like this decision that decision those are the old days so there are different right room when I ask Chris Coons on television yesterday I said you're not going to vote for him either way right he goes no wonder\nAnd I said why is it well because I'm I'm a liberal and I want to liberal judge and he's conservative judge I said just a Scully that Ninety plus votes Lizzie grand voted for Sotomayor and Kagan\nOh so many people didn't the past they just see if you're qualified you know U.S Supreme court Justice Stevens up until today are liberals liberal say yet break Kevin ... should be confirmed\nIt doesn't matter your ideology argue qualified\nSo lonely I got off the track\nRight let's go play in politics go the most\nCan I just got to stop you for a second Blake voted yes\nFlake has voted yes that just came out now it doesn't mean he's going to\nVote yes tomorrow but for now he's voted yes and I give him credit because he said had been investigation see if there's any cooperation if there isn't then we move ahead there wasn't he said that and now we move ahead\nThey believe right that's to your college in Blake you need that would give you that will give you enough with Pence to put you over the top right because you know have the only one you don't have as Murkowski so then you were at fifty\nAnd if you were at fifty ... put you at fifty one\nCorker people that are worried about Corcoran others I mean he's already said I'm In\nSo here's the key boat so it looks like a Jeff Flake is voted yes Melissa who see in Springfield, Missouri\nAnd kid rock climbing thank Eugene and use that\n[laughter] you know I had something similar to the doctor for it then when I was Eighteen years old\nAnd um you know they try to turn there she was the Layla you all have Macomb county sitting there ... acts like she's scared as a rabbit but I got to tell you something if you had something happen to you and you have thirty six years to do about it she would come out\nAnd that means they have thirty hours swim to thirty hours of debate which means tomorrow's vote Saturday's vote\nWould be in the afternoon he can he will puts her in the background I Apologize for that\nI'm just trying to follow everything at once\nSo tomorrow let me see what is thirty hours so twenty four hours is around eleven o'clock\nSo it'll be eleven o'clock and then you add to it's going to be tomorrow evening we're going to get a final vote on Brett Kavanaugh so before you go to dinner\nOr before you watch the Yankee game and the Boston Red Sox game you'll have this uh activity which is more significant believe me than any sporting event even your own and we're going to find out if those votes hold just because they voted\nUp for this it doesn't mean they're going to vote tomorrow to passing through in ... who's going to let us know at three PM eastern time if she's going to vote for Brett Kavanaugh for\nThe Supreme Court she only goes to advance his candidacy Michaels\nNews talk Ninety seven one in St Louis Mike what do you think about these events\n[noise]\nHey Mike you're on can you know\nYeah now I can now I got a ... what do you think it looks like he's going to get through\nI think that the Republican voters need the whole center like Murkowski responsible for this and a quick claim Patsy this ridiculous show that the Democrats are putting on a we just can't tolerate that anymore nobody asked me what was that\nA Republican voters and the and the needs of the Republicans\nA country but\nIt doesn't even know that they're in the U.S Senate they're not in a soap opera they need to go with what the process and or some sort of an offense that constitutional ... they're not just the courts of law at a universal\n[noise] so so now I hear ya I hopefully we're going to be decided we went to the edge of the cliff with this help we we looked down and said I'm afraid of falling next time\nIf there is a Democrat in the White House and the Democrats in it if the Republicans were personally towering somebody about their high school record if they sexual assault as serious but now we're talking about the class members at Yale and high school talking about how we drank too much\nUh when we started talking about that I think that's a problem when you start talking about a candidate as a twenty year old standing around a punch bowl and then just accusing him of spiking it because he held a solo cup I think that's a problem\nI think that when you talk about gang raping women and accused Brett Kavanaugh of doing it but not really seeing him doing that that's a problem and up Republicans were doing that and you listen to the show and I hope you still do I'd be just as angry but this thing has gotten way out of control\nSo advanced to the final four vote and I don't know what Senator Murkowski was thinking I don't know how she feels good about ourselves but right now at fifty one forty nine it advances we'll see if the Danes has to come back right after his daughter's wedding on Saturday CDs needed still listening on in Scranton, Pennsylvania Phil\n[noise] uh yeah I just think that ah these senators are grandstanding a these are known names senators that are seeing their name and lights and they just wanted to go on as long as they possibly can [noise]\nI don't know I I ... a lot of people agree with you feel I don't because of the level of anger because senator or you\nKnow Centre College can't go anywhere can't go out to eat can't leave her office I mean there's people just huddling around as people screaming they're celebrities standing there three hundred arrests on Capitol Hill interview see cows it's like seeing Paul McCartney in Nineteen sixties to BC Murkowski imagine and I look at how angry man she was\nA it was just trying to walk through a down a path then people are screaming out of how you going to vote a woman is yelling at him let's listen to Joe mansion get yelled at if you think they want their time and I don't know what the how enjoyable or this is cut forty [laughter]\n\n[noise] ah that's up on you know in my mind that I don't I don't think that is the type of thing that's fun and now you're ready to join the FBI investigation which to me makes no sense Terry church he was on yesterday he was on late last night\nAnd you know him he helped get the Unabomber a very well respected the FBI as an investigator he was former FBI assistant director he said this about the investigation as he talked to nine separate people and supplied a boom in his paperwork and they also provided information they got from the tip line cut thirty three\nWhen somebody sits down and talks the two FBI agents that person you can bet the story is going to be vastly different vastly different than all the rumors that you're hearing from people who all have agendas and one one final point\nThe FBI released its information it's therefore all the senators to review the facts of the facts they got what is out there to to get they brought us together and uh unless there is anything else this is what we have [noise]\nUh that's where they have and I just find it not so much to insult appraise the FBI they they did exactly what they did for Justice Thomas they do exactly what they did on background checks his his seventh background check people come forward you redo it so they did the background check\nAnd they ... they talked to nine people they talk about their emir as allegation and they talked about the Ford allegation that which time they set up my judgment on Keizer Kaiser PJ Smith Tim God that Chris Gard all these people were put at the scene of the party Nanette any recollection of this woman\n... Ramirez comes out in the New Yorker magazine says as a freshman I got really drunk and Brett Kavanaugh was drunk and he exposed himself he couldn't vote supply any first hand eye witnesses\nNow to the three allege that witnesses were interviewed by the FBI evidently they was ten or twenty all of a sudden that Ronan Farrow couldn't get [noise] hey go to Brian ... dot com or\nWe condensed it recaps every show like this one it's official at least cultures confirmed fifty one forty nine tomorrow Brett Kavanaugh has one more both it'll happen tomorrow tomorrow evening after thirty hours of debate if they use all thirty and I imagine they will\nAnd will find out if we have a new Supreme Court justice exhale everyone for now\n\nIs going to be fun\nNation coming to you know they can be the personal\nStationed on gum now Fox News rundown he's a weekly morning podcast the dive deep into the major and controversial stories of the day hosted by the anchors of Fox News radio driving out of here a perspective of news you won't find anywhere else plane to now on Fox News but I guess the only job [noise]\nShannon bring there is a lot of adrenaline with being a journalist I can get one of the things that drew left for the business you want to be well informed so that whenever news break there ready to tackle and I think the nighttime hours are invaluable the fact that we added a hard news hour to ... pm eastern credit or whenever it developed through the day and\nPeople are fully informed from coast to coast where they go to bed theory something about getting that core and you know when you got it right in breaking something to really work on Fox News you know\nNews real honest opinion it's a home ... tip from David Baker brought to you by the Olympics at ... dot com\nImage type year annual cleaning garages make sure you are at least sweep the\nFloor being so close to the outdoors and it's natural elements makes this job number one\nHe's a good quality push room and you'll begin to see a little sparkle in the garage also sweep out the areas where creditors why finesse number to get rid of the junk me route was if you have a touching your pitch strapped to lumber aging sporting goods have all kinds of paying God\nNot only the ugly in in the way they are areas worst critters loved to that number three get organized Ivan do you use the most need to be within easy reach summer stuff out winter stuff in\nThis would not only clean up the look but it will remove your areas where her love all\nGraves ... jobs your side for how to do it or not to try and who the higher valuable information on the Web at the whole ... dot com\nBubble you asked me about ... er Cox media group station has twenty four hour news weather and traffic\nFive and am seven fifty\nAsked me to this news\nIt's two o'clock on Charlie O'Brien up at the veteran's group has to be twenty four hour news center top story that saw her she may do pre to point out\nDown there ... all of the vote on Saturday with this update from WBEZ base Jamie do perjury and Washington prostrate\nIt at the outcome of this confirmation fight\nWe had before as the nominee who's been deceptive and misleading Democrats\nKept the Senate burning the midnight oil arguing the full story of judge Kavanaugh still isn't known what are they hiding but the scoreboard today will be on the side of the GOP as President Trump is on the verge of a major political victory I'm Jamie do pre in Washington\nUm she's looking at the same FBI report that everyone else says well you know there's been tremendous pressure on her from the beginning because she is pro choice and there have been a pro choice groups from the beginning who have been after both her and send the recall and I'm saying that we don't believe that he's actually gonna respect row he's going to be a threat to the way\nA potentially overturning that so that's always been a consideration for her\nSo um you know they're all looking at the same FBI report some folks are drawing different uh conclusions from it others say listen there's nothing corroborating there the FBI has done what you ask them to do but there's clearly something for her that the sticking point and it may not be\nThe latest stuff it may be what our concern was from the beginning which is abortion rights\nBut I Want you to you John Heilemann on another channel set about mccaskey\nEveryone who's been paying attention to those for a while now both of those four so maybe we should work out to the most likely know women's group she's got a governor and always having governor in Alaska or both drugs Kavanaugh ships arrived a primary\nAnd there are the Native American issues or a cat and I was on the wrong place off from their point of view without there's usually for the Fisher thing for her so the politics\n... Murkowski we open up the space for her to vote no if she wants to\nDo with John Home and so that is a Native American meaning ah I guess native Alaskan ... right\nMight remember though right after the last big get together these guys the uh after the committee vote remember it was more khaki mansion continents like who got together and a lot of people think they move as a bloc now she need political cover to vote now\nThey may have made a deal where man she says I'm going to be a yes that gives you what you need to go home and don't know because you know for when he's in a reelection race and a state that President Trump won by forty point and maybe more politically\nAdvantageous or if those or are working together for him to say I'll go ahead and\nTake the yeah so it won't hurt me it'll probably helped me in reelection if you need to be a no on the cover for you because the war has been behind closed doors many times together discussing what they would do and it could be a deal\nTell you what they want to think about it tactically show than it is a genius move for mentioned because at this age he's a young I mean he's in his he's about Seventy now he's already been a governor he wants to get another six years here it will just you know it'll say I'm doing well West Virginia wants me to do okay you're very pro gun we're you know he's anti Obamacare\nSo he can stay a Democrat being West Virginia and it'd be the most vital vote for Republicans and Democrats for six years heated arguably the most powerful person in the Senate\nYeah he could be like the Justice Kennedy then it where you know both sides know that the persuadable at times on really important issues and you know I covered\nThe Senate campaign last time around and traveling state of West Virginia over and over and over again people love him there and what they told me is he's actually worked with both sides of the ... that's why we loved him as a governor Locke\nRepublicans and Democrats in the state capital and say no one leaving him ordering and food and so we figure out the budget and he would make sure that both sides are doing some give and take and I think we've seen him do that in the Senate um that he is persuadable on key issues to both sides so um\nI think that he is they show old fashioned politician and that he doesn't always but with his party and she sees the benefit a and actually Koch now but the Ayelet time not political reasons uh although you know this vote could be one of those little reason um but because he actually thinks it benefits people West Virginia\nAnd they have great respect for him there I mean I I couldn't find a Republican that had anything negative to say about him when I was there covering his campaign because it gets really respect him as a man of his word in a principal\nA okay we got this news you just want to share with you a source familiar with the lobbying efforts to confirm Kavanaugh told Fox News this might have been from you that the White House believes it has the votes to confirm Kavanaugh the sources they blew Murkowski's loss but they will get mentioned as well as cones and boy to vote yes\nAnd they were still working on Donnelly too because you remember last friday he voted or that he was going to be a nurse\nAnd then they have the deal come out of committee and then he was sort of like well let's see what happens after this report the White House has not as as late as yesterday they did not think Donnelly was locked in fact they thought he was\nPossibly still persuadable um you know you've got the issue of the bank to I mean he's an absolute yes we're capping off his daughter's getting married tomorrow and we had him on the\nShow last night and eat that if I've got to be there I Will find my way back ... opened um you know and of course the vice president's going to be around in case there's a tie that needs to be um broken but they feel like at this point they've got a path all the at a very narrow once he getting Kevin onto the bench\nAnd the next most important votes tomorrow if we've got to get past that Frank uh and then that will set the clock here for the vote on Saturday I got a wedding on Saturday my goal this weekend is to walk my daughter down the aisle and to see a you know you knew the United States Supreme court justice\nDoes his daughter say about that [laughter]\nYou know can you imagine this is that the health position for their family to be in but you know he told me there's no way he's going to you know let that fall apart you will find a way to get there at the at a time machine\nUm and he had no but you know they have maneuvers to hold a vote open and he said there are these things called airplane so you know initially he was saying he wouldn't be available at all Saturday the whole wedding day I'm sure they have yes than family and it's the one day and your daughter's life that you know you really can't miss\n'em but whether they hold that over into the wee hours or whatever they do you know Mitch McConnell the man is a master technician at procedure on the floor and accounting his though there's no way he would have triggered this if he did not feel like they had a way to win\nTo interesting because I was asking around and people say that he says we as a country have no choice we have to move this ahead\nBecause you can't use what are you going to do I mean you do the FBI investigation you're done with the persuadable she's not going to come out again he does the oil so wouldn't one way or another we have to do this so you're telling me that you believe promote your contacts that if if it became clear that two of the poor we are going to vote no that she would have held it off\nI don't know I mean I think that yeah we're kind of a at the point where they're really has\nNo uh no we don't do that but you know how good McConnell is at this\nAnd so I have to feel like at some point in that we see and I did have someone tell me earlier in the week a GOP center that they felt confident they had mansion so you know I I think when McConnell took the floor and said we are voting this week I think by then he was convinced that they had a pass\nThem when you say that you do you think do you think of the brain that they told mentioned will ease off in your Senate race if you give me this\nI don't think so I think that they're going to want that seat more than ever um but if they feel like there's not a real shot it that they tried to give him some political cover [noise]\nBecause I'm just saying that were done only two doses y'all give you this vote it'd be it'd be back off because I could lose but Donnelly weight and there's no yesterday Heidi Heitkamp trailing by about eight to nine votes collectively a a point to collectively she voted no\nYeah and and I think for her at this point there's no chance of now there is no chance the polls don't look good for her right now and I feel like if she and her got our heart and and on principle feels like she doesn't want to vote for this guy if she was maybe within three or four points maybe we see something different if she feels like\nUm she's likely going to lose this race anyway she may want to go out with a her head up by ... if she feels like there's something about judge Kavanaugh that she can't wear personally for her um but you know you got in the capital she's in no and that's a nail biter\nI mean there's so many of these races were Kavanaugh's absolutely factoring in you know all the polling showing that it it looks like it's coming off I spent a benefits the Republicans I mean that they say they're more United and they would have been they've had not nothing to really rally around until now I mean the house paints a different picture the race over there but the Senate races for now it looks like\nDespite which has been losing nasty and ugly has actually benefited Republicans in in most of the Senate races\nAre shown and Bremer those general before I let you go I Want everyone to get an understanding of what it's like in Washington here's an example Senator Orrin hatch who's seen it all does not take the Republicans are beginning to fight back listen to this cut forty one\n\nI guess one of the things you're doing sooner is when you grow up that ... I mean but that's it's indicative of what's going on what is it like walking the halls and Capitol building\nIt is absolute insanity as you would imagine I'm listening to Capitol police\nHave worked over time they have had so much on their hands and see if hearing began at the beginning of September um it's been nonstop and you understand people are so passionate on both sides of that but the left has been very organized\nYou know they're celebrities involved there's funding for numerous sources involved I mean this is not just a few people are going to show up because this is the day I mean people are organizing their bussing in 'em and I got to think that he's members Republicans or Democrats most of them\nThey like and able to walk around and be normal people and not have any security with them and most of them were just that\nBut from what I'm Talking to you right now are taking it I mean they're using um Capitol police and other security to get them from point a to point that they don't vote and they can get them where um and the people of the country are more than welcome to show up and all of these Senate um hallways and to make their voices down at the\nKemp wants the public sector to get out of business both approaches good very pricey for voters WSBIU top measurable story\nSenator Susan Collins book Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh on the doorstep of confirmation friday she says she will support his confirmation vote expected on December ... after me\nThe Atlanta public school superintendent while to Atlanta to get all the Turks dark sooner rural before offering tax dollars to redevelop to golds Maria ... wants to ... to renegotiate or you lend me\nFine special tax districts before from ... to go back to those older deals received school starts dollars WSBIU moved down to thirty\nOne\nAbsolutely we\nPanic kick them when I'm In a line when it brings back nightmares ... ...\nI had to endure were\nWe were constantly praying for predatory [noise]\n\nPardon my language is finally over I Hope no one will ever have to experience when I went\nFrom the king of the world's\nSecond most profitable illegal business Ninety percent\nVictims are females and the average age of a prostitute in the U.S is twelve to fourteen helping these victims is easier than you think wellspring treasures are upscale retail stores selling clothing housewares and furniture to fund treatment education advocacy programs for sexually abused when\nYou can help today my donating were shopping in one of our foreign locations in Duluth Kennesaw highlands and Peachtree city\nWellspring letting fighting sexual abuse by Haitian she's having one hit rock spring letting dot org for more information\nBehind and comedian ...\nScientists are finding that are more humane way to get down treatments for cancer and other people\nIt helps donors fine charities provide vital can enhance him soon\nHow you can get but his main see on ... on\nTheir mom has to learn you know me I'm your nine to noon house every day right here on WSBIU I'm here to say look out Alfa reta we are coming your way the doctrinaire is an Iowa will be doing the show live from serving change the Rio and\nMars arena bar on friday is free and open to everyone get more details at W.

we're going back and forth [noise] and then we fell in love [noise]\n[noise] and\n[noise] we found a\nJob he's having fun uh but it makes a lot of people including Lindsey Graham uneasy because we still know that the regime we're talking about North Korea we do know there are cultures past is now a deer now within thirty hours that voting\nOn Brett Kavanaugh's Kennedy said fifty one forty nine it goes even though mccaskey said no mansion said yes so we'll keep you up to date on that but the real problems facing this country and North Korea Russia and China William Toby joined us now senior fellow develop our Center for science and international affairs\nHe's also a director there us a Russia initiative to prevent nuclear terrorism Debbie administrator for defense nuclear nonproliferation\nAt the national nuclear Security Administration he's done that in the past William a man are you prepared to answer this question where are we at now with North Korea us relations does it does that play does that cut I have a President Trump worry you\nOf course it does um that's one of the most brutal regimes on Earth I'm on a per capita basis it's a nasty or anything that's ever been faced um\nAnd my concern is that despite the fact that President so but he was quote solve the nuclear problem all this time all these small some weeks I'm ... continues to churn out more highly enriched uranium and more plutonium that can be used to advocate nuclear weapons\n[noise] um we know that the president on one hand there's not release any of the sanctions did stop the er do war games as he calls him but we know this Mike Pompeo's going Sunday but at the same time we just sanction turkey turkey some companies from turkey poured trying to circumvent the sanctions\nAnd we also were going after China to crack down again on the sanctions so we're talking nice poor act in top don't you think\nWell we are ... it's not clear that for example China and Russia are I mean the president I think\nRightly said that he was going to maintain is maximum pressure campaign until he saw the ...\n... almost as soon as the Singapore summit was over trying to call or you could end up sanctions and frankly that was code for China thing we're going to ease sanctions and it's fully within the power so the Washington Post um\nRecorded on a un a finding that up till August some forty vessels I'm\nOnly by a hundred and thirty different come company is mostly tied to try and China and Russia have been smuggling oil into North Korea oil and other petroleum products are they document a hundred and forty eight transfers totally eight hundred thousand to one point four million barrels\nThat is substantial that's much different than a year illness actions\nYeah so uh that tuition so we have Mike Pompeo going over there if I gave you this hand to play right now how did you play it\nFor a tough one to play um China has cobble gr alive for decades um I I think probably\nThe most effective thing for secretary Pompeo to do is to convince the Chinese that while the president is sincere and wanting to find a negotiated\nSolution if the north box and doesn't pursue\nGetting there are as I said he was going to turn the more difficult measures now I I was also very nervous about the war talk that the president seems to be\nA engage again throughout most of the twenty Seventeen and I'm not sure the wild swings between war drums of love letters it was a constructive one but secretary Pompeo has to make clear to the Chinese were going to get very tough\nSo interesting uses a certain formula for this it's worked for decades and then the president comes in and through all of that on his head are you curious it all\nUh being that sometimes you just do things totally different whether if it's football incomes is running shoe ... they start with a shotgun and things change you know the forward pass was something that football didn't embrace now all of a sudden it's commonplace the way he goes in there and makes these deals are you curious it all to see if\nBy throwing everything in the air if we could get out of the sixty years stalemate\nAirport and I was a part of the the now ... years of attempts to be there for our North Korea and we didn't get Bert are are fully admit that we tried hard we tried soft and none of it seemed to work\nAnd so the president trying something new is not necessarily a bad back but I think it needs to do two things couldn't particular\nFirst keep an eye on the ball this isn't about a peace\nTreaty or some declaration of war that it it's about stopping the production of this material that now may about food goes into nuclear weapon um and then the second he has to make sure that", "show_name": "Brian
