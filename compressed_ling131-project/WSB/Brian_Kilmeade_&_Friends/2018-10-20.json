twenty thirty eight seven central only on your PBS\nStation Susan is with us on the car to our show Hi Susan Hi Claire thing is so much for taking my call my pleasure um I Love listening to\nUm I have a question on flood insurance and getting ready to purchase a home that is absolutely going to require\nThat I get flood insurance and I thought that the only option available was government flood insurance but I'm\nThe insurance carrier that I'm getting insurance um from gave me the option of private flood insurance and I didn't know how that appeared to governmental insurance and if it's something I should even consider\nSo private flood insurance is only a backstop\nIf you're buying a very expensive dwelling that you need a backstop beyond the federal flood insurance program the federal flood insurance program is subsidized by your fellow tax payers okay and so the first dollar Walsh you want to go against the federal flood insurance program\nAnd uh it's really simple but by it it there's a website that explains everything about\nThe federal program it floods smart dot Gov and okay homes that the structure itself you know native land you don't consider the land\nThat have um a value of a quarter million dollars or less okay you're fully covered by the federal flood insurance policy how much is this home you're buying likely work\nOn I ... it will be covered for like three hundred thousand dollars\nOkay so you could I mean you got [noise] you have a situation you stack additional private what insurance on top in the in the situation where this house is that you're buying\nWould have would create a total loss of the house is a multi story like what's it look like\nIt is a one story house today as a second home at the beach\nOkay so so\nI have under I'm the same ... you Susan okay I have a second home at the beach and I have a homeowner's policy\nI have a wind storm policy and those are both private [noise] I have the federal flood insurance for the two fifty and then I have private insurance or the access\nSo much more complicated and with the second home I should tell you are you and I don't get the same subsidy\nThat people do with a primary residence\nAnd I think that's just as it should be I mean why should\nWhy should our fellow taxpayers be subsidizing us to the hill when it's okay uh you know and it's a second home but it is generally cheaper to have the first quarter million under the federal program\nAnd in your case she'd have potentially a little supplement of a private policy\nAnd at that follow up question is there any um any ... is it for education from having a separate lend policy from the homeowners versus a combined policy or is it just\nWould generally what they do is uh is it would be from the same ensure but ... charge you a premium separate for the wind store without really call when storm\nOkay All right that's great\nAnd one thing you should know get ready for the joys of having a place on the water which is great but know that there will often be a larger deductible on that policy when it's a name storm\nOkay yes yup okay\nAll right thank you very much for the information I really appreciate\nHer and let's hope no floods no hurricanes nothing come near the home of yours for many many many years to come\nOut until they said yeah\nSure you're listening to the car how we show

proper way which led to an argument ... hunt on to fight with Bill ... she was she exacerbated the situation that led to his desk\nHe says get rid of Jon Tester and helped me when the mid term elections and another four years cut seven that's what it's going to\nGo to election of those things\nLaw and order to have it\nDelivered common sense and remember it's gonna be an election of the caravan you know what I'm Talking about [noise] you know what I'm ...\nAnd what he's trying to say is nothing against anybody Hispanic or Canadian\nThe borders are wide open the policies say catch and

there when you get to America you got to be given a a kept for twenty days in pretty good facilities get an ankle bracelet and a court date to see if you can actually get asylum\nSomething like Ninety plus percent get asylum what about all those people waiting on line the right way from Brazil from Bulgaria from Japan from China\nWhy did they have to lay out the fees and set and and live by a standard of rules and practices and our rules and regulations and why is it okay just to walk to our border has nothing to do with compassion\nWill get the money we're already spending we're take they're taking on average the government forty to fifty percent of your income\nAnd they're still overdrawn by seven hundred and sixty billion dollars annually\nSo we have a ... trillion dollar deficit\nHave a big heart give to charity have a refugee program but you cannot have an open border and even though Democrats don't say we want an open border by allowing these ... these programs to stay in place that Dianne Feinstein put in place in two thousand that's exactly what is happening\nBut for Donald Trump to make any progress he's got to keep the Senate and find a way to hold the house and one thing he's got to do is take out Jon Tester who took out his VA secretary with fallacious claims cut nine\nIf you want to drain the swamp you must defeat the Democrats and you must defeat Senator Jon tester\n[noise] I mean\nHe's a super liberal out of you know people I Know I Know you you know me I Know you how the hell did you ever elected to [noise] how did you pull that off\nOh he's a former he related to a lot to the world community but he has not really voted against his party at all except symbolically or he is not push back on President Obama and he is not one went along with Donald Trump he just didn't vote for Donald Trump's nominee for Supreme Court justice so in case you wondering what kind of agenda\nThey Democrats will put forward even if you do not like Donald Trump you have to note is what's happening with the ... with the country with the economy with our trade deals with regulation the ability to open a business and sustain that business\nThey'll have a small bank be able to thrive with the Dodd Frank retraction even on health care do you know premiums are actually going down for the first time I am not sure the president deserves credit for that but\nIt is happening bait or the rock star on the left who was giving Ted Cruz a run for his money in Texas was still trails by eight did a town hall for an hour with Dana Bash on\nCNN and when asked about impeaching Donald Trump he doesn't take the Biden way he takes the beta way cut twelve\nHe said in July that you would as a member of the house right now vote to impeach hadn't changed your mind if\nI haven't let me let me put it this way there may be an open question as to whether the president then the candidate sought to collusion with the Russian government in two thousand\nAnd sixteen foot when by broad daylight on Twitter he asked his attorney general Jeff Sessions to end the Russia investigation I Would say that's obstruction inaction I wouldn't like an impeachment to an indictment there there is enough there to proceed with a trial for a full vetting of the facts\nAnd to make the best informed decision in the interests of this country and our future\nOkay there you go there's your rockstar there's your RFK he wants to impeach the president for doing nothing a Robert Morris has eight or ten to twenty million dollar investigation ongoing for past a year now up two years\nHe's going to give the bulk of his or the bulk of his conclusions and evidence and indictments I think a couple of weeks after the midterms but ... thinks if you put me in the Senate if you leave me in the house I'm going to impeach the president the average person in Montana in Wisconsin in Michigan\nThere I say Texas thinks that that is not working for anyone it's politics as usual\nI Want you to you with Joe Biden said clearly he's running for president and clearly he knows losing his temper and not being discipline is an issue he also understands that he's just a member of a party not in power has been around long term\nWeight to the investigations finished\nYou know put an arbitrary end to it\nYou wait till is finished let's see what it has a say\nAnd if Democrats win the house do you believe that they no new foreign with article I Hope they don't\nI don't think there's a face for doing that right\nI think we should wait until the report comes out\nOf course in the report is not going to say he colluded with the Russians it's not going to say he colluded with what's the latest Saudi Arabia that's the new one\nDid you\nThat campaign I don't want to get into details as books written about it everybody's selling everyone's a leaking whatever Robert Mueller is going to come out and he's not going to say the president colluded with the Russians and if you continue to say\nThat he should be impeached about stuff you know nothing about because most agree that the Mueller investigation is not leaking it's a

blue wave forming a democratic way for me I think\nThey said our reaction to the cabin or confirmation and the unfairness of it\nI think has resulted in the president's favor I also think the president is more energized I mean now that the economy is soaring and he's a he's getting these successful trade pacts are\nGoing to North Korea and so forth or the war kind of quieting down I think the president is on the role I mean maybe they'll lose the house it's possible there's no way on earth I think right now that do a lose the Senate the Republicans so I think that the Democratic house will complicated make messy\nA hit the second half of his first term but I don't think it'll be any kind of profound or a profound difference I think he's he's definitely energized and those those crowds don't libre\nYeah I mean especially they they seem lateral passionate but I Hope the president and the next two years does more McCain style town halls and less rallies I Want to see him start to win over some of the independent and critics if they can keep it simple I think that'll be the beginning of the president\nDoing when Bill Clinton didn't the second term let everybody know\nYou're

star he's very very charismatic he is wearing well even on the people who hate him or he the more you see him the better you like him but you're absolutely right\nThe more you see an acting presidential at responding to citizens questions now it's just reporters' questions but in a town hall setting as you suggest he can answer these questions more thoughtfully and nobody can hold a candle to him who will the Democrats put up to contradict Cory Booker\nI don't think so I if I said I don't think so Nancy Pelosi\nI don't think so I think that he is the best salesman the Republicans have the more and the and he has the this unusual phenomenon\nThe more you see him the more comfortable you are with him right I think that he should really stay out their answer every question they can every time there's a gaggle a you know stop do more interviews do more town halls especially I I think that uh he is definitely the most potent campaign or the Republicans that seemed\nLike Chris Wallace and my first hour who disagreed with everything I said Geraldo Rivera started me on this hour almost agreeing with me\nMy self esteem is back and I thought it was gone forever [laughter] so I'm going to bring it\nTo something that's what the Donald Trump critic had something to go on in the in the wake of what happened with ... and it looks like even the president ... killed now we're trying to find out why the president said this last night caught one\nBut Greg get smart and by the way never wrestle him [noise]\n[noise] any\nGuy that you do with body slammed me my highest shouldn't say that they're not but there's nothing reimbursement way indoors Greg very early but I had heard that he body slams a reporter\nSo they say in the wake of that murder should the president be saying that and then there's the cascade of outrage where do you stand around though\nI think that this uh you know this\nKind of thought scene is where you have to stay on one topic why didn't you go down to the victims of hurricane Michael immediately why does it wait a week what did he owed the rally before you went why this way that I think we have to get over that you know people have become ... car\nMental alive compartmentalize\nThese issues I I you know I took seriously of chicken about the immigrants\nUh I then I laugh about something else the body slam thing I mean ... what led him joke about it I mean he said that he wants to kick the s a Trump or says President Trump said he went to kick somebody's ass or I you know let let him be himself politically I say the same kinds of\nThings I mean it's ... to be presidential where it's appropriate I thought that in that crowd particularly that was a good crack in terms of what happens if you're asking you about the show is murder and what the United States should do I have a solution just asked me anytime\nA first off before the solution to set up the president will pause according to the secretary state and wait for the Saudis to conduct an investigation Jack Keane weighed in cut thirty one\nFirst of all this is a serious setback for the relationship ... also the reality is\nThat the relationship with the kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United states is in the U.S national interest that will also guide us in terms of what we're going to do about this obviously I Believe there'll be severe punishment meted out by the United states\nThat you set up tell me the punishment that works but saves the relationship\nFirst of all I totally agree with everything general Kane does I urge people to listen to him when he speaks he has no political agenda he's a hero retired four star\nOr a rise rails hired him for a reason is the best of the military analysts I really I Love the guy and I I really appreciate everything has to say here is what we do here is what I suggest and here's what I Will recommend to the president or either via tweets or more directly we sell Saudi Arabia all these arms it's well over a hundred\nBillion dollars it's a lot of jobs tens of thousands of jobs at Boeing and a rate the ... and these other defense contractors and so forth we don't want to cut off our noses just\nBite our face as a as as a as Mike ... says the secretary of state\nSaudi Arabia has been our historic ally for over Ninety years we should keep it that way\nAlthough they must be severely punished here is the punishment that makes sense we sell them these fighter bombers we sell them the jets we train their pilots we sell them the bombs and missiles that the jets fire but we do more than that\nAs these Saudi\nAir force jets take off for Murray out of the other bases in Saudi Arabia to fly to Yemen\nTo because they are not very good the Saudi pilots because their intelligence uh sucks because they don't care they use our bombs to bomb ... civilians and schools and so forth it is absolutely appalling they way the Saudi Arabians are waging\nThis war so here's what we do do you know that these bombers and around from Saudi Arabia to Yemen\nEither en route to the bombing or more particularly as they are returning from these bombing runs that are ... out this horrible civilian casualties they are refueled Brian they re field by American tankers flown by American pilots how is that\nThat we allow our pilots and our resources the refueling resources to be used in this horrible manner\nBut why you know immediately we stopped the refueling at least we can do that it is a concrete step it will punish the Saudis without affecting the strategic relationship\nWell my my hope is you know the who the ... it's a fine idea I chose the the the depth in which you know the operation but I don't think the Saudis goal was to kill civilians is to kill the who the rebels\nLike you said they're not good at it so um we have anything else I think we should have been working with them to get more accurate to kill the people you're supposed to kill a lot to allow not allow Yemen to become a run and be on the doorstep of Saudi Arabia as a norm complicated\nYemen will begin to Iran and so forth to me Saudi Arabia bank worlds ISIS they ... they bank roll out those for a bank roll al Shabaab\nEvery madrassas I've ever gone to throughout the world is all Saudis sponsored they are generating the next generation of terrorists I don't like the Saudis I think that the uh uh that the Iranians get the short end of the stick unnecessarily and incorrectly I think they should fix that\nUh uh but I I I think that we have to rethink some of this a surprise\nUh to keep in mind that you agree with Rand Paul and that but\nThey said the Iranian people are great you know they're talented and smart we also know what the young population we also know they're being disrespected by the leaders\nAnd we have to find a way for their grave new generation of Iranians to take over they used to be tied allies but in Israel they are very concerned every day most in foremost first and foremost about Iran you

you look in the short in it and try to have the building and the bigger but that all this happened in this in two thousand and how many illegal border crossings there were in the year two thousand down here\nIs roughly now so you're still at historic lows in terms of the number of people crossing the border it's just now they're coming more families up a little bit from last year but it's still way lower agree it important\nIs that true that is what they were saying on CNN Today that his the border crossings or a historic low and decrease since two thousand joining us now someone who would know because er she deals with the on daily basis she's the department of homeland security spokesperson Katie Waldman a Katie welcome back\nThanks for having me on so I was a scene in telling the truth there\nWe are we are definitely seeing a decrease and apprehensions from two thousand to twenty Eighteen but that's only telling one side of the story you know we're building and from two thousand two now we're building wall we've had new wall up we had hired more agent but\nWhat we're seeing is a change and demographics\nAnd the laws that have existed since two thousand back in two thousand Ninety eight percent of our apprehensions were from Mexicans were Mexicans and we're able to quickly repatriate them and send them back to Mexico within hours\nToday about four hundred thousand fifty six percent are Central American those are people we cannot return\nAnd now many fifty six\nFifty six percent right now or Central Americans and we cannot repatriate them the same way we can Mexicans US law treats Mexicans differently than it treats Central American [noise]\nThat is strange and I think very few people know that what happened to me the ... ah that that made politicians think the central and south Americans were more important than Mexicans\n[noise] it's a two thousand eight law written by Dianne Feinstein that treated Canada Canada and Mexico different than it treated Central Americans because back in two thousand eight most of our apprehension\nWe're all Mexican now they're all predominantly Central American it's a shocking start when you look at it at the hundred thousand family units apprehended last year from El Salvador Guatemala and Honduras\nNearly Ninety nine percent of them remain in the country today so what that says all pretty much does four hundred thousand apprehension is we cannot repatriate them there once they enter put a chow in the United states we cannot just send them right back\nTo the the theory is with the president now is president catcher releases over and catching go home is in what's stopping that an actual law to overturn the two thousand eight law\nWe need Congress to act and closed the loopholes the other one is the fourth element agreement which says the Clinton era law are ... that I'm a decree that says that we can't detain family and it's longer than twenty days\nWhat ... what is the ability to detain and remove those we apprehend our goal is repatriation our goal is not the tension we want to be able to the tanker the tendency of an immigration proceeding\nWhich if you are a single adult right now from you know Central America we can detain you for about forty days and send you home that's how long immigration proceedings take one were forced to release\nBecause it takes longer than twenty days that turns into eight years\nAnd that turns into you know than ice having to go apprehend and neat and communities and then remove it's a much more arduous process and much more lengthy journey which during that time they also apply for work permits [noise]\nUm and pretty much become part of our temporary about permanent population\nWill just say that people were doing it right or who get a green card pay the fees are live up to the standards do the paperwork that line needs to be reformed and that process needs to be sped up I get it but what what messages that to to people that are trying to do with the right way\nYou know we're also processing applications\nAnd increasing the rate at which you can become a U.S citizen and green card holder\nWe're actually looking at ways to reform our legal immigration system as well not just for ... for farmers but also be able to get to do it the right way to beat up that process so you can become a legal resident and become a U.S that if in the right way but I think it's just a slap in the face to those who are doing it the right way and are\nFollowing or us immigration laws versus those who are openly flouting damage and our faith\nSo ah do perception is that while this is a the the president of the United states is going to set up before she was a great it's a great topic and it's a great issue for him would come to terms but you're saying on the ground when everyone's focus on these caravans you find it relatively aggravating because those are focused on\nOne issue you're dealing with that on the border on a daily basis and in your view helpless\nRight now you know we're seeing a caravan coming towards the United states\nOf about four thousand people right that's what the news is reporting we're apprehending about two thousand on the border each and every single day that's where you know the men and women have CBP and border patrol or apprehending them but there's not much request they can do once they apprehend then were forced to release because not only are detention centers\nFilling up but then even if we do you know keep the family unit and detention we can't do anything with him since twenty days is too short of a period to be able to adjudicate and removed from our country the best attorneys removal and we don't have that ability right\nNow do you do you think the word is

and you know all the W. B. J. listeners a they had been so great to the show news talk when I'm five nine\nUh but uh I I committed to doing this but then I got a cardinal Dolan says Brian I'd like you to come to the Al Smith dinner be my guest and be on the day is and it looked like a great time although I Would have had to rented a tale because I don't have tails so I did say myself money\nThat's all right let's go out to the cause Michael W. N. D. B. in Daytona Florida Mike\nHey Brian thanks for taking my call yeah I'm Ryan ... square now is out here say why Ted Kennedy and Dianne Feinstein and all the liberal Democrats\nWant open borders they want to let people in because they want more votes Brian I didn't expect your spokesmen from being liberation or a department to say that because she wants to remain non political but Brian they understand\nGreat are losing they need more votes they get 'em in here they get them on the welfare system and who's going to vote again somebody that sending them to check every month Brian are you\nI did that that that is the theory might I've heard that before I don't think it's going to be effective and the word is the is panic vote is a is remarkably undemocratic considering they usually get about eighty percent of the Hispanic vote and it's got the Democrats panicked but now you have a situation where central and south Americans are coming in and you heard that a hundred thousand\nA hundred thousand a year four thousand a day and they're being able to stay\nAnd they're in our system and who knows who they're voting it on I'll be honest I'm not convinced that there's enough of background check to know who's voting\nOr that would be the plan my Tom W O o K v in Jacksonville Hey Tom\nHow're you doing today good will tell you one\nQuick question you know if the federal government is hands are tied but they also want to a child they got to release but once they're released oh I Can't ... we have like the ... the local share it you know without the child gets to order that way I mean more of a grassroots effort I no\nNo no no unique well to do that you need ice and now ISIS the bad guys or because they've got to go around and do their job but the thing is they didn't violate they just haven't shown up for the hearing and they've melted into our system and they were the banquet bracelets off they've told me last night the ankle bracelets useless\nSo we have no ... there right now catcher releases there you can't keep someone longer than twenty days you can't process them in twenty days therefore the law says let them go\nAnd that is unbelievable it's so easy to solve this solved a Mexican issue because the ... you saw that Ninety nine percent of the people coming in or not Mexicans oh GM's other the Mexicans they solve the problem by making it worse\nAnd bugs Mexico essentially says oh lay Greg W.

Selma and\nHe had been rash at times and I think the question is what you really have done something like this with which again is so evidently discover bleak talking about Fifteen guys traveling in a gulfstream soy to ask for control using that Saudi consulate to torture and this member\n... they could have bought 'em over on the streets of Istanbul but they decided not to do that um he had been hard on the set up and put people in jail you had a lot of his own family or business people at the ... I'm a under a sexually house arrest\nA but man it's taken it to another level and I think many found it to be\nUnbelievable but as the days go on you know what I bet you think about all this will bring\nThe intelligence community senior officials foreclosed testimony it solves the Senate intelligence community has set it up to me as well watch in fact what happened then they'll do it and I no doubt that that the public the u._s. public will will get to know exactly what happened down the road\nHere's Mike Pompeo yesterday I'm not happy with this decision cut twenty six\nWe made clear to them so we make this matter with respect to Mr ... Chevy very seriously they may put an amazing thing to understand the serious nature\nThe parents have been Chevy they also assured me that they will conduct a complete\nSurrounding the show that they will do so in a timely fashion and\nRecord itself will be transferring where everyone is saying\nThere were investigating themselves stand\nRight so it's something to compare it was actually doing some good\nPublic diplomacy with the Saudi saying look it's over a year to do the investigation but\nUnder the surface he told them I'm quite sure\nA lot of people are watching and we all know is such that they use to service director of CIA or I'm sure that that\nHe told the Saudis when he met with ... and king thumb on I'm sure he told them that look we have intelligence collection on that so when you come out with your answer it better be consistent with the fact is we know them the other thing it's probably happening that no one is really talking about is that given the fact that a shell game but a lawful permanent residents stay\nA green card holder or you've got three\nOpen up a spoiler us citizens I'm sure the FBI is engaging with their Turkish and Saturday counterparts not so much to collect evidence but rather to examine the evidence\nOr there's probably a lot happening beneath the surface um that secretary palm pay is not talking about and he's very aware of the potential for collateral damage our bilateral relationship with Saudi Arabia wants to try to avoid that so it's hard to thread that needle five\nWell you you know the deal or Saudi Arabia with the there there are the way they cut the way they treat their people's terrible it's supposedly getting marginally better\nBut we have similar interests we want to counter the rise of Ron in the region now they suddenly are open to putting together a Middle East peace in working with Israel and they also we are concerned but they are more concerned about the rise of the who the rebels will to the Iranians over in neighboring Yemen\nAnd if you're going to control al ... and ISIS a lot of them come from a A R finance from different sources within Saudi Arabia so there was this sense we working together why would they they put that on the line I Would you be as a leader Dan hopping willing to risk that because of this horrific murder\n[noise] so there's there's something that for me have to be immune from whatever tension there isn't a bilateral relationship but I can tell you I served in Russia for five years\nWe maintain some level of collaboration with the Russians on counterterrorism we have to do that a citizen safety and our homeland is that it would be otherwise that ...\nUm so we do have a strategic partnership with the Saudis but at the same time\nWe have um a long history of defending human rights them while we respect the territorial integrity of other\nNations are we also recognize that when human rights are violated\nInternational law there is cause then there is reason uh to intervene the Clinton Administration did nothing about Rwanda for example genocide there that's probably the best example of of a reason to interfere in somebody else's internal affairs in this case\nUm again I think the administration is going to have to draw\nSome sort of a line between what is the greatest value of a strategic partnership with the Saudis that we're going to carry on\n'em and they're not a monolith either I mean we do a lot of work but the intelligence services that should carry on that should be immune to that anything that happens in a bilateral relationship with much um but we have to think about how we manage that relationship and sometimes the best way to manage it is by keeping them close\nUm and uh and delivering the tough messages to them rather than necessarily\nEliminating the partnership on which both nations rely\nYeah but what is I mean we had Lindsey Graham basically calls on the ... called for the resignation of the crown prince I'm not sure that's going to happen crown princes don't usually resign from things but I mean what is the pound of flesh that we need\n... and it's good that you raise the Congress because ah I'm sure that something that secretary palm pale having come from the callers would have told the Saudis look unlike you we have a representative government and\nLike it or not our Congress has got to be out here doing things that you might not like like freezing millet tried to freeze the military sales or imposing sanctions\nAnd the Congress can do a lot of things to make it really hard on our relationship with the Saudis that's why it's incumbent upon Saudi Arabia to deal with that I'm In a trance had way\nIt could as I think your next guest David Ignatius is going to say it could be a real tipping point for our relationship with the Saudis and the relationship in the region this calls for you know the most sophisticated uh diplomacy I'm Glad my um pay us at the helm if there's somebody who could manage to pay him but he's going to have to manage\nThe value of a strategic relationship and then what is inconsistent for us as bad as the support of human rights and and dealing and holding the Saudis accountable for what appears to be a critically murder\nBut they do want to vote the\nDay and do you think is a major ... thing here is to show every journalist out there not only will we kill you we will do it in a painful way and we would do it any we're not used to when you come to Saudi Arabia but you're not safe anywhere is that the message that it's worth giving\n... right well that the question I've been asking myself the unknowns in this case or what were the orders that were given to those Fifteen guys who gave the orders for the orders carried out as they were intended to be carried out\nAh you know those are those are really important questions to be out and then post mortem who report it among those Fifteen guys back to the kingdom I think our intelligence community knows the answers to those things and the conclusion that the dark side of me\nPast to draw the conclusion you just drew which if they did they discover of always do that all the other journalists corn journalistic take care of their internal dissent by themselves but this is about\nSaudi Saudi to live overseas and others as well what do dare to express their the center of the kingdom this like your fake um and that is you know look journalists are under siege in Turkey that the irony of this thing president aired on um is it lily white but\nHe's the worst on yeah and and so you know he's holding up the Saudis as a bad example but my goodness the the ease that as bad or worse and imposing a you know a great level of control over the media there um and frankly loved journalists are great people um\nHe'll go out and do the artist jobs without diplomatic immunity and the toughest places and when we don't defend them uh where certainly not standing for for human rights large but we're also not standing for freedom of the press on which our democracy you know is baked\nThat came to him so I was Eighteen Saudis are being held the suspects but Turkish officials claim it's the work of a Saudi aside from insurance for\nThe ... friday you know the twenty seven year old kidnapping of Nineteen year old making woman in Nineteen Ninety One\nThe GB yard arrested
