J. J. in uh in Arizona Fred\nHow you doing Brian gray agree with the previous caller I mean you have to look at just from a purely analytical basis who benefits from this instability between us and the other and Saudi Arabia [noise]\nWell a ... so you could artificial intelligence you say it's outstripping the human mind the human body in what way\nI mean you know almost every month or so we hear about and you eh um\nAnd you achievement official intelligence\nOr doing things better than human beings but only playing a game or driving the car oh diagnosing diseases or deciding who gave a loan toy multi multi gauge to more and more than you apply to a bank to get low enough\nThe entity that process says the request and decide whether to give you a loan or not he's not a human being it's an algorithm\nSo interesting are also people get her nerves I remember President Obama gave that speech saying hey we you know bank tellers are needed any more because of ATMs almost cursing the advent of ATMs but you cannot hold on to the past right you have to stay ahead of the curb so where does some of the Twenty one things we should be looking at in the twenty first century\nIf you talk about the job market then obviously the will be a new job but we don't know if it will be enough new jobs\nAnd the biggest problem or fall will be to retrain and to basically reinvent yourself when we used to situation when you do most of your learning when you're young and then for the rest of your life you you rely on the knowledge on the skills that you acquire with a young person\nBut in the coming decades they will not be enough\nYou will have to reinvent yourself\nYou'll you'll live several times not just once\nBecause the automation revolution will not be a one time event let's say twenty twenty five\nLike fifty percent of job disappear new jobs emerge though if you refuse but eventually everything settles down into a new ... Graham wants to be like this it would be kind of infer bigger disruptions\nEvery ten years you basically have to reinvent yourself if you want to stay in the game and we don't know if we have the educational system or if even we have the\nPsychological stability the psychological balance\nTo to live up in such a stressful world\nSo interesting you bring up a story we Google for example so you have a you have the health insurance and you told you know you don't smoke or life insurance you don't smoke will use you sneak is smoking a cigarette will Google has a way of finding out that you did that Nixon your policies cancelled we're living in a surveillance and all he did it to ourselves\nIn ... one of them maybe the most important thing if you don't read the book the most important thing to know about\nLeaving the twenty first century either we are now though I mean those we are animals that can be hacked\nUp of talk about ... king your computer or your smartphone your email account but he says nothing the real story is the ability to hack human beings what does it mean to me I'll go read them\nGot his own you enough data not just about what you buy and what would you go about you what's happening inside your body together enough data\nTo get to know you better than you know yourself because the crucial point one some I'll go with them out there\nKnows better than you know yourself it cannot only put the decisions and choices and makes choices on your behalf\nIt can basically make them for the most important decision in life for people\nTo study in college or work to work even who Leary now looking is a federally dystopian eat them even today increasingly rely on I'll go read them is that in order to make decisions that used to be made by human humans\nWe rely on Facebook that if you knew we rely on Amazon to tell us what to buy you rely on Netflix to tell us what to watch how we rely on on a Google to tell us what is true\nBut increasingly people will turn to uncle rhythms even to tell them things like what the study or who to marry\nIs you're saying and lastly what happens to religion what happens to patriotism nationalism where where does that go in this new environment\nThey still have a lot of importance\nBut the key thing to realize they think that the biggest problems we face a global problems in nature and therefore cannot be sold just on the level of a single country you\nWill need stronger global cooperation in order to deal with them because\nOf this in the case of nuclear war and the climate change but it's also true of psychological disruption if you if you want to regulate the explosive potential of artificial intelligence of bioengineering you can't do it on the level of one country because nobody would like to stay behind\nIf for example you think that starting to engineered human babies is a bad idea and you ban it in the United states what do you do if the Chinese are doing it and then I think the youth super human by the south and very soon you will be forced to break your own band because you will have to stay behind\nAnd it's the same development like Oklahoma flipping fifth and ...\n... ... if we if we want and we let me certainly shoot\nRegulate these blow the new technologies it can only be done to global cooperation from nationalism is still in it what is going up to the very important but\nIt should be um Olbermann that they should show added to it shouldn't be that realization that we all strong global cooperation human kind not to be able to regulate and too late for five days in men for the Lucian\nYeah it's so hard we're not cooperating with each other let alone with other ... uh we'd get we'll get nations who are so different to get along but who knows maybe we'll make the adjustment

this morning in the pages of the Washington Post\nAnd and this is a little crazy I don't know exactly what he's talking about but the president of Honduras accused on named political groups\nIncluding the caravan was based on lies to cause problems in the country of Honduras he said quote there are sectors that want to destabilize the country but we will be decisive and we will not allow it he says\nUh also the foreign ministry of that country has told a alleges that people are lured to join the migration with false promises of you know what you're going to wind up getting a visa in Mexico and then you're going to be able to ask for asylum in the United states so uh the foreign ministry of Honduras is saying\nYou know just hop on the line and Mexico is going to let us go through and then you're going to apply for asylum and that's one of the loopholes\nThat ah Tom Homan was talking about if you get to our southern border and you apply for asylum the United states government with laws on the books has got to go ahead and take a look at your application and whether or not you should be allowed in you know here's the thing\nCurrently Mexico says that anybody with travel

they're going to go through standard immigration procedures\nAnd the Associated Press yesterday I talked to a number of the migrants in this particular care of and\nNot a single one had a passport\nThing about that no one had a passport so what's Mexico going to do when they're knocking on that\nOr and they say okay uh we need to apply for asylum what's Mexico going to do the president has made it very clear that Mexico let these people in there's a possibility he will mobilize the U.S military enclosed our southern border to them that is extraordinary [noise]\nBut as I said earlier it is politics and uh we're about to play a cut with Newt Gingrich from last night on the Sean Hannity show\nAnd he sees not only the national security angle he sees the or the midterms as well looming large just three weeks away and here are two words that Newt says it's all about\nI think two words are going to define the night of the two thousand Eighteen election and an extreme which one is Kevin ... and the other is caravan\nAnd the combination of anger over how the left smeared engaged in character assassination lied used bullying tactics with judge Kavanaugh is going to be one part of this and the degree to watch the left is eager\nTo have three thousand people in a caravan cross the American border break American law recognizing that if that happens next caravan will even bigger and the caravan after that will be even bigger\nAnd I think the American people are going to reject both the way they treated cabinet and the way they are dealing with the border and I think those will end up being\nThe reasons the Republicans keep the house and dramatically increase the number of senators they have\nSo think about it or if Newt is right and uh so many Americans already have an opinion formed on Mr Kavanaugh who now sits on the Supreme Court a lot of Democrats are steam that he was able to be confirmed by the U.S Senate there are a lot of Republicans who are schemes\nAt at the treatment and the investigation and the allegations that were never proven were made no doubt by a number of women but uh we're never proven according to the FBI background checks so you've got\nA the the the country motivated on that but keep in mind the midterms aren't for another three weeks\nFor the most part what do we have a looming large you've got this caravan\nAnd just think about it uh currently the Caribbean is a four thousand people is about Thirteen hundred miles to United States and there are some who have suggested just about the time people are going to vote on election day\nOn the first Tuesday in November that's about the time that this caravan could be arriving at our southern border and keep in mind last time this happened and um it was a number of months ago where it became so dramatic when it was a learned that\nThe federal government or under laws enacted during the Obama administration were enforcing the laws in the land and that was to separate families at our southern border and there was a a you know it it was a shocking to many people because they did not realize that that was happening [noise]\nIs there a possibility this caravan could actually be at our southern border at about that time and that would inflame both sides once again because it really is a binary choice\nYou look at the Republicans are saying we need a strong border we need to keep people from coming in who have no business doing that but then again you've got the Democrats saying essentially they are a party of open borders let people who qualify come on in but\nAt the same time you got a number of Democrats\nIn the ... a strategic positions in the communications department at the all of these Democrats offices and they're saying you know what\nThis is a loser issue for us so whatever we do let's not talk about immigration before the midterms\nBut we're talking about it here in the Bronx kill me Joe we'd love to hear your point of view

thousand people heading towards our southern border\nAnd it sounds like unless Mexico is able to stop them\nThe president of the United states may call up the military to close the border\nWe put this

personally\nWhat I personally think Trump is doing a great job is covering a lot of areas if everybody that Republican in office right now would have been working as hard as we wouldn't be in a lot of this luck\nBut I Will say that's not just fires calling up the military for the border\nIf that's what that's what he asked and I'm pretty sure most of America what back in\nThe other thing I'd like

what do you make of one of the other things we were talking with a rich Lowry about a little while ago is what's going on in Saudi Arabia and it looks as if\nThey could be covering up the fact that uh the crown prince of Saudi Arabia ordered that his hit men decapitated and take the fingers off of and then just kill a this Washington Post correspondent a rather a columnist in Turkey\nWhere do you what do you think about what is going on with that dynamic because so many people here in the United states Keith are asking the president in the United states to get\nTough and do something about Saudi Arabia\nWell and what happens unfortunate if it happened we need to get to the facts of course however I think a plane sanctions and the ... situation would be rather inconsistent\nI mean if we're going to do it the one we should do it all I mean just this past August we at Iran order seven journalist to be jailed and flogging awake at our coverage China just in February detained relatives of three United States and journalists Andy you ask a green card holder for their coverage\nOr Serena sham she was an American journalist who in twenty fourteen was killed by the Turkish government the drug and regime after the two days after they accuse her of being a spy\nOn I mean in fact turkey under their German regime they've been one of the worst offenders when it comes to

Mexico doesn't stop them in Mexico\nOr we might actually send the U.S military to our southern border so that some of the stuff that's going on right now also we've got this mess in Saudi Arabia

killed in that conflict we know he went in we know he didn't come out are based on the reports and the information that we're receiving\nThat something possibly happen took a show he inside the ... but they're still waiting for American verification remembered CIA it's still collecting information overseas on people are still trying to figure out what happened here but remember just fighting Saudi Arabia pushing a divide between this administration and Saudi Arabia\nWorks for the benefit of turkey it worked for the benefit of you write it works for the benefit of different players within the region particularly cuts are and they're going to be looking at this very very closely what was the reason behind that and\n... ... he did have huge problems with the Saudi royal family I'm at and there were they were very angry I Believe\nBecause he was in what they called the third rate went up\nSending out the Saudi king and remember this has been a big deal they got rid of the four three they're pushing the you know to get rid of the third rain we saw the rats or the Saudi Government wants to keep bring one and bring to a print Solomon was behind as a show he was also a member of the Muslim Brotherhood there were a lot of issues there are things\nThat have not come up a in a lot of stories um but obviously white there there needs to be some justice for this absolutely thoroughly\nGruesome the gruesome nature of of what happened to him and whether or not he was killed by a the Saudi Government directly or by somebody that took matters into their own hands at a an interrogation gone awry so\nRich and and so they say you know it was an accidental\nMurder you know they were interrogating him and things got out of hand but now we know there's a seven minute tape of barely it's gruesome well we're just going to say that for them but you know here's here's what you gotta wonder\nHow often first of all it's ... if the royal family somehow involved with crown prince or some some other permutations how often if they've done stuff like this and simply gotten away with it\nAbsolutely ... and I can't even tell you how many times I grew up in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia I remember when I'm there was a huge uproar at threats of the Saudi Government at OPEC\nRaising the oil prices when the princess Saudi Arabia was executed in a soccer field along with the man she tried to flee Saudi Arabia with\nHer ... she wanted to marry her lover and they caught her at the airport uh it uh you know she was dressed as a man or to try to escape ... she couldn't marry the man that she loved and her grandfather at ... at the time uh took them into custody a\nAsked her to denounce her love for him and that she could survive she refused\nA date beheaded her lover in the middle of the soccer field and they and they asked her with a gun or from what I remember and I remember there were two British reporters who would not get and film the whole thing they used a ah a cigarette pack\nTo hide their camera to take pictures or at when it went public I mean it was a huge uproar you but it happened quite often the kingdom operate very differently on a different a\nLevel of ... of judicial system or anything else the monarchy operate differently but in a blender kids or\nSomebody that we rely on 'em and right now particularly with the issue with Iran and Israel and the growth at the Shiite regime in the middle east it's very complex\nMotives than just a mess\nIt's it's just a ... no doubt about it so we are talking to a\nQuarter you know over the last year she has broken so many stories choose an investigative reporter and so you know it it looked like Rod Rosenstein was going to be going up to Capitol Hill I think last week last Thursday is going to meet you\nGoing to talk about that New York times story about how he had suggested he would wear a wire and they needed to use the you know all sorts of a\nConstitutional tricks to get rid of the ... the United states and it sounds like when it at the eleventh hour when the congressional investigators and their staffs said okay we'd like you to come in you're going to be under oath egos\nI'm under oath ... wait a minute I thought we just have a little uh informal conversation with Mr good lead I didn't realize there would be a lot of people with Bain sticking out their neck one asked me questions the very limited ...\nI Would have to be actually telling the truth\nIn your latest story at a certain quarter dot com is congressional sources concerned Judiciary Committee threat to subpoena Rosenstein is empty so in other words\nYou know it sounds like well you know in front of the cameras they say we're going to beat him but that's not going to happen\n[noise] no I ... you know this is what's so frustrating\nTalking to a number of sources that are I guess we could say last few years investigating this right uh and\nPutting the pieces together one of the most frustrating aspects of that for a vote those congressional members and those investigators and reporters like me and judicial watch fighting for document is the fact that there is no teeth\nEver to anything that they say who is investigating the investigators Steve this is what's so frustrating we have Rod Rosenstein who's overseeing the special counsel we know that\nAccording to my sources Robert was wrapping up its pro we've seen it you know he's he's going to issue a report after the election but we also have all this other information that that Cory out information that is by far the most shocking\nEvidence that we've seen in modern political history people working ... versus ... like a shadow government to remove a duly elected president of the United states and in fact the outcome of an election so\nNow we have all this information we have James Baker who by the way I Capitol Hill now uh with with testified to Congress he's the former general counsel very close to James cone H met with Andrew McCain meets with Lisa Page after me it made two\nThousand Seventeen with Rod Rosenstein and they're telling him look Rod Rosenstein has this idea a record a President Trump there's also some talk about invoking the twenty Fifth Amendment and apparently there's two other administration officials involved in this town\nAnd it's and it's shocking but he won't want he doesn't want to answer questions about that he doesn't want to talk about this the American people still don't have the documents that\nThat they that they should have\nThat they should have the transparency that they need to know what was going on and as far as I can see the only accountability it's for those people that supported President Trump those are the people that work at the gate and write that none of the other evidence is is is being investigated and there's nobody overseeing that\nIt is just such a mess a if you want to read the very latest I always go to Sarah Carter died because she knows

Mexico quickly uh responded okayed it unfortunate at that age it later arrested or the the people that killed\nYou know I I Know and we talk this morning as well about the fact that Mexico\n... obviously the Mexico doesn't want to be on the bad side of the part of the United states like they were back in April where the president said hey Mexico you gotta do something about stopping this because they they are saying today that they will not let anybody from this from this group or anybody period\nInto the country of Mexico unless they've got a passport or the proper documents\nFor that was good because as I said this morning [noise]\nAh people from Central America cannot travels through Mexico without a transit visa and they only get a transit future they have some sort of extreme documents so\nLooks like they're doing the right up let's say they are saying the rights and just let you make sure they do is say al ... walk the walk to talk but uh you know that's why I said is more into ... issue\nTransit visa to Central America and turn on the border or they can claim asylum in Mexico as I said this morning they're no longer a on a show they obviously escaped whatever fear of persecution there claiming the head of the hunger as they cross to another country Guatemala Mexico there was no reason to come to the states\n[noise] well here's the thing time if they ... and you know how this works\nIf these people are able to say okay I don't have the travel documents but I've got my driver's license from Guatemala or Honduras\nSo I'm going to apply for asylum in Mexico and then go okay a then could they essentially cross through Mexico and wind up at our southern border saying\nHey yeah we'd like asylum here instead\nOf a say anybody's getting a ... to ... and that's that's that's all you got to talk about the underlying cause of all of this\nIs is a is a carrier of the Democrats in Congress to close loopholes and Jake actually I as I said what are shy director out on how many times the secretary was up on the hill and we talked about a loophole such as you get your take families were for twenty days or less as best I Love to see a judge they get released they never show\nA court if they just dropped the court they ignore the judge's order ones are so ... know deterrent to this illegal activity why would they stop I mean so this is Congress ultimate failure and and that's why it's so important\nThat you know Republicans maintain control both houses ... ... if if they don't it's only going to get worse because I think there are a majority Republican support Donald Trump in his immigration policies or another\nCar seats that dresses she asylum a lot people collect claim asylum and uh they're coached by the organization is shaped Yuki phrases which gets them approved at the border\nOr once they show up in court ... court eighty percent of the lose your cases so what Congress needs to do with race at asylum ... or so it can't easily meant so much thought\nYeah Tom we're speaking of Tom Homan the former acting high stricter about this Caribbean time the president of Honduras said that there are unnamed political groups that have organized if they say other sectors that want to destabilize the country but we will be decisive and we will not allow it\nHe's suggesting politics are involved to make a Honduras look bad but at the same time people are doing the political calculations here in the United states and they're going", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Brian Kilmeade & Friends", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "19"}
