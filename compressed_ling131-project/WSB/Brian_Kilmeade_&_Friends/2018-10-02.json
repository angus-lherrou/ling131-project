know\nTonight his attorney releasing a statement which the judge has been interviewed by the FBI but his interview has not been completed\nOr so we'll get to that surely so this is a ... just to review what happened on Friday after we left the show\nI'm heading home friday afternoon eastern time\nAnd I see this so I'm watching without the sound Jeff Flake get up tap Chris Coons on the shoulder and they walked out\nWhere it is this something going on we watched Jeff Flake and there's a story behind that somehow these two activists who claimed to be sexually assaulted I have no idea starts screaming at Jeff Flake and what does he stuck in an elevator with the door open and alive CNN camera rolling\nI'm not say could be totally coincidence which he's supposed to do push right away and go in the elevator especially when she's screaming sexual assault and there's no threat he's traveling by himself and put out a a a tweet or a press release saying I Will vote for judge Kavanaugh\nThis comes out and they target him by the time he gets downstairs he has a change of heart and he says I'm going to vote for capital out of committee but I Will not vote for him on the floor which could be critical in\nThe end tank the entire ... nomination until I get a get a five day seven day FBI investigation they cut the deal\nGrassley pass into McConnell mechanical the White House the White House calls the FBI game on you knew it as soon as this investigation with every Democrat was asking for was implemented they were going to raise the bar and complain that it wasn't brought enough why we have an artificial timeframe on this why can't we just let it go\nOn and on and on and that was\nThe story over the last few days and it was so so very predictable and you know what he's already made progress they've already interview the Yale student Debbie Ramirez who is now in her fifties the your members thirty\nThree years ago in freshman year she says it Brett Kavanaugh even though she was beyond drunk exposed himself and he couldn't remember going to the New Yorker story right away and then she thought about it and thought about it well now she sat down with the FBI evidently she's got some people to operate\nThat story but that doesn't stop Democrats were saying this isn't a good enough investigation here at center messy horrible no cut for\nEven seven days that fatty now for them to limit the I answer the question that that really have\nA [laughter] I live in\nThe far side of that kind of the nation and all of us are expecting the I\nKnow it's the same type of Justice Thomas investigation would they need a hill they're going to take in the relevant people\nUh Ruth Brett Kavanaugh from thirty plus years ago and that going to put together a thrill to just like Kavanaugh said just like the FBI always does just like Joe Biden was educating us in the Nineteen nineties why are you surprised\nAnd then Jeff Flake listening to Jeff Flake who I like I think he did some great work you basically saved the life of Steve ... at least some of those on the field I think it's a good person\nI don't understand why he just can't tolerate Trump but I couldn't understand how Mitt Romney at of everybody couldn't tolerate Trump that Tom Cotton good that Lindsey Graham could that McCain I don't understand it but here is Jeff Flake has always been a conservative not a moderate\nGet tape Bush\nStaffer who the great ... go judicial record get them in front of them wants to vote for him but because of these other transgressions he pulls back now he's on the fence then he's going to set to vote so are you sorry his moral compass and his worry kind of just got the better of him and then he says this last night\nSenator Flake

I think that his moral compass\nLet them this way that he wanted to save American government when if he decided to stay in office or if this was years three of his six year term he wouldn't have dreamed of doing that why\nWhat Susan Collins did Murkowski did Corker was considering it\nNow your mansion and others thinking about doing it but Jeff Flake did this whole historic move and said if I wasn't retiree I wouldn't have been able to do it I don't get it and the Chris Coons sits down on sixty minutes who I like\nBut I thought would be the one that Democrat they would say you know I I think having a you know I'm a moderate to liberal Democrat but he's so he's really confident like his record I'm going to stand behind him his name Chris Coons is pulling for Jeff Flake to buck his party\nWell as Chris Coons going to vote for judge Kavanaugh regardless of how the investigation came out now he says he was too angry when he came out\nTo be angry why wouldn't you be angry you spend

thinking this since we're up in our country apart\nAnd they are just like that Senator Jeff flake who really couldn't raise his voice for some reason sat down on sixty minutes actually Chris Coons as a man above it all I'll listen I don't think a Jeff Flake has a mean bone in his body I just don't I don't understand why certain people can't get by a President Trump's\nApproach to politics I Know it's a typical but he's just somebody that was just destined to find them along the way but he's a conservative got elected as a conservative not as a modern as a conservative who doesn't like Trump I get it but\nThis is something that I thought that he said you know morally he's a Mormon I saw a lot of things happening here what if what if she is telling the truth I'm just going to give a five day pause I thought there was nothing that on Sunday and veteran reasonable about it\nI'm going to give you another chapter to that but I Want to bring in my next guest Michael good when New York post columnist his last article I just read a as soon as it came out yesterday actually on the elliptical Kevin O's hearings our national disaster and the worst is yet to come Michael\nWelcome back good morning Brian thank you very much was it a disaster for\nSlate to tap Coons take a walk outside and cut this seven day delay or was it a disaster from the get go [noise]\n... yeah look I think what Tunisia inflate it was part of the continuing disaster a look just are not to recap the entire thing but\nI think for for Kavanaugh to be dirty up the way the Democrats to decide let's face it this is a political that they're running is like a political campaign and what do you do in political campaigns these days\nYou define your opponent and how do you define your opponent the dirtiest things you can find about him or her and so that's what they've done to Brett Kavanaugh the dirty him up as if as if\nThis is a political campaign rather than a process by which we elevate someone to the highest court\nSo what they've done is they've taken it to the lowest common denominator and they're not done yet\nAnd so I think that what flaking Coons did typically flake let's say because I think Coons\nMay well be a decent man but he was clearly on the Democrats' side in this dirty job um I I think what flake did was World War does who who flung most mud and let's not forget Dianne Feinstein withholding that letter\nOr imagined that how what a storm this is how will need unleash the doctor for its claims Feinstein had a letter and met with Kavanaugh privately and never mentioned it now suddenly it shakes the world I mean where is her judgment\nDate I Love people who said this old Brett Kavanaugh has got to be investigated okay fine but\nThat's a good cabinet and what he said and go back to see if he did drink and not not that I think it's relevant if you drink at Seventeen sexual assault and I think is\nA but if you didn't commit a crime but you had a few beers that you admit to I don't understand why they drove in but if you're gonna go back and look at behavior then go back and investigate Dr Ford what would you do in a tenth grade how many ... did you lie about other things along the way who else did she do who else did she tell that day\nBefore we do that I Want to back up on Jeff Flake as much as I I met him talk to them and I thought to be able to overcome his distaste\nFor President Trump he never did and now he left politics\nHe lost all credibility to me I thought he acted out of more his moral compass it made him stand up and thought he could heal everybody but listen to how what he said to Scott Palys question\nSenator Flake you've announced that you're not running for reelection and I wonder could you have done this\nIf you were running out of ... not a chance\nBecause politics has become too sharp to pardon me there's no value to reaching across the aisle there's no currency for that anymore there's no incentive what\nIs he talking about I thought he was just doing the right thing and yet I wasn't doing the right thing he was doing the right thing because it doesn't matter he's out there anyway so it means nothing\nWell not only that Brian I'm\nI think he's being dishonest they're he wants to run for president he talked about that and and there is among many I think Republicans this idea that you can be a Republican and be anti Trump at the same time I mean the never Trump voters will love Jeff Flake and I think that's so this is\nThis is a political move disguised as a moral move now politics can sometimes be moral but let's see I I think flake as being dishonest when he denies any political that just as an anti political move this is not anti political for him it's very personal and very political\nFive five and am

been interviewed although they say the judge interview was ongoing Dario holding on ABC News\nDo free to point\nWhile President Trump said he had no worries about an FBI review of judge Kavanaugh I'd like it to go quickly Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell was making it clear that he wants a Senate vote on Kavanaugh sued ... will be voting this way but to do that by Saturday the GOP wouldn't have to start the procedural action tomorrow\nBut Ron why in the sixth background checks throughout his career did his high school education or a a a ledge or a college education or ... alleged why did they not come up\n[noise] well look the these backgrounds Brian start with an ss eighty six form that's been in the news of late certainly sense or Mike Flynn's legal dramas or it's a lengthy for they they go into the details of your employment your education they collect\nUh your your grades and and you look into educational information but really they they generally aren't going back before the age of Eighteen\nOr less it's for an FBI employee who is starting out in the organization that you know the age of twenty two at the age of twenty\nBomb and so in these successive backgrounds that they've had now reportedly I guess half a dozen they're really going back to the last background investigation and going forward so this most recent one is is going back to his last background investigation looking at as he moved does he have a different employer\nOr had his finances changed and they're going forward in time they're not going back thirty six years to say you know did a teacher say bad things about him so if they would've caught it would have been more likely caught way back then\nOr it would have been more likely caught if somebody who you know had some derogatory information on on Mr Kavanaugh\nWould have surfaced you know ten years ago Twenty years ago that they would have had a much better opportunity\nSo when it comes down on friday how soon does he have to do is the FBI get where they're going to be they're going to be um they're going to be pulled off the bench they're going to be involved do they asked the White House\nWho they should interview and with the scope should be\n[noise] in in a case like this I think the answer's definitely yes Brian you know first there's the traditional scope of character and associates at references and and a financial information and loyalty to the U.S government those are all the standard questions\nBut here you have really a horse of a different color you have a have allegations made by\nAt least one person and now multiple people that go back\nDecades and and so it's going to be up to the White House to tell the FBI here see additional scope of work we want you to conduct and I understand that that's probably being coordinated\nAs much with house the Senate Judiciary committee and and the FBI is going to be told look here's here's the range of issues we want you to cover and if it's outside of that\nMaybe come back to us and tell us what what you found is that you found some additional derogatory or or you have additional\n... that come from these leads but I think they're going to be constrained by what the the ... ... what the White House wants them to do because Justice Thomas who just took a few days you need to heal\nSo they looked into it they bring both they bring 'em both and so that's what the Democrats are calling for hey why don't you take a couple of days\nAnd take a look at this new information that came up even though you had a month ago but that's where a different conversation so we understand that the FBI has already interviewed the New Yorker woman Deborah Ramirez who claims to be very drunk or freshman year\nAnd Brett Kavanaugh exposed himself a suppose himself to her\n... ah what do you take of that because she's on the record saying I was so drunk I did take weeks to remember what I saw and then she decided to come forward and the New York times didn't want to publish it of all things New Yorker did\nThey start with Debbie Ramirez from there she says I have reportedly I have three people that witness is does the FBI go find those three people or did they just right down here are their names here their addresses here's what she said they said\nYeah I think if that is all on the record now they would be having a back and forth with the White House saying look you know cure our\nThree ... much like they would with with Dr Ford if she can provide additional ... fact witnesses who who they say were present at that time\nI think that uh they would be having that conversation with the White House counsel's office and saying look here here's a we have we have a list of you know additional potential witnesses we can go there today\nA and with their cooperation we can have them interviewed by the close of business by by dark tonight\nUm I I ... and again it's going to be right what does the White House agreed to it in this case and the white can the FBI do that work\nAbsolutely they can um this is not the case in my mind where the FBI is going to grab you know three hundred agents and say\nWe're going to go interview every one of Brett Kavanaugh's classmates as is graduating seniors from Georgetown Prep or wherever I don't think it's a situation where we do that but I think if you have obviously age that can either shed light\nOr refute an allegation they they certainly could do it as the question is where the White House want\nThem to the bottom line is do you think they should well look I\nThink we have an obligation was what if I'm putting somebody on the highest score to land to to take a credible allegations and flush them out and that can be done quickly\nIt could be that those allegations wash out that that the person making the allegation is not credible or when they have an FBI agent sitting across from them they say look you know I I embellish that a lot or I you know I was really drunk I think it was him it could have been one of you know other people many other people [noise] uh\nUh you know it's it this is an opportunity to flush it out sitting across from an FBI agent or more\nThan I Know I'm just saying how extensive you want to be and then you wonder what's going on here or I'll give you an example a run this Roberta Kaplan says attorney for one potential witness Elizabeth were so or restore she's a former\nGirlfriend of mark judge member mark judge or the admitted alcoholic with cancer and depression he did not want to go public but now he says awesome it to an FBI interview but now we're going back to his high school girlfriend\nDoes that sound fair and your ... your answer might be yes\nBut I'm just saying if you think about this just think if you're on the other end of this microphone you the FBI expert I'm Talking about it now everybody out there do they have an a girlfriend that might want to come out from Thirty years ago and destroy your hopes of becoming the next CEO\nOr the next ... general manager\nOr or or the next coach of uh NC double A. team because it's something you did in high school according to the girlfriend of your former friend [noise]\nRight I I think that's the very troubling part of this process and we collectively and and\nThe Congress especially really needs to put some thought into what do we want this process to be how long do we want it to take place over what what is the scope of the investigation\nAre we looking for snow why are we looking for somebody who was never touched a beer does know what is beer smells like a at any time in their life we ought to ask some hard questions after this what do we want this process to look like\nA well he apparently already we've had to have asked it already\nAbsolute well we should have asked it already but you know this is a cautionary note for potential witnesses say look this is a a three ring circus doing you know just cue the music\nAnd start the animals um neither do I want to be part of this do you know the FBI knocks on my door do I say very politely thank you but no thank you I I don't want to be part of this process or are people willing to to bring their own name into it have their own lives opened up for a question that's what's going on now\nCongress ought to be asking that and and and the media ought to be asking it and all of us as Americans who are serving say what do we need here what do we want as a process\nSo I'd Alan Dershowitz on today who said you know I he was outraged these high school things were coming up what he does say the FBI should investigate he said that on Thursday last Thursday his credit\nHe came on today and he said I Want to I guess I Would start with Julie sweat Nick she's the one who said they were talking about force gang rapes\nThat he witnessed in was spiking punch putting drugs in punch so let's talk to Julie sweat neck right away the Michael ... client and let's see if any of these allegations are credible and then work our way backwards towards somebody that seemed authentic Dr Ford\nHow would you feel run high scores an FBI investigator going with their ... suggestion\n[laughter] well look I I I think we they ought to examine credible allegations and they ought to be putting some thought into allegations that seem like they're not credible maybe they point to flaws in the process we you you you know part of the FBI's role is to look at\n... evidence of bias evidence that suggests the person is making it up from whole cloth a ... again it goes to how long do we want this process to to continue how expansive should it be\nHow do I characterize entered and try to process a personal bias that oh yeah it turns out that guy broke up with me or he said something that I did like in Nineteen Seventy two\nIs that should that be part of the consideration or should it not be again by you know the FBI's role here is fact finding they will challenge people if they have something to challenge the Mondale test their recollections\nBut at the end of the day we could end up with you know a credibility\nA back and forth a exchange about somebody's credibility I and the overall nature and and and uh uh people's taking different people taking different views about somebody's reputation and their character that may be completely unfair\nAnd

what we're we at now\n[noise] well we're going to see I mean I just for real quickly on the hearings themselves me it was a it was even by the new standard of of news and drama surrounding the Trump Administration this was this was off the charts and you had I mean you talked to people\nAre Democrats liberals progressives they watched a doctor for testifying and said there were weeping they were they were you know touch them so deeply there weeping\nAnd then an hour later I heard the same thing for conservatives men and women who said they watched\nJudge Kavanaugh's testimony and they were they were sobbing because they felt that he had been so wrong in this was such an industry puts\nSelf number one would fewer assaulted and it affected your life she had to put two doors in the front

was looking at right there front and center that's the way I Would have acted right or wrong and it\nIt is absolutely and I said this earlier I think you know we'll see where the FBI investigation wrapped ends up my suspicion is that it's going to uncover nothing new and barring some big new bombshell I think I think we'll go to a vote and he'll be confirmed but\nBecause we have we're still we're going to be left in the same place we were when we started you know people say Dr Ford was credible but she has no corroborating evidence that she had just one person who could corroborate her story might be a different conversation on the other side you have judge Kavanaugh says\nI've been wrongly accused right and there's not a ... or if there if there was something else in his background right he's been thirty six years served at the highest levels of government not a hint of scandal not a hint of impropriety with women until two weeks before his nomination and suddenly the floodgates up and he's got all these allegations against him so\nI'm In that circumstance right we have two people who are credible or people think are credible but there is no you have to look to the evidence and there just isn't any evidence but\nI think what Democrats have done is turn this into\nAlmost if you if you followed the news coverage of this they turn it into a referendum on his white male privilege and the fact that he went to the lead institutions and he thinks he can get away with anything and uh you know now it's about how much he drank and whether he was downplaying his drinking and whether he blacked out um it's sort of gone [noise]\nAnd you hear Democrats not they want the rest of the stuff investigated and the Trump White house and Senate and Mitch McConnell are saying look we're going to stick to the ... for people to specific allegation and I'm so we'll see what the FBI says in in a few days\nYeah we will but it's already expanded Debbie Ramirez was spoken to last I by the FBI agents for about three hours at which time she says I have three witnesses it say that I got really drunk tonight and he exposed himself to me my freshman year in jail now does the FBI go OK needs to be two or three people\nAnd now we have to find out and she admitted already huge gaps in my memory I was so drunk and took me a weak according to New York magazine team remember this now she says the FBI and she says I have three more witnesses okay does the FBI go do that\nIt's expanded now evidently doctor for its friends 'cause see I don't remember anything but I trust her I bet if she said it out but it happened\nBut as you know the prosecutors Arizona prosecutor wrote a five page mental they're published in the Washington Post that said if it was me I Would not prosecute this case because we don't know how she got there we don't know how she got home we don't know where it was we don't know who invited her we have no proof they even knew each other\nAnd the other person there are a mark judge floor ... character as he would admit said it never happened right well he's going to give up to a kit or he's going to give up to a testimony but\nThe question is do you stop it re mirrors and say I got to use ... story do you see what the Ford problem again corroborate at which time you handed over to both sides and what do they do with it\nAgain we're going to be right back where we started and Democrats are going to want more than ... they're going to want more investigation and they're not going to want to vote\n'em and Republicans are going to I think say\nAfter after having a ceded to the idea of a delay for one week um that look this could go on we can just would go on forever so we got to put a stop to the process and we got we got to sit down and take a vote that's what Mitch McConnell is going to do and the question is you know how to how does Jeff Flake how does the U.S Susan Collins had as Lisa Murkowski how they vote on\nAnd that's all and that's all it is and I think Tom Cotton said yesterday the re Democrats he accused and they said they have weaponized you to movement\nShort and to me too movement look\nThere is you know we're in an interesting point in time right I've got daughters I got sons um if something happened to my daughter I wouldn't want her to come forward I Would want her to be heard and I wouldn't want her to be believed if if she had you know evidence to prove to back it up um I also\nWould not want for my son to be wrongly accused falsely accused with nothing more than someone else's accusation and no evidence to support it so I think it's um\nIt is unfortunate that this allegation came forward the way that it did\nIt could've been handled in a completely different manner if if Diane Feinstein had done the right test you write this could have been handled it could've been handled confidentially it could have been handled well within the timeframe that we're talking about the wouldn't have resulted in any delays but I think um because of the way she handled it we ended up in this mess\nWhen we come back ... politics dot com has got to be telling us who stands to benefit ah depending on
