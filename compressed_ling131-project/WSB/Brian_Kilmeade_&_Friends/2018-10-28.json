Know you don't worry about it now you just keep on paying it no one's going to touch you can go bankrupt do you want [noise] oh okay I don't worry about it that that part\nIs yeah and that's usually the case is I assets are deal I dealt with with the bankruptcy court so you file for bankruptcy and the court looks at how much money you old versus what you have and then if it's a liquidation the splits up the assets but cars are almost never\nEver put into a bankruptcy unless you've got a Bentley or a Rolls Royce\nA that is a paid out that's been paid for but other than that what you have users exemptions where you're allowed to have a personal car and usually whenever there's alone I as in his case you owe more money let's say you buy a car for twenty thousand dollars\nOn and so you you you go ahead and arrange a payment schedule I'm you finance a car well the second you drive off a lot it's Fifteen thousand dollars is value and you still owe twenty and that's the case all the way down so no cars are pretty much a left out of it so I wouldn't worry too much about that\nI hello Mike Oh yes Oh yes oh yeah\nYeah yeah of course you're all okay oh the ... case after case a ...

charging I just had an issue with a a lawyer headed I needed some a business documents a six and a quarter an hour\nSix hundred and twenty five dollars an hour and by the way that's not off base either for a good lawyers summers seven hundred appeals lawyers can be nine hundred thousand dollars an hour senior ... senior partners in law firms you can run nine hundred thousand bucks an hour\nSo when you have to pay for a lawyer and a good lawyer you have to look at whether you have a good case or not\nAnd that's why I Love us the principal thing I Want to follow suit okay go go for it you know you'll enjoy yourself and then the judge says you're absolutely right thank you the other so I Can't do it anymore and you're out Fifteen thousand dollars\nA Israel Israel Hi I'm here Yes sir or what can I Do for you\nAll right I'll bet you for ten years um you know and I was a pretty conservative denomination\nA long story short my wife had an affair on the nomination did not care whose fault it was if you're not able to lead the outcome God or lead your own house Kelly the help of God so I was removed from ministry wow kept my ordination\nUh for two years I was I'm working back for your email talking about getting in ... the pastor\nA finally here's later I was given my termination notice however they backed candidate a day before my ten year where I Would have been backed into my tension play a lot of my church lots I wipe it off like I said that there might just rude\nAlright well first of all I did what denomination is is\nA happy Methodist I'm Sorry free method is yeah you know I deal with that is have you considered becoming would say a Muslim or a Jew\n[laughter] actually I met you ought to use I should just go that route\nOut you know what I Love that because you know what the uh you know what people called messianic Jew so people that believe in Christ\nWith that\nThat's ... that's what we call them\nThey're not messianic Jews just saying just thrown out always a pleasure talking about that uh where you can do ah I think you can go for your pension because uh that was knocking you off one day a is retaliatory and its creditors or a predatory I mean that\nIs I mean they're just a bunch of ... they really are to do that well yeah they sure have that Christian outlook on life don't they\nAh and yeah Oh absolutely\nAnd now the issue of uh their belief that you can hold your own house in order you can't leave you certainly can't a lead a house of God a which is also complete crock is your wife leaves you and a has an affair somehow it's your fault I Love that\nMan that's another reason why he sort of just switching a religions Israel I mean this this is a tough way to go it really is\nNo no I'm I'm thinking about it they just I don't like the people I got to stop people from my chair\nAlright is a possibility of getting in another uh percentage or ah another church\nKids how do you say that actually I was approached by one of the new leaders that just stepped up and and what are the higher positions and they asked if I were still interested and uh\nI kind of wondered if if uh if I did do that if they would have to take off the fact that they terminated me and kind of kept me on fourteen years\nNow that the other issue is as you talk to or the new folks that you are I'm considering going back to the church or at least having a a a a church where do they call that ... percent of Jews a congregation congregation that's the word yeah having your own congregation\nYou want to say can I please be credited\nUh with the two years so my pension kicks in and have a ... not only are we in statement but credit\nFor the two years and if I were if if I were them\nOr or they I Would draw I'd give it to you in a heartbeat because it's so unfair to what happened to you\nI mean it really is I mean on the face of it just said you know the fact that you are but a good attitude about this if it were me I was torched the church [laughter] anyway so uh the issue is yes I think you have a legal\nA right to go after the pension based on their actions but if you can only do that with a new congregation and the higher ups on that you're willing to do that you're home free Israel you don't care matter of fact you don't have damages\nThat's true and I really appreciate that thank you so much All right take care of her

I talked to an attorney or because there was an affair and now the trick is over a hundred thousand dollars you could take an a contingency that one is a problem because if the money's gone\nUh and and she doesn't have any money or where do you go see where he's a lawyer yet that wears away or get paid\nYeah so there has to be and she spent the money a regime that what do you do\nYeah if I was trying to get someone to try to maybe helped make somebody said that you go to and file ... they can make make myself um how do you say the ...\nThe executor I don't know that's not so easy to do but it doesn't matter what can happen is all the accounts are frozen once you file yes court to freeze the account but it's certainly worth talking to a trust trust in a state where I go to the website to do that because there was a lot of pieces on this one for sure\nSunny hello sunny\n[noise] probably more in the crowd at grad school there so that that you don't have to pay that out right and I do\nIn Georgia well I here's the problem you're probably gonna need a warrior in Georgia and there are\nA the law schools generally do have clinics where they do we help people who don't have any money\nOr it's these pro bono I've organizations ah we're a law students get to work under a lawyer and get some practice but you're going to need that you're gonna find that out in Georgia sunny\nDay that uh that that's how they\nAre yeah vacationing Georgia you're gonna have to call a lawyer in Georgia we call the law schools in Georgia and find out if they have any clinics\n[noise] okay called enough\nYeah call every law school you can get your hands on and Georgia and then you may also want to just find out all organizations that that do pro bono work sunny or are you are you ... are you broke\n[laughter] that helps All right what kind of civil case do you have\nTo go out there and my mom and I just love it it's ... or ... ... it was a it was a a lot of a combination\n... long voted out of\nThe audience so when I see that I gave him a fair bit and I asked them what to do it if they sent their forget and hey I got paid for the deaths or ... foot cliff diving about\nGay I none of this makes sense and you can you can get the death certificate in two seconds that's that's a public records yeah you're going to need a you're probably gonna need some kind of a clinic no lawyer is going to take this on contingency and clearly you're not going to be able to pay hundreds of dollars an hour so\nAll the law schools you want to look under pro bono a legal help in Georgia right\nOkay alright alright\nAlright yeah good luck you know so I just occurred to me that some law schools do have ... [noise]\nAnd actually the lawyers and oversee those clinics are generally pretty good uh those lawyers are or what they do is they get paid about twenty eight thousand dollars a year to oversee the clinics and uh they couldn't ah a probably\nA so pencils on a street corner if it weren't for ah those clinics nicely said in Germany at one or two calls and say come on bill really\nAnd I will say do you have any pencils for sale\n[laughter] All right Tom Europe welcome\nOh okay I'm gonna get right to it [laughter] okay I worked for an employer for\nIncidentally the law started not as human rights or contractual right at all it's a real estate property and the and it came out of that which is why in terms of common law that is ancient English law which a lot of our laws derived from\nA it says that in real property no verbal contracts everything has to be written this goes back five hundred six hundred eight hundred years\nA steamy hello Stevie\nOkay I get you know yeah if you're on TALK of you're on a ... ah what do you call it phone speaker phone get off\n[laughter] [laughter] okay this is the bottom line I I'm going to just continue my insurance or with Kaiser okay and what I wanted to find that let's say my own insurance or just me working out riding my bicycle staying healthy is the federal government and the same when I Do my taxes are they going to impose a penalty\nI was sure because under Obamacare you have to have insurance and if you don't uh there was a penalty why would you give up your health insurance quickly Kaiser I'm a member of Kaiser why would you do that Stevie okay\nSo so really what I'm ... well the reason I'm going to do it is because I have Kaiser\nSo go to another so by BP oh\nUh yeah\nI mean I I don't understand why you know the first step is why would you give up health insurance because anybody who can afford to design of his mind not habit and second of all yes this at this point it is the law that you must either having insurance plan or you pay a penalty if all\nOkay that's simple and I heard the penalty is based on your income\nI have no idea okay you have no idea yeah I'm assuming it's\nNow it's two hundred and five hundred then it goes up to a you know two thousand I have no idea if you can have the penalty subsidize that would be hilarious that would be oh areas because they do subsidize your insurance if you don't have the money but they subsidize a penalty if you don't have the money that probably not\nOkay yeah so so I'm white no legislation\nNo it's not in legislation there is nothing in legislation\nBut the Republicans are trying to appeal you\nKnow they're ... yeah but they have to pass a law and there's not even been a war that's introduce right now\n[noise] ah so this could take this ... could take your\nGun and it was going to take years but a neighbor passed but get yourself insurance you know please\nHello Pam yes ma'am well can I Do for you I'm here with a heart had a partnership with the death for\nThat uh we've had for nine years and we put down two years ago we had a recall like filed bankruptcy personal bankrupt before so I was able to file on their threats that my partner filed bankruptcy under oath and stuff but they don't come back after\nA well what kind of ... first of all let's talk about the business was in a in a wealthy or corporation\nForget that partnership\nA and yes they can come after you are as a one of the partners in since you've already filed for bankruptcy you can't you cannot go bankrupt on it has it been ah I think what seven years since you file for bankruptcy\nOr quite federal\nAlright well theoretically they could go but once that seven years is over you can re file I mean you're never gonna have any credit again Pam that's a given but you can no re file and you could refinance at any time\nSo it doesn't matter if they're suing you doesn't matter if they have a judgment it doesn't matter any ... anywhere in the process all the legal process or you can stop it cold once you file for personal bankruptcy it's over for anything that you would be responsible for what kind of business by the way we talk about him\nOn it was it was right the right field back there's wet during practice for ...\nAnd why did he go under not enough and then there weren't enough customers a or a\nRobbery I got wrapped in my shirt or a I had to close it down after nine years\nGot Rob neighborhood where are you in that was so crazy\nValley huh wow\nWhy it got really bad after nine years so we get that the shut it down within the pressure that folk like my partner filed on up there that that would have taken care of it\nNo because you have a partnership and go what happens is I you know I don't even if a partnership can file bankruptcy 'cause everybody's into your individually responsible for it right so effectively it's a it's the two of you know I don't even think it's a business it's a straight partnership where you're just personally liable\nWhy why wouldn't you do an El Al see you're a corporation\nOr a law now I Do\nI Do yeah oh she said it you know I'm a dumb ass so I didn't have to say it although I'm going to repeat\nIt

she got extreme paying into the big toe and I'm\nIn the morning she couldn't even walk so she couldn't go to work so we weren't so emergency and they had to cut part of her male off but it was infected do the pedicure so we gave her medication antibiotics they stay off your feet\nFor the next couple of days so she she got to know couldn't go to work\nThe next day it didn't it didn't and got it got worse so we had to go back to the emergency pay them the other co payment and\nThen they cut another part of her mail and they said go through your doctor so the next day seeing her doctor the doctor said I Can't do it I mean to send you to a specialist so she was off work for four days I couldn't see the specialist or the following week again she missed like six seven days\nBy a car we seen the specialist it got worse they had to remove all now [noise]\nAnd she couldn't go to work again\nSo she roughly ... ah two weeks of work because of the one creditor do we have a case\nWell yes you do the problem is certainly no lawyer in the world is going to pick it up Henry\nA missing two weeks of work because of the bad pedicure and you have an infection and they ripped off a nail a I mean that's\nNothing there and so what you have is a small claims I don't even know I don't think that that a small claims he's going to hear a small claims a a a matter of effectively a a medical issue negligence too where you were a method where she was medically hurt you can try\nAnd saying here's what happened uh I've gotten the infection of course if I were the odd person the other side of that if I'm being sued and I run a nail salon a shop and he goes hey wasn't\nMe that the infection someplace else so I it's one of those and also what kind of insurance you think now people have\nA while the other thing that we ever thought of of of going back to the salon and and telling them that we're considering to sue and what they make any restitution\nOkay that's fine you can do that\nAlthough I don't again I don't know how much money you're going to get so here you're damages the the work that was last what two weeks how much how much is your wife went make Henry\nUh she works part time so maybe I don't know maybe a thousand dollars in the last two weeks\nShe works part time and make five hundred bucks a week All right let's go what did she do she works for a school district\nOkay fair enough so she's not a thousand bucks so there's that and then there whatever the co pay is on your insurance there is that\nUh so you can try I can guarantee you that uh the nail salon I don't know what kind of insurance and has\nA probably it only has liability insurance for the building if someone falls down\nA and breaks a leg that kind of thing I don't think they have insurance for the other thing but yeah when we do is just go there and say hey you know I'm Out a couple of thousand dollars here and I wouldn't want to do you want me to sue you and see what they say I'm assuming that the owner is Vietnamese right\nYeah no I Want a shocker a Vietnamese nail salon especially here in Southern California I\nShouldn't they carry insurance [laughter]\nYeah I Would think so although I don't even know what kind of ... what kind of liability insurance you have for males\nI imagine yeah they sure but so what assuming I'm willing to bet they don't Henry okay so you're I think your ideas as good as any show up there and say I'm going to sue you maybe it'll give it to you in trade you got two thousand dollars worth of a pedicures there's a lot of pedicures you know that\nA lot of pedicures\nJerry Jerry welcome to handle on the law\nRight now I'm going through the park oh I'm I'm Still waiting for the first court date but we can go to\nCourt to the mediator
