knows how to protect me and how to put me in a position where I can get the best returns possible and that's not always the truth that's the live Wall Street is\nThat you're not smart enough for sophisticated enough to imagine handle your own money understand something folks a lot of people out there pitching annuities to you you need an annuity it's a fixed income product it's a pension is what it is essentially creating your own pension and that I knew what he gives you a fixed rate of return for a significant amount of time which is nice and a lot of people want that\nBut here's the problem the upfront cost the loads the commission on the front end a lot of times anywhere from four to ten percent so if you put a hundred thousand dollars in annuity anywhere from ... goes to that guy that woman that license professor who just sold you went to the unity understand that\nNow here's the other thing a lot of times is a term in other words if you want to liquidate your money you get liquidity out of that position you can't because you have to pay a penalty you have to pay a surrender charge up front that takes money off the bottom line as well and then as early redemption fees and a lot of other things that come into play and I'm not saying there's never a need for these I'm saying there oversold\nAnd Boulder bay as we believe that you can create that same annuity the exact same thing that that license person's going to say because they're representing Wall Street because they have a license and it was sponsored by our institution\nSo you're letting some institution manage your money and they're competing for the same way that you and are competing for there's a divergence of interest right there but what happens is some Wall Street firms not going to manage your money\nAnd the person who's actually making the decisions is Sonia what's in their inventory so for news and the image where they can sell it to you they get paid a large commission for that\nWe both have to tell you that you can create that same annuity that they're selling you yourself\nWith the same products that they use in the financial markets because we can use those same products we have access to those do you realize you can create a bond fund\nIn other words a fund that can give you a five or six protect return with very low risk and not pay any loads or upfront commissions and literally be able to create that yourself and get the same returns that you need to get out of an annuity without having to pay all those high fees and more importantly having full liquidity in your position you need to cash out you can't\nThere's so many things out there and we're trying to separate ourselves because we don't want to manage your money is not what this is about this is about you learning to manage your own money you learn how to self correct you will and if you learn the skills it allows you to make better returns for less cost think of that\nAnd that's what we're really hear about and that's why if we don't tell you this no money managers going to tell you that you should put your money and self directed they're going to tell you put it on a management with me with us course they are because they have a vested interest in your participation\nBe careful folks you can learn the skills of self directing is not a complicated process you have to go through a learning curve but it's available and what I Love a sponsor\nThey teach people how to do it more importantly learn it somewhere learn how to self directed make better decisions yourself because ultimately if you don't get the returns you want and you don't hit those retirement goals\nAnd you have no say in the decision where are you then a lot of people are worried about run out of money that is a real risk in this country and that's the problem that a lot of people are facing\nWill share of you know a lot of individuals they think they don't have enough time they don't think they're smart enough they think you know they don't have enough money that it's you know they should be focusing on it and people make reasons and they make excuses all the time either don't miserable money realistically you know how much time as I can take somebody\nSix to ten hours a month I have students that I might trade academy that I personally coach it's managed their wealth and six to ten hours a month\nThey don't have to where they get the same returns or better returns that all those products available out there and he has a beautiful thing they can make money when the market goes down to the problem with a lot of those money managers they put you in some sort of a position where if the market was up to make money the mark goes down you give it back and if it doesn't go up dramatically enough\nThe fees that they're charging you take up the profitability that you do get so we've got a plan in place where you can make money regardless of direction more importantly\nYou'd have to pay all those fees and ultimately get those returns you want and what's great about that as the increases probability lowers costs that's a no brainer that's why self directing is becoming so prevalent and so many people looking for a chance to learn how to do that exactly in our sponsor online trading a cat\nThey teach a class specifically on self directing now whether or not you have a

a lot of greed counted that comes through that which really is stuff that just is hysterical I mean we've this one of the fun of\nThe hours and hours of the ... the city I got it so it is one of the best parts of the week she has always having a good time but you know what one of the things that we need to talk about is there are individuals out there that are trying to figure out how to generate additional monthly income there are people out there that aren't financially where they want to be I mean husbands and wives all the time they're like man if I could just make another five hundred or a thousand bucks a month\nThings would be so much better for me let's take a moment let's talk about how someone can utilize the market really and talk about trading for income how someone can do them\nWell most people being seen ... traveled the world I've been all over the planet talking to be about trading and investing and what's universal is that people want to make income they want to generate additional income in the markets are a great way to do that and the problem is is that a lot of people when they hear the word trader\nThey check out they think Wolf of Wall Street the movie Wall Street greed is good some guy in suspenders sitting on Wall street overlook in Manhattan and that couldn't be further from the true some of the most successful traders that I Know people for income to generate an income in the markets on a daily or weekly basis\nOr people just like us that your blue collar white collar stay at home moms I mean pizza delivery people barbers I mean scientists we have a lot of surgeons that have had success in the markets so what's important is that it's a skill set that you learn over time but once you learn a skill set think of the benefits is about forty million\nTrainee a couch in the United states you know eat trade Schwab Judy marriage rates got trade and most of those traders based on our knowledge are not successful they love the sexiness of the opportunity they love being able to sit at their home and speculate on price change in a marketplace they loved that but if they don't have a good system in place are good set of rules\nThey normally aren't successful and those are the stories you hear so people think the market's a casino and it's not if you understand\nHow to play the game it gives you a unique advantage and the problem is is that many people have this preconceived notion that the markets are nothing more than throwing your money and hoping it works\nAnd it couldn't be further from the truth is ways to generate high probability low risk decisions\nAnd if you do that consistently it could turn into a compound and growth curve I seen it personally I've seen people that have come through the process and learn the skills and transform their life with trading and they had no knowledge coming in they didn't understand the first day and even what's the difference would have stock and bond\nAnd yet they learn the skill and what's great about that as it opens the door for people instead of having to get a second job and punch a clock somewhere go wait on tables not that there's anything wrong with doing that I've done all of that\nBut what's important is if you could generate that income from your home you know in in your spare time that's the opportunity and many people don't get it because they have this preconceived idea what a trade or is it couldn't be further from\nThe truth one you know what a lot of people think that it requires a lot of time they think it requires this high IQ and it's just a skill it's like any skill you said all the time you used to be a framer champ no understanding how to use the proper tools a professional grade broker dealer understanding how to actually minimize risk increase probability just\nA checklist of things that keep you safe in the market and a lot of people think it's just so out of reach that they can't do it and if not I mean I tell people you can drive a stick shift you can learn to be a successful trader because it's nothing more than learning the skill and repeating it over and over and over again one of the most important things I tell people is\nTrading and investing shouldn't be exciting if it's exciting you're doing it wrong it's just a decision\nAnd when you have the ability to make that decision what's great about that is the doors open anybody I mean I mean people that literally have very low capital I mean they might have a few hundred bucks to work with and they're able to go into the currency markets start to make money and make consistent money and a decent amount of money [noise]\nFutures markets such great opportunities to trade futures and in this country people don't understand how the power of those assets we focus on stock stock stocks in this country futures a tremendous assets and sometimes that can use to treat stock\nAnd I can use reaches a trade stock indices like the S. and P. and make a bigger a troubled less capital on the same moving price there's so many opportunities out there and when people start to realize that they can generate an income in the financial markets it's a game changer for them\nAnd it has nothing to do with your IQ or where you went to school what your GPA is I tell everybody you don't have to be smart to be successful in the financial markets you just have to be a teachable and this living proof in this studio of that exactly champ\nAnd you know what a lot of people out there they don't realize that this is an opportunity for them there are people out there that are trying to figure out how to make extra money was I mean how many Hoover drivers you meet your there and executive during the day and they're driving ... night there's so many easier way to generate capital than doing all that stuff and trading for incomes one of them are sponsor online training academy\nThey know individuals' out there and want to generate additional income they also know that people don't know how to do it that's why they have a class specifically on trading for income from our sponsor online training academy\nThat allows an individual
