figure\nThe American dream build a business have equity on something you know have a piece of it most people trade their time for money many of you driving down the road right now you have a salary or an hourly wage and if you don't go they stop paying their\nNew trade your time for money and successful people entrepreneurs people that become elite in life financially leach they typically build a business they start something and what's great about that is that there's a lot of you that probably have businesses that you own your business and your business owns you your small business owners

there's somebody driving down the road right now the letters on the top of their truck who's a contractor who's a self employed individual who's the last one to get paid each chasing as money's good employees you can't count on it's amazing and think about this\nThink about if you could have the results of that business without the headaches and I'm not saying that trading and investing as a business without headaches what I'm saying is this message\nIf you get up a business with no employees no overhead are very low overhead no liability insurance 'cause you're not dealing with people's property\nEven worry about customers 'cause they're online you can literally post something and every time you want to sell something to just be somebody to buy it every time you need to buy something

you had no limit on the profitability in other words the cap was off\nYou can make as much as possible that's the dream\nThat is trading and investing seats a business and if you understood as a

how\nWell you know let me a ... a sixty one year old lawyer who has never written a document regarding elder abuse in his life uh that's probably a less competent than you are my dear\nBut he had a choir behind the room\nSo why you can represent yourself I I live so why do you think\nSomeone who has Esquire behind their name is going to somehow when the case and by the way it was a

All right you're you're saying uh before him he's asking you to fill out a W to form or are you know on a previous W to form for a previous job\nLike requiring a previous that we have to form a\nFor free for previous jobs you know doesn't that doesn't have the right to do that or because effectively what he's doing is asking for your salary and it's against the law to ask what your salary was it's funny because it's not him his business how much money you earned that the previous in employment\nSo no he doesn't have a right to say I need to see your previous W to form doesn't work that was\nA lot of fires that\nYeah there's a particular law that says you cannot ask for a how much money someone has made previously handler and don't tell you to form a previous W to form says exactly that also even if it wasn't an ally you're saying you can't do that you say no but\nWhat are you doing yeah how about the color underwear and wearing a so uh no I don't think uh that works or John Hi John you're up\nTo eight that rent but not now um they pay you out there claiming that there are no damage to their\nCurrent so you're talking about the so you're talking about they moved out right John\nAre in the movie now okay\nAnd what you're saying is that the damages are going to be greater than ... this or the rent is greater than security deposit correct\nOr do they pay the rent that hot it that they\nYeah they do that all the time All right so what's your question\n[laughter] so my question I I brought it up and then they are claiming that Iraq you know what I mean I called and emailed them\nOkay what is going on right okay here here's your your your choices and I'm going to tell you just suck it up and here's why I technically they have to pay you\nTo the ranch there's no question about it and the security deposit is a separate issue and the security deposit is about protecting you from damage a particularly protecting you from damage or to the property so I assuming\nThat there is no damage or even if there is damage what happens is they are of course saying where to put the security positive towards the last month's rent and you're saying no you can't do that\nSo you have the right to sue them but but you have to offset the amount of money you have a security deposit as against three so it becomes a wash\nSo right so what are you gonna do you're going to sue for a wash\nAnd then the issue is if there are damages beyond that then of course you sue them in small claims court\n[noise] [laughter] you didn't you know then you so then you do then you then you have a small claims soon but other than that no we haven't had that before but don't they all the money yes but you have to offset so now what why even bother\nSteve hello Steve I Want to you\nSir yet you know for some reason uh I I've been listening to the show or you know sort of during the week I been to the tape of it and you know people don't know I I have a hard time

other snakes all the time the STDs part that crosses the line All right [laughter]\nYeah that crosses the line matter of fact legally it crosses the line because it's a libel per se\nIn other words a libel per se beans you're you don't have to prove anything\nIt's by law liable and it goes back to common law goes back to a oh it's fantastic law goes back hundreds and hundreds of years English

Jake there you are you have one that I'd love to take All right Jake you're up [laughter]\nI yeah I paid a timeshare company to get me out of my contract yeah I'm here yeah and uh I Am out of it but I think all they did was uh let it go to address the sale delinquent and then the time share company bought or the time share bought it back\nOK how much money do you will uh oh I don't know anything at All right I Hope that it was about seven grand All right so you paid it and you're what you're saying you could negotiate it yourself and you don't think they did much right yeah so I have any recourse oh yeah you consume in small claims court saying they didn't do anything they just let it lapse\nAnd you can either way I requested documentation that me\nAnd they will they will as soon as you file a lawsuit in small claims court for your seven thousand dollars oh trust me they are going to come up with documentation because you're saying they did nothing and they're saying or you don't deserve any money back\nBecause we did something in your question is okay let's see it\nAnd if they didn't do anything I mean are there any letters negotiations but if they they did or didn't do as you said I Can't imagine you're not going to get your seven thousand dollars back\nOkay small claims court but yeah the right absolutely why did you get into a time share in the first place because I was an idiot\nGuys very well sad die you beat me to it and well said\nMy man I Patty [noise] if you're a young lady yes ma'am I'm semi yeah\nUm I had been working for a school district and so Cal for sixteen years\nUm I'm part time actually part time and they've done that for this reason I'm getting ready to retire when I had taken on days off for being sick and the whole sixteen years generally I ain't going to do it and put them on the sick days [laughter]\nBut um mostly I've accumulated I'm thinking that I could\nTrain them at the end either take up a out or um take time off prior to my retirement and looking into it we're getting ready to retire this year I have over three hundred and twenty five hours accumulated and I can't take any of it\nAnd why can't you take any of it\nOn the same because I Am part time work to less than twenty hour ...\nSo what's your question\nDo I have any recourse at all\nI didn't know if if the policy of the school board\nAnd the policy in which you hired is that people were under twenty or twenty five hours a week or month whenever it is or not entitled to take their sick pay\nAt the end of it uh then there's nothing you can do that's their policy and some school boards some companies allow people to take sick days like police departments for example usually do so wow you got cops that\nRetiring literally years' worth of sick leave that they pull out early and then there are companies and uh they're our enemies that say no for example uh my my company in the center for surrogate parenting\nIt's using the same thing uh I work for this radio station it's they use it or lose it\nAnd they said the only recourse I could have is if I had because I'm part if I took a different um government job that was over twenty hours well I mean whatever the policy is yeah then it stays with me I guess\nOkay but it's whenever the policy is you have to live within the policy and its\nPerfectly legal to have a policy that says use it or lose it yeah as which I Do and not only do I have it in my company ah but I also live under it yeah yeah well yeah you're screwed yeah I ... so there is no case here\nA new oh Nick [laughter] rebellious or

big problem in the future with my could take a my landlord of small claims court about\nThe ... the amount that they said I ah\nYou said Nineteen thousand dollars\nThe original of that fifty nine hundred I think they are\nI sent the IRS a copy of my credit report showed fifty nine hundred\nAnd it doesn't matter it don't it doesn't matter I don't care that\nResidents that the IRS then reduce their from Nineteen thousand nine hundred back the fifty nine hundred I paid the debt off so I'm square my question is tracked the credit card company employed at the debt from fifty nine Ninety nine do I have a record\nYou know because because no 'cause you didn't pay the tax on the Ninety nine you ended up accepting the ten Ninety nine was for the fifty nine hundred dollars it was originally in the fall to the point is there were no they they knew that there are no date but but they reduced it again\nNo not them the our or is that right but that's the only thing you have is the IRS they already have a judgment they'd given up they're not collecting on the judgment\nSo a credit card company has no recourse\nNow it's only been there done a statute is done\nEven though they inflate the fifty nine hundred\nGave does it matter they under they inflated the fifty nine hundred on the ten Ninety nine Ninety or not on the judgment they issued a ten Ninety nine for Nineteen thousand you got that reduced to the original fifty nine hundred dollar where your damages\nOf the question is sense the credit card company and play that the original um out yesterday did four times over yes there is no records I guess the\nOnly because you have not been damaged\nIf you want me to gouge in dollars when I send you a bill for a hundred thousand dollars and then you end up paying me two thousand dollars I expect it and I accept that well uh I'm I've been damaged Ninety eight thousand dollars you know having you paint you sound isn't\nO O\nTalk we went through that over and over and over again
