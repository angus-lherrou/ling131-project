Jeremy\nJoins us on the Clark Howard show Hi Jeremy how are you doing\nHi Clark I'm good how are you great\nThank you so the stock market is not your friend\nNo I'm I'm One of those millennials that I Try not to invest in it um I wanted to touch lightly on why what I Do that but I Do have a dilemma that I Need your advice on let's hear\nThe reason is pretty straightforward subprime disaster had a profound effect on me and my wife just with marketing read so because of this you start to fit in your mortgage we have no debt or Mac savers and we don't plan on purchasing anything with that for the rest of our lives\nI'm lucky enough to have a four one K. with the government I'm a software engineer\nI matched it out or off version and I I ... which I Know you're not a big fan of it but I'm okay with your three percent returns\nAnd then outside of that I take a take advantage of promotional\n... with my credit union that you are part of um which today three to five percent so I take one out for each member of my family but the problem I have it on my wife is going to become a stay at home mom\nShe's been in the workforce for ten years so she has a four one K. that we're going after all over I Know that you don't have to roll it over by the way\nWell um I Would I Would like to I Am not a big fan of where it is it okay so I I've been looking at one of your low cost providers and a target fund\nWhat the problem I have is um I Know you only watch index fund so how do you get over the fact that you indirectly own stock the companies that you do not like\nYou know I indirectly own shares and banks that I bash all the time and so in a sense I'm hurting my own investments I also am an indirect owner of companies I don't trust and don't respect\nAnd the way I look at it is that that is passive investing I'm not making the decisions and not choosing to put money in and that or not it's just part of a basket of\nHundreds or thousands of companies that little teeny amounts of my money go into\nAnd I just accept that that is\nWhat is a tiny part of what I'm invested that there's an expression perfect is the enemy of the good that you end up if you keep trying to do everything perfectly you end up doing nothing\nAnd so the advantage to her on balance is so great being in that target retirement fund\nThat is essentially in large part a variety of index funds that I think you just do it and then the way you balance it is the volunteer activities in the community activities\nYour wife's involved in and you were involved in or things that really matter to you that you can make a direct impact an active difference then\nVersus the passive the your money's invested or her money's invested\nThat sounds good I I Know you said that when it rolls over not to invest all of it right away and the incrementally of that but you still apply that they ...\nThat would not be the case in her case because she's been invested in the four oh one K. so there's nothing no need really two dollar cost average she can just\nThrow all the money right into the diversified portfolio to target retirement fund is holding\nVery much for your history is in a city and hopefully many others out there saying Hi\nThank you and congratulations to the two of you on how you live on substantially less than what you may just the key to giving you the freedom of the choices

parents off\nWell so this guy is full of himself a you know he's getting all this praise including from me and I've been on the floor defending their actions in Yemen I've been on the floor thing to have been a good ally when it comes to the war on terror or they've not been perfect by any means I've been trying to beat back this effort to\nTo to serve our relationship with Saudi Arabia so what does this mean for this NBS\nTo put us in this spot shows contempt for us in our relationship nobody has done more for Saudi Arabia than President Trump nobody has been there on their side more than I have in the Senate except maybe Senator McCain and this is the way you get repaid so\nYou were co so they're going to come back ... going over there right now he's got to come back and they say the Saudis are basically the myth that they did it it was in interrogation gone wrong\nSo that is indeed the case and the president has said listen I don't want to hurt Raytheon bowling in my other major companies who had these weapons sales why should I heard American industry because these guys can't behave themselves what do you say\nWell sometimes you have to pay a price for your values\nI'm pretty defense a hawkish kind of guy on on services yeah absolutely I I won't Saudi Arabia to be on our side\nThere's Saudi Arabia then there's the crown prince they're two different things so how do you expect to stick to his children came to my office a metric ... kits he has three American citizen children they came to my office and I said will help they got one one son in Saudi Arabia that I'm worried about\nHow do I engage Saudi Arabia when NBS the de facto leader of the country is this brazen district disrespectful for the international norms that we fight for he is toxic there's no way we can move forward uh I don't I Would suspend arms sales as long as he's in charge\nCentered let's back up a second you know the he created a lot of enemies when he made some of the changes he locked after roe family into the Ritz Carlton and interrogated them brutally in many respects and some are still in jail or under house arrest right so if you want to up into him\nDo you pull something off like this and say now you're tagged with this responsibility could this be a diabolical plots it may be John Grisham would write\nA you mean the setting up NBS no cars everything about NBS scenes to gravitate toward this this is not some guy is trying to change the country and hard liners under cutting\nHe's schizophrenia one man and he's talking about the twenty thirty plan for Saudi Arabia the next minute he's personally involved in stamping out the slightest descent\nSo I think he's unhinged\nHe's thirty three years old if this is the Next Fifty years God help us all\nIt's an important relationship but the values that we possess as Americans are more important than any single relationship this is a test of President Trump he did the right thing to saint palm pale I just don't believe that we can ever do business with Saudi Arabia again\nA ... as long as he's in charge in the U.S\nWhile that will be used because it to be you know whose high fiving Iran\n[noise] yeah well let me tell you don't get so excited Iran or we don't break your back\nThe people are going to take back around after we've crush the Iranian regime the sanctions so don't misunderstand I Want everybody know to be an ally the United states require certain things you don't murder people in conflicts in foreign countries and expect us to clap for you\nAre on we've been tough on will continue to be tough on but this is a challenge the hardest thing\nTo deal with is abused by your friends everybody expects ... act this way and North Korea but Saudi Arabia and ... we have an alliance is not perfect this is about us Brian is about who we are how we react\nThis is about Saudi Arabia I Hope they will take this moment to deal with this problem in a fashion that will allow the world to engage Saudi Arabia more effectively because right now in BSS too toxic in my view to take Saudi Arabia seriously\nAll right and I guess speak to the president about this yeah\nAbsolutely we are taught to palm pale Sunday the relationship is important Saudi Arabia is not the crown prince is bigger than the cramped perhaps but the crown prince do this outrageous action has put us in a box right now when everybody else to know that if you got plans like this\nAre with your friend America don't go down this road because you'll pay a heavy price\nA great to be a dead to be at Fox News world headquarters

to put in ... is trying to get our society today in perspective what about getting American history and prospective Doris Kearns Goodwin is in Studio and uh she is a great new book out called leadership and turbulent turbulent times\nUh I've there's a better story in the country I just don't know who it is\nUm she draws upon\nA all four presidents in particular Abraham Lincoln theatre Roosevelt FDR and LBJ a president you knew about going in right doors yeah I spent many years with them so many years that I felt like I was waking up with them in the morning and thinking about them and I went to bed at night that's so interesting\nBecause ah the when I looked at this book I said did you call from what you know or did you have to go back and dig again\nI definitely have to dig again I mean the reason I chose to these four\nInstead of writing about a whole new president was it each time I would leave the guy behind when I went from FDR to Lincoln or Lincoln to teddy I'd feel like I was leaving an old boyfriend behind I felt guilty so I thought what if I keep my four guys but look at them through the lens of leadership and I had to learn a lot more where did they are in mission come from how did they run for office the first time\nHow did they are and dish and change from South to something larger questions that weren't part of my sprawling biography so and I read a lot of literature from business actually 'cause there's so many leadership literature is cause I ended up\nDoing case study of all of them which sort of along the business lines\nSo you said you you read the business to find out about the leadership principals ... applied to these guys in many\nWays I did I've been lecturing for the last couple of decades to leadership groups in business many times as well as universities\nAnd they write about leadership more than a lot of other people do so I think it's human nature if you're a leader of a huge company than the traits you need to have a a a team that works well too infused purpose in the team to be able to communicate to the team to reach out beyond that pop Ilan ... these are all qualities that we need in politics as well\nSo you get a rambling can he was not born a great leader right\nAbraham Lincoln it's an extraordinary story I mean to think about this young man who only has twelve months of schooling he has to scour the countryside for books and read everything he can lay his hands on\nBut he was born with empathy there was a sense in this little kid even when he saw his friends put hot coals on turtles to make them are eagle he told them that's wrong he came by a drunk and man on a highway one time not highway road\nAnd all of his friends passed by and he lifted him up and carried him to a fire and take your taking care of him there was something inside that guy that I think was there from the beginning but boy he had to develop\nSo tell me with the with this story you know and can cause corroborate he uh he didn't like his dad his dad was really tough man and his dad used to know his son was very good wrestler and used to wrestle him for money and one time he takes on\nA I don't know Armstrong's first name was a jak yup jak I'm saying so they ended up wrestling and when his father when his father went to finish them off\nWanted him to finish them off you let them up and then the mob one after Lincoln and Armstrong was the one who puts them up back and said he ... he beat me fair and square that ended up being friends for life that has\nThe story that I've heard too and I think the important part of that story too\nIs the father was always resentful of the fact that Abraham Lincoln wanted to read books he thought it was lazy in a physical culture that demand a constant effort to fail the trees and plant the crops he would take the books away from him at times so he had to fight for education against is very father and I think that's where they alienation took place 'cause he wanted to learn so badly\nSo you have somebody to an end noon or you know ... the civil war when people say Lincoln he takes office as tough as as as much as he had empathy he also knew we had to win a war and it would mean tens and hundreds of tens of thousands being dead\nAnd he said he's pushing his generals to fight so the man who didn't want to put a cold in the back of a frog nobody has a push generals to have one American shoot another American is that part of leadership doing making the tough decision that may rank who your rank who your instincts\nA question he once said how strange it is that he had hated violence ... never he didn't want it to kill a turkey when he was young would find himself in the middle of the bloodiest war in time\nAnd yes you have to be both merciless and merciful you have to be both patients and persevere and and he was both things at the same time he encountered that side of the great place where the apathy comes out\nIs once he is winning the war once the union is coming to an end with the war he gives the second inaugural and talks about reconciling with the south but until that moment of triumph he was willing to expend every bit of blood\nTo in order to get the war one and get slavery indebted\nTo moving to a if you think about uh the ... do you think humility has something to do with great leadership some say you chose weakness to say I don't know what somebody else whose ideas come out and not be yours Decorah chill vulnerability where does humility and vulnerability commit yes\nSome weights for some reason in today's world it seems vulnerable to admit weaknesses in the earlier days certainly for Abraham Lincoln money runs for off the first time it's a wonderful statement he makes every man has his peculiar ambition managed to be a steamed up by my fellow man\nBut I'm not sure if you'll understand me and I'm not sure if you vote for me and if I Do lose I won't be too chagrined make us I'm familiar with disappointment but then he says but I'm going to try five or six times until I'm too humiliated and then I won't try again I promise\nBut he said in that opening statement if I don't know something I'm going to learn it if I say something wrong I'm going to correct it right from the start he comes out of the gate with those qualities of resilience humility and empathy and they stay with them the rest of his life\nSo tell me if this was a leap did you could take run sure notice book on grand talks about how grant slaves after the emancipation was issued more and more slaves were deciding to run for freedom\nAnd when they were running to grant grants idea to say let's give these guys some uniforms and let them fight and he sees how they fought they got together and the galvanizing came to a unit and that's when we can start getting an idea of how what the world with this country is going to look like when this war is over\nNow I think that's right once the black soldiers became part of the union army as they did when he finally opened the door to the black soldiers they fought magnificently and even the generals who have been against the idea of bringing them into the army began to see that they're helping the cause and they're doing an amazing job\nBut Lincoln was reluctant at first to do it I mean he waited and waited until Nineteen sixty three because he feared that the whites in the army weren't ready for any fit the north even the north wasn't ready\nTiming is everything he said so we watch the changing sentiment he watched what was beginning to happen and that's another quality of a leader you can't do what you may want to do unless the timing us write the timing was perfect for the Emancipation Proclamation and for allowing blacks in the army\nThe banking system was collapsing for one out of four people had only had jobs and the jobs were for small numbers of wages and a few hours\nThere were people in the streets who are hungry there was a feeling that capitalism itself with at risk\nAnd when he came on what he had to give most importantly was contagious optimism it wasn't that he didn't agree knowledge in his inaugural he said only a foolish optimist would not denied the dark realities of the moment\nBut if we can come together as a people and if the government can help with the problems we have to have to help with jobs the private sector couldn't do it any more states ... even if it's make work jobs you give people back a dignity until the economy gets going and then you have the longer kind of jobs that would be possible once the economy got going\nAnd he got them into the sea Sisi the civilian conservation corps a whole generation of young people would have been without jobs and they're working in the woods and they're learning camaraderie and they're learning common missions something I Wish we had today as well to W. PA\nA W PA and the ... W why all these wonderful initials he had but you know in fact the interesting thing is he had two different people working on jobs so I must Harry Hopkins who like the small term make work jobs if it needed to be even if it's ... and you get the person to going across the street and coming back\nAnd then Harold Ickes the secretary and interior wanted long jobs like dams and public works projects that would last and then come back to the economy and they began to fight in public and he didn't like that so we ... them on a cruise in the Panama Canal for three weeks so they could drink and fish together by that time and if I was on to and that's how you have to deal with those kinds of problems inside your\nGovernment coming out of the depression and you are looming ahead as a World War\nSo how are we going to afford to fight in this world let's stay out of the American public didn't want any part of it at the same time how do we stand up this economy\nAnd then a lot of pushback from conservatives who don't want the social programs correct correct as their instincts are social programs are going to be hard to break up which we don't really end programs even today which is why we're seven hundred and eighty billion dollars over budget right now\nAre on the deficit so he was able to get through it now bringing me to the psyche of FDR where's this leadership come from\nYou know I think from the time he was young he was confident he was gifted with an optimistic temperament\nBut I think he was the kind of person who experiment it through the new deal and then to even during the war\nYou try something if it doesn't work you say to yourself I have to sign something else\nAnd the great thing he did during World War two is he realized that his relationship with the business community was at odds obviously and he needed them to build the ships the tanks the planes and the weapons convert their factories so he put up an olive branch to them he stopped antitrust regulation he'd build their factories he gave them profits that they would already have\nAnd it was the most magnificent government business relationship in the history of our country three shifts today what they produced in planes and airplanes which we gave to lend lease all over the world it was an extraordinary partnership I I Love thinking about that whole mobilization\nKeeping the country together and keeping the allies together in one of those allies is Joseph stone\nCorrect and he saw\nOnly at the end of his life he began to see what was going to happen with Stalin he needed style in her early on Russia was essential for keeping the German forces out of Russia and so many Germans were killed because of the Russians he\nNeeded Russia he thought to come into Japan if we were going to invade Japan we would lose a million people he wanted the UN and he needed Russia for that so he wasn't in the best of health when he made those decisions but I think he would have made them any way but then style and became a much more complicated character then he'd\nRely LBJ comes out and one thing about um you mentioned before that he does do deals we don't do any deals anymore you know we don't really compromise and his wife just played this for a for a ... Jeff Flake saying there's no ... there's no rewarding compromising these days was it a different American LBJ now without question\nYou know the congressmen senators used to stay in Washington they played poker together they weren't racing home to raise their money\nThey their wives knew each other their kids know each other I mean he could call on friendships that were true I mean they were real friendships but he also never stopped calling he'd call at six in the morning you'd call it new and even called a senator too and my hope I didn't wake you up\nBut I Need you on this deal and he promised them what they needed for their states but there was a larger goal in mind that could be civil rights are voting rights or Medicare or Medicaid\nUm he knew what he was doing the means to the end but it worked and they they got something out of it and so did he and some of the\nCountry to if I was sitting there and and I want to teach readership to my uh twelfth grade football team or a my son or daughter well could I take from FDR\nI think you could take that what a leader has to do is to have a bond with the people that he's talking with\nHe kept up conversations in those fireside chats he knew as long as he explained the problems to the people\nAnd he told them why he was doing what he was doing they would then come along with him so he kept talking he kept listening I think having that communication or whoever you're trying to lead know where you're going and then be able to explain to the people why they should go there with you\nAnd then yeah there'll be J who was a leader a lotta people are but he also we cut deals the ends justify the means right\nYes and he would say what convinces his conviction and the end he knew what he wanted to do but in order to get there he had to do a lot of things to make it possible and that's what Congress used to be about why not just share some of the largest of what's happening in the cities in the states in the country is with with the nation\nDonald Trump shocked the world no doubt what advice would you give him now two years in two years left maybe six\nI think one of the things that would be the get out of Washington more I mean Teddy Roosevelt went on a train for six weeks every spring and fall so he could visit people in local areas here their complaints listened to them\nAnd learn from them ... said the worry for America and I still worry today is if people in different regions sections um parties religions begin to see each other as the other I mean that's partly what you were talking about before and the way to do that is to just go and see as many of those people as you can even if they haven't voted for you to expand your base\nAnd under a minute that was the big worry the Thirteen colonies that they wanted you to stay in their own states they have to be convinced they had to do was stronger together\nAnd that's why all George Washington one around the country to to be able to visit the different states to make them feel part of a hole we've lost that sense of common duties and common interest in the country and we have to eat pain that sense of citizenship people in the military have it when they come back\nThey've had a common mission they care about that that goes across race party any kind of lines we have to make our own people feel that again that's what leadership needs to do some type of services some type of man show for national service I Am so I think it's the most my one of my sons served\nIn Iraq and Afghanistan and he's now a huge proponent of national service should come out of high school maybe go to a different part of the country and you're living with a host family and you're working on some common mission you're gonna feel differently about these other people and yourself in the country and I'm a huge proponent of your son's mother's stars Kobe [laughter]\n\nTake one Adam of nitrogen and bonded with one atom of oxygen and boom

going to put our business in trouble with Raytheon Boeing and the other defense contractors who got a hundred billion dollar deal I don't want to hurt American business to send them a message\nBut he might not have a choice which Lindsey Graham on last hour he says the only way we still dealing with Saudi Arabia is if the crown prince resigns that he feels actually taken advantage of because he

Miller waiting yesterday cuts six\nBy full fare waiting to see whether or not we'll story has legs is whether or not anyone in Washington or really odd or any capital in the world believes starring because I didn't fight and Saudi Arabia\nOfficial is concerned about the relationship are both trying to find a way out of weddings and down and like she did you get a lot of combat spent and that's something that could lead to a very strange and one of our most important in our household they're searching for like four\nAnd now is there a plausible explanation that their results in oh now I understand\nSo you know what the Saudis are working on is we wanted to and ... they're they're inching toward we wanted to talk to him\nAnd perhaps the interview got a little bit out of hand [noise] uh and he died and you know as you mentioned earlier the Turks say that they have information that says that he was killed there\nAnd of course the Turks are not exactly our most reliable ally or certainly not in recent years under aired won who's something of an authoritarian himself\nUm this is so we can't take them at their word necessarily we probably will never get\nTo a point where the where both sides agree on the events that transpired the question really is this and I think the the framing here's been pretty substantially unfair for the United states the question is and what the United States is going to do the question is what are the Saudis going to do\nThe Saudis are substantially a client state to the United states um the Saudis depend on us and really profound ways now they make us keep our troops offshore they want our troops or they want our navy a doctor off of Bahrain\nOr not there they don't want us troops wearing a American insignia when they're in Saudi\nBut they depend on us and they are our client and they depend on us and western oil purchases to keep their of authoritarian autocracy afloat\nSo the question really ought to be you have a client state that has obviously misbehaved what are they willing to do it's not as much about what they're willing to admit they can come up with whatever ... story as long as in the end we killed this guy\nOr whether it was by accident or intent\nOr and here's what happens next and that's up to them and we can't really it it would be it would be not only unwise but it would be it would be imprudent ... to get out in front and say this is what we're gonna do instead to say okay you tell us what you're going to it's like when you tell your kids what punishment do you think you deserve for what you did\nI have free range kids I don't give them any instruction\nDirection holding store that said you just give 'em fifty bucks turned them loose right\nYeah and a quick real quick 'cause we talked to St Lindsey Graham earlier and he says he's been one of the the biggest supporters of Saudi Arabia I talked to Bob Corker last week also he says the same thing he's the reason they got these arms sales approve this is being pushed back on this here's what he told us a half hour ago\nHow did I engage Saudi Arabia and went NBS the de facto leader of the country has this brazen district disrespectful for the international norms that we fight for he is toxic there's no way we can move forward uh I don't I Would suspend arms sales as long as he's in charge\nThat's that's huge and the president is very made it clear he's very reluctant to do that is very reluctant\nTo do it because if you ... you remember the ...\nAh when Trump played his hands on the glowing or with yes leaders in the new whatever terrorism response center or whatever they call it um Trump as Trump and cushion or have a big bet on M.
