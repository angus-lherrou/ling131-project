time in its history you know there was always a joke about Israel that Moses flood the juice or the one part of the the Middle East that had no energy but we later find out that he was a great navigator and there was actually oil and energy so what I was\nDoing it the Hudson Institute it was essentially trying to figure out how American companies could really answer that space or help Israel a realign its allies in that part of the world after the Arab Spring\nAnd you know basically help American companies monetize or Israeli energy reserves the reserves which was a win win but that caused a lot of problems for me and put me under the microscope of the Obama administration\nLose they were all over Israel I mean they they were almost enemies him in Benjamin Netanyahu and President Obama did not get along and they thought Israel is the big obstacle to Middle East peace\nYeah no absolutely I mean I remember I be talking a very high level conferences in Israel at that time in Iran that part of the world about this particular topic and I would have people from the Obama State Department is basically threatened me and telling me look what you're doing it you know you're causing a lot of problems for us\nThat would have ... reach out to me from the Obama State Department and say the same thing so I never really took it to serious and solve all of a sudden I

at all besides being surveilled did it stop you getting credit or did it stop you getting a job well\nI mean a ... at the time in my FBI interview I was actively trying to get a job with the administration so I mean of course are you a bomb and there's no I'm not the Trump Administration and of course once FBI came to my house those dreams were completely shattered and what I think it was for a completely unjustified reason because now that\nUh we have new evidence that surfaced about the tremendous government misconduct as a congressman himself reference yesterday um I think uh um my story really needs to be viewed in a different life so the\nPrice of the United states ends up being the front runner in the Republican side and he has easy an outsider so all the big names are with the Rubio's and the Bush's and they don't like the way Donald Trump for the most part conducted himself and they don't believe he can win\nSo we put together young young talented foreign policy group and you're part of that team famously there's a picture of you all sitting around a table what was your mission uh\nSo uh I Believe that a candidate Donald Trump was actually going to be elected president as soon as I saw him announces Canada say I don't know that was just fate that and you know I was supposed to get on this campaign\nBut in the summer of two thousand Fifteen I reached out to Corey Lewandowski when I think their entire campaign was three people and I said look I Want to join this campaign I Believe in\nA Donald Trump I think he's going to end up winning so I stayed in touch with these people I got on the campaign eventually after I joined the Ben Carson campaign and my mission of sounds ... essentially was to try and McDonald's from book as much of a statesmen is\nAbsolutely possible by leveraging contacts I had in the middle east not necessarily Russia because I had no contacts there and then I go on this expedition to introduce them to Vladimir Putin and in the middle of that of course it's now known that western intelligence use that against me to ah basically sabotage me and then eventually try to do with the Trump himself\nSo how did you end up with a mission to me it valid vitamin food um\nYou know I just saw a Kennedy from talking about working with Russia I mean he was very vocal about it obviously obviously I mean this was in the secret\nAnd I said to myself okay you know I could introduce some saw a leader in the middle east but does that really going to achieve what he's been talking about and he wants to meet Vladimir Putin or at least you know they can gauge the American public of why he wants to work with Russia so I thought\nWell let's introduce them to Vladimir Putin for a photo op a handshake just so you know he would like a great statesmen and that was really essentially what I was trying to put together there was no collusion there was no attempt to ... this is all fantasy\nCalled back to sessions say listen I'm getting some contacts with Russia who these contacts\nI'm so sorry I didn't talk to us to sessions of in particular but at that meeting if that's what you're referring to emerge thirty first meeting\nI basically told the group although I there's this one person who's a presenting himself as some sort of an intermediary with Russia and I could set up this meeting by using him or we all interested of course some people were not interested you know I don't think really Donald Trump was that interest that he just kind of nodded\nTo think about it and then I just pursuit of and then never went anywhere so there's this misunderstanding that I'm this insider in Russia when in reality I was a complete want to be\nWhen it came to that part of the world because they were telling you one thing and who was that person that was telling you they had rushing connections uh so yeah it's just a infamous professor Joseph ... professor that are just a couple of days ago or more to\nJust simply ... we're living in London and as a professor exactly\nAnd living in London tied to all these western intelligence groups but then ah you know he starts to present himself as a Russia Insider\nAnd basically a couple of days ago his own lawyer went public in state of that he was working for the FBI not Russia\nSo it's very confusing I don't understand why his own lawyer would make such a statement if it is false I don't believe it's fall and he's also hiding in Italy is also is also hiding in Italy his living openly I think he changed his identity so obviously is getting support I mean ... is a reputation obviously it must be destroyed\nHe's not going to be attending conferences or\nAnything like that so how is he living who's supporting him and have them check stopped and is that why his lawyer went public knowledge\nPapadopoulos is here so this is your first contact with intelligence but do you think you're talking to fester but you're talking to Joseph ... who's allied with British Intelligence officer as so did one of the things he tells you\nOr what does he tell you about Hillary's emails\nSo I'm ... by the time he tells me a in late April that the Russians quote have thousands of Hillary Clinton's emails this is a person who couldn't even introduced me to anyone of substance in Russia or the Russian government or\nYou ask me twenty four

becomes fuel and it's a whole thing how many Democrats feel like they did with Hillary Clinton in twenty sixteen only to be crushed on election day or is that one of those things where you're trying to motivate voters as they read the article there's a fear that the Republicans have closed the gap\nSince Labor Day you'd have to say yes but how close that they've gotten to the closing the gap in the house is key right ...\nYeah but I mean you have to I think it started with the Senate because that\nHas always been the Republican stop goal that if they lost the house they had to keep the

then you had to change the way society deals with the developmentally disabled is really a a herculean effort that took a combination of federal law suits and a legislation and and just to get people's minds around the concept that you don't warehouses humans\nThe way you wear ... or a you know a old furniture\nAnd in fact er and I want to get to the breaking news but I Do want to finish this and that you did developmentally challenged now or ... that the goal is to get them living on their own and get\nTheir act exactly exactly and that\nRather than being stuck in a huge dirty filthy smelly noisy room sixty of them with one attendant smeared with their own feces and I'm being dead slop they they live respected\nA respectable lives normal lives as normal as possible uh depending on their disability they're handicap\nOr there's homes opening all across the country from coast to coast or\nA you know we're two three four five or a developmentally disabled folk live together they uh they go to school they take ... training they have relationships have normalized life expectancy is now a back then are very ... it's like the the signal signal achievement of my otherwise a seat\nOr do\nNot true and just real quick how do we get in touch and support you well\nLife's work life or is it the principal charity life's work but I tell you autism speaks is also\nA terrific it's nationwide or anybody that wants to help and there's so many people who were directly affected any parent with an autistic child those when I'm Talking about they need help they need support or they need more these community based residences to open as an alternative to going back to the grim old days life's work looking at ...\nHigh and now to this what is going on we found out two more package is as soon as I got off Fox and friends and started on this show or they look like packages how would you label them Geraldo because they they have the makings of a bomb but no explosive devices\nI think they're pseudo bonds fake bombs I think the weapons are designed to terrorize rather than to explode and because they never intended never were designed that were never capable of inflicting or\nA death or injury or it was clearly a stunt the question is whether the stunt was as a you know certainly as advertised done by a Trump supporter\nEither go yet the trumps enemies list which to me and I had this eureka moment last night and I said we're trying to go to a crucial midterm election\nTrump supporter is going to do something that was guaranteed to make the ... the president of the United states looked like who is complicit in mass murder or tempted mass murder I mean no supporter of Trump\nIt'd be able to play with friends like these who need the enemies no supporter of Trump or that I thought this through for one minute would think that this was going to help the president striking out of James Clapper or Cory Booker the Clintons Obama's or Brennan deniro George Soros Maxine Waters\nI mean that's the Trump enemies list you get to you you're going to do something so blatant so obvious that uh\nI you know my uh my my pet dog would see what was that the clear motive apparent motive or false flag motive was to uh\nUh you know grow up to the president's enemies or was it just to make the president look bad really a Trump paid they're doing this or even dare I say it has some manipulate their about political system like Russia or China\nI I Want you to hear some of what ah MSNBC and CNN is saying about this attack ended up going into that I thought we'd have conversations like this may be on the Sunday shows but first we find out who the who the suspect is not so cut a\nFair to blame and some of the president's rhetoric our president\nCannot escape special scrutiny he is at the head of the hate parade\nUnleashed dogs are the\nRhetoric that comes out of that White House is not helpful it all\nOn this collateral damage\nRhetoric has been going on in President at his rally friday the ... what ... what what is new and toxic mix toxic mix at two years and bracing dictator tone is coming from the top\nAnd now CNN has become a target [laughter] incumbent upon the Republican in this country to start to speak out\nOn the perpetrators fat\nOkay or you think that's fair\nI think it's appalling unfair that's exactly my point people sees that on this\nThis so so obvious a connection between Trump's enemies and uh and being in receipt of\nOne of these devices that we all tend to Trump's enemies but what a Trump friend really do that no friend would do that that ... days before an election if ever it's just it's either it's shocking to me that there hasn't been more skepticism\nMore cynicism directed at the mainstream media than there has been and it is strictly a up a ... a point of believing what you want to believe people\nWant to believe that Trump's\nBy fiery rhetoric led directly to these devices being sent to his enemies that Trump inspired these attacks it's obvious\nIt's too easy to make that connection\nYou know with my pet dogs can make that connection anybody can make the connection it is obvious what they intended to do they intended to make President Trump blip complicit who did it\nI think that that once the FBI announces for sure and I think coming down on them to do it sooner rather than later once the announcers for sure that these devices never could have blown up\nNever they were not real bombs once they announced that then the next step has to be\nLet's find is that it's a alleged perpetrator let's find out what is real motive was and is it not a fact that the real motive was to get the migrant caravans either they or the front line to get the idea of what jobs not mobs a slogan of the president's off the front line to get the economic\nAchievement so the president's off the front page I I think that this is a put up job I think more likely than not I'm not sure of course I don't know yet uh but I talk on the couch last night and I spent a long time on the phone talking to cops last night they think that these were bogus devices or big big the\nHard core a bearing that gold street cops that I Know I think that this is all up in the lab right hoax\nOr rather of air with this obviously Geraldo as we head to the midterms I Know it's impossible who would ever predicted the caravan Hoover predicted this type of a rock is confirmation of Kavanaugh\nSo and now all of a sudden we have a eleven devices scattered across the country against prominent Democrats but if the election where the election now and eleven days on Tuesday what are we going to be seen by the house who they're going to be saying about the Senate\n... are you asking I predict it on ... [noise]\nWell I just know blue wave I'll tell you that much as ... I don't know I haven't factored in my own psyche yet the impact of the this uh uh this bomber ...\nAh you know on what I've before the devices were discovered before the cat scathing\nCriticism ... bucks is made up of President Trump as the instigator of of this\nUh you know potential horrific violence I felt that Trump had it I thought I thought that ah\nAh when the Margaret caravan started coming even though I oppose the president's immigration policies by and large I think that much to draconian a but having said that I thought the Trump totally reverse the trend his popularity picking up higher than it's ever been higher than a rocket bomber was at this stage I thought\nThat he had the midterms in ... in his pocket I don't know what the impact of the last two three days though has spent\nBrian I Know it's going to be so tough to tell and to keep up with all this uh when's the last time you talk to the president\n[noise] I have not talked to the president in ah almost four weeks\nOkay I I Do believe in according to reports say he's really enjoying it may be for the first time\nAt well he certainly was having a good time when I talk to [laughter] he's a you know I think a lot\nHas to do with this tapping now I think he's finally gotten to a place where ah\nYou know first of all you as the competition between the John Kelly and and uh uh John Bolton the thing is happy I helped the tension and you know he's got a our own ah best shine one of the most brilliant media executives on earth\nNow uh you know I at his uh it is right or his right shoulder they're backing him up by I think the weeding out slowly or the deep state types who want to sabotage him a and I I think he also senses are with the economy and with his uh his\nHis poll numbers are getting rose era you know picking up a that he may really have a shot at being a a very good if not a great\nPerson he is Geraldo Rivera Geraldo best of luck watch your weekend\nThey spread it on in the mid west you got people out\nThere that you are at Geraldo Rivera is a place to follow ... gonna be your calls wanting to fix for all eight seven six six dimes and if you want to know where all day and hopefully it's near you go to Brian kill me dot com just click on tours Andrew Jackson milk of New Orleans now that I'm paperback with a brand new afterword this is the brand kill me Joe\nThe hunt for unlikely voters\nIs getting a strong push from both major candidates for Georgia governor's race between Republican Brian pampered Democrats basically ... it was almost literally American mutt both are scrambling to render judge their own bases and that means getting I'm likely voters to vote\nHawk for her to our sports ... will miss at least three games after hurting his left me in line with us from opener we've done our he's all for today's game with download and will miss the hawks road trip to Philadelphia in Cleveland ... who might be the film where would you must be news turn one thirty\nOne Brian Kemp Stacey Abrams Georgia's future is in your hand followed Georgia's race for governor every day we got played Erick Erickson and the company's largest news team nobody covers Georgia's elections like news Ninety five pound am seven fifty do when you asked me a band on\nGuns guns and gun show John do best up big Lawrenceville gonna nice show on sale this weekend up what our county fairgrounds by cell three thousands of new and used wisely shot guns handguns nice wholesome managing\nThe holster reload while I have so much more bringing your own gun collection of cash wires paying of the thousand dollars one\nWay or go on ship so dump is a big large gun show this weekend up like what our county fairs\nAround twenty four oh five shut them up on the way it sounded a nine to five on Sunday tend to vote for [noise]\nHey although Halloween is a holiday full of scares in surprises choosing where you buy your next vehicle shouldn't be\nThat's why I gladly refer all my friends and family to Jim alber Chevrolet why because they always go above and beyond to exceed my expectations kind of like those houses that get a full sized candy bars and Halloween and the savings well they're hard to beat especially this time of year\nRight now Jim Ellis Chevrolet you could say twelve thousand dollars often is our pee on all twenty eight ... ... ... ...

complete investigation into my clients allegations\nAnd that would ease a that is Michael have an idea what he's referring to there and his presser was a letter that Grassley wrote two sessions and Christopher Wray the FBI Director\nHe said in light of a mix sweating it can Mr ... his own statements to the media information obtained from the committee interviews of or associations and public

know what he's doing is having a ... right well\nThat's exactly what he said yesterday like he doesn't know what he's unleashed in what he's just done\nA I think that Chuck Grassley who had been presiding over the Senate for decades or in various capacities and has done a number of investigations and presided over there that I Would venture to say that he had a good grasp on exactly what he's done\nUm my very non scientific political I put out last night says you are you taking in this fight at night or Chuck Chuck it currently at Ninety five percent to five percent\nYeah uh that take that for what it's\nWorth so but ... does he have to go back and can you go back in and did you go into discovery and try to find out more information about cabinet\nI I mean to me I don't think so the way that this is proceeding as a Senate proceeding he filed a couple of 'em are presented a couple of the declaration sworn declarations by women that he was working with\nThis isn't like he is going to now get get to open some civil lawsuit against Chuck Grassley unless he decided to do that if this is going to be a deal Jay investigation that's not how it works gotcha\nAll right let's talk about these packages are your sources saying they're getting close to finding out who's behind it\n[noise] yeah in fact you know we had a couple of a focus on last night uh who are very experienced\nIn this uh including um you know somebody who has been apart as numerous as a high profile bonding investigations and they said to register the FBI had way more information is\nProbably way closer to the individual as individuals and then they're publicly saying at this point just because there's so much potential ...\nEvidence and all these these packages that didn't actually explode um there's just so much information that you're there it's almost as if the person that taunting down because you know when these things to stay in place that forensic evidence is a\nYou know just overwhelming it's at at this point I'm so yeah are supposed to think that they are very close and it wouldn't surprise and it's in a day or two we had to buy the concrete information about exactly who they think's responsible\nTerry ... former deputy assistant director of counter terror said this about what the suspects probably like cut seven\nI Do feel this is probably some sort of alone offender I don't think this was going to involve the group I think it's somebody that is clearly been planning it for a while because after all this person has put a seven to ten bombs in the mail so it took awhile to do all the research it took awhile to do the building took awhile to put these packages together and have a plan\nSo now with the FBI has to do is go back and try and I'm In reverse since these crimes actually occurred from the time these packages were mailed a place in the mail saying\nThey have to figure out what happened in between and where the packages were and try and pay for all this together you know the the things we talked about before finding cameras finding potential witnesses right in the mail saying that handle these devices\nAre so that she was doing it and that's where a sense and I hear there's a there's a lot of activity in Florida right now we know Debbie Wasserman Schultz who's ...\nTurn to address for just about every one what do you think it means a Shannon and we're glad about this that these are bomb it looks like a bomb but there's no detonation\nAbility with these\nRight I mean you know somebody that I talked to off the record who\nIs also very deep into these kinds of investigations not this one in particular said you didn't have to really look at this at their you know the people who are examining\nThe bomb techs and the specialists through the FBI\nThey know almost immediately whether something is a viable device or not unless the authorities in New York has said these are not hoaxes these are potentially viable devices [noise] um but not one has\nGone off and apparently none of the packaging the way that normally they would expect something like this to be done if they actually want to hurt or killed people is that the packages booby trapped to go off when you open it they said that wasn't part of it either so\nIs adjust to strictly in the work quote terrorize to instill terror and people to frighten people\nI'm I'm hoping when I buy and kill me will come on\nI Hope this week you might get by coming out next week out since the second half a week right as we can live in Studio\n... the you can stay for finding a dance

news done too low on\nRight I I think that's an that's an interesting detail that comes to a word that's been reported about the packages themselves\nI mean I think that we always want to look at in the news you have to just to get it are these packages who who could influence the packages\nWere these days as you know so called bond at this point I'm going to be really curious and we find out even more information about what was inside the packages to get there you know wasn't it detonator if there wasn't that started you know the string component that you need to to build a bomb you know God Forbid that anyone would open that packaged what does that tell us about this\nThis aspect does it tell us that you know this is just to scare people just tell us that this person which you know an\nClearly ill equipped to do this\nUh you know it gets to rule out\nDifferent things like terrorism I mean without knowing who this person was really there were all you know all possibilities are on the table and so a detail like that which we get a little more information confirmation from the FBI they will be really important\nYeah I think that would definitely help we understand is going to be a two thirty eastern time press conference\nWe'll we'll find out more details on the FBI so Joe Biden was targeted yesterday also ah Martha mckell him did a sit down with Nielsen at the border but she wasn't just talking about the border obviously homeland security secretary in charge of Secret Service and other investigative tools and all the homeland said this cut two\nFBI as sad as tracking that I don't want to or in any way hinder their investigation I'm not going to say more about er an active in that situation that rest assured that President uh appropriately interacted everyone within the United states federal government to work on this uh as quickly and expeditiously as possible to bring people for percentage of the other\nSo a moving not given much information Andy McCarthy was actually a little bit last night uh because these bomb because these materials on tacked ... pretty much knows who weren't necessarily looking to hurt somebody cuts six\nAt the beginning of the investigation one it's just one or two packages you have to take the position because it would be a responsible or take any other position that it's these alive bombs to somebody who intend to commit mass murder\nWhen you get to the point where you're you know twenty four thirty six hours for fast forward\nAnd now you've got ten devices and nothing has gone off\nAnd in fact what we're also hearing is that you know most of the time when you're dealing with packages like this the idea was that they are booby trap the act of opening them is what detonate them\nUh and that hasn't happened here with respect to at least some of them that have been opened you have to then start shifting your theory to the idea that what we're dealing with is somebody who intended to frighten rather than have these things detonate\nTrue or does it mean you could not you know if this is not the person and then we by the way a John Roberts has confirmed the department of justice has told him that they do have somebody in custody so this is if this is this is the person great it's over\nBut if not and there's another wave only this time they explode remember which in a lot of people going back to it what was happening in Austin does this remind you of what was happening in Austin\nThat was really into I mean it's hard to compare Audi case if we take a step back was that we don't want anyone to be afraid we don't want anyone to be injured we should not be you know there should not be a concern that we want any citizen in America to worry about in Austin and it was incredibly scary and we talk about this on the radio because\nThese worst is just a kid a device that were staying in the mail and also be trapped on the street and it was by a young man\nAnd a ... you know unfortunately he took his own life do we know we we still to this day unfortunately don't know the complete motivation of that crime because it targeted a whole bunch of different people and I think that that experience did show is though is that\nIf someone wants to make a device\nTo explode there is a way to learn how to do it I mean it's scary that sounds that is true it this way that you know at twenty something uh\nA young man that did it so you know I think I think that that that whole experience really\nRaise people's awareness\nOf just what sort of resources are are out there to cause harm in this day and age and\nThe idea that we're getting so many packages delivered all the time that our economy is based on that was also part of the story at Texas because you realize that there is not attended protection or say anything I mean that also is a really important difference\nRight you know none of these packages that we know of right now we're actually you know went to the recipient that problem in Austin where these were average American citizens that stopped boxes pick it up\nAnd just even taking up the box detonated the explosion you know these packages were stopped the went today were stopped they were going through and the ones before we stopped by you know officials that were inspecting the male so there are differences you know I think it's\nAny of these stories and when we look at the bigger picture just you know they're scary to even think about so hopefully this is the person and we get a little bit more information but you always have to be concerned about copycat\nYou know seeing that hate mail delivery is a way that you can actually scared a lot of people\nYeah and I think that's happening or will say hey this caravan is a national news not as big since the ... the center packages had been gone up a huge we have two reporters\nNow full time with this ... which is around four thousand people in society seven to doing just a bit there about a thousand miles from from human County Texas at about two thousand from San Diego I'm\nThis highlights a big problem illegal immigration and it's where Democrats and Republicans disagree\nBut what does America want I think the average American is not so much worried about a wall or a fence or they do all worried about security when it comes to our borders never some type of control or who comes in and out where do you get the sense Texas is\nWell I think for taxes at a border state is that you are concerned about security I mean I think that as a high priority as citizens here but I also think you have a lot of folks in Texas that have a deep connection to Mexico and Central America and had an awareness of the poverty and the violence that's happening\nIn that part of the world so it's an interesting conversation to have here in Texas and that\nThe journalists being based here versus New York still different you know it lasted a political conversation and more of an emotional light and in many
