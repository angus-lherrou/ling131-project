locked up in the four seasons hotel\nOr in a in Riyadh the capital even\nAs the extort money from them and now and and you know he's been backing or using us arms to bomb the hell out of Yemen\nWiping out bridal parties killing civilians left and right or is a is regime as historically\nFunded all them addresses the religious schools that are given birth to a you know future radicals like the Fifteen Saudis who participated in the nine eleven attacks I think that uh\nHe's really low down totally self serving a despot and I'm I'm Glad that uh\nUh you know he's now going to be busted for his arrogant apparent murder of a of a Saturday journalists who is exposing some of the things I\nTalked about for a couple of things you know everything you said about the Saudi Arabia is true I'm not going to go to bat for them they're not Canada\nI get it they're not Britain they never will be but in the middle east they seem to have ... understood that these ... have turned on them that that school of thought of dead or a bad shot that form of a bassoon urea yeah\nThat that they're not ... but are Salafis the salad ... students those are the ones that are uncontrollable and they were training and they seem to Hawaii to up to that having said that we decided that prison Obama ignored Saudi Arabia\nAnd we watched the rise of Iran as he did everything to get this Iranian deal so the risk is as bad as Saudi Arabia is there somebody that we've been with for sixty Seventy eighty years it FDR a you know help support\nSo we thought okay let's go with them as a counterbalance to Iran in the region so we go out to them and we should sanction them we have to realize we can't go too far because ah Iran is worse than they are\nWell I I see it differently I I I think that\nThe bronco bomber was on to something\nWhen I I totally support President Trump but I think that it in my world view in my experience and the reason I think it's a it's it's not in considerable uh I I Believe that\nSaudi Arabia is by far the most malignant force in the region I when you see who's actually sponsoring terrorism who is a ... you know in Europe you never see a Shiite terrorist in Europe they're all Sudanese they're all bankrolled by\nSaudi Arabia every attack you say in France and Belgium in Spain or wherever you in Germany or wherever you see the the the the terrorists who are really affecting\nThe temple of life in the European confident and here as well or who was the you know they're they're almost always Saturday sponsored Sudanese I don't I don't\nKnow when the last time you can point to it in Iran sponsored Shiite\nAs a as ... as perpetrating me as far as I think we're making a terrible mistake and bank rolling Saudi Arabia I understand the pragmatic aspect they do by over a hundred billion dollars worth of arms but do we as the United states how do we feel about our bombs\nWiping out bridal parties in in Yemen and killing schoolchildren and yeah I I think that\nWe need a total reassessment and this guy in Saudi Arabian charge now is a bum fry it might\nWell I mean I did not think I knew that he wasn't going to be a you know he was going to be Thomas Jefferson but I Do think he was going to be a ... an improvement and ... young enough to think to himself I we can't exist like this\nBut they will give you this the way I understand it and I'm not I'm not reading the Yemeni papers on a daily basis I'll give you that\nBut I Will say that the Saudis have Yemen on their doorstep they're concerned about the who the rebels who were propped up by Iran and now all of a sudden we have a situation where when you bomb as we've seen over the last Seventeen years in Afghanistan\nSometimes you hit the wrong people for whatever reason bombs go astray and maybe you got bad intelligence my hunch is Saudi Arabia knows it's not in their best interest to bullet bridal parties but like we do sometimes we got bad intelligence you buy\nIt I I really I really don't first of all a Yemen on Saudi Arabia's doorstep Yemen is a tiny country with a different religious or a belief and training and orientation then the Saudis\nIt's a desert where Saudi Arabia and Yemen meat is that nobody lives there is a Yemen is not going to invade Saudi Arabia that who treat rebels are no strategic threat to the Saudis Saudi Arabia wants a Gemini there they want you know they are petrified of the Iranians I give you that\nYeah there there are ... it'll be around even base to be Iranian ... sphere of influence\nIran doesn't need the Yemen Iran already is strategically located in the center of the of the middle East that has a much more favored location it doesn't need a satellite in Yemen what Iran is trying to do in my view is to protect the non Sunni Muslims who live in some of these other countries\nYou mean out of benevolence the heart I think it's I I I don't listen I think that I wanted my bottom line is this Iran is Persia Persian is an ancient ancient\nEmpire with real culture when you see the Persians that live in the United states like the ... of a Sunset Boulevard they they want to be rich they want to be\n... American Geraldo I Love I Love that point which means they are good people would buy a horrible government horrible\nThe government and the the more we alienate them the more we prop up the horrible government in Iran I think\nThat I think they're suffering now I think the president doing a good ...\nYeah I think that the president is doing a good job putting pressure on the government uh you know I I I Wish there was a ... I I met Rouhani when he came to the general assembly a ... not this year the year before and I you know I hung out with a for a little bit interviewed him or you know I I\nHe's not crazy like the Ayatollah Khomeini and those other the the the ayatollah who took hostages back in Seventy nine was it in the Carter administration I you know I I I think that there is a deal to be made with\nWith Persia slash Iran I we're getting off into a geopolitical yeah it's pretty complicated but I just think that America is by stereotyping Saudi isn't good and Iran as bad as missing\nThe boat okay I Want you to ... on something I think we can agree on ...

I'm going wait a second\nEvery one of these people that was in the previous administration is going after this administration ouch we never used to do that during an unspoken law he just didn't do that\nI mean I I worked in George W Bush's White House I Love George W. Bush and but the moment he left the White House he was gone down if we did not see him again and plus there was a funeral\nOr all the way he was being called out for six years of course being blamed for six years at Obama's\nInauguration he called out Bush and Bush went and got on al ... he didn't he didn't stick around like the Obamas are doing or frankly like the Clintons are doing you just mentioned all these losing presidential candidates\nWhen normally when you lose the presidential campaign so very humbling moment and you try your best to bring the country together and support the person that one that is not what Hillary Clinton is doing she's on the speaking circuit in our in our I don't know if you stop at her and her husband are hitting the speaking circuit together\nI guarantee what they're talking about they're going to go around and trash Trump is what is what that is a that's just not what you do when you lose the presidential campaign is not a good look and be it's not good politically for the Democratic party to still be led by the Clintons\nA couple of things are as Mark Penn said you know more than it is very smart guy and I guess he's on the ... of the Democratic party after Hillary lost the nomination away and you know weight but he's still a Democrat\nHe was with me today and he said I Can't believe she is doing this and he is doing this and seven hundred bucks a ticket the high end and nothing's going to charity you\nNeed money they don't need money why would you charge seven hundred bucks to see people who don't like each other\nA couple dozen like each other they're probably never together they're going to be on together and\nWhy would you pay seven hundred bucks for that why wouldn't I wouldn't be seven are Democrat I Want to pay that are up somebody who has a problem with the way they act in the White House the me too movement sidelines marginalize him in a hurry ineffectiveness marginalize her\nNo that's that's the best that exactly right I and I actually think a lot of democratic candidates don't want Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton's\nFor driving around the country this fall they want this election view at their future they want us to be about the next generation of democratic leaders instead\nThe party's continue to be dominated by people like Dianne Feinstein who why she's still running for reelection is beyond me Nancy Pelosi why she wants to be speaker of the house again is beyond me all the Democratic party is being held back by this senior\nThat's happening in my faith is here\nSo is that could help her Senate run\nNo I mean I look she was leading most of this race but we've seen the polls tightened dramatically in Arizona in recent weeks in part because voters are learning learning a lot more about some of the New York times of all papers\nHad a story about a week or two ago they basically said to her whole biography is is alive she used to sleep so poor she was still being homeless growing up and they the New York times went back and looked at the central she wasn't she wasn't homeless as a kid there is no evidence of that\nSimilarly you're right she's trying to present herself as a moderate now but it was not long ago that she was a left wing lunatics for lack of a better word which is about as liberal as you could possibly get\n... does she I think is in real trouble ... just four weeks ago I think Republicans are going to hold that she'd make Sally is a phenomenal ...\n... I don't even know why she's struggling some have uh postulated that perhaps because it was such a competitive primary no one really was behind and the president just backed out of it\nYeah I think that's part of it it was a very contentious primary there and you know there was an open seat in at a seat the Republicans should when I think they were going to win that Arizona Center is in part because make Sally such a strong candidate send them as a deeply flawed candidate and just nationwide we've seen a real bump in all the Republicans' numbers in the last few weeks in part because of cabinet\nIt's interesting because they overplay their hand rather than look they put out A Guided was a bad guy in a bad candidate turns out how many people look back at a high school days and say I had a few too many beers and I'm Still okay as a person I might be able to have a job or the sexual assault could not be confirmed and in the end people solve some of the struggles\nThat date back thirty six years and wonder can my life hold up to thirty six years ago I Know I Am not proud of everything I did in high school and college would you are outside of ... a call ... said this about what's happening in Texas Beto O'Rourke a guy that LeBron James likes and Democrats are rallying behind a lot of charisma presents\nA his real name is Robert cut thirty seven\nPeople are waking up to the fact that Beto O'Rourke\nRobert Francis O'Rourke is a very liberal guy in favor of impeachment once a government run health care are in favor of free college universal job six of them said that he can think of nothing more American he said\nThen taken and then decided to take a knee or at the plate of the national anthem that's not a very ... Texas guy the more he gets known as a liberal the less as a moderate\nOr the the stronger this but people have strong opinions about bet Dylan strong opinions about that but at the end of the day it's going to be a red victory\nBut it's getting scary for Republicans is it still\n... I think Texas is a fascinating Senate race Bedouine made a really interesting strategic choice early in this campaign which was that he's not going to worry about moderate she's not going to try to win over conservative voters in Texas\nHe's just going to try to drive unprecedented liberal turnout democratic turnout in the state is running a very liberal campaign as Karl just hadn't act and that gets the crowds gets big crowds he's raising unbelievable amounts of money\nThe problem is that there's a lot more Republicans then there's Democrats and the state and so like I think he's gonna he's gonna do well he's gonna he's gonna have probably a record number of votes for himself in Texas\nHowever Ted Cruz's finding that the Republican base is coming home he's got Donald Trump coming to to rally the base and even if if Cruz just gets average Republican turnout he's going to win that race regardless of what better does at this point\nHe wants to run for president can you lose a Senate race and run for president\nI don't I don't like the horn tried it thought\nIt was going to come out of this was probably the best fundraising list in the country just given how much enthusiasm is generated on the liberal side of the belt but\nAgain I don't know what the cases if you can't win in Texas state wide you're going to turn around and try to win and places like Iowa and Ohio Pennsylvania and I don't buy it\nSo now you know Florida well you there was Marco Rubio now you have a ... a you have a governor Nelson who's doing the Governor Scott looking at best doing the best he can\nIn a ... horrible hurricane just grind it up the whole Gulf Coast so he's their wares dissent is congressman descent as I Know he doesn't want to look like a deputy but at the same time he could be playing more of a roll\nRight yeah I mean look it's hard to second guess from the outside the whenever I've worked on a lot of campaigns is you know Brian and whenever a natural disaster or some term disaster like this happens\nThe politics of it are really tricky you don't want to be seen as an opportunity to us so I I don't want to second guess to San Francisco strategy I Will say I've friends working on that race and that those numbers the Santas Gillum numbers have closed dramatically in the last week or so I think because people are discovering that Gillum the the mayor of Tennessee who's the Democratic nominee\nIs the age of ... in Tallahassee ... thank you\nHe's a socialist and and Florida is not about to elect a socialist governor I I think if some if it wants this once we get through the storm\nI think the sand is just needs to focus on drilling down that message making sure that voters in Florida understand Gillum understand what he would do if he were elected governor and the base will come home I feel pretty good about Marco\nRubio and Ted Cruz into Donald Trump won added barely in personally but yet I see Marco Rubio's Rubio is one of the first to be invited to the White House how was the relationship that the president they\nThey have a very good working relationship but we're talking just a moment ago off air\nMarco and the and and and Trump and the Trump team worked very well together especially on issues like the western hemisphere Cuba Venezuela market was really taken a leadership role I think obviously with the hurricane now the ... Marco was visiting with FEMA the Trump team\nMaking sure that the federal government is doing everything it can to assist in Florida Florida voters\nI look I think Marco as I Know for a fact of Marcos excited that there's a Republican in the White House and he likes Donald Trump personally they they they get along fine now\nAfter the after the some of the ... campaign yeah but you know they've flown on\nThat they've gotten to know each other and and they work well together and market works very well with the president\nIs so interesting right to do if I talk to you and twenty sixteen after you say you ... we'd be what would you tell me\nWell look I'm Marco Marco Marco ... doesn't take all of a self ... any good politician doesn't take it all very personally and and at the end of the day when mark especially when you decided to run for reelection I knew he'd do what was best for Florida a but look losing as hard and um you know as as we're seeing with Hillary Clinton some people don't take it very well\nAbsolutely but I Will say this I Do predict that Marco Rubio run for president and be successful I there's no question he's so young so talented and you are on the way had her on a national campaign\nYeah uh I ... I Hope you're right I mean like I worked really hard I work for for over five years I think he's just a a tremendously talented they in your biases I'm a little biased I mean yeah\nThe president Rubio some day looking for the he's the man in the middle and out numbered at noon\nOut there and watch the news they want someone like neutron our job is to come through the talking points ... we're going to ask the question because there's a lot of\nConventional wisdom out there in the mean guinea ... and then when I'm making sure that whatever is on the day people are fully informed from coast to coast were twenty four seven news\nBe here let's we're going to be fashion whether ... midnight and were there on channel\nReal news real honest opinion what it is it stars\nAnd he got in Britain and Henry and we're excited to be a part in the ... nation because now more than ever we need powerful voice chat won't\nBecause now more than ever we need box nation then you don't want to have ended up ... favorites you already love Latin\nTime they're going to be very PC hell no on the sea is more like maintain opinion done right but if I make you dot com\nA\nBiker never forget the sound the screaming tires the crunch of metal and fiberglass if somebody causes you to lay your bike down steel horse lock and help\nThere are a law firm dedicated to protecting down bikers writes motorcycle injury lawyers who ride Neil bortz year and I've written with Attorney George time and he can help you get back on your feet get your bike repair your medical bills paid and your case resolved\nGet a free riders advantage carded steel horse law dot com or called for all four or five two to one thousand\nCome I don't give me that during the headlights look you know George is distracted driving laws enforced but that doesn't mean you'll ever be stuck in traffic download the app think keep your hands off your phone\nWith us these people seem traffic alerts that by your phone's your goals is to open up the ... before you begin your commute traffic alerts or automatic look I'm right here phone or loses enabled radio ...

not be more grateful\nRight so that'll be one good thing and I know the vice president states has also led the charge on that so we have personal sanctions against gays style on certain people in Turkey so we'll see where that goes but\nI don't get why Saudi Arabia if these reports and their widespread and there are details are true and they actually killed his Washington Post columnist why they think they could get away with it and it's not and why would it be worth damage you relations with the world's number one economic and military superpower\n[noise] yeah and that's one of the questions you have to ask because one of the report was they thought maybe that this was they were going to get him and detain them and take him back and maybe it went wrong\nOr maybe they're going to lock them up and it went wrong we just don't know I there is a lot of unknown at this point and there are some people who say wait a minute you think about this turkey as I said over the last couple of years have been more anti western a lot of friction with the U.S\nVery hostile um Saudi Arabia has been you know helping us and in the region and there's been a good\nUs Saudi relationship so it does seem like something that would be so explosive and unhelpful a on\nMany many levels that it doesn't make sense maybe there's something that went wrong or maybe I think it was that you played Senator Corker might have been and make it another one that talked about this arrogance is sort of developed with and that they made me feel like I'm under this new leadership that day can push the boundaries of what's going to be accepted by the international community\nI don't want to tell you at a book to your show but uh maybe Senator Corker was the best interview of the last two months he's so honest anyway let alone a guy who's about to put a hold on his political career for now and he was led denying that he was a huge supporter of Saudi Arabia made sure they got their arms\nAnd now this is devastating yeah before we jump to conclusions and say this is done no how Turkey's been acting over the last couple of years Daniel Hofmann\nTook that into account and said this about this entire incident cut twenty four\nThere's roughly a dozen are us citizens being held in Turkey we don't have any hard evidence here but the timing does look awfully awfully interesting and maybe not so

states which has been suffering over the past couple of years\nSo he ... he wasn't born yesterday he's got an intelligence background from Iraq to Russia and he says wait a second before you jump to conclusions as did the president and the presidents getting some blowback he's used to it for being slow to go after Saudi Arabia\nMhm caving in Reno\nWell and you know I Know that you guys talk to him yesterday and the night before I had him on it asked about\nUm the the arms deal because there is absolutely agreement on Capitol Hill that the Senate is going to shut down for the arms sales\nIt they're conclusive evidence that lead them to believe the Saudis are responsible for the disappearance of death in ... so\nYou know the president was very hesitant on that saying well you know I mean it's we're talking about billions of dollars and he says they're just going to go buy it from Russia and it it impacts American companies that are manufacturing arms so that's very much a a business standpoint an economic point but I think there are times you\nGot to stand up on moral grounds and they're ready to do it on Capitol Hill will see the president will come around their way of thinking that\nYeah I guess so uh a couple of things are happening right now number one I don't think it was I finally heartening that Michelle Obama saw her family friend attorney general attorney general
