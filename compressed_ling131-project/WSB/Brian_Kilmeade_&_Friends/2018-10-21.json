you a for years whenever I see my dentist he's trying to uh\nTalked me into installing a bridge on a a I have an open more that I've been chewing on for ten years no no uh no problems who'd been trying to talk me into installing a bridge on their thing and it was a piece of cake\nSo three and a half weeks ago I allowed him to do it it hurts me thirty five hundred dollars and part of that preparation for bridge is you're going down to write\nTwo teeth on each side yes I have one that I've\nBeen in a structured and calling for three and a half weeks\nHe thought it was settled down it didn't I've been an ibuprofen eight hundred milligrams you know twenty four hours a day for almost a month now\nHe sent me to an end to on this yesterday and ah he says that I'm going to need to root canals that grounded too ... too much for the call is almost to the store\nThat's lovely okay so what's your question\nSo his response of uh my original Dennis responses it's just one of those things happen\nYou know no it does that first of all I don't even understand why a dentist would push for a bridge today when they're\nDental implant I mean all you have to do I have a bad too if you put in a dental implant so you don't have to do a bridge which I mean I have a bridge but it was put in the decades ago before implants were even around so I I have no choice but I mean the guy from what you said this is pure malpractice\nNow you need a you have to go to another Dennis it'll say yeah this is crazy and then as soon as that happens or you get to take 'em for malpractice problem is how much his dental malpractice worth\nA but now you start going and doing all kinds of research first step get another Dennis get a second opinion to say this is crazy this is not just one of those things that happened this is malpractice on its face\nAnd then you go from there and then you start talking to\nMedical malpractice people are in there's plenty to specialize in dental malpractice\nAnd I'm not really interested in pursuing\nI'm well yeah you're right now than get it straightened out and send them a bill I mean you can assume anyway and if it's under ten thousand dollars a year go ahead

they're going to walk away from it\nDr ... thank you very much okay yeah I mean I mean could they go after the state of course for breach of contract or do you stay does the money but then it gets

the estate because he's still owes the money dead or not\nAnd uh but that would stop or the estate from being distributed because it has to be enough money put into that\nTo cover the cost of a the time share I mean it becomes a mess so timeshare companies normally just walk away or that's it you try to get him to walk away anyway but I mean the bottom line is you're crazy to get into a

O. L. okay that's a legal doctrine you know that don't you [laughter] yeah\nYou are screwed beyond screwed\nOkay ah I Love that isn't that special All right norm Hi norm hey y'all handle Yes sir\nWe live in your every morning my wife and I love your cheerful sarcasm\nOf it correct okay to literary question tore though cause I'm because I'm so literary I understand because yes because you're so literate yes I'm I'm\nWritten one book and I'm writing another one and then the first book we held off on publication because we were worried about we wait describe a couple of experiences in hotels and it was all positive nothing negative or we were wondering if those\nI Would try and do anything to us legal it because we talk about them and we give their name that oh\nNo no matter of fact even if there were negative and you give your name too though you give the hotel name out the what you can't do is make stuff up in a negative way that's defamation\nOh eight or you can tell them what can we had no no go ahead yourself alright so uh let's say a year accusing the hotel and having bedbugs in your story any name the hotel or you know I don't want to name any names but Hilton Marian\nWright Wyndham let's just go through the names incidentally what was the name of the hotel\nOr can they want to say that on the air bill\nWhy they don't know who you are\nAh well actually truthful and I'm not sure if I can imagine\nA fair enough I it's been it's been a few years\n'cause you don't have the have the proof not that you are\nOkay I'm not at all to saying you're a liar although you do sound like one a but it's just it's just too easy to uh attack you on this one so argue that feeds you obviously you totally collection easy to go pounds ... pounds sand on this one tell them to sue you and uh then you have to defend yourself it'll be a small claims to probably\nAnd then you have to worry about your credit being dangerous even a disputed has your credit already been attacked\nIt probably will all our credit yeah probably will you gotta mess on your hands and there's no there's no good way out of this\nWell my friend I mean how the money to settle it\nWell then maybe you want to pay the other hand was just negotiate with them negotiate say I'll give you half the money now\nAre now and ah I I mean at the money more than anybody I wrote or giving them money that's\nAll right well then you negotiate it on a payment you tell them to go pound sand or you look at your credit you've got your choices none of them very good unfortunately I'm not a good place to me sometimes and I often\nSay this is a everybody looks to the law as an answer and quite often the laws very sloppy that it's not very clean ah for example what's what's clean about all I have you committed a crime yes or no right\nIt's very clean the jury determines yes or the judge determines here's the statute yes thirty five miles per hour is law un thirty six or thirty seven boom you violated see that's clean stuff\nI loan you a thousand dollars you don't pay me there it is now dogs barking next door because they're too loud\nAnd I want a restraining order what does that mean\nWhat is too loud it's just a sloppy way of of dealing with things and this is one of those where the to answer this\nIs just there's nothing clean about it there really isn't so all I can say is I'm Glad it's him and glad it's not me there you go silver lining\nEvery moment okay\nOr Alexander Hi Alexander\nFrom where are we going to do for you\nOr I had a debt owed to a credit card company fifty nine hundred dollars or judgment was ... years later that judgment disappeared and I received a castle I showed up that from the IRS showing Nineteen thousand nine hundred\nOkay wait a second you oh hold on a you a cancellation of debt for Nineteen thousand nine hundred dollars correct so you're saying oh so you're dealing with the IRS that's you're not dealing with the original credit card company you're dealing with the IRS someone ten Ninety nine you for Nineteen thousand dollars is that correct\nYes okay so the IRS is now saying you will or you're forgiven this much\nDebt and uh and they got a judgment against you correct no they didn't they sue you or they just wrote it off\nThe original credit card company I owe Fifteen I understand it they write it off\nOr I don't know if they did ... were you ever sued or no but there was a judgment so that means you are now that means you were sued okay\nAll right and so uh you got a judgment against you in a ... it's a little complicated because ah they forgiveness of debt ...\nLet me tell you the whole story okay so you\nCan follow it a little bit better be original that fifty nine hundred I received a judgment the Ira I mean the credit card company after giving up years later the IRS\nYeah no I understand since the IRS or ten Ninety nine on your behalf because with\nThe lights on for the amount that they said I ah\nYou said Nineteen thousand dollars\nThe original that fifty nine hundred I think they are I bet they are or if a copy of my credit report showed fifty nine hotter\nIt doesn't matter it ... it doesn't matter I don't care that\nReduced the IRS then reduce their mind think valve and lying hunter back the fifty nine hundred I pay the debt off so I'm square my question is trends that credit card company and white at the data from fifty nine Ninety nine do I have a record\nYou know because because no because you didn't pay the tax on the Ninety nine you ended up accepting the ten Ninety nine was for the fifty nine hundred dollars that was originally in the fault\nThe point is there are no they they all knew that there are no ... but they reduce it again\nNo not them the Ira is that right but that's the only thing you have is the IRS they already have a judgment they'd given up they're not collecting on the judgment so a credit card company has no recourse now it's only been there done a statute is done\nEven though they play the fifty nine hundred ... does it matter lanes they inflated the fifty nine hundred on the ten Ninety nine\nNot not on the judgment they issued a ten Ninety nine for Nineteen thousand you got that reduced to the original fifty nine hundred dollar where your damages\nOf the question is sent the credit card company and play that the original um\nOut yes they did four times over yes there is no records I guess the only because you have not been damaged\nIf you want me to go out in dollars when I send you a bill for a hundred thousand dollars and then you end up paying me two thousand dollars I expect it and I accept that well uh I'm I've been damaged Ninety eight thousand dollars no haven't you paint do sounds and\nOh\nTalk we went through that over and over and over again I Would have been I wouldn't inflated twenty five thousand dollars just because of patients issue\nReally God take me for an idiot yeah they do I guess people take me for a complete moron bill let me explain how this works I got it let me explain again I got it no no I I Want you to give some background\nI haven't [noise] thank you [noise] I'm
