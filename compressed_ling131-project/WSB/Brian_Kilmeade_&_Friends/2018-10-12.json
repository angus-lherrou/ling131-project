I mean this ridiculous ridiculous and they clap and they cheer and he's happy this with Maxine Waters calling on if you see it official Trump official basically get in their face others you see the activists screaming at senators walking the halls all last week\nHillary Clinton remember what she said and I'll play it back\nYou're not civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough to win back\nThe house and or the fact that ... can start again [noise]\nDoes Hillary Clinton so if we win back the house and or the Senate then we can be civil but if we lose kicking scream and the attorney general doing the kicking she's doing the screaming or encouraging it so we played this for the press and we played Eric Holder's remarks with the president cut to\nThe better be careful what he's wishing for that I can tell you better be careful what he's we're discussing safe and found a Mac for him to make a statement of like that is a very dangerous state but you know they talk about\nUs we are exactly opposite you know the rally is where they send people I I heard somebody yesterday on your show actually talking about my rallies\nThat my rallies or really calm and and well run and and packed with people we don't have problems that arise and I would say is that it wasn't so successful for those protesters but they have to be careful with the rhetoric because it's very dangerous what holder says\nThere's no question and it's not just Eric Holder it's it's all over the place uh and the word mob is being used a and as if it's being encourage Maxine Waters used it before as I mentioned being on civil that's something that Hillary Clinton brings up what does it mean in a big in the big picture Andrew McCarthy\nOr a prosecutor here in New York turned Fox contributor best selling author cut Fifteen\nPassword that it's not a four week phenomenon you know we can't here and do anything

there seems to be more outlets for with social media for these crazy people to get to know other crazy people\nAnd suddenly make it seem like it's OK especially when the so called leaders say it's okay listen to some with Don Lemon Maxine Waters Brooke Baldwin Matt Lewis listen to some of the texture of this conversation on other channels you probably don't listen to cut seven\nCall people mobs because they are exercising their constitutional right if just beyond the pale we\nCannot allow Donald Trump and anybody else to take protest away from us and to damage to be by blood and to try and make us look like them up\nWhen you see people like Ted Cruz getting chased out or restaurants by a mob I'm not going to use the word totally among\nFolks just a mob what wouldn't you used a mob these people a lot of times they are paid this is their job against Christian you'll send again Stephen Miller against Sarah Huckabee Sanders against Ted Cruz\nThat's what these guys are doing and these women are doing they feel so instead of actually doing something productive you can protest that's fine but that's all you do your screaming people you don't agree with who writes in office by the way Ted Cruz that was an eight point lead in Texas so your idol uh Beto O'Rourke who's got a lot of talent\nBut he's he's wrong on a lot of issues especially with the people are taxes are beginning to sober up\nI find a crazy a next I Want to talk about what's going to be happening today I have great hopes\nThat the president could accept Jim Brown's plan for establishing some type of prison reform because he's worked over Twenty years in prison setting up curriculums for life skills a lot of these men and women who get in prince didnt have absolutely no doubt that the education doesn't suffice they don't\nKnow how to balance a checkbook they don't have any um they don't have a a sense of self esteem he going in there with the American program and it's all part of criminal justice reform you use that\nAlong with was already been out there by banned Jones in others and the president has a template for criminal justice reform and I hope something like that comes through today when they meet at lunch I Hope it isn't just hey Jim Brown how much money would you make if you were still playing today a instead I Hope to make some progress\nSo Kanye West is out and says I I support President

latch onto a any natural calamity and it is natural and then try and try it back to to climate change in our what I call our sins of the mission are increasing CEO to content from burning\n... they're going to be hurricanes tornadoes forest fires you name it\nUh because they want to strike fear in the heart of the population in order to get things like the Paris climate accord and acted thought\nIn the big picture you say hurricanes have always been there would they would argue is the worst and there are more now because of human activity\nThat science the facts and the day that don't support that in fact a\nReliably alarmist inter governmental panel on climate change I PCC agrees with me they agree that hurricane numbers have not been increasing and even if you go to the NOAA website\nOr we could see that a boats and numbers and particularly land falling hurricanes in the United states had been a definite decline for more than a century\nAll the while CEO to and temperatures are increasing a particular land falling a hurricanes are are are stark and they're easily accountable and we can take them back\nAh really into the the end of the nineteenth century but he was just a satellite record when we can capture or you lie for records of ... of tropical storms and hurricanes are we also see\nA decline a definite decline not significant for the decline nonetheless uh both

change continues in coastal flooding from hurricane worse since uh the forms might now include acts of humans from your own [noise]\nAnd they're they're linking well we have to do is is it\nAnd go back to ... what does the science tell us what do we see in the long term data we've had two years now with land falling hurricanes in the United states so it seems like there are more but in the big picture a we'd gone back before\nLast year we'd gone twelve years with no major hurricane making landfall in the United states\nAnd that's the longest period with no major hurricanes striking landfall since Noah\nI'll begin capturing records back in Eighteen well because they go by their records go back to Eighteen fifty twelve years with no major hurricanes making landfall or you have to go back to the Eighteen sixties to get the second longest period a with no major hurricanes striking the United\nStates so so you look at things like that and what they do is take a short period of time and confused that\nWhat they need to do really as alarm the population a list what I H A man called imaginary ... of alarm with which they need to frighten the population to get\nOtherwise onerous regulations like the Paris climate accord an act I mean who who in their right mind and why would the United states and act just harmful in economically crippling legislation like\nA carbon taxes or the Paris climate accord so unless there was not\nImminent catastrophe that we need to prevent a and that's why they're doing is they're painting every natural calamity well like I mentioned before

king Solomon ... sorry you got to it and I said\nThat out and kill killing in America you can be killing me there unless everything she every now sir is in jeopardy now I have to\nFind out what happened when I go out and we're probably getting closer than you might think but I have to find out\nWhat happened the Washington Post is reporting this morning that the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman boarded the operation to lure him back to Saudi Arabia from Virginia and entertainment and according to us and tell intercepts of Saudi officials discussing the plant okay that sounds like it goes right to the top as president\nWell it wouldn't be a very sad thing and we will probably know and the short future we have some incredible people and incredible talent working on it we don't like it I don't like it no good [laughter]\n[noise] yeah I mean it's unbelievable they think they can go just take out a journalist or because they don't like to read their critical and the Saudi Government and there's a lot to criticize I don't really know much about this guy I just know that uh the the report is\nThe latest report is intelligence has picked up intercept that says that they wanted to get him and bring him back to Saudi Arabia they were trying to lure matter Virginia he goes over to turkey and they pick them up\nAnd then they do in somehow during the so called during ... two teams at Fifteen pick him up he ended up dead\nSo whether it was written dishing gone wrong or you had a heart attack or in their midst in some something happened a they're in trouble\nAnd the one thing Saudi Arabia we were looking the other way because the Saudis were taken on Iran and counter balancing a lot of orange activity through the region this puts it all in jeopardy all of it\nIn my mind and in the future our I'm not sure the order in which you're taking the show going to be treating the Bob Corker about that a bipartisan put a push to go after Saudi Arabia a and sanction them for what they may or may not have done to Jamal ... here's a Senator Chris Murphy cut thirty six\nWe're also engaged in a very disastrous military partnership with them inside Yemen today but it's predicated on us and believing the salaries that they are not intentionally trying to kill civilians inside Yemen where the United states is helping them bomb\nGiven the fact that they may be lying to our face about what happened inside this consulate in Turkey why on earth which we should we continue to believe them that they are targeting civilians with bombs inside Yemen\nWhen all of the evidence tells us that they are just as most of the evidence we've seen thus far tells us that they did kill ... or ... so\nI think it really calls into question whether we should continue in this partnership with them or inside the civil war and you have a\nCouple of things I Can't give you the latest on Yemen but I Will say this it doesn't even work to the Saudis advantage to kill civilians they're going after the who the rebels why because they're being propped up\nBy Iran who's around in the in the Arab world uh they uh they're mostly Shia or the mostly they're a Shia and what is a Saudi Arabia a Sunni and what are they trying to do take over Yemen why would they let their neighbors being takeover or by hostile power\nAnd just standby so we supply a lot of the military for Saudi Arabia you're the ... the United states has changed that they're actually paying for it these days Rand Paul actually siding with Chris Murphy on this ...\nWell I think you could say that there may not be proof that they've killed a journalist or even the journalist has been killed\nYet but what you do have evidence of is that the Saudis have been bombing civilians in Yemen for over a year now several million people live on the edge of starvation\nYeah we'll see what's going on but what role does Iran have in that have you spoken out against them and Rand Paul's Case he just wants to pull out everywhere\n... buildings fall and they get toppled and Americans get beheaded when we pulled out of Iran when we Iraq when we um when we left Afghanistan to its own devices or al ... came in you don't have the choice to be oversimplifying like that\nBut I think there's going to be a major issue today Jason singing serious or a in St Louis Jason\n[laughter] that was near Charlotte time I'm I'm not saying that the Democrats should be violent\nBut I Do feel that the Democrats need to fight fire with fire\nAnd I think the problem is Republicans are never adopted this play ball and I think are upset and I agree with it in water that we can start their constituents wherever they're at\nAnd that's exactly what I Do because I'm a fighter might sell and I agree with what Harris said we need to figure out why these other people were not interview by the FBI and also hurts supposedly that Justice John Roberts is going to be hearing complaints filed\nThat particular child but I'll ride during

start protesting in front of them you do a lot of support Eric Holder says kick them or you do I don't\nSupport the going and protest but I don't support them to cause any violence against\nWhat what do you go violent if I'm having a bombing in a restaurant with Ted Cruz shabby screamed at\nI don't think that's what I think look really I think I Know that that's OK\nWhat am I just can't get everybody that you disagree with you should just protests at their work scream outside their window and interrupt him at restaurants in malls\nThough that's all you may I make your point ...\nThat make your point you want three hundred and fifty million people who don't agree with each other to start screaming at each\nOther that's you're absolutely right\nYeah I just don't Jason you could be

stand for what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough to win back\nHouse and or the fat that ... can start again\nSo the attorney general says kick him and then she says you can't be civil I'm just wondering if it's getting warmer towards the Chris Wells threshold of tolerance\n[noise] uh I listen I as far as I'm concerned I think that the Hillary Clinton\nOr just the go stay in tropical I could I don't think she helps the Democrats at all I don't think that's called the violence by any means it isn't like what Maxine Waters did but I don't know that it helps Democrats particularly and I don't know that she\nYeah she did have all these like millions of supporters and probably still does but I don't know the tree particularly helps Democrats but\nIf you take those two things you know Joan I tell you okay maybe Chris falls to the point but if you look at what's going on\nWith Christian Nielsen with a Ted Cruz with Sarah Huckabee Sanders with every senator who happened to be walking the halls and most likely to vote for Brett Kavanaugh or had made up their mind yet have you that collectively do you wonder why some people are getting concerned let's say like a like others in Washington\nAbout their safety\n[noise] well yeah I asked to Mitch McConnell about at this last week and he didn't want to talk about a particular you said I don't talk about security matters which probably is smart on his part but I there were certainly things that I saw on Capitol Hill\nLast week during the the hearings during the vote I mean I Know it's quite extraordinary that to to see the best looking up at the TV screen and it says Donald Trump president of the United states on Fox it was it the the president on Fox and friends this morning for forty seven minutes [laughter]\n[noise] anyway to bother you well I mean I'm happy for you I have been the fact that I haven't had a single interview with him since I since he became president bothers me yeah at the fact that a Libyan knows it you know who you know who are living in those areas\nNo obviously Olivia now so you you should read this is a reporter for New York magazine when's the last time they were fair to Donald Trump she ended up spending half an hour in the oval office with Donald Trump\nJohn Kelly a Mike Pompeo Mike Pence bill shine a Sarah Huckabee Sanders I don't know I I Know it's very I I'm you know what I Would say hashtags sad [laughter]\nI think you've got a few big interviews all the way I think you're going to be okay well we'll see Kanye West is having lunch with Jim Brown and the president today again and he gets in and I was ... west ... I I don't get an interview with the president but I I don't know right on and you're worried about being to Chris Wallace centric\nI if I played that open on your television show and now everyone not how whiny whatever and uh and begging for an interview that's all here is terrorists ... someone you probably doesn't hurt obscene and contributor on Kanye West going to the White House cut twenty two\nNow all of a sudden Kanye because he's proud of that hats\nAnd he's an attention war like the president he's all of a sudden now that that the model spokesperson ... he's the ... of the of the Trump Administration\nThis is ridiculous and no one should be taking Kanye West seriously he's clearly has issues he's already been hospitalized you know not to trivialize mental health issues but I mean obviously Kanye a has taken a turn in a very strange way\nYou have a problem with that\n[noise] um well I I I'd love to put it this way I I don't think Kanye West is a major spokesmen\nFor African Americans but on the other hand he has supported the president and they use a\nCultural figure and if the president wants to have lunch with them or Jim Brown that's fine I don't think that they\nRepresent the majority opinion in the African American community but for a while you know I I Will say well I Will take a negro that's okay no I I find that a objectionable I Will say this that when you look at what the president has done in terms of jumpstart the economy yeah\nThat the unemployment rate for African Americans for\nHispanics for young\nA minority people are at the you know historical near historic lows so I mean there's no question that the general a rising economy has benefited a lot of minorities as well\nI Would think so and I think it's okay to me with the president and not get ridiculed also when it comes to mental health\nThere's a lot of very productive people who might have\nBe bipolar or have chronic depression was low and you're trying to tell me what I'm trying to say is that why is it OK you mocking somebody because of their race and your mocking someone because of their mental health\nI never I never saw it and this was on their entire panel last night why is this acceptable ... well you got him something mentally wrong with you and you have to end up condition if you want to have lunch with the president I never heard of this\nOkay I've I've become on these aren't things worth getting outraged really I was about ... somebody criticizing Kanye West\nI don't know I come on we can do but we can do better than that I can [laughter] if we can I mean look\nThere were serious issues here I think that that you know the president has done very very well on the economy uh I think that's a serious issue I think health care which is the number one issue for Democrats I was astonished to see the number of the percentage of of democratic ads\nThat are raising questions about about health care and pre existing conditions and whether those are in jeopardy those are important I mean those are important issues I mean I'm not I'm not trying to tell you what to cover and not to cover but I don't care about Kanye West one way or the I was to have lunch with the president from press wants to have lunch with them find where's my interview that's what I care\nSo I'll Try this I've got ... Harris does not want to let the Brett Kavanaugh hearings go so when the FBI Director shows up to talk about terror she talks about this ... twenty five\nAnd like to talk with you about the ah the Kevin I\nDid anyone in your age and save save any direction about the scope of the investigation directly on again do you know who determined that the FBI would not interview catch calf now are Dr Ford or the list of forty plus witnesses [noise]\nShe thinks is is a campaign issue\nWell okay so now there are two issues there one is do I have any problem with a Kamala Harris\nAsking him about that no I don't I mean it's routine you can say it's good or bad but it's routine when officials testify before a congressional committees they don't always get asked by the senators and this is true of both parties about the quote subject of the hearing they can ask them anything they want\nSo I don't have any problem with Kamala Harris asking that having said that I think the idea that Brett Kavanaugh that this was a cover up I mean the fact of the matter was there was only one really credible charge against\nOr you can say too I mean I think this next story was obviously ridiculous on its you know I I Love the fact that she claims that she went to multiple parties which women were gang rep I dunno after two or three wouldn't you think this isn't working for me I'm not really area\nParties anymore so much to talk about the two cases you know you have the ... the woman at Yale and you add Christine Blasey Ford\nAnd they interviewed people on both and they could find a zero backup for that so I I understand it's an issue and that's that's fine I mean if Democrats want to make it an issue but the idea that somehow\nA there was a cover up and that it wasn't investigating I mean really they thought that they should but the twenty more people should be interviewed they interviewed nine and got a written statement from another one it seems to me it's it was clear there was zero evidence\nThat the Brett Kavanaugh was arrow backup for Christine blobs a lousy Ford story and in fact that that raises another question for me if Christine Blasey Ford was going to come out and do this in front of the country\nWouldn't you think she would have gone to some people for instance her longtime friend legal in ... and said hey do you remember this event and yeah perhaps if she if Kaiser is a I don't remember that at all that maybe she wouldn't have come forward because she must have known\nPanhandle there's nothing left in many communities but the men to end debris along with

I I Wonder if it's over or we just doing the speaking tour are we doing something else like what is what is exactly going on here and I wish I had to answer but I I\nDon't I mean there's no way to join another election I don't think but I could see if there's a Republican wins like an Eric Holder or somebody like that they'll reach back for her she got nothing else to do\nI mean it's not like the Clinton by they should take a lot of time is it a miracle how we don't even have a Clinton ... meaning anymore it's amazing I guess all problems have been solved or the Clinton Foundation was focusing on\n[laughter] I didn't know that it's a completely there's no more meetings and nobody seems to have a major thing in New York City I don't even see it anymore I mean then they'll show you can you imagine seven hundred dollars for a ticket\nYou can't I mean the Beatles were charge less money how much do you charge because they heard seven hundred and ten seven hundred and ten dollars [laughter]\nBut I'm worth every penny America I Know yeah I can juggle\n[laughter] I ... you know what I think it's actually [laughter]\nGenerally have a special guest I mean really it's I I I'm looking forward to it I'm going to come see right when you're in Texas but I think that's really interesting to see who is going to pay to seven hundred dollars like are they going to they're not supposed to be very big arenas right I mean we're not talking about huge\nYou know showers in person auditoriums are we I mean from what I understand reading it they're going to be more smaller and frightening I don't know I haven't paid seven hundred dollars to see anything and here at the outset two toddlers I haven't actually seen anything\nRight yeah then it helps us not animated [laughter] exactly well okay I I play this other clip for Chris Wallace who's been in the news business while he thinks some overstating it I don't like her tone or she wants civil unrest I don't like the former attorney general's tone either\nHe has time for us as Democrats [noise] to be as they are going to be medicated as they are to me is committed as they are and\nYou know when they go low we don't know [laughter] they go low we can read\n\nWas his new democratic warnings about\nGreat fantastic isn't that a good message for law and order\nYes it did a key or just on the other Republicans said that what would the reaction be and how much coverage when he got he went on to say let's say less than I Do anything inappropriate he followed up with it because it clearly when you say something like that you know it's going to be incendiary\nThe question I have is how do we get to the other side of these issues which you over so many different issues all the time and I don't see that these leaders and and it could be true as well for for conservative leaders and Republican leaders that we have the same kind of conversations about civility but no one gets the other side of them\nYou know we don't end Vance them in any way and I'm really listening for the person that's going to bring us the next level make us think differently and\nFor their you know President Trump has a lot of positives to have a lot of fault so what are the things that we do it's for news is that we are completely non part is and I like covering the news an unbiased way but he has challenged people to think differently about issues rightly or wrongly and I think that that's really important for the civil discourse today whoever you\nAre so ... are born in Saudi Arabia but work has contributed the Washington Post seems to have been lured into a ... or the Turkish embassy and killed a there was word is we think he's dead they picked up into steps and it was a big set up to fifty men\nThe French the French have curiously stocked with the\nAncient rocks shaped by century when\nWhen you see these things you're seeing the world the way we found was over five hundred messages across America you don't have to go far to make a special connection with me to learn more and ask W ...\nFlash messages that\nW and Don guns slash refuges\nHey it's Eric bond has learned my radio show is now on three hours every weekday nine to moon right here on ws me\n[noise] [noise]\n\nCounty general doesn't want prison reform Jeff Sessions in standing on your way is that an accurate\nWell if he doesn't he gets overruled by me because I make the decision either\nThat was my question to the United states I'm short time ago and he joined us for forty five minutes on Fox and friends called in and we discussed everything and I by the way I think I'm right Jeff Sessions sat down with Lindsey Graham and others\nAnd they must be going to sit on our show I I talked me remember which on the air and off the air because I Do talk to them a lot but he said to me he goes you know this did it he goes I Am no longer defending Jeff Sessions because he also believes that prison reform or something Republicans or Democrats can both do\nA lower this now I'm the prison reform so on top of that um when Jeff Sessions ... and the way that he has no use for him and that's why you remember a couple of weeks ago Lindsey Graham stop sticking up for him he says after a while the president has a right to go with that attorney general they trust he does not trust and respect\nA Jeff Sessions any longer\nSo we'll discuss at and and by the way that's going to be disgusted about an hour and a half\nAt the White House what county west Indian brand and when I asked wholesale would you just accept Jim Brown jug American program would they go into the prisons they work with people that get them life skills so when they get out and I know it's distasteful for a lot of people think about but there's tens of\nThousands of people in jail in America and they're getting out\nAnd if they have no skills and can't contribute to end up going back to crime it back to prison because the only thing they know and do say well I have no room for them with the president saying with Democrats agree with most Republicans are on board with is it there's got to be some type of reform and my hope is the president takes head on what I Am astounded on\nIt and I'm getting some emails about this now that Chris Wallace it does not think that Eric Holder's comment or a big deal that Hillary Clinton's comments or a big deal Craig truly a presidential historian was Laura last night and he said you know listen\nI'm there were protests in the eighties you know he's a big Reagan guy or there were protests in the eighties to protest in Seventy ... there was non stop in the sixties cut all of it\nBroke it down to its elements until it's components in the ... who is really going on there which was just talking about social justice so it was about creating injustice but this is essential difference between the Tea Party of some years ago and the protesters have today is that the Tea Party was\nDefending institutions the protesters have to try to tear down institutions and that's the central difference between the two\nYeah and really odd would you have conservatives is is holding on to what they their view of America instead of changing America and saying you know not being able to answer the question already exceptional nation yeah we are but we everybody thinks airing exceptional nation Craig surely the presidential store and he was referring to Reagan he went on cuts wealth\nWe're witnessing the twenty first or a version of the French Revolution the French Revolution recall was about turned out all institutions and crabs destroying everything marriage contracts money\nGovernment property everything in order to achieve what they call the times social justice and that's what the modern left a pipe protestors on tape of protesters about it's about destroying all fabric of society\nIn order to start over and everybody supposedly starts out on an even playing field\nAnd it was even for a long uh wasn't even for a long time we're getting more even but in society there's no you know\nLike this and they're not everybody wins everybody loses it there's no logic to it

I wouldn't say anything out of the realm of possibility but\nI don't think so I Do think she's a little bit of a time out and no one saw this other resignation coming so anyone who says for sure we already been caught caught by surprise once I get the sense\nThat he's yeah Jeff Sessions is gone Rod Rosenstein is gone but I wouldn't say the ... I don't even know it is Nikki Haley even a lawyer\n[noise] I don't think she's a lawyer and yeah that would be a problem [noise] but I think\nYou got to play another role there one eight six six for all eight seven six weeks I get bored if we do have a three hour show I'm not sure what our you get next but I Do like you to be a part of it go to Brian kill me dot com find out all my tour stops\nFor Andrew Jackson the miracle of New Orleans now at our paperback skews me next weekend [noise]\n\nFair on Fox News channel every day I wake up and I think who knows what's going that not only through the day what in the next in our lives for twenty four seven news\nDown to the minute so our job is to control the talking points to no matter the party no matter the ideology to try to get the bottom\nLine truth to take a deep breath\nYou realize you're in the moment and do your job on Fox\nNews real honest opinion what it is who's who stars\nAnd he printing Henry and we're excited the heart and Fox\nNation because now more than ever we need to our voice that won't\nWe need ... then you don't want to know and the ... favorites you already love Latin\nClues that members on they're going to be very PC hell no on the sea is more like Mason\nOpinion done right but if I may just dot com and find out more\nHey although Halloween is a holiday if all the scares enterprises choosing where you buy your next vehicle shouldn't be\nThat's why I gladly for all my friends and family to Jim Ellis Chevrolet why because they always go above and beyond to exceed my expectations kind of like those houses that get a full sized candy bars Halloween and the savings well they're hard to beat especially this time of the year\nRight now Jim Ellis Chevrolet you could save twelve thousand dollars often is our pee on all twenty Eighteen ... and ... ...

reports that he was brought into teams Saturday teams are Fifteen and they were going to have a written dishing taken mountains something went wrong and he's dead have you heard that\n[noise] why because I've read then tell 'em let me just lemon and you know we have to be careful about\nWhat a ... and I've read a lot of stuff and open source reporting and I think that the reporters and you and others who\nWho report on these things have generally got pretty good picture but but look they that I've talked to the ambassador immediately when he went missing and the ambassador told me that their video cameras only live stream they don't record which is ridiculous\nCannot be the case\n[noise] um and uh so obviously you began with your antenna way up when somebody gives you a ridiculous\nResponse like that I've read then tell 'em and I would just say this Brian I'm I Hope that I Am not right and I hope that somehow or another he is produced as a live human being someplace but I absolutely believe the Saudis murdered him\n[noise] and uh and\nI Believe that uh it's something that a ... ... ...\nYou know possibly went to the highest levels and if that's the case or a hope it's not a hope that he's alive I Hope that he returns to to the United states [noise] uh and ended up marrying the his fiance who's desperately waiting to see any sign of him um I think it's going to

is an outlier\nPlus grandma and lay have fund our foreign opt operations through appropriations signed a letter invoking what's called the global Magnitsky Act and what that does is forced the
