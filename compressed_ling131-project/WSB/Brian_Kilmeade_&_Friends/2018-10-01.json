I don't expect and judge Kavanaugh or Jake Tapper Jeff Flake or or any model to me how responsible for that\nIt seems to me that we're in a moment where they just want to confirm someone so they can have a hard right majority on the court for decades to come\nAnd you may have seen articles talking about how evangelical voters and what to me is tremendously ironic given that they say their values people I'm saying you know what we were going to punish Republicans unless you force a vote on Kavanaugh and get us this second conservative judge\nOn the court in the aftermath of having whip held the seat from a properly duly elected president President Obama twice elected a and had a year\nA year which she could have nominated and had a confirmed seat and they denied it and now they're trying to rush to sleep in my opinion or because it's all about power plays one last thought on this is that it's again upsetting to me that the court\nAnd its integrity its credibility is suffering in light of the idea that it's now seen as totally partisan just like the White House or the Congress is seen as partisan a suddenly now it's that\nIf your case goes to the Supreme Court you just anticipate well they're five conservative votes and for liberal votes it's not that I'm going before a blindfolded hand them justice that's going to consider the issues is that there are ... preconceived outcomes\nThat you have to overcome and I just think this is not good for America not good for our institutions and I think it's what the Russians want they want to break us apart\nAnd they want to diminish trust in American institutions\nWith the midterms now little more than six weeks away and with the current debate on\nBrett Kavanaugh's nomination to the U.S Supreme Court should he be confirmed and installed on the court before the midterms which is what the Senate wants\nAnd should it appeared that the Senate even though they have hired a female prosecutor from Arizona to ask the questions to avoid the optics that you describe what message does that send to that sliver of independent influence ... female voters\nAcross the country this is the political trick at play\nThe Republicans are in a box eleven men\nLebanon white men on the district can go back to Anita Hill Clarence Thomas it was the same kind of image and it did not help them and it came across it I think as insensitive it points\nBy the way that also impact that someone that we may be talking about in the twenty twenty election Joe Biden who was then as a senator chairman of the Judiciary Committee\nSo the Democrats have eleven votes to Thomas I don't think you're going to see that in the cabinet case I don't think he's going to get any democratic votes that people are talking about well there's some Democrats in red states but in light\nOf all these allegations of sexual misbehavior sexual improprieties\nA I think that those Democrats are now covered in terms of being able to cast a no vote for cabinet I'd be surprised the real issue becomes what happens with two women who are Republicans in particular Susan Collins a senator from Maine Lisa Murkowski the senator from Alaska\nAnd here again it becomes a matter of what are they willing to hear what are they willing to say because there is this push to just get it done so that Republicans can say to their voters in the midterms we have given you a conservative court very conservative court for generations to come\nIs roe versus Wade safe you don't have an AIS confirmed\nI don't think so and you know to me it's ironic that Kavanaugh says well\nI Can't tell you what I think what I can say that I consider it to be a matter of settled law well we know that uh the last nominee also said he believed in federal law and within months was reversing longstanding labor law in the country [noise]\nForty years so I think you have to say that you know what these five votes with people on the court on the conservative side who've already indicated they would undo roe v way that it was wrongly decided you'd have to say that that is a legitimate concern the problem with our politics is\nRather than saying this is all about abortion we get into fights about other disqualifying issues in Brett Kavanaugh's case it may be a sexual misbehavior\nNow to your book what the hell do you have to lose sounds like he pulled out from the president's and I guess candidate Trump's speech to an African American audience I think it was in Detroit\nThat well outside in them and they all Michigan okay and it was in Michigan\nAnd ... by the way President Trump is continue to use it just recently he used it in reference to\nIndian Americans not a Native Americans or and asking why are they supporting him what the hell do they have to lose this is his framework and again to me so condescending so insulting it's as if you have nothing and the image he was creating by the way\nPeople say to me well he was speaking to black people and saying you know you have bad neighborhoods bad schools no job so why are you supporting Democrats Democrats have not delivered for black people you should be supporting not Hillary Clinton you should be supporting me\nAnd again you have to think about this he's not speaking to black people he wasn't speaking in Detroit\nHe's not even I think sending a message to black people my impression is that he's sending a message to\nRural whites especially working class white men who may feel that they had been forgotten or that somebody else is being helped by the government a at a cost to them in terms of feeling forgotten\nAnd he's saying to them that yeah these people have these terrible neighborhoods in bad schools and I'm the hero who's going to stand and prevent them and their troubles

show\nYou know romantic diseases ... and cause of is the leading cause of disability in the United states\nAnd you might ask yourself how easy is it to live with this disease in Georgia Dr Christopher ... joins us from Johns Hopkins American College of ...\nHere to tell us you know really about romantic diseases that think we don't really know what that is what you're about to tell us how are you this morning\n... good morning I'm doing well thank you for having me\nSo and I know that romantic diseases and the same diseases and it covers this umbrella of things so tell us what it is exactly\nAbsolutely so romantic diseases are auto immune and inflammatory diseases where the patient's own immune system\nAttacks their own body including things like their joints their muscles bones and other internal organs so patient sometimes have a lot of joint pains but there can be a lot of different sent them such as difficulties swallowing can have difficulty breathing\nThat can have weakness and unable to stand up from a chair and go up the stairs so it can be very heterogeneous\nAnd see your point there are over a hundred different types of romantic disease\nThat's amazing that was early may they may be a most familiar with you know rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis lupus but there are so many others that are less well known things like scleroderma unbiased scientists and the list goes on and on ...\nShow ... syndrome um soul you know a lot of us have symptoms of arthritis but it doesn't necessarily mean that we have a romantic disease\nShore so it's a little difficult at times to make the diagnosis of rheumatic disease there are so many of them and not all of them are common as I mentioned so we usually recommend a good place to start for patients has to have a very open and honest conversation with their primary care provider\nAbout what symptoms they ham and whether referral to a rheumatologist is appropriate\nSo there was a study done and a like a report card of sorts about how easy it is to live with romantic disease in your state and I'll tell you I'm I have some form of one of these\nAnd um when I fly into different places and different environment I have no symptoms so how easy is it to live in Georgia with rheumatic disease\nShores so the way the report card works is it assigned letter grades to each state's on your conventional aid to scale ... and three main areas basically access to re mythology care how affordable is it and the healthy lifestyle habits of the population of state\nSo when we look at Georgia they received an overall grade of sea which is about average and it's about middle of the package joined by a large number of other states that also received that grade and George is actually doing pretty well when it comes to activity in lifestyle\nHas several CDC funded arthritis intervention programs that operate in the states including those sponsored by organizations such as the YMCA so there are a lot of opportunities\nFor us citizens in Georgia to really exercise and in the lead active lifestyle [noise]\nAt the same time there are areas for improvement and really the domain is one of access so we\nNeed to work on expanding the health insurance coverage of Georgia NATO's health insurance rates a little higher than average there and also the number of patients per rheumatologist so on average in the country for every one rheumatologist or about forty thousand people vowed\nThat potentially can have ... disease in Georgia that's almost\nDouble for every one rheumatologist there's almost Seventy Seventy five thousand patients so it's definitely an area that torture tend to dress to help improve their grade teacher report cards\nIs amazing that's a lot of patience per doctor\nAbsolutely unfortunately that can sometimes contributed a long wait times listeners maybe all too familiar with calling in office and being told the first new patriot as five or six months away absolutely\nAbsolutely and and what we understand we have so many thousands of people moving to just to land a every month so we're amazingly overcrowded right now so talk about um treatments for romantic diseases\nUm you know besides our our exercising and perhaps eating right and\nYou know maybe not smoke I don't know\nWhat things should we be doing a if we are diagnosed with rheumatic disease\nSure it's a great question and and to your point you know diet and exercise are kind of ... therapy um that's kind of wanted to focus is on the report card was activity because studies show that regular exercise can reduce joint pain can improve mobility\nReduce the stress that's associated with ... diseases so there are a lot of opportunities for two GS either by themselves or perhaps with a a a gym membership or physical and occupational therapists\nBut treatment from ... to watch on different types of medications and they often have the common theme of suppressing the immune system [noise] or call that I said earlier that rheumatic diseases or auto immune diseases where the patient's own immune system attacks their own body\nOr medications we used to treat it tried to tamp down a little bit they they've decreased immune system with the old decreasing the disease activity\nBut does that open you up to other things if you decrease the immune system\nIt absolutely can and has to be a conversation between them here provided when the patient that's basically a risk benefit ratio and of course we think the benefits of or medications for far outweigh the risks are also want to prescribe them but it's definitely something that everyone needs to be aware of going into it\nSo if somebody thinks you know or have perhaps thinking it's got a little arthritis year has been swelling here or are not knowing what their diagnosis is do they find a rheumatologist initially or do they go to their their primary care doctor first\nIt was a good question they can probably do either or but sometimes it depends on their insurance some people need a referral from their primary care doctor before they can see a rheumatologist in general you know I personally advocate for having an open conversation with the patients primary provider is\nMore than a trip advisor the really cool guests arrived by power gliding\nI didn't know there that we had to jump off of one thousand foot high class\nAnd the guy said he said you have to run off\nThe cliff because if you don't run the parachute will not filled with air but you won't know what's going to fill their until you run off\nThe money go [laughter] I Know it sounds scary or now that I'm Talking about it\nSo when you were standing on the cliff [laughter]\nWhat were you thinking\nI was thinking I Am such an idiot [laughter]\nI've always been afraid of parish [laughter] I wouldn't jump out of an airplane because I'm always afraid like it's just fabric it's not going to fill up where they are the only things are going to get them thought that ... was like a hang glider you know with um the ... and they're putting a harness\nOn me I look behind me on the ground and there's a parachute lying on the ground with a million strings\nComing out of it and then I said you were such an idiot Amy because you're an editor and you didn't think that ... parish\nShoe [laughter] well what was your husband saying what does your husband say was here you go first [laughter]\n\n\nOh golly it turned out okay you're here [laughter]\nWell we're still married very proud of our cell\nPhone you go oh I Can't wait to tell that story that it was hilarious [noise] so when you were up there where you just like in all were you scare where you were amazed by what you were saying where you were feeling\nI was scared because we took off and then you know you're you're like you're attached to this guy who invented a million times and the guy goes oh we've got great wind today we can stay up extra long and fly even higher than everybody started it\nAnd I'm going\n[laughter] my voice is so high I'm lucky like break\nMy gosh that is so funny but that's a great story because you said yes to something you would have never ever [laughter]\nIt's because they made this policy of saying yes and so many people in our book chicken soup for this all the power of yes did exactly that they actually made a deliberate policy that they would just say yes\nTo everything that came along unless it was something to write out but it's ... anything that came along where they just wanted to test themselves a little and it really changed their lives and they became different people they really reinvented themselves\nAs fun people who are always up for something new and then their friends and relatives started treating them differently because they were like\nOh Suzie she'll do new things\nWhile she'll do ... do they got more invitations as a result\nThat is so great that\nI'm going to go home and tell my mom hey you guys start saying yes to some things you know um that is just so fabulous I'm Glad you tell us your story was up in the next four chicken soup for the soul you've got more titles coming\nOh boy we did we have a full fall season we have a great book out filled the Christmas Story is called chicken soup for the soul to wander of Christmas\nWe have a book coming out that something really new for us I made a book with Dr Mike ... who's a well known psycho analyst he's always on the doctor the doctor has a different shows and he I were talking one day and realized that our chicken soup for the soul writers\nSolve a lot of their problems themselves and write about it and the stories it's like they're acting as their own therapist and I went\nThrough our stories and chose the best examples of this and in our book which is called think act and be happy we show people how they can be their own therapists and solve many of their problems themselves with the tools they already have\nIn their rounds and like that I Love that I Love that a lot of times we think um you know we've got to go and spend a lot of money and I believe in therapy definitely but\nAlso I Do the same thing I write it out I talk it out with my friends and um sometimes I pray so sometimes those things I get the answers that I have with it myself which is really great\nYeah the idea is that you shouldn't you shouldn't avoid therapy if you really really need it but there are these little things that you can solve yourself why not solve them yourself and save yourself the money and the time it would have taken to go to therapy mhm\nMhm oh acting be happy and when is the Christmas one coming out\nWell they always make us put those out really early October Eighteen\nHer yeah but that's another thing last days\nBy the time Halloween comes at Christmas\n[laughter] yes no both for Halloween now [laughter]\nWorld and we tell everybody where they can find chicken soup for the show the power of yes\nOh my goodness it is available everywhere Barnes and noble book ... million\nWalmart um Amazon of course it's all over the place and we love supporting our local Barnes and noble stores are local books a million are independent bookstore so go to those brick and mortar stores and keep them alive so that we can go and see books in person\nAmy Howe\nIn this Gen Z aren't going to take on the student loan debt they're not willing to because they've seen the consequences of\nThat and at work the gyms ears you know a lot of people in the workplace managers in their forties an older complain all the time\n... you'll never want to work they want all of his balance\nIn their lives with contempt well loved the gyms ears are back to the whole work thing I Hope that if you are listening to me and you're in this

thing being careful with your money that's a great thing avoiding debt a fantastic thing\nBrooke is with us on the Clark Howard show hello abrupt how are you great thank you you want to talk about your mortgage\nYes they do what's the story wow\nWe have a ... year mortgage that he sat on the air\nI mean you actually took out a ten year mortgage yeah [laughter] you are my hero\n[laughter] [noise] um how yeah it's a ...\nPoint seven percent at the moment [noise] um and we're going to be here at least [laughter] exercising more years before they get fired for a living and I my question why should I we've financed ... like a Fifteen Atlantic astronaut him he said\nOh no way they get along and leave it alone ... there's no necessary move you got seven years left you're going to be completely mortgage debt free and a seven year cycle you're building up at this point you're building up enormous equity every single month\nAnd it would take you into reverse adding eight years back into the loan okay you're going to have closing costs\nTo be at the same rate you're already at\n... and so you are thinking of it this way you are investing in your future with every single monthly payment you make your ... okay I just thought about this do you know the fastest growing part of the car market or people taking out seven year car loans oh why\nYou are now in a mortgage that day sickly a seven year Carla [laughter] so I Would just pay is agreed and know that that you are absolutely doing a great thing for your long term financial security\nAll right and I believe it right\nBack to you and again\nIt is such a neat thing if you're in a position when you re fi\nIf you can go into a ten year alone that so many credit union specialize then you get extraordinarily great rates and such a quick pay down debt on a straight trend line to being completely debt free Peter\nIs with us on the Clark Howard show Peter ... to have you here you want to talk about a potential benefit of the costs go visa card and what is it\nYeah clerk good afternoon I'm is Christ rewind feature and it is kind of hidden under the shopping benefits\nBut it's somewhat amazing um I bought a refrigerator for about eleven hundred dollars and it basically it's a retroactive cash price match up price guarantee and they gave me a hundred dollars cash on it\nAnd as long as you register or purchase how long does it take for you to register a purchase\nAbout a minute oh you have to do is you have to um you know in a mere item you know by UPC code name they have a database it'll find the item and then you upload the receipt as an image file a J peg or something\nAnd they don't do this for perishable food and medicine personal care products that has to be you know something durable\nAnd ah you know I bought a Christmas present for my daughter and I saw it on sale somewhere else for Fifteen dollars later and I was sort of you know crime that sad cry but then I thought hey I'll just price rewind it they got the Fifteen dollars so so I shop for quality now and I worry about the price later\nHow about you and so I have a brother who uses this with a different credit card and he remembers to register them and all that I Am too flaky to do that but if you are like you are my brother\nAnd you'll take the time to register or if you don't register you can check you see a lower price within two months\nYou can apply submit to prove and they just give you the money back\nExactly cash or or the same thing or a credit to your credit card\nWell I Love that you mentioned this again uh this is not just the Cosco city visa card although it is one of their benefits several card issuers do the same kind of price match thing\nBill is with us on the Clark Howard show hello bill carpet to talk to you\nWell good to have you here you've got a question for me about your your wheels what do you drive\n... right now I'm driving a an older ... and it does not get the gas mileage that I Need out of it so I've been looking at a moving into a hybrid\nAs you've seen over the years gas prices go up down up down up down what it does if you do buy a hybrid when nobody wants them when they're completely ion loved is you get a great deal buying it and then you spend like nothing to run it\nYeah and I'm definitely looking at\nYou know moving into a hybrid for the gas savings but I'm also looking at some of the older hybrid that maybe are coming off of lease or got some more miles on them but one thing that I'm a little bit worried about is that replacement costs for the battery\nAnd I know you said in the past that the war in like a third party warranty extension on a car is not a good deal but there's that battery changed the equation does an extended warranty and hybrid makes sense\nNo because the battery pack for a hybrid used to be a real big expense\nAnd now they're not you know the battery packs on a hybrid if they went out at one time I think it was as much as ten thousand dollars to replace the battery pack and now it is really not a major expense any more typical hybrid battery pack replacement\nWill be somewhere I think about twelve hundred Fifteen hundred dollars\nYou know you're going to have a transmission go out in the car and spend a lot\nMore than that oh definitely\nAnd the other thing is if you buy a hybrid\nThat it's a model that's been out for a long time they've got the reliability down pretty well on the batteries I made a mistake I did something you're never supposed to do in two thousand three I bought a first year version\nOf the Honda Civic hybrid and they just didn't have it right yet on the battery and the battery ended up failing white prematurely\nAnd so you know they say first year of any car you
