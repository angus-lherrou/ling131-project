[noise]\nYeah I've lived with a bow wow and I'm thinking maybe I could feel my bills off\nAnd then every week you know pay a large amount on credit card when I get paid\nSo this safe if you pay credit card balances in full is a great idea\nBecause with the fights going on among the banks for market share with credit cards there are so many reward cars out there every single bill that I can pay by credit card I pay by credit card and then get the rewards for having done so\nSo I think it's a great idea as long as you've never run a balance on the cards\nWhat do you mean I'm like hey it off before the end of the month\nWe'll just when the oil comes so that you're never paying interest\n'cause you know credit cards all operate based on people who pay balance isn't for called behind our backs by the banks deadbeats\nBecause we're getting free ride on the credit cards money and right now not only are they giving us the grace period where we can pay our bills\nIn full you know they give us the typically three weeks to pay our bills and fall but then they're rewarding us with cash back or free gasoline or free hotel stays or free travel or whatever it is\nAnd it's a deal for

chasing promising leads pointing them to South Florida as a possible origin of at least some of the packages sent this week two prominent Democrats another's\nThe un detonated devices were sent to the FBI lab where they were exploited for clues including DNA and fingerprints all ten devices recovered so far we're sent through the mail\nPhilip Bartlett head of the U.S postal service inspection service operations in New York City says he and his team are on the lookout for more packages\nThat I think goes both ways seems to elevate the political or finding real solutions to this stuff and finding out who who uh who's responsible it's true we ... we there's so much we don't know about this\nAnd it's irresponsible I think or Democrats to be blaming President Trump and suggesting that he's responsible for this particular series of\nAttempted attacks or attempts at at at threats um but I also think it's fair to say that the president should speak out more strongly against political violence he did the other night at this rally in Wisconsin but he also shouldn't\nAdvocate political violence which he sometimes has in the past\nWhen you know where there was some uh unrest with uh the some hecklers they say we should you know he said I you know there was a day when we used to be able to you know ... you know punch that like a punch that guy that type stuff\nReally during the election I was surprised by this Jeff Zucker a couple of hours after his building was cleared out because one package was found was addressed to John Brennan who's even work there\nHe said this there is a total and complete lack of understanding of the White House about the seriousness of their continued attacks in the media the president and especially the White House press secretary should understand their words matter does for the show no comprehension of that\nIs that fair [noise]\nWell I think the general critique is fair\nI mean he ... he said something that's similar to what I said I don't think the president United States should be even if he's joking which I think many of his defenders would suggest he has I don't think the ... the United states should be even joking\nAbout political violence or or supporting political violence but there is a leap year that that Jeff Zucker is making I think which is to tie the president's\nWords to these specific events we just don't know enough about what's happened here how may be the case that will learn that that\nSomebody was somebody who's you know crazy was\nTook the president literally and then decided to act on it but we don't know that yet and I think if you're responsible to speculate that way as well\nUh I Want you to hear what the president said last night a cut for\nAny acts or threats of political violence aren't attack on\nOur democracy is so [noise] no nation can succeed that tolerates violence or the threat of violence as a method of political intimidation go words you're in Oregon from we all know that\nBut then he went on to blame the media cut eight\nAs part of a larger national effort to bridge or divides and bring people together the media also has a responsibility to set a civil town\nYou stop the endless hostility and constant negative and oftentimes false attacks and stores have to do\nSo um the that's the balance he struck last night and anyone to try to get Governor Walker another four years as ... as governor\n[noise] yet look\nI think more of the former from the president it'd be it'd be\nGood for the president to continue to say the kinds of things that he said where he is a decried political violence and and warned against that I Will say as somebody who's been critical of him in the past are the kinds of things that he said it is ironic to have Donald Trump lecturing people about civility suddenly I mean this was somebody I think\nRose to the Republican nomination in\nPart because people were eager for the kinds of Republican primary voters park where eager for the kinds of confrontational sunny times uncivil politics that he brought was part of why he succeeded so it is ironic for him to be saying everybody let's be civil but I'd much rather have and be saying that\nThen saying the other or joking about beating up to us\nI mean you don't think that he would ever said himself I Hope some of my supporters of go put package bombs to all my detractors I mean that just had to yeah Steve I got I got to do so in in the other thing is\nUh you have a Bernie Sanders supporter literally get a rifle and start trying to kill Republicans\nAnd he shoots in ... almost died at second base there and very few people are saying well that Bernie Sanders is the wrong tone\n[noise] right and and look I mean I don't think Sanders has has said\nThe kind of um inflammatory states that other politicians have said it's\nSuggesting that his followers are inside political violence but remember after that shooting\nThe Washington Post ran an article that suggests that it was right wing talk radio that was responsible\nFor the environment that was sad I mean is there is a certain sense in which the mainstream media goes to its old sort of script in an always wants to blame everything on conservatives and conservative talk radio and\nConservative media whether it's true or not it never the New York times just ... not long ago repeated the ... the false claims\nThat the shooting of Gabby Giffords was inspired by a by Sarah Palin and her uh her targeting um so yeah there's there's sort of ... um tendency\nBy some in the mainstream media to to

though we have almost all the pieces to put together and finally the Saudis want from he died in a fist fight too it seems to be a premeditated murder where are we going with this Steve\n\nAnd it's a it's a hugely problematic I mean obviously the the the Saudi story has evolved I mean initially they said that we don't even know where he is we don't know what happened to them you left\nYou know their their story has changed in every particular that it could possibly have changed so their courage\nStory I think has virtually no credibility whatsoever and I think the Turks are playing a

right away John Miller who is deputy ... he's a deputy commissioner the NYPD former CBS\nA CBS anchor and reporter who was hosting twenty twenty for a while I Know it's bizarre also interviewed bin Laden on a side note but everybody you know here's what the package looks like because they all look strikingly similar Jason ... what do we do\nThe return address was Debbie Wasserman Schultz spelled on one of the packages to John Brennan is CNN wrong company spelled wrong we have six uh always as six stamps exactly the same stamps\nOr and we'd doesn't look as though this one to the postal system although it says a poster more postage required on the original package don't you the sense we are going to get this person I really\nDo because the the postal service actually has a great way to track these things I Do think there's a suspicion that these didn't that they were hand delivered that they weren't necessarily through the postal service but that was the second to another photo that we came out with their that was out there showed that the postage was short of what it needed to be\nBut think of all the elements that go into actual a package you have an envelope you have the tape you have the ink you have the piece of paper you have the stamp itself you have there's so many ways that this person times nine of them now\nA could have slipped up and made a mistake I I really do think between the NYPD\nOr the secret service the FBI a bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and firearms there's a lot of resources being thrown at this and I I got to believe that there's some trace some clue and they're probably honing in on that person right now\nAll right I Want you to hear a little bit what's going on another networks I Know there are a little freaked out the CNN was cleared out because of the one package that was brought there is it's interesting the policy uh uh Columbus Circle was get everybody out\nThe policy at six in the morning when they found the package at Robert Deniro Z restaurant slash film studio was just going to move the package and so I guess things have changed listen to this cut eleven\nI thought it was the absolute bare minimum that the American people could expect from the president to say given the circumstances\nLeaves me wanting like Harry is you find yourself saying I just wish it could have said some other things I think it would behoove tend to be a little bit more complex and we say about this\nBut the exception of the the violence part of it I don't know that it's just the far right I think it's just a lot of Republicans we have Republicans on Capitol Hill a congressman talking about Soros talking about John Brennan as he should be the focus it's not just the fringe anymore this is now mainstream Republican thought well look I\nI think Marco Rubio was probably the most articulate in the sea tweeted out a couple of things that I really did agree with\nWhere he basically said look we can have vibrant political debate but you don't step over the line and engage in violence\nYou avoid violence by having the political debate and so we shouldn't be afraid of that debate we disagree about things were in the middle of a of a mid term election but uh that doesn't when it says step over the line of pilots and don't get me these\nFake phony you know I'm comments about well I Wish the president to do this or that that wasn't going to appease any of them I think the president was it's been pitch perfect over last forty eight hours and just saying\nLet's come together let's be United this is not a time to be divisive let's tone down their rhetoric those are all things that the Democrats them encourage them to do he did it and then policy and and Schumer tried to swat a way of saying that I think it was wrong\nWell I think it would be wrong to if the president came out and rip Bernie Sanders ... shot and and that's why you think this can be an analogy there\nSo Jeff Zucker ... hours later a couple of hours later was president CNN says there's a total complete lack of understanding of the White House about the seriousness of their continued attacks and the media the president especially the White House press secretary should understand words matter\nDoes for the show no comprehension of that\nAnd I'll bring it to Marco Rubio's words yes words matter because freedom of speech allows us to air and settle or disagreements and grievances instead of violence the first amendment protects press freedom but it doesn't allow immunity from criticism\nCriticism calling people to violence or not the same he went on to say some already giving it to the temptation to react to the terror attack by either assigning blame\nFor or rationalizing it no sane are well intentioned person no matter how poor decision would do this it's either the work of a demented person or terror aimed at further dividing America you wrote the deep state he's trying to elevate the conversation\nBut we expect people to follow the rules and to get in line into law and to do it\nThe right way that's the way we've honored immigrants historically in this country by welcoming them\nTo legal immigration the United states but this idea of basically a mob\nInvading United States and in violation of our rules jeopardizing public safety\nWe all know that this is a vulnerability that this uh this pipeline up from Central America this controlled and Mexico mainly by the cartels and they transmit not only are immigrants\nBut also drugs and other contraband to uh it's time for a wakeup\nCall and this may be just enough to trying to wake up the American people to\nExactly what's happening and who's controlling this so I'm the president's committed to stopping at a I was with him on Monday Night in Houston and he made that very clear and I applaud that and support it\nBut he might not have the tools to stop it I mean right now thanks to a a law and maybe you can expand on it they Dianne Feinstein passed in two thousand eight it told mega into Mexico a you know you're not welcome here but central and south Americans well if it tip the scales to them can you tell us what took place under President Obama\nYeah what what what happened is this was a well intended a wall which basically has\nBeen exploited now a by the cartels to uh uh that treats immigrants from non contiguous countries in other words places like Central America different way than a trench Mexican uh enlist immigrants and it requires children to be a process by health and Human Services put\nWith a sponsor in the United states and then to litigate their claims of for asylum uh later on this is really created a not only a humanitarian disaster or a huge backlog in our in our immigration or asylum of processing system\nAnd this is being exploited by the very people who make money off of off of this I'm all for this flaw in our system it requires bipartisan\nSupport to to solve it but as you saw when the president offered the solution for the DACA recipients deferred action for childhood arrivals one point eight million young adults offered a path to citizenship in exchange for border security and ... laws\nWas turned down by the Democrats and this is the price we're all having to pay for that\nAnd but the thing is they turned it down when you guys including chain migration as well as the lottery system but straight out it looked as though uh that wasn't enough for many on the right straight up twenty five billion for the wall and terms for DACA\nSo would you take that deal today\n[laughter] I think it's important we break this impasse when it comes to our immigration system because what we're seeing is as\nFlaw we've all recognizes now being exploited by a these transnational criminal organizations sometimes called\nCartels who are using this to a to import a heroin and illegal immigrants said Traficant human beings to the United states we need to stop it so I Would I Would sit down at the table and roll up our sleeves and and get this fixed\nHe usually ... drives me crazy if you have a policy difference at All right fine which but within it lets debate it but if you have a policy difference and you know you don't even feel you convicted to what you but what you're saying\nI have a real problem with that because you just spinning your wheels trying to get political advantage and I put that label on Senator Schumer and embryonic Obama because he they could solve the immigration issue but listen to Brock Obama in two thousand five and Chuck Schumer in two thousand nine\nWe all agree on the need to better secure\nThe border and punish employers to hire illegal immigrants we simply cannot allow people to pour into the United states undetected undocumented\nUnchecked and circumventing the line of people who are waiting patiently diligently unlawfully or become immigrants in this country\n... go ahead that that ... that's exactly what Donald Trump is saying\nThat's right that's right and I guess the best thing you could say about that or the most uh would be that was then this is now but I Would call that plain and simple hypocrisy it's just a those two positions are inconsistent and what they said that is exactly what the president saying now what I'm saying now\nLet's fix our broken immigration system let's have a system illegal immigration that can be up that we can respect that honors or those who have tried to do with the right way and\nThen to deter those who tried to do it illegally\nHow hard was it for you to get used to the president's style and approach\n[laughter] while the president\nIs a unique a unique political figure I mean that's reason he was selected the the ... all the more conventional politicians and the Republican primary and I would say now two years in you can't you can't really argue with the results are the results have been tremendous\nWorking with Republican majorities in the house the Senate and not only we confirmed eighty or federal judges including two members of the Supreme Court we've lowered taxes we've reduced regulations and the\nSleeping giant that is the American economy or was the American economy has now taken off and people work\nI'm not ... that's the results you can't be denied and while president style as ... as unconventional sure uh I'm all for the results\nBecause you are just the opposite view of the same beliefs but you have a totally different approach you're gotta legal background you were a judge your understated but you're strong in your beliefs and there's the president saying whatever's on his mind at all times so did you ever think you'd have this positive relationship or that you have now when you first met him\nWhile I think it was I viewed it as my responsibility Brian ... in the leadership elicit it is the majority whip and\nWorking with Senator McConnell and the speaker Ryan I thought it was my responsibility relationship work or where we can find common ground and we have and I think

critics of President Trump\nHaving said that and and you know and I think that's the main lesson is that the the the ... responsibility is to that individual there is no question that there is a an inflammatory a polarized an ugly\nDiscourse for politics today not say that it's responsible but I think that it's the it's the environment in which these kinds of things happen if the President Trump goes over the line in a lot of his rhetoric I Know you you called them out on some of his attacks on his his opponents or the media\nUh and I think that that the Democrats do it as well nobody's got clean hands\nAnd you would just hope everybody would lower their voices a bit I don't know that it'll make an immediate difference\nIn terms of this individual or or other deranged individuals but it would be better for the country if we could just disagree about policies without demonizing the opposition\nIt would and I thought in a couple of days maybe friday night or on Sunday shows they'll have people condemning the president once we get this guy and most experts believe there he left so many clues we're going to get the guy\nOr the people who say but I thought maybe Sunday you'd have people on and they'd be saying I blame the president or I blame a Nancy Pelosi or Madonna whatever\nI was shocked to we're seeing it last night as if he was the one who ...\nRight and and and that's my point I I Do think that he bears some responsibility as do people on the left Eric Holder and when they go low we are going to kick them or or the other people on the left so there's nobody comes with clean hands but it does\nAnd the president has got the biggest megaphone as the as the president uh and he has said unfortunate things things that I I don't take a defensible in terms of\nDemonizing enemies talking about the Democrats as a mob or you know praising this reporter at a desk congressmen in in Montana ... body slammed a reporter you could say it's a joke it's not a funny joke and and particularly to reporters\nA ... and ... who were covering the president of particular interest those rallies where there are tens of thousands of people\nBut having said that do I think he's responsible for this particular bombing or does it uh no\nBut I Do think he he goes over the line and I think a Democrats\nLeapt winters have gone over the line as well [noise] ah Chris Wallace with\nUs Chris let's just move I've been covering this all money even cover it we've been covering it all night to\nSo as they try to find that the origin of the ninth package now I Want to move on and talk about the mid term elections Tom Bev and like many experts are saying this does this thing is changing with the advent of the Kavanaugh hearings with this uh the caravan and the Democrats are radio silent on it\nHe thinks the the blue wave is dead or sexually cut forty one\nIf you were talking about a blue wave you would expect it to be cresting right if it way was coming a mute expected to be building and building here we are Thirteen Days out from in terms of that's not what I'm saying that we're seeing the president's job approval rating going up we're seeing the the generic ballot number holding Democrats and the advantage but not building\nWith alpha king from forest factor it's never been easier just one small pill a day for a serious boost in total

October and so if the likely if once we get through the day they should have identified everything\nAnd we'll see what that means Ron ... running cases he's a former FBI assistant director president and law enforcement\nLegal Defense Fund run from what you know nine packages same return address same misspellings same stamps same a ... that has some bubble wrap in it same looking bomb we understand which shards of glass on the inside\nDo you believe that there's some some pathway to finding out who this is and it is a is it a easier than most pathway\n[noise] well I think uh there is a pathway I think they're probably multiple pathways one could be someone out there in Bryan we often talk in a in the wake of at an active shooter incident where a lot of lives are lost [noise]\nYou know the FBI studies suggest that probably at Seventy five eighty percent of those incidents there are prevent indicators that somewhat in somebody else has seen us observed and is it a in a position to contact law enforcement say hey you know so it's so Brian ... is ticking\nI'm going to go um I I suspect strongly that that exists here this you know even though a person may have acted individually as a soloist\nI'm Better off and prevent indicators that might tip off a neighbor or a friend or family member or to say hey this is you know my cousin this is my brother this is my father he spent angry he spent communicating\nIt would not surprise me at least if we see prior uh threats and angry language directed at some or all of these folks from this person whether it's through the mail or through an email some other form of communication so I think to prevent things\nMay be certainly that's what law enforcement as they're waiting for the the forensics on these devices [noise]\nThey will be combing through those those prior communications with all of these folks as the recipients to see what ties them together is there anything in common here do we see an uptick in in a particular persons communications and the anger\nA individually all I'm ... that somebody that they would put on their list of a let's look further so I think there's multiple opportunities as we wait for the for renting part of it is to come through\nAll right to kind of interesting they look to X rays and somebody gave some information to the ... with it has in there\nThey have actually images are on the condition of anonymity said that the is PVC pipe is covered with black tape or there is a small battery in there along with about six inches a pipe packed with powder in broken glass if there's ... there is no blasting\nCap on it and the fact that none have gone off what does that tell you\n[noise] well first or if if we're talking about a gunpowder black powder or something pyrotechnics um it doesn't need a blasting cap a sometimes those things can because their their heat sensitive their friction sensitive\nOr they can detonate with the right amount of friction just putting on the end cap so there's risk to the person constructing these devices [noise]\nThere's some risk to somebody that that might a or a machine if you're standing near a machine that may be bagging the devices around as it's being sorted in the mail facility there is some risk to those folks that question\nI have is as designed could the device have functioned yeah um and that is could\nBe the uh the the clock mechanism with a a\nUm have actually been set to trigger these devices at a certain point or if there is a battery there there's a a power source if the batteries were good could they have designed and when was the design to actually function at a certain\nUh our uh upon you know after they were received it the answer to that might be no that that this is really a a a a dangerous device because it has black powder in it but it's really a movie device it's a TV show device because it you know it looks threatening and acts threatening but it actually\nWould not detonate a intentionally by design could have detonated\nBy accident if if they're right activities if they're right actions were taken on it\nI mean we know a couple of things where if it is true and it's a dummy device who we wouldn't be able to detonate I Wonder what we can learn from it and how much danger postal workers were in UPS drivers were in\nAnybody was and how far did he get now we know it wasn't gonna get close to the Clintons house we know what God did your chores his mailbox we know got to Brock Obama's didn't get to his house but got to his location where his mails distributed or John Brennan was actually send to CNN even though he doesn't work there\nAnd they spelled his name Ron Eric Holder Maxine Waters that too and now you have Robert De Niro and Joe Biden and didn't get to actually to their house and I'm Wondering where other with those people who were handling it if it was a legitimate bomb if it turns out not to be where they in danger and do we have to amend the system again\nYeah I think that uh will again and it remains to be seen if the devices or actually did have a running timer attached to some sort of power source of battery a battery device within the timer uh the clock mechanism is there a power source there\nThat that could have actually triggered these devices good\nQuestion secondarily if if certain mishandling hum bouncing the devices around a machine sorting the devices\nOr of a sufficient to you know potentially trigger that can cause a an injury or death or or maybe somebody look if if black powder in it and in a one inch PVC pipe\nIf he were to take a more civil tone it would make a difference it would help president shouldn't refer to the breath of enemy other people\nUm you know we all have to watch the rhetoric that we use it makes a difference [noise] people here that and they follow it\nThat is Jeff Flake for a change he's being critical of the president I had no idea he felt that way\nA one eight six six for all eight seven six six nine but I'm not saying he's off base I Would love for everything the changes that will be great to president fights away fights in where people don't understand about the president which I Do because I had a chance to known before and people that know him no\nIt's not personal he'll go out there and he's got a bit for a deal he's got to go out there and go for his point of view and then when he's done he's done it almost reminds me of what they do at the end of UFC in boxing fight say go at it they they have a huge pre game there are a lot of bluster they sell tickets and at the end they hug\nNot to the other stuff was authentic but if they're out there to win but after the competitions done it's done I give you for an example Marco Rubio how ugly does that get how ugly did to get what Rand Paul man did he get loaded with Mr one percent Lindsey Graham\n[noise] guess who he campaigned with Ted Cruz for Ted Cruz he calls from Texas had not lying to anymore do you understand so he is not taking it that way he thinks his opponents don't take it that way but the deranged might be taking it that way so I Would love for the president sit down and give it one more shot and that that he has to\nBut it would be good just for the fact that the leaders do stuff like that\nTake a risk taking forward in time for outlets at a time go meet can't find out what their biggest problem with him is\nHe could go out and tell them what their his biggest problem with that is his staff goes out and get some stats say NBC Chuck Todd I watch your show Seventy five percent of your panelists are against me every single weekend\nMost of the rhetoric on you MSNBC show is it against me a U of said this in monologues is monologues and I would have all of them CBS has at least offensive on the Sunday shows anyway\nSo I Would say let's just air it out and see if they could ever reset and worst comes to worst prison will get less than Ninety percent negative material and the president in turn will say no more enemy that people talk me that might be a good start David WG a you and George H David\nHow's it going buddy W they invited us a listen I'm I suggest you know finding out who sent these bombs and that would be by now they know what the packages look what\nThey also know where the packages were mailed from so why not go to these individual post offices look at their surveillance videos and see who bought the packages are there to the mail\nThey are are they looking at a lot of it but the thing is I thought it was strange that but what I could tell from the picture there was no stamp on the stamps you know that stamp the post office gives it looks as though it wasn't used so they have six stamps on there forever stamps on there but there's no stem from the post office so it makes me think they hand delivered\nYeah but in the hell we live in in the city they say somewhat courier which is like hand delivering right yeah so a guy who was the courier\nThat maybe we'll get down to that Hey David by the way we want developed as to how great was at in Georgia was great to be in a a to B in Georgia last weekend last friday night [noise] uh let's go to Steve unless you have to have news talk Ninety seven when St Louis hey Stephen\n... Brian hey this is more of a a question for expert possibly but I think you're probably going to have a lot of experts early in the country\nA minutes or hours has to do with whether it be more difficult to trace or track if it's a false flag kind of a thing\nI'm not sure it's going to be more difficult but if it's a false flag man a lot of people said that right away because these are all targets of or the president who have been targeted these are all people have been the most was the first critics of the president and people that I could do trust anything they see right now things aren't as they appear\nI heard a lot of people texting me an email me and on social media saying well wait a second this is somebody on the left who wants to who wants the Democrats took sympathetic in this\n[noise] sure that they're looking into that and go as well I was just curious if it would be more difficult\n[noise] I don't I Will ask but we just hung up with the runoff go the FBI Michael W. N. D. P. and Daytona Hey Mike\n[noise] hey Brian what's on your mind and Brian I'm\nDon't think that the terrorists and people want to do harm to this country are watching really closely and how easy it was it for one guy let's assume for a second this one guy to take over the media narrative for twenty four hours or who knows how long\nThey everybody just fell into place and this was the only story Ryan\nWhite scenario is\nThat it's a leftist but it's a guy that got upset that the left was the only side being blamed for violence Trump did his body slam statement this guy had the dummy bombs ready to go\nAny nailed them all the next day and that's why they're all shown up right now\nBut if you will see I mean that's a lot of twists and turns on that plot or let's find out who it is first but you're you're you your school of thought is not unique I'm feeling a lot of that today\nAre a lot of people have written me directly but I have nothing to go on to be a responsible for me to a kid to to proclaim that happened because we know nothing about who did it one number one I'd be shocked if it was more than one person most profile or say it's not and they are actually hitting every body that is the most the biggest critics of the president\nMaxine Waters but the thing is Debbie Wasserman Schultz has been so out of the news of late\nHow does she fit into this puzzle micro soon WMD

Republicans on Capitol Hill a congressman talking about Soros talking about John Brennan as he should be the focus it's not just the fringe anymore this has now mainstream Republican thought\nYeah because he is a mainstream Republican thinker who just has a different way of delivering and I think most of the people whose voices you heard right now I understand that Donald Trump is different why they get up every day and I believe this was one of my big three earlier in the week\nWhy everyone gets up every day and it surprised when this president is unconventional it's stunning to me\nWhy they want to go back over his rhetoric and blame violence would be attended violence with nine packages being sent two prominent Democrats on Donald Trump\nThat will be is wrong I Believe the blaming Bernie Sanders for the Bernie Sanders worker that shot and almost killed Steve ... on the baseball field\nThere'll be like blaming Brock Obama for setting the tenure so out of the south Carolina

be\nDepend on it [noise] talk show that's getting you saw your with Brian kill made [noise] they were back\nAnd I want to change gears a the number one story for most of the last two weeks has been the caravan as we try to find how to find a way to stop in my mind stop between four and seven ... seven thousand\nUh south central Americans from coming here from Guatemala Honduras\nAnd Ecuador in Mexico the president says it will not get here we understand the national more National Guard troops are streaming to the border and we understand without hopping on this train the so called beast\nThere's still a hundreds of miles away but Montgomery Kalamazoo several ready she's on her way to Yuma, Arizona for an interview with cures to Nielsen homeland security secretary and Martha ... who shows going to be on at seven o'clock tonight joins me now hey Martha\nHi Brian how are you\nGood so Martha you're heading down to a you're heading down and the caravan heading up do you have any idea what to expect when you speak to the homeland security secretary today\nYou know I mean obviously there's a lot of questions for her where I just ... at this point we're going down to the doctor and we're going to talk to ice officials their tactic ... in there as well\nUm she has a ton of I think think about what what the homeland secretary at on our plate right now she's got\nDisasters that she's still dealing with the hurricanes and Florida and damage in Georgia she's got a pipe bomb issue which also\nFalls under a and she also has this caravan which as you say it out the way\nRight now and one of the big question is you know that there are potentially other caravans forming their set to be another one that's getting together to leave October thirty first found out that that are so this is not going to go away anytime quickly\nAnd we understand that the president is out there I think eight hundred about eight hundred members at the military to join the Twenty one hundred national\nGuard currently serve on the order\nI just don't know what they're legally allowed to do I mean there's a reason why we since ... ... you know after the civil war we were sending troops out to kind of forced integration and we kind of stopped that so what are they going to be allowed to do what they're going to go to the Mexican side\nStop them from coming into our soil\nYeah that that is definitely one of the key questions for secretary Nelson um we've heard the president say things\nLike you know whatever it takes I interviewed on my call the chairman of homeland security the other night he said will do whatever it takes so one of my big questions is you\nKnow what does that mean what's the definition of whatever it takes nobody wants to see violence break out at the border between the military and you know members of this caravan\nBut I'm setting as parameters and understanding what they are marching orders are it is the big question\nHere is the president last night could forty three\n[noise] those who violate\nLaws or grosser borders illegally will be sent back home\nCourt [noise] and we showed them the cars are gone a long hard but they get they cannot gum and\nThe way they want to come and those are more\nWhere we don't have orders we don't have a country and we have the greatest country on earth\nSo if they were pumped up in Wisconsin and that message on the Caribbean and stopping it is resonating with Republicans and what's so strange Martha is I don't hear anything from Democrats\nYeah that is very strange um and you know I mean one can only surmise from that that they don't know what the politically advantageous a response from them with me and you look back at comments by President Obama in two thousand addicts you look at the secure borders\nA fence act that was put in place in two thousand six by President Bush which was supported by Charles Schumer it with supported by ... it was supported by Hillary Clinton all of them saying that we have to have a secure border that you can't\nConduct the sovereignty of a nation without some sort of border and they all supported the eight hundred miles west project along the border at that point so I it's it's an understandable if Democrats don't quite what to say about it now they see just gone so far away from that stance\nOr more to the other thing is the word is when both any Kelly we're going at it last week it wasn't over an issue it was over ... Nielsen and we know the uh the general Kelly the chief of staff is a huge fan of his replacement and former deputy ... what do you know about that and will you approach that today when you speak to her\nYou know I mean I think that those issues of sort of you know at least you know put them in the palace intrigue category at the White House you know everyone that I've spoken\nTo in the White House is very supportive of secretary Nelson um\nAnd believe that she's doing a very good job of it you know she's always said that she starts at the pleasure of the president that she feels that there's an enormous a jet\nThat falls under her job title that she's very carrying out a but certainly you know questions along those lines of of you know because it's difficult to do your job is if this kind of friction ths are in place and and yes we'll get her response to that", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Brian Kilmeade & Friends", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "26"}
