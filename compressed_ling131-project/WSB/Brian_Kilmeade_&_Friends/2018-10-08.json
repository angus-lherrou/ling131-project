I. bill almost gave it to them for free and and but they've been playing way than we did not do for black communities I Do you think about the way the inequity has been baked in as a consequence of the system so when you look at community like Baltimore when you look at places like Chicago I live in Baltimore\nIs that what what do you think the outcome is going to be when you strip people all their resources when you heavily police and the myth of no access to jobs to food to money like\nOf course the conditions that have look one way and we can actually do something about if you think about crimes of poverty things like that it's like we could in poverty you know Trump just gave them a hundred billion dollars to the military\nYou would only take a hundred and twenty five billion a take every single person out of poverty it's never a question of resources is always a question well so when I heard Jasper that Reverend after Williams' talk about\nBlack on black crime it's like these are not this is apples and oranges right there are people dealing with community violence and we should talk about community violence black people don't have the only community that are violent that is not true race so\nUntil we can deal with that police\nVolunteer something wholly different right the police I sanctioned by the state they have a right to the intervening use for us and we're saying that the very least there should be a sense of accountability and that's the best there should be justice and we always think about that they're seen accountability injustice accountability\nIs that you never have to be a justice is what happens after the trauma that's happened I'm\nI'm married to accountability is what happens after the trauma has happened justice\nIs that you never experience the trauma and the first place so even when officers get arrested in something like that that's accountability like we used to live in a world where\nThere's justice for like people aren't over pleading about New York city Ninety percent of the marijuana arrests in New York City a black and brown people you and I both know and Ninety percent of the people who are smoking marijuana in New York City I'm not black and brown and that's just not true\nSomething else someone else is in the news that you know and was back on the national front page and last a few weeks\nFormer president bronco bomber who gave that very thing rebuke to the president when he received that award in a University of Illinois a couple of weeks ago so is he back is that going to help the party's cause going into November and now what are your thoughts on the maternal\nI didn't notice it everybody needs a little dose of hope and I think that you provide enough for people my push that President Obama when we met with him and the push continues and then I think that for a younger generation the idea of just a voting for voting fake is if a hallowed idea to like\nYou know I'm One of many people who voted my entire life I still got dragged on and police department by my ankles I still got sided with our mobile as I said I prefer to rent voting was in like this panacea that just like he'll do the things we think about voting is like one of many tools in a toolkit and we should be able to build our house with as many told as possible so we should vote\nWe should be in the streets we should run for office we should do all of those things so I think the more and more that President Obama and Michelle Obama start to help people think about the issues that should and I made the vote I think that will be more effective I think the idea of sort of just voting\nIs not really motivated that speech though where he sort of the first time he sort of come out and it's like Trump\nIs bad you're like thank you write like we knew that were happy you said it though I'm but I Do think there's an opportunity and leading up to November to help people think about the issues right so you think about in Florida are there are two million ex felons they can't vote it will be the single biggest three in franchise amount of voting in the history of the country and\nLike we should talk about that rate and Louisiana how many people on a jury\nTwelve twelve the alternate\nIn Louisiana only takes ten of those people to commit to a felony where you can get sentenced to life without the possibility of parole it's like a wild system in this in in November people have the opportunity at the ballot to change that to make all too well be needed to vote for you\nTo be committed which is happening in forty other states right now right so they're all these actual things that people should be mobilized to go vote for and not just vote against this guy\nWhy don't more people notice\n[noise] yeah I don't know I think there's sometimes a what makes it to the\nThe specially the folks who do vote because if we are to look at the playbook that the candidates used in both parties there's an understanding or an expectation that more senior people will vote and will vote consistently in once you've condition them to vote your way that's what they're going to do\nWith your generation that is entirely not the case and as you just said it's not voting against somebody's got to be voting for something and not just voting because y'all said vote\nYeah I don't know why it has been broken or you know I think that there I think some of it we think of activism is organized storytelling and I I think that sometimes ah we've not figured out how to tell the best stories and and the best way um but you think about you and voter id and this ah in this state it's a Georgia requires a a record of every name\nChange that a woman has had so if you're like an older if you're an older woman who has had a set of name changes like you have to document that from what I Do like that doesn't make sense right so part of this is how do we peel back the system to help them the the way that the inequity in the address is actually kicked into it\nUm and that's why I wrote a book that's why we're talking today because people don't know\nWhat is it that you're wanting readers to take away from\nAs work

Davy one of the co founders of prepared to launch you an online course that gives women division tools and confidence\nTo get back to work how are you this morning Susan\nI'm great ... thanks so much for having me\nWelcome such an important subject ah I remember when I had to do and I remember when my mom had to do my mom cried I was only ... only girl and we're just talking about this the other day she said you know I really just felt like I was losing my best friend 'cause we and we had become friends\nAnd uh she was just sad when she was working it didn't matter but she was still so sad and then\nThat that much harder if you're not working you really don't have any other\nDistraction and you know I started working with this population when my first yeah for two boys were born about\nTwenty three years ago and I would see these women coming to me who are at this point their kids are leaving and I thought I'm never going to be an affidavit airline unhinged yeah I'm always\nGoing to work part time that I had my foot in the door I added starting my own company but you know what I just dropped by last for children my last one off and I was shocked at how unhinged\n[laughter] you know it really is a big big change even for those of us are working\nBut for those who aren't and want to get back it's a really daunting process\nYeah so you just told us why you created I so I ... and you also have folk a co founder and this for about ...\nSo Kelly has professional uh cooking experience on the women's\nUh on the winning side of things she does a lot of help they win a set goals that they just kinda redirect their lives and they get kind of tangled Web of motherhood and my experience has more on how the women on the professional and and so we met actually when we speak I spoke at a conference and we ... we have these complimentary skills that\nCould really be a powerful together because if you look at the process of returning to work there is a professional component of it where you're trying to remember who am I\nRight now now that I've you know I\nStopped to work I Want to re enter and then we moved and through the process of creating the tactics and strategy is to get back though we started with a seminar then we had a course alive course that was very successful and when we started getting calls from people out of our drivable area and then you bring it here we realize the best way to scale it would be to bring it on line\nYeah yeah um so so talk about the program I I Know that\nUm I Know for me and you know it's kinda weird I I work the whole time part time most of it as they were ... you know when they were little and then when they had already gone to school I work fulltime but lead right you know pushing them out of the nest was really tough it was when we have and I\nStill miss them yeah\nCourse so imagine doing that and now they're gone and now you want to go back to work that you're feeling of yourself you're feeling sad ... um you definitely lost some of your work confidence because you\nAnd out of the workplace for a while so what happens is what women typically do is to things they either take a much lesser job they may have been you know an accountant or a lawyer or marketing manager you know Fifteen\nTwenty years ago they go to get a job um you know part-time recess coordinator at the elementary school or they go to work retail which is fine but a lot of them really has so much more to offer they just don't know how to do it the other thing that they would do if they don't take a lesser job is they take their old resume which may and you know in Nineteen Ninety nine or ... thousand and\nFour and they tried to put that out there and nothing happens and then they come back to us and they don't know where to begin\nAnd what we do is we take them through very foundational work so we look at what are your values what are your strength how do we account for those years that you've opted out because you know unless you were sitting at home surfing Netflix you were doing something you were volunteer right community\nYou maybe you were managing a family property whatever so we help them create language about what they've done during the opt out years we take them through personality and aptitude testing because\nUm you know I took the when I started work I kinda did okay what are my dad told me to do you know a lot of women took the job that someone told them to ... when they graduated because they'd have a job\nThat isn't necessarily the job you want to have Twenty years later right so we are if you look at the course er about thirty three different exercises in the course it's about I think it's about sixteen hours of video time\nUm I'd say probably at least half of those hours or you know close to half of his hours are just spent on foundational work doing exercises to figure out where should I go\nThen we help them figure out where can you fit because things have changed their jobs now that didn't exist when you left the workplace\nIt takes a long time before we get to the tactics of helping them write their resume we provided template we coached them through that how to interview those things come on the back end and what most women don't do is all of that front and work which is why they ended up taking something\nThat probably isn't what they really should be doing\nAnd you know for a lot of women are like oh my God I don't even know any of the software I don't know if you don't have the skills for those anymore I don't know how to I don't know how to you know a added or I mean it's it's a lot of things have changed in those years that you have so\nWe had one wanted to go see the life course recently\nWho decided you know what this is not the right time for me\nI have all the tools I'm ready but I Need to wait two more years until I got a couple of other things that my private life a set up no really just this course can benefit you wherever you are on that continuum\nRight right what what are your final pearls wisdom a for empty nesters who are considering really going back to work right now\nI Would say that a resume gap is not a career killer do not\nDo not quit before you've taken that chance mhm because I've seen people with thirty year gap go back to work so you are employable and in specific to this particular period of time right now there are more\nProfessional American Jobs open and there are qualified Americans to take them ... ... so the fact that your resume might be gap and maybe you don't meet all of the job criteria of um the posting or you know maybe your skills are a little bit dated\nJust not going to matter as much right now because employers need good people and the good person part of it\nIs far more important than the tactical skills that you have ... and then you know another another piece of of current news is that quit rate so the rate at which Americans quit their jobs voluntarily is that a Seventeen year high\nPeople don't quit their jobs voluntarily without another job to go to unless they're really kind of things are going to find\nWrite great information Susan

and sharing\nThank you wanted to thank you so much of a great day you're listening to business in the black widow who won the block\nYou know record low unemployment at the U.S trucking industry is facing a critical shortage of drivers\nAnd their scarcity has created a capacity crunch for freight companies driving up costs for shippers which ultimately gets passed on to businesses and consumers joining us this morning is Eric solar\nAnd he is president and CEO of us expressed the fifth largest trucking company in the country how are you this morning I'm doing great how are you doing good\nWhat's happening with the shortage why do we have a shortage right now\nOr pick up a couple of hang on one is worth sending below four percent unemployment until obviously jobs are are very tired and it's very competitive market that we look at areas like construction and manufacturing where housing\nWhich are traditionally areas that we have competed against and the trucking industry and those areas are hiring\nAt record levels and so it's putting a lot of pressure on being able to find qualified employee for our jobs\nHow does a trucking shortage and I can only imagine how does it really affect American consumers and our economy\nRight there you know it's hard to see you on a day to day basis but eighty percent\nOf all the goods and more are on a truck and so if we don't have enough drivers to pick things up\nOn a day to day basis then you may start getting into situations where some of your favorite retailers\nActually don't have product on the show that you expect him to have and and a large part that could be related to the fact that there aren't enough is enough capacity out there on the roads um in order to uh to ship the type of a product of needed to fill the show\nWow you know I commuted for sixteen years over an hour for work and I'm ... I was on the road with a lot of truckers um talk about for a moment how the industry has changed just even in the last ten years\nLater it's changed a lot over the last two years there have been new new ours a service that the federal government and put in place and uh that load dictates that a driver can only drive eleven hours on any given day or Seventy hours and an eight a\nAn eight day week and so that really restrict the amount of time but drivers can drive but the biggest change just happened in December of two thousand seven theme that now all of the trucks on the road have to have electronic logging devices leave our electronic devices\nThat truck drivers our in compliance with those hours of service down to the second and the reason that the big deal because prior to a lot of drivers have paper logs and they were able to maybe\nYou know a little bit right march that right on\nThe ballot the electronic lock them up off so it down to the second thoughts really changed the dynamic of the industry just within the last year\nI noticed also that I'm most truckers also have hands free devices um you know there there you know where they used to see 'em on the phone and uh now you see them with their headsets on and all of that so I think that that is a lot more in the safety line right\nRight yeah distracted driving not just with commercial drivers but then also with a you know obviously a your um your vehicle\nWell has become a major major in on what ... what five six years and that's really creating a lot of safety\nIssues out on the road which off of it but a lot of pressure on the drivers ... their vehicles are a little bit harder to maneuver much larger\nPressure on people don't realize a Eighteen wheel can't stop on a dime right you know when you're driving in front of them is which is the latest scary\nSo let's talk about the U.S expressed full ride program this is a phenomenal program and I want everybody to listen I'm\nSure so the day and then they kicked off a driver appreciation week so in conjunction with driver appreciation week which of the\nNation wide program we are now you express for and what that means is that we are going to pay for the four year degree either graduate degree or under or an undergraduate or graduate degree for our drivers\nUm and it's it's a online program and so I'm anybody who employ about ... as soon as they become employed by your express can start this program and start attending online colleges but I think they even bigger is bigger\nAnnouncement is not only are we going to do this for the employees but we're actually going to also extend this to their children\nYeah and so um we all of that for up to two children\nUm any of our driver\nI'm as soon as they come in for the U.S expressed their children can start\nA a online program through Ashford University there is about forty five to Fifteen degrees that are available as I mentioned undergraduate and graduate degrees on any given time there can be two people either the driver and independent or to a defendant that are covered by the fervor\nNominal why did you decide to do this\nOr we're constantly looking at them different ways to attract\nNew people into the industry to really started with\nHow do we bring newer people in the industry and when we look at it are average age of the new people making a career out of trucking in the forties nobody in their twenties is coming into the industry\nAnd so we kind of took a pay a little bit out of the kind of the military play book when you think people are going into the military and they're doing it mainly and a lot of cases to try and get an education\nAnd have their education paid for with and you know maybe we can make ... or a mechanism where people come in for a couple years they get a degree and then they can move on to a different career and so that's where it started but then obviously we have a career truck drivers that we want to reward as well so I don't want to put a program about those\nWho aren't drivers and our guy hides them but not rewarding those who are making it happen on day in day out and so that's where the genesis of what include the children came from\nMy gosh just a phenomenal program tell people how they can get more information\nSure we have a website is W.

news enter\n... these top story this hour for those folks who do have to work today and it's going to be a whole lot of coffee consumed in a lot of bleary eyes\nAs he gets game three of the annals the s ending just around midnight a little over an hour ago and the brace making up for a dismal day for Atlanta sports teams with the wind in game three over the Dodgers at Central park\nAnd a lot of their life six five in game three and the second inning of tuned it becomes the youngest person in baseball History Channel host these in Grand slam taking the record for Mickey Mantle and give the brain vibrant laid which they could not home until rented Brennan writes the time to stick with a laid off a bomb LA's village the series you gave the wand\nYes I Do cook I Need to get some help I really do and that's why I was asking is it makes sense to continue paying Fifteen hundred and eighty one dollars a year and home insurance when I rarely fail I don't really need it\nOkay so they're different issues so when your house is paid off\nTake your homeowner's insurance to Dr bowl as high as you can whatever your insurer will allow\nAnd that will have the potential cutting your premiums by a meaningful amount in ... her home insured because the purpose of having especially when you own your home free and clear is if you had a real catastrophic loss you know it burns to the ground or something\nYou want to know that insurance is there to rebuild it passed that the doctor bull you don't want to take on the full risk of that after you've worked so hard to pay at all\nI knew you're going to say that clock\nRight who was talking about let's talk about what you've got to do now at fifty five you're going to be mortgage debt free how much was your monthly mortgage payment\nOne thousand or fifty and how much of that one thousand fifty was taxes and insurance\nThree hundred thirty seven sound correct three thirty seven for taxes and insurance yeah yeah\nOkay that's probably the reason I'm asking that is that means you're gonna have seven hundred dollars a month\nYou can start putting towards retirement\nAs soon as or are you are in a position\nTo be employed again at your new job you start throwing money into retirement you're fifty five so you're allowed to do sixty five hundred dollars each year into a Roth IRA correct and you want to do that so the first sixty five hundred of that you would throw into a raw\nAnd then are you single or married\nOr getting married and by the end of this year\nWell congratulations so they know your your soon to be spouse can do a raw as well and even if she is not working she can do what's known as a spouse or raw\nAnd put money into it okay is that sixty five out at all so yes it is if she's over feels that she is correct\nYeah so you can start building up meaning savings right away and have you seen I've got a simple step by step guide just setting up a raw\nHey if I have I went up to that site I almost did it but I um I got involved with something else uh I have a non profit that they don't want a lot of money at the clock I got to stop it okay my passion is taken away my finances\nGot you got to build up or you'll be working forever right\nAnd you've done a great thing paying off that mortgage now it's time to build up your nest egg for your future so you don't have to work forever ended\nKatie's with us on the Clark Howard show Hi\nKatie hey there how are you doing good thank you for having me\nSure you are trying to figure out if a Roth IRA is a good path for you or a type of insurance\nActually I I you al I with papa was someone that was to find out or not a financial advisor kitten into and I we are talking about stuff like that and it's a crime that I've never heard of that ... which is that we're getting\nNicer we're talking about an index universal life policy is that what you mean I Will yes\nOkay so I Am not an unbiased person to ask okay I Need to lay that out for you I hate universal life policies of all flavors\nI hate that so it's going to be hard for me to give you a balance dancer here so why did I tell you why I hate them and wild love Ross and just take it as one piece of information that you can use to make a decision okay\nOkay so we're the Roth IRA let me first say ... and we'll compare back and forth so with a Roth\nThe money that it earns is tax free\nIt's not some kind of odd ball way to maybe get a tax advantages tax free Ross IRAs if you go with a low cost company will have an all an expense\nOften about or less than one tenth of one percent per year for the money you have in a raw\nOkay the universal life products will tend to have an annual expense of one and a half to two and a half percent so\nThey will be many many times more expensive in over the years\nThe difference between those expense ratios is a difference between you going to work for years more or being retired because you end up with a incredibly larger amount of money\nIn a low cost investment versus a moderate or in the case of a universal life policy it's a concern to be a a high to ultra high cost investment\nNow as far as the universal life products like an index when they're promising is that you earn a percent of the game of the stock market in years against but that you don't suffer a loss in the years that it has lost his\nRight so do you know that's a complete and total why\nNow\nTotally it's it is\nI mean it's like if I were to tell you the moon is made a Swiss cheese I mean it it really is and it's really yummy and nutritious as better tasting than the Swiss cheese on earth\nI mean that's about as equally true is somebody telling you that that's what an index universal life policy does that you get the upside no downside\nRight okay\nLet me tell you why that's a big fat lie\nRight first you're only given a tiny portion of the actual gained the stock market has an ... year and you don't get what in most years is the most important part of gains in stocks which is the evidence insurance company doesn't give you any of those\nAnd then the downside protection so remember you only get a little portion of the up the downside protection requires that you meet dozens of pages of conditions in the index universal like policy before you\nAre able to have what what would be referred to as the safe harbor of no loss on your money\nBut it gets worse than that with a universal like policy\nIf they failed or perform\nAs the illustration you're given says you can get hit with what's known as the capital call where in order to keep the policy from exploding and being hit with a massive tax bill you have to put in more money at a time in your life you may not be able to\nOK okay the\nOnly people who ever make out from any universal life policy is the agent who sells it and the company that agent works for\nOkay\nI I mean I mean I get upset when I talk about universal life insurance because I Need to tell you Katie I've had so many people call me over the years who bought one and they get one of those capital call notices and they're like what do I do they want another like fourteen\nThousand dollars I mean I have to pay it wow within thirty days or else I mean it's just writing narrow oh gosh\nBy so then I'll tell you the last worst part of it ... the illustration that the insurance agent shows you telling me showing you how the money is going to grow and not just this guy is going to grow through the galaxy and you're gonna have wealth beyond your wildest dreams\nThey're allowed to make up the numbers on there in most states so they can sit down at the computer and put in what ever rosy scenario they want and then it'll say at the bottom in mice type for illustration purposes only\n\nOther than that you can tell I loved them right [laughter]\n\nRaw tire lays on the other hand are very simple product you can buy them commission free\nAnd I've got a list of companies that sell commission free Ross the money gross tax free spent tax free they're ultra simple to set up ultra simple to have an ultra simple to spend the money from\nOkay and I think that I explained to me as a long term insurance is that\nYeah the insurance and them as a joke okay because when the capital calls come if you can't pay them you not only lose the policy have a big tax bill but there is no insurance either an inherent to protect your loved ones who buy\nSomething that agents not going to tell you about and its level term insurance we're all it does is pay to your survivors in the event you die it costs like nothing and agent can't pay the gasoline to come to see you to\nSell you one of those for the commission they return from it so they're never going to talk about it\nHis hiding in the

going to live [noise]\nThis is a stunner\nAs my pleasure to welcome you to the Clark Howard show where it's about you and that wall of yours I Want you to learn ideas to me so you can keep more of what you make there was a study done\nBy professor at the University of Texas Arlington\nAnd was reported on and one of those pointy headed journals about public health\nThat found that when you live in a suburban sprawl county that you were going to ... just under three years less than somebody who lives in a crowded urban core\nI this is something that doesn't surprise me at all I always thought it was because of the time people spend commuting\nThat that time when you're sitting on your rear end in a car going back and forth being sedentary is what leads to the shorter lifespan that turned out to be only one\nOf the three factors that lead to shorter life\nAnd that is a significant thing though is that is your commute is a time suck\nYou have cut out of your life for each time that you might have used to walk or bike or go to the gym or whatever and so again that's one factor another\nIs that if you're doing a lot of suburban driving\nAnd you're more likely to be in an accident 'cause you're driving more miles but your accident is likely to be at higher speed than someone who's in an accident and their core urban area in the U.S the chance of injury or fatality is significantly higher\nAnd then the third factor blows my mind I remember this one research study\nSo there'll probably be another one later the disagrees with some of the conclusions of the author of this but the third factor is that because of all the driving in a sprawling suburban area\nThere's higher pollution than there isn't a core of a metro area\nI always thought that the corps was where the year was really dirty but it turns out that that's not the case and the dirty air is what can lead to shorter life spans as well so\nThat long commute can be costing your health and costing you three years of your life\nLarry's with us on the Clark Howard show hello Larry how are you doing\n... thanks for taking my call\nSure you've got a credit freeze question for me\nI Do I took your life to help protect from identity theft and froze my credit and I'm In the process of thinking about applying for another credit card\nAnd before I started to fall on my credit I wondered if if I just need to fall um just for one credit ain't just faded or do I need to solve all three\nThis is a frustration of mind because you should only have to thaw one\nAnd generally\nWhen a financial institution is pulling or a credit report to decide whether to grant your credit card or not they are pulling from a single bureau because they have to pay for every time they tap into one\nAnd I have repeatedly when I've had to sell on my credit for an application for a new credit card or because I'm getting a new cell phone service or whatever\nDo you work at a traditional job even though your wife is self employed here why would reduce your withholding at work so that you're more likely not to get a refund next year\nOkay that's the most important thing to do because then if somebody does file a return is if they are you and it slows down your paperwork process like if you're not waiting for any meaningful refund who cares if it takes months and months and months to generate it you're

Clarke you excited\nI'm very excited it's been a long process but uh they're telling us that were scheduled to close a month from today\nAnd we're in the country you're buying a home it's in Denver, Colorado\nOh could you find it more difficult market to find a deal on a home in the United states right now in Denver\nYeah it has been very tough and I think we finally found the right place\nWhile I Am so glad because people complain constantly in Denver about the difficulty of finding affordable homes\nYeah that's right prices have been skyrocketing [laughter]\nHow can I be of help to you in this quest for this home you love\nSo part of this process um our builder has given out for five thousand dollar incentive if we use their preferred lender to get our national mortgage with them and the court they gave us a little bit higher it's not outrageously high\nSo I'm just doing some quick math kinda guessing on what closing costs would be I figured that it or break even point\nFor the five thousand dollars would be about four years now which it might make sense to have taken a deal and over the life it alone if we go at a lower rate I think in the end it would save us around forty thousand dollars which sounds great to me\nSo how do they want half a point more than market potentially so the only way you really know though\nIs that half a point would really come your way is to go to a mortgage broker and you have the mortgage brokers shop you\nAnd who knows then you may be able to go back to the builders preferred lender and say hey I got this offer here and what can you do for me\nLike I Know we've already spoken with him and it doesn't sound like as ... as a lego shuttle at all [noise] so my question because um [noise] well the plan I mean when I'm planning on doing is taking out the loans through him to get the deal closed because I don't think I'll ever say five\nThousand dollars and somebody like this again shirts and then at some point in the near future shop around to refinance because I imagine closing costs are going to be about\nTwo thousand twenty five hundred refinanced our costs all depend on it varies so much from lender to wonder you can even set a target of doing or was it was a no closing costs ... where you then in turn take a little bit higher rate\nIf if you know we would take for years before you break even\nTaking the five thousand up

does actually Amy Schumer\nIs Amy Schumer was supposed to have been on tour including a date here last friday in Atlanta at the Fox theater she postponed all of that well home well yes so\nI have all that proves that right there I lean on to the fact that it it it it's plausible that she could be her you're not saying it is I'm not saying it is how many tic tac or like maybe just the pack part of the ... the tack that I Know that kills me I intact and now that are the grass\nRhino that you're related to Chuck Schumer so I can see all this is all some sort of a a I have no idea that\nYou know the other guy we view believe Senator Grassley that there's a possibility that Dr Ford is actually Amy Schumer in makeup\nI have to lean on the side of it could be accurate [laughter]\nI mean he's hit

I I Believe that you're on the side of Kavanaugh as am I yeah I I Want to point out if people don't know you may be considered a the founding member of the never Trump ... and the primary season I voted for the libertarian\nA but this seems obvious to me that this guy has been smeared I Wonder what you think about when you see people saying I just believe everybody and I don't care what the subject is it seems to me that you got a a a bunch of people saying\nI Want to throw I don't want to have to think anymore I'm just going to believe every every single accusation that is out there and also I'm a little amazed at how willingly some people in this country are\nAre well are willing to throw away the concept of innocent until proven guilty I I'm astonished by this I don't know if you are you might be a little more cynical than me because you you play the game a little more than I have as far as politics and inside baseball but as it is it somewhat astonishing to you as an issue to me\nOh is it very much as you know the first principles in this country are innocent until proven guilty and um the is that you got the right to face your accuser and the burden of proof is on the accuser not a leak used in\nDemocrats have seemed very willing to throw the way that this new very post modern idea of of the bully evil women will you you've got hundreds of women who have known bread capitals since he was in kindergarten saying this isn't break capital he's gotten female friends who were with him\nAt a number of the parties where he supposedly was a binge drink belligerent blackout drunk and they say never happened and yet now we're not supposed to believe those women but we're still supposed to believe all women do none of it makes sense except for the fact that you understand this is has never been about\nThe accusations the accusations exist because the political left is opposed to break capitals jurisprudence\nAbout roe v Wade yes and I and I'll say this I I think that actually I think both sides are planning a bit of a game on roe v Wade 'cause it's very interesting to me that Republicans are kind of like oh no don't worry about it [laughter] oh but never in a million years will be and I think that's a little bit of a political ploy I think that uh certainly it will be challenged uh but you know elections have consequences", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Brian Kilmeade & Friends", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "08"}
