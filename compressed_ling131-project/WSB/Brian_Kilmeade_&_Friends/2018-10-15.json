L. M. B. A. S. dot com slash am seven\nWell you asked me about ... er Cox media group station [noise]\nTwenty four hour news weather man from five to seven fifty\n\nKnow [noise]\nGood morning it's midnight I'm Mark ... from the ws me twenty four hour news center\nBecause the mid term elections in Georgia and across the nation\nEarly voting begins Monday across Georgia and officials in one metro county already\nYou know beginning today here when it's made elections office that Saturday you can go to one in seven satellite locations a week's sooner than usual and for the first time voters can go on Sunday the twenty eighth of its main elections office\nWe wanted to say how citizens would respond to that so that's why it only at this location and spring it's only six hours a\nDay elections director Lynda ... says with a near record requests for absentee ballots she's not sure what turnout for an person advanced ... will be in that county or perish devil us the\nThe sounds a lot like sorority and fraternity rush at most colleges and universities around the United states\nPeople have asked me what's the difference you know final club at Harvard and a sorority and fraternity\nThese clubs have a more formal kind of angle to them or their house and these multi million dollar mansions are that are in Harvard Square in around campus they are owned only by the graduate members and the board so the university doesn't own these clubs\nAnd this is the reason why I mentioned that because these clubs had had come under great fire and the University of has has had problems with them because it can't control the clubs so the university has tried year after year to put pressure to either disband the clubs are open up the clubs in fact last year they've gone to for this ever\nThe administration said that members of clubs cannot hold officers in student government\nThey will not get recommendations for scholarships like the Fulbright or the roads and they also cannot be captains on ... teams\nSo this is the most they can do to try to pressure clubs to open up or disband\nAnd you say open up meaning walked\nWell the belief is that more minorities\nOr should join clubs women should be allowed to be in clubs and also people from different socioeconomic strata so right now for years it's been the elite of the elite for example J. P. Morgan junior founded my club\nThe J. P. Morgan junior or and so the names of the members who you know I've been in these clubs and who still run these clubs or the who's who and so the university says these calls me to open up or just ban\nAnd to that and if they don't open up and they don't disband and the members of these clubs cannot hold other leadership positions at Harvard that's right so now are you in any sort of trouble for writing this little red it this is a novel that takes us behind the scenes but you have definite first hand knowledge of what this experience is\nSo I say in the beginning based on real events because it is my experience and so when I get in trouble I mean you know every\nMember takes an oath um and I wrote it in a fictional manners so that I could not necessarily\nBe specific about everything but there are a lot of things in the book that are actually drew\n... listen my feeling my feeling is that at some point someone's going to tell this story I've been wanting to tell a story for twenty plus years and I said to my publisher you know let's just go ahead and tell it you know it's a fun story by the way it's not it's not an expert say on the ... but it's fun I mean it's it it deals with two of Harvard the most important books\nOne book was in the private library of King James the first and it has to missing pages in it and scholars for decades have been trying to figure out where are those pages and what was written on those pages the other book is the last remaining book from John Harvard's donation has collection to Harvard\nAll the other books burned in a fire in the Seventeen hundreds and only one remained because a student and returned back to the library so these two books as well as the disappearance of the students trying to break into one of these mansions and the Nineteen twenties is the centerpiece of this mystery\nHealth what can you tell us about the story and what can you tell us about the title the ancient nine\nSo the ancient nine I'm as a group these men who comprise ancient I'm at form a secret society with in the ... so even the members of the ... which I was a member of even members don't know the identities of who these nine guys are\nBut the nine guys are protecting the secrets that are buried in the walls of the club\nUm and I won't say what the secrets are but I Will say to use that for years students have tried to break into these clubs because they are believed to hold valuable treasures and artifacts and so these clubs are heavily alarmed\nCameras all over the place and fortified because people have now and my club Matt Damon is a member So Matt Damon the actor or came in after me\nAnd in fact he became all has no time for exactly that guy that [laughter] right\n[noise] um so ... was a member of quick story\nWhen you have we hold events very formal events black tie event you ask what's ... to\n... in a club we hold dinners there we are mansions have servants they have ballrooms lunch rooms so when we hold these big dinners and all your lumps come back and black tie smoking cigars we actually have posters that had been drawn to commemorate that particular event and we all sign that we autograph it with our years\nAnd So Matt Damon of course was a member so he autographed you know one of the posters\nAnd then Matt Damon became Matt Damon\nAnd someone broke in and stole his poster that he had signed and so after that you know you know security of of course was ramped up but for years students have tried to break into these clubs for all kinds of reasons because of these treasures\nSo the secrets especially in your club if you're a member of the secret society you know at the secrets aren't right\nIf you're a member of the ... you know those secrets but the secrets of the ancient nine you don't know there's a group of men of a there's a group that's really controlling things behind the scenes that you don't know\nAnd these are real people today\nWho hold\nThese secrets who're titans of industry or in government and they've all emerged out of one of these final clubs like the one that you belong to at Harvard\nWhat's interesting and what's unfair and I think a big one of the big reasons why women should be allowed to join this clubs is that when you joined these clubs you have access to a tremendously powerful networking you can contact\nCEOs a fortune five hundred companies partners in law firms anybody because if because if they're in the club directory and you called and say hey I'm so and so classes so and so\nThen oh yeah they'll take the call put them through you know\nAnd if you know other students unfortunately don't have that access so I personally believe that club dream more open even though I had a great experience um and it was fun and some of the brothers are still my friends a lot of them are but I think that you know women should be allowed to join more minority should be allowed to join 'em and it's a it's a tough one right now on campus and it has been by the way for\nHundreds of years\nLeave a message on our Facebook page\nDo appreciate you're listening and\nThis same time as we examine on\nTwenty four hour news weather man

S. B. depend on it\nGood morning and welcome to business in the black with the one the black\nJoined me this morning are desperately need either back to ... to Adams Robinson she is CEO of hitting me consulting and also founder of NASA and she didn't tell you a little bit about that how are you this morning\nI Am one of us on our you write as good day to be alive [laughter] it really is and it's a beautiful day out there too\nYeah it is our subject today and I think it's a really great subject is the fear of success and I think a lot of people\nIt's kind of suffer with that um yeah they were doing them at a special on TV some kind of series or something that kind of talked about um well what kind of let me think of in a minute but they talked about how people oh of success remorse when people have remorse\nYes they are yes that is all about that special but it is and it's a real paradigm mhm you\nKnow the fear of success success remorse and you know there are people out there so that's just ridiculous fear success you would be a main road\nAnd honestly when we talk about this you may see some here's the thing that make you realize that maybe I Am ... just a little bit Mm because there's a real it really is a real paradigm\nYeah yeah so where do we start with that um my goodness you think about and and I used to always tell my ex husband who's the guy who still a drug addict\nThat you know we will get right on the precipice of being straight\nMe you know the relationship the kids possibly having some extra he allowed and blow it and I go I think you're afraid to succeed you right but that were there was an and he got a drug issue but it just felt like he was so scared to get it right you know\nMhm Mm because his situation is drugs but that paradigm that comes into those situations as well um I Want to start here because I taught Sunday school this past Sunday\nAnd I think this is what kind of brought this to my spirit the topic was the first man mhm and we're talking about why\nThe man was created and the authority with ... with which was created for and he was traded for two reasons one\nWith God and got to have a relationship with him and we just all the time but I don't think we really get it he was put here\nTo have ... men over there ... and as little breaking that down we ... you know look they don't minion rule power ultimate authority and well it came to my spirit and I did talk to the class about this is a little bit if you will have ultimate authority\nOver the earth that why you live at so far been issue I mean\nYes if you were\n... aided by God himself that alpha and omega to roll why can't you have a rule in your own life ...\nAnd as I Begin to talk to people I began to listen and I began to hear things that really made it very clear\nThat people dream and they have they have plans they have strategies in their head but\nSomething is keeping them from moving\nAnd as I began to think about that and I realize that we're having our time for this this\nInterview I said you know sent that looks kind of deal with that for a minute and what's stopping you from succeeding when you know you're meant to succeed ... so as I was beginning to interview me to to research it I realized that concept of fear success\nIs the main thing they're keeping a lot of us back mhm now\nOne of the things is is we were created in God's image and his likeness and to be in his likeness we've got to be like him which means a lot of us will sabotage and I felt by just not walking without ... a lot of us all walking outside of righteousness a lot of us and not doing what God says do a lot of us are not living according to the Bible\nAnd sometimes we get punched for that but\nI Want a deal today with those who know that you know that you are meant to do and be more than you are right now but you just\nAt that place you just can't seem to make a habit and the whys and mhm so let's talk about what this fear of success is that right one author who said that he thought it was just a bunch of bull [laughter]\n[laughter] it who would fear money and six says and lavish homes and nice cars and being in the limelight\nHe said you know everybody wants that right but then I started reading the ... by the psychology of the fears success and a psychologist put it like this\nThe excitement that sometimes we feel when we want to succeed and we're thinking about succeed off to mirrors the same body ... actions that drama bring those same types of energies\nI'm the same type of of second guessing the same type of muscular just I'm almost a immobilizing wow those same types of physical ... ashes happened when you get excited about success\nAs well as when you get irritated traumatized [noise] so when you have that same dynamic going on and you don't realize there is a subtle difference\nYou will get caught and stuck in that place so that made me kind of got a confirmed okay we got to deal with this issue\nSo why ... why do we fear success list this get there first and then we'll talk about some things to overcome that paradigm mhm one\nYou can't have success without changing something in your life oh\nMargaret [laughter]\nIf you do the same thing you've always done you always get the same result to think otherwise is the is the definition of insanity let's be real\n... in order for you to be successful at anything that you're trying to do you're going to have to change and guess what change is\nScary yeah it is changed and cites a feeling of fear\nAnd we're going to get that they managed to give this seventh one and that's loneliness yeah\nIf I'm successful who's going to be with me because we always hear everybody who's with us level one won't won't be able to go with you to level to write and to glory glory glory so by the time you get to\nThat place that God has for you that that's the only place of success and again how you find that defines us as on you\nWho's going to be with you I Am I going to be by myself and this is much more prevalent in women than men\nYeah so how do you take all that fear all those things that can pull you back because they can't they ... they literally become a subconscious anchor around your neck that's pulling you back\nAs you try to move forward so how did you deal with that we're going to go through a real quick 'cause I Want to give you these real quick I understand that changes coming whether you like it an ...\n[noise] so are you wanting to move changed to a positive area where it's moving you up or you got all that changes happen erode downhill wow it's going to happen mhm okay prepare for it but the fear for the positive change\nWhen it comes to all these things you're looking at how people are going to treat me um how can I can I handled the demand he said that thing yeah\nDefine what success looks like to you because remember to sell a lot of people is not money\nA lot of people have successful having you know their their lawn done on on the weekend and having a nice little two bedroom house that they go home to everyday average success looks like the you got to define that first and foremost before you even start personally yeah\nWhat does it mean is it a a a directorship or president up company is it your own company is it an executive director of seal the ministry what is success to you\nAnd then be real with yourself on where you are right now and what is going to take to get there and as you outlined that\nUnderstand that you're going to have to step outside of your comfort zone to do it and many times that me when you start thinking oh I don't know if I can do this oh my God that's a lot of work you gotta shifts what you're saying mhm mhm and you got to say you know something that might be a lot of work but I think\nIt might take me outside of the comfort zone but with a guy that I could do all things 'cause he would give me strength and then remember this year war Crete ate it\nTo take the million over the earth that means you have the authority to do anything you decide you want to do\nYou got to do it in a position of following God now yes I Know people going to say well this is people living living high yes they are sure okay but is that true success because see me for me part of successes knowing that I'm doing what God told me to do\nThat is definitely if I'm not doing that there is a success right right and so yes the enemy is\nGoing to reward those who are following him but is that the kind of reward you want if you are seeking destiny align yourself with the vision that God has for you so that when you reach that point a destiny and\nYou are successful you know it otherwise you might be just peddling you're you're on on a bicycle going up hill and ... not going anywhere\nDefine what that looks like in the parameters of what God has for you and what is your destiny mhm mhm [noise] and when it comes to being lonely and not knowing how to handle it dear you can handle it\nRemembered that theory is false evidence appearing real\nThis is not real unless you make your real in your life right still fight against those things that's keeping you forgot has for you to go and do not let the fears be failure or success keep you from your destiny Mm Mm\nThat's so true and sometimes we're just scare wouldn't even know why risk it you need to examine that there were there we're comes from you know some stars drivers I'm Glad you mentioned that you need to know\nWhat's going on in your subconscious that makes you so fear phone ... love doing that which you know you want to do\nAnd I have to do that constantly I've got some things are going on now and as I was studying I found myself like oh I did that just just [laughter]\nI made an excuse for not doing it I mean this cues for not moving forward so even people who have reached some level of success and and and live in the destiny they will even have to deal with some of these so if you're out there and you're successful and use here here this and say well I I feel that way sometimes you're not alone mhm\nDefinitely not you're not alone ... a man a man\nIt was awesome I'll tell you the fear success and you see it in family use the you know the doctors and the CEOs and all that and you're like oh here come doctors you know in families are the ones who will not let you just be oh my goodness\nCelebrate your family members who were yeah right yeah\nAnd please goodness and those who are succeeding yeah if you have family\nWho is who's always talking down against your dreams talking against you or if you're on your way up and they're always saying you know you think you all day on the table the is that do 'em all that and God\nAnd you have permission to walk away thank you very yes you you don't have that you don't have to entertain that do not you know ... what Graham I say I'm all handed them with alone handles\nYou better than that [laughter] and you keep it moving yeah yeah nothing is worth sacrificing your destiny your dreams and your hopes it's really not get out of your own way yeah keep those people were trying to you know you get the money away as well and and watch what God does in your life\nSo lovely that debris tell everybody how they can reach out to you\nI Would love to hear from you you can reach me at proverbs

um seven fifty up yesterday\nKnow when you asked me about 'em doorbell er Cox media group station [noise] twenty four hour news weather and\nFive and a um seven fifty\nMe want to\nGood morning it's one o'clock I'm Mark ... from the W. H. B. twenty four hour news center\nBecause the mid term elections in Georgia and across the nation\nWhat George ... most populous county is ready as early voting against state wide on Monday you can go\nNext main elections office starting today but the county's seven satellite locations will open Saturday a week earlier than years past\nBeing advantage to have the satellite open for the extra weight because that way better throughout the county can get it someplace it costs are more convenient and happened to come here\nElections director Lee led protests were the first time when it will offer Sunday voting on the twenty eight that its main elections office only she's waiting to see how high number of absentee ballot requests will effect in person early voting in that county seat or perish devil us the outline of\nAnd his wife laid it out to him he traveled a lot worked a lot and his wife was responsible for thing you're trying to make sure all the bills got paid and all the rest and things got tight for them\nAnd she was taking out those credit card offers they were zero percent balance transfer\nAnd so every time there wasn't enough money to pay something she would take out another credit card and then when that one started charging interest she transfer it to zero percent offer and was really doing magical work\nKeeping everything afloat until it all came crashing down in two thousand seven and there's not a story about\nA couple where things fell apart because somebody who lost their job or anything like that he said he was fortunate through the great recession to keep his employment and to keep a good paycheck\nBut when they sat down and really figured out what they were facing they had a hundred and Seventy thousand dollars in credit card debt\nHundred and Seventy thousand so that's how she was keeping things going when there was more expense then there was income coming in which just by borrowing and so many people did that\nBut what they did in their case is why John wanted me to share the story he said it was brutally tough but they chose not to file bankruptcy\nHe said he'd heard me talk about going to the national foundation for credit counseling\nAnd they contacted them and they directed him to a local accredited counselor and they went on a payment plan with all these credit card companies I'm sure none of which thought they were ever going to see all their money\nBecause once your debt goes credit card debt goes above fifty percent of your annual income odds are very low you're ever going to be able to pay off the debt\nBut their credit card debt was way past a hundred percent of income\nSo they sacrificed everything they could in their\nLives and made it work\nAnd in just under eight years John and his wife made their last payment and paid off the entire hundred and Seventy thousand dollars in credit card debt\nToday other than their mortgage which they are very little one versus the value of their house\nSo at this point you know now it's been eleven years later\nThey are almost at free\nAnd living a life of frugality they were able to make it all happened the irony and I didn't say this to John and John if you are listening and hear this if you would call me eleven years ago\nI Would have told you that you had too much debt\nTo be able to pay it all off\nBut you had more faith in yourself and your wife and I would have in a situation where the debt total was so enormous\nAnd you made it happen and so\nIn the spirit of what John and his wife accomplish I Want you to know that if you find yourself because credit card debt levels are rising again\nAt a very rapid rate you find yourself facing\nA lot of debt no they you don't give up that morning better ways to handle your money\nOr if it's because you lost your job or whatever you ended up with that you got to be patient you got to have a plan and you may have to make changes in how you spend money to tackle that debt and yes it's true eleven years later as it was then an FCC dot org\nNational Foundation for credit counseling and FCC dot org\nIs a great place for you to go for budgeting or beyond for negotiating with your creditors so you can pay off your debt and a reasonable period of time\nSo congratulations to you John and your wife and your whole family most interesting thing John said to me was it early on it was a strain but later\nAs they made progress their marriage got even stronger as they fought\nThrough adversity and ultimately you achieve success good for you Michael is with us on the Clark Howard show\nHello Michael ... are you great thank you Michael you need a a magnifying glass to see the ...\nThe earning on your savings right now is that accurate\nThat's absolutely right I'm looking at it what we get from our our credit union ah it's in some tests civil\nWhat's your credit union paying on savings\nOr point two five\nOkay that's still [laughter] I'd still like five times with the big bang bang on savings but it's pitiful compared to what you can earn now in the marketplace\nLie I wanted to do what what we should do with um with the ... we have a we have two accounts both of them are administered by a financial planner or on a ...\nAnd uh but we have some money that we want to have on hand that we can get a whole yet not only equally well don't want to just let it sit there at less\nYeah so in a day to day savings rates are set only rising\nAnd the rates you can earn in the country now are pretty much a at or above two percent\nAnd they're headed steadily higher towards three percent so versus one quarter of one percent would I Would do is I Would link your checking account at the credit union to a savings account at one of the online banks\nAnd start earning two percent or so and there there are now a bunch of FDIC insured account that you're covered up to a quarter million dollars that you can open with one of the online banks\nAnd I'm looking right now like one that heavily advertisers right now Marcus paying one point nine percent American Express paying one point nine capital one one point eight five percent I'm One that I'm not familiar with\nCalled I I go banking is paying to in a corner neither one called bank purely is paying to in a corner\nSo you got the idea that it's pretty easy you just go if you want to see a list of all these different people go to bank radio dot com click on savings rates and then with a lot of these you can just click and open an account right they're\nAll right and Lincoln your existing account fund it right away and bam your days of\nOrder earning a quarter percent or over and earning round two percent or so well again and\nJohn is with us on the Clark Howard show John you got a question about your mortgage let's see if I can be of help\nYes my wife and I will be debt free probably within the next\nSix to twelve months and I didn't know what to do with some of that extra money that will have [noise] and

about you learning ways to keep more of what you may\nYou may or may not have heard the news reports\nThat a number of the nation's largest banks are facing a very heavy barrage\nOf cyber attacks right now attempts to hack into the bank operating systems way beyond just trying to take over an individual account at the bank but in fact to disable their computer systems at\nThe bank now nobody's saying but you can just assume that it's a state\nActor who we try to completely disabled the computer operation at a bank even according to federal officials maybe even to wipe the data clean on all account holders\nThese warnings coming from listen to this office there isn't the federal government I saw this on Wall Street Journal dispatch about this there's an office of critical infrastructure protection and compliance policy\nThat the Treasury Department that's a mouthful isn't it\nIt's very very freaked out about what's going on right now you know you know certainly assume it's the Russians or another foreign power trying to mess with U.S Russia it's always the first suspect because\nThe evil pollutant in charge but anyway in the past things the Russians have been up to I don't understand the Americans who don't\nGet how rotten terrible the Russians are under ... anyway I digress\nSo think of two things one if a bank's database gets completely wiped out it is\nLong term no real problem short term there are potential hassles plus the long term one of the things that has been implemented I don't remember how many years ago this was\nBanks and credit unions work under a buddy system where they all have and nobody really talks about this because it's doomed to the doomsday scenario what kinds of stuff but there is a companion\nBank\nA competitor that has a database backup it's never more than twenty four hours old from their competitor and in the event that something happens where foreign actors able to completely disable\nThe computer operations at a bank or credit union people will still be able to use their accounts with the other financial institution acting is host\nAnd for you and me after a cut over\nIt should be somewhat pretty much business as usual I guess records would be there'd be like a twenty four hour window of a missing data potentially\nSo which again is not normally the end of the world but two things come to mind with us if we were to receive a serious attack\nThere are a lot of people who rent out a room\nOr apartment or whatever on air being be have you been looking at air BNB at all\nNo I had and I heard you talk about it but obviously it's something that can go online and and checking out\nAnd if the airfares are out of sight then one thing I can recommend to you is look at fares from Salt Lake to Baton Rouge instead of New Orleans market airfares potentially ... Alexi Mississippi instead of to New Orleans\nWould it be better and I was the correct me if I'm wrong would it be better from it if I can say the city a lady from\nYeah go ahead oh San Diego airport oh why did I think\nYou said the Utah I assume Salt Lake I'm Sorry\nWe're we're driving down they're dropping the kids off at the grandparents and then ... leading for the week [laughter]\nOkay so leaving them in San Diego gives you the big option of not only checking fares from San Diego to the three destinations you know Biloxi Baton Rouge New Orleans but it also gives you the option of checking fares out of Orange County\nAnd if you don't mind the commute up to LAX\nTo see what might be available\nAnd in your book the airfare into New Orleans on southwest southwest you can change your ticket at any time at no penalty if the ferret drops\nOr of a better deal comes along on somebody else you have a year to use that money on southwest for any other trip so when you're booking

my Social Security number so I wrote back and want to know whether or not I should look like a security number on the application\nSo the thing is with any stock brokerage firm\nAnd now with many banks if you want to open an account with them you have to give your Social Security numbers to Social Security number should only be given for what's referred to by the overall\nPhysique kind of term go gentlemen's business reason or purpose and using the example with Robin Hood they're required when they open an account for somebody to know who you are\nSo they take your Social Security number so they can run an electronic background check on you\nThat I don't know how much it goes beyond just checking your credit report but they have to run background on you under a note that customer law that exists because of the ability for people to money launder so\nIt's not your Social Security number should not ever be misused in any way and you should feel comfortable\nGiving it on the platform

Know you that well we've got other stories from the studios will be one\nYeah I have to report on this one there's a there's a man who was an undying love for sex robots\nI don't know whether or not you hold on hold on wait a minute are you talking about me [laughter] yes I found that on your computer to when I was\nA family why wouldn't that be while to be looking at pictures of inanimate women that would have ... that's got to be the next thing I Can't afford what I'll just look at pictures of them\nYour custom designed Seventy six thousand dollar real though I\nThat's right that you are you jealous that I can listen to me [laughter] that's the name of the website ... uh listen to it\nIt's er I Would just say that I've never myself but I'm In love with the concept of these things because I think it's going to save marriages and the future\nBecause I Know when it's time for me to put up a mistress\nUh up in the city you know get a you know how this is done I've been married Thirty years so a rather than having a real person that I have to put up in the city my plan what I have a mistress is to have a sex robot that I buy or get an apartment for the city and uh and then my wife really cannot accuse me of cheating\nBecause there's no person involved all you're paying for the church and I saw it in ... we don't have to go out now we know it's a ... you know why this is my problem\nYou know I I've known people who have Mr since I don't know if you guys have but I've I've known people that my life\nAnd it turns out after about a year\nYou start having the same problems with their mistress that you have with your wife\nSo why in the world would you just double that uh we all know marriage is wonderful but it comes with a little baggage you think of distress doesn't come with the same baggage now you've got double baggage so the sex robot I Believe is the answer but I just went off on a Kanye like rent there I'm sure there's an\nActual story behind this I\nI don't really know if there's a story behind mess but there is a man he's an advocate for the sex robots I don't know if I can say his a fake name know it goes by ... you know I don't I Can't because I noticed the family show people gather on the radio and listen to it together that's right but he's an advocate and he believes in these robots so much that he thinks that the robots are going to the ones\nThat save NASA in colonize Mars\nNow here's the thing when you go to Mars\nWhat did he could never come back and what if you're a guy and now but what\nIf I told you that before you got there three years ago we set up a colony of sex robots [noise]\nNow the deal is it's not as bad as it so I I don't know just the way the guy meant it and also by the way sex robots can go both ways I'm not being such as the earth you're a female astronaut\nOr do you want to go to Mars but this could be a way to incentivize people to actually go spend the rest of their life on Mars because I think that's the way it's going to be a woman a round trip for your ears went to Mars kind of stepped down like we did with the moon got back inside the ship when it's still take like three years\nFrom ... to getting back to earth so it's a very it's a long way to go and I think everyone here will agree with me\nThat uh when there's a long way to go a sex robot can't hurt [laughter] I'm not going to make things worse idled say especially in zero gravity\nWow this guy spared decides to go over here I like to apologize to be a live audience but a Tim address was a little bit strange that I Am we got another story for me from\nI Do what I Want to talk about that one for a second a little bit more because they're all see what happened in this because I went last night to see first man so now Neil Armstrong so my mind\nWell by the way I recommend there is that there was that phony outrage going around 'cause there's not a scene in the movie of them planting the American flag on them if you ask that was the big money I think there's an outlet in Maryland and\nWell there's plenty of American flags in the film and it wouldn't actually makes sense you see the movie it's about ... and when she's on the moon nails very introspective it it just wouldn't even fit the narrative so please alright yet but because of that someone like Neil Armstrong I don't think\nHe would be thinking about sex going to Mars he would do it for the mission alone so you know there are out there that's not necessarily a lower Buzz Aldrin yes that would get him out there\nAnd not everybody's a deal Armstrong you have to have sex robots with a Buzz Aldrin says the world can we agree on that yes that was a great amount of that is that sums up review of first met\nThat did come out of it I didn't mean to ... and then there are just fit [noise] no no no I I probably watch last night I loved it\nI heard I've heard really good things about the movie so I Know that was that controversy and I think the controversy Greg wasn't so much what's and what's not in the movie it's what a Ryan Gosling right he's the one who plays Neil Armstrong it\nWas what he said about it that it was a a a global achievement if if the director just would have said you know just when it didn't work in the movie I think people have been fine it was the explanation that uh this wasn't an achievement for Americans there was a cheap it for the world that's what bothers people that story\nDoor to the Texas bar owner who has made a beer for dogs but it's not alcoholic it's just a a a\nConcoction they put
