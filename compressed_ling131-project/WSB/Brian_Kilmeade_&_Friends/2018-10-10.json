Senate confirmation process tested me as it is tested others it did not change me my approach to judging remains the same\n[noise] a good judge must be an umpire a neutral impartial decider who favors no lid again or policy a judge must be independent and must interpret the law not make\nThe law and what he's trying to say is that you might think I was nominated by a conservative president you might think is Republican solely backed me and only one Democrat got behind me and voted for me that he'd be going to owe the Republican something it's not the case it's not the way the Supreme Court works it's not the way the justices work\nI thought Britain you put it best cut ten\nThere is a deporting difference between being a political conservative and a traditional conservative [laughter] sometimes the those things overlap but most of the time to basically do not a traditional conservative it was a judge looks at the case compares it to the law or the constitution and Israel ...\nTo find new rights and new concepts that are not clearly putting the statute or president of the constitution [noise]\nAt the same time such judges tend to be reluctant to overturn existing president\n[noise] so that's why unless something is compelling about any decision\nAnd I'm not a legal expert but unless there's something compelling to overturn they won't and that's why Senator Susan Collins says I'm not worried about roe v Wade because I talk to him at great length and they believe there's nothing compelling enough to make him want to overturn we'll see how that goes\nNext in terms of the actual politics of it it's sickening and I think nobody's more embarrassing to the people of New York in my mind or to me personally then ah Jerry ...\nCongressmen Jerry ... he said this a couple of days ago cut Nineteen\nThis has got to be thoroughly investigated I Hope the Senate will do so if he is on the Supreme Court ah and and the Senate hasn't investigated the ninth and the house will have to\nReally so you're going to drag this out and bring the Supreme Court into it maybe they'd even question him again remember as as divisive as as explosive as Justice Thomas in they need a hill was once it was over it was over only brought up again recently can anyone put anything behind them ever\nThat's the problem no one sees above the fray ever\nSo they don't want to lose I get that\nBut Mitch McConnell did a great job powering through but I Believe and Mitch McConnell in in Donald Trump's final year Mitch McConnell should not put up a Supreme Court justice should Brier or a Ruth Bader Ginsburg retire say consistent with what you said before\nThat's what I think it will be one way to bring everyone together and say game on let's go have an election and I hate to tell you if you thought Trump or if you think Trump can't win reelection you haven't been paying attention\nHis approval ratings you know at forty one percent low I get it but CNN always reaching low it was thirty six when he just gets busy and gets to work at just a few questions in stays out of\nPolitical unnecessary turmoil he is a machine he will be sixty percent because always doing his knocking off all of this things to do with which a lot of time going against traditional Republican thought\nFor example he is not necessarily anti union for example ripping up these trade deals that's pretty much something that Democrats are always talked about\nWere the most part the trade deals with something Republicans worked on even though NAFTA was passed by Bill Clinton it was proposed by George Bush forty one\nSo a lot of these things that are going to raise wages because of the new NAFTA is something that Democrats have talked about in the past taking on China something Democrats talk about it's hard to hate someone who's doing a lot of what really helps you unless you're a political walk or pope politician and only\nSee victory or defeat Jonathan Turley says this about the process he's more concerned than I Am and I'm concerned cut twenty three\nThere seems to be a new development where we've given license for people to be an arranged to feel that they no longer have to be fair and empathetic\nAnd people have to wonder you know it's a lot like the old saying about pattern that revolutions like Saturn devouring very young [noise] the Democrats have to be very careful than leash this they may find that it comes back to haunt them in years to come\nAnd we're talking about pounding on the Supreme Court door we're talking about interrupting every vote with screens and as for the Supreme Court judge associate justice\nKavanaugh takes to the takes to goes beyond the bench today you just know they're going to break precedent and start screaming again you're talking about storm in the halls of the Senate and interrupting dinners around the city of Washington and around the country\nThat's what we're seeing on a regular basis Mike Pence seeing the big demonstrations to his credit he won through it the president with a forty one percent approval rating or so that is something that he feels good about because they are going up\nNot going down in terms of the generic poll with the Gallup people it's just a seven point difference the Democrats are favored to take the house but it's anything but locked up the battle for the Senate Republicans doing much better take a look at this I mean you have Kramer in front of Heidi Heitkamp before the last vote\nUs now Marsha Blackburn making it clear she supports Kavanaugh\nAnd now British didn't say any wouldn't support Gavin so it looks like an eight point lead for Marsha Blackburn in Tennessee she was trailing almost the entire time\nAnd then when you talk about other areas like Joe Manchin Joe Manchin might be locked in wherever there's a big reprisal and blowback among Democrats in West Virginia because I Believe he did the right thing he studied he evaluated and said well maybe it's too conservative for me but he certainly qualified and he voted them through\nSo these are some of the things that have taken place since the mid term then we'll take some calls on that\nAre from here on

yesterday and then the president almost on two twenty minutes later says that before he boarded shopper and goes to Florida to salute the police chiefs over and over ... and he said listen\nYou know I'm not I'm don't make yourself that that made the Democrats' I'm not an enemy of the Democrats he could actually go further and say I was one he's it but this isn't the Democratic party I Know\nThat these people away to the left in Tom praised emitted yesterday he's the head of the DNC that there really is no more moderate Democrats joining us down with that premise and he wrote about it is lieutenant colonel Allen West\nThe title of his commentary we are now fully embroiled in the uncivil ideological war civil war but I'll tell you what a colonel you're not saying Democrats or Republicans you're saying something different\n[laughter] yeah it's good to be with you Brian I think that this has to do with the philosophy of governors there has to do with the principles that stand for\nAnd I see the what was the Democratic party now what I call them ... or this or that bottom ... who could agree with what we saw this past weekend with people climbing on the statues at the Supreme Court or banging on the walls of the Supreme\nCourt case what they'll do it today colonel they're going to do it today at his first session public session\nWell and and if you don't see more of the members of the Democratic party coming out denouncing that they're they're condoning it when you have a person like representative Jerrold bachelor standing up and saying that yeah we want the majority of the house of representatives so we could have be in ... and\nInvestigate or a justice Brett Kavanaugh peach peach and for what\nPitching for a decision cities may but this is how far off that have gone you know from from the sense of normalcy and and again my parents were registered Democrats without grew up in the inner city of Atlanta Georgia but this was not the type of principles of values that they were a believer\nYeah we'll see in Texas your book\nReally really is a perfect time for it to be released because people are talking about Southern California if you lose the Democratic Republican Presidents Day they'll lose their house central Virginia even though Virginia's has gone blue if you lose the central part of Virginia you lose the house and then what about taxes people look at Beto O'Rourke\nAnd they're saying oh oh if Texas actually in trouble and they gave me a book called Texas hold the nation's victory or death and that's from William Travis and the Alamo and that's where it's a reference to but his tests just tearing\n[laughter] yeah I think that we are seeing a a big problem here in Texas I mean I live in a congressional district is represented by a ... and you have a very strong challenger to him about it I have a column Allred because what is happening is you know these businesses are people moving from these failed states\nIn order to New York New Jersey and what they're doing\nIs they're bringing the same failed out the allergy to a place that has an incredible economic growth and then put a credible message\nBased upon a conservative policies you know tax policies regulatory policies and so it it would be counted lip itself toward ... definition of insanity when you continue to do the exact same thing believe you're going to get different results and you see it happening of the major population centers here in Texas\nYeah and in in colonel that's one thing you're seeing in Florida to that too many people wonder you know in Puerto Rico basically put a temp you know thousands of people there\nAlthough Governor Scott sent a good job winning them over\nBut here's the thing if you actually look at the issues is Beto O'Rourke going to run out of state tax is Gillum going to run on I'm going to he actually he's running on I Will give Florida a state tax and full Medicare for everybody why is that a winning message it's almost comical losing message\nWell because the thing is when you are looking at how you can give people more things and this is what is so\nI guess disconcerting about the American public is that if Hugo Chavez said the same thing in this way\nThat he was going to redistribute wealth and give people more of something and make it free and there are folks that tend to believe that that is never been a successful economic model anywhere in the world and that's what a socialist a economic model is\nAnd that's what we have to try to educate these voters are to include what we see with these threats coercion intimidation of the violence in front of the progress of social is left\nOf it so what's at stake I mean right now there's a seven point difference in the generic ballot or in between the Republicans and Democrats were not voting for people how do you feel about the party seven points is doable for the party in power doesn't mean it's an obtainable board asked what do you expect to happen in the next four weeks\nI think in the next four weeks there has to be a clear delineation about uh the path that the United states of America is on right now would you look at all of our economic success in the past that an opposition party wants to take it towards and again just look at the images of people climbing on statues\nAh these guys are insatiable and I'm Talking about Hillary and Bill Clinton they're now starting their own show costs you seven hundred dollars to see them talk about politics my goodness as was brought up on the television show Fox and France today which I'm On\nSeven hundred dollars to talk politics in the meat to era and when you put up your hand and say hey how would you handle all the things that happen to you that you did these are going to be a friendly audience granted\nNow by Bill Clinton endlessly more interesting than Hillary Clinton I Would not I would pay seven cents for her but I Would like to see him talk openly in a private setting because he really has a great sense of politics where it was where it is I have no interest in putting into the matter Monica Lewinski or things of that nature\nBut would it hurts is when she does not go way Hillary Clinton does not go away we understood she was trying to run and stay relevant after you became secretary of state but now how do you feel if you're a Democrat now they're out they're charging seven hundred dollars and they're going to be creating news\nA non stop so I don't think it helps anybody with Hillary Clinton comes out there um meanwhile we're going to go to the phones but first I'd like to find out if there's more to do more to no we haven't done that throughout the two former White House communications director for the most talented people I've been

she did a great job incredibly a fishing under pressure this a good move guys do you think\nOh I think it's going to be interesting for sure and you can be based in LA not New York\nYeah but she's also good in a crisis and understands challenging situations Fox is always in John in situations is us against the world so often and that's something she's accustomed to\nI think it's gonna be

I just saw a report now from an MBA recorded just spotted Nikki Haley walk into the west wing\nOr that she ... she smiled and walked by recorded [laughter]\nYour story number one story with a siren on drugs the number one website in the world\nSo well a big story man yeah a good job of a say so\nBut I I Will say this for the country sake I Believe she has been a shining star for the last two years nobody ever brought more prestigious I Would argue to that seat in her she was leading the way a lot of times the one time she was crossed I think by Rudy Giuliani excuse me Larry Kudlow\nShe went and talked to him directly and say don't say I got confused ever\nYet she looked she I'm Nicky highly doesn't take that will take a anything from anyone uh she she is very very forthright um so ah yeah look she um she certainly been one of the most high profile\nIsn't the couple of minutes ration she has been a huge voice at the un United Nations I'm seeing her speak out\nAgainst the countries that that bash Israel has been a very very uh I think for many conservatives are have been wanting to America to have a voice like that at the un ah so she has definitely feel that um that well\nYeah and real quick on on the other stuff John and then when you you talk about what happened yesterday with the president saying that uh apologizing on behalf\nOf the American people for what Brett Kavanaugh one ... of course Democrats are beside themselves as saying you know the guy's guilty you shouldn't be a Supreme Court justice and they're the president is apologizing but how does that resonate with the elections\n\nWell it's it's going to like the day you know I mean that's I think that's been far too many conclusions drawn already about um the effect is has had what here's what I Know that I had a a good conversation with Glen Bolger who said Republican pollster that I have a lot of respect for and he said to me it\nWas very striking the kittens during the Kavanaugh\nScandal fought in the scandal whatever you want to call it debacle um that\nWhen uh the fight started to heat up he saw me pick an uptick in in ... I'm a model Republican voters and he said\nDemocrats are already like his character is eleven out ten enthusiasm he said Republicans have been up for out of ten and the Kavanaugh jak them up to about it\nSo he said the effect of ... to it being a net positive to Republicans particularly in the Senate states with thing a lot of Senate polling and nose red states that he's more favorable to Republican\nHowever and this is a really important asterisks Republicans do have a huge huge problem with\nIndependents independents us a wildly in favor of Democrats much more than they would be comfortable with and uh and the house is still a very very ugly Matt because there's a lot of\nA base swing districts where Trump is not popular a lot of members of very vulnerable so there are a lot of problems um bought it appears\nSo far that this has been a net positive for Republicans to the question is can this Thursday at them an energy ah maintain until election day\nOr a couple of things you know we don't this just looking back and Nikki Haley we first negative thing I saw that blew up it was her in terms of how to be true about how much money she spent on drapes\nOh here we go just just white I'm I'm just saying just now apparently I'm a therapist at the told a Nikki Haley's woke up in the west wing and status has said that they can have an open press or with her Trump in a in the west wing\nToday in the article\nRight now man was like Fifteen minutes [laughter] they televise yeah I I guess I'm just seeing all these things recorded by my colleague\nWith us so incredible it's incredible the way you're going to happen here here's a name pretty\nFar yeah here's this other story that just came across a ... a watchdog group wants to federal investigation to Nikki Haley's use of private planes owned by a South Carolina businessmen that group citizens for responsibility and ethics as Hayley undervalue defined by tens of thousands of dollars\nYou have to fight to the fights creed or the impression of him impermissible gifts to a public official\nSo the scrutiny that the Trump officials go under scrutiny that have not seen others going there but we'll see if that had anything to do with it I highly doubt it\n\nUm I don't know I I just don't know one way or another I I really ... with with situations like this broad as you know you just like the more caution the ... the better I mean I just I just want to tell you what I Know and be very honest about what I don't know I don't have any ...

there's no problems\nShe comes out as a leading candidate in twenty twenty four she told us on the couch on Fox and friends\nThat you know never run against the president but she easily could have ruled out ever running for president period but in twenty twenty four when you got a governor of South Carolina who's already shown a bipartisan flare who now has international credentials\nI mean I

I also as John and this one this is actually as I said what about both in east the newest guy in there how do they get along and he says no they totally get along their communications great Bolton used to have that job so he understands that job and he knows what it's like to be the only person there who's not really popular\nAnd also something else Nikki Haley brought to said to me on Fox and for instance the U.S [noise] she said I asked the president\nTo have a couple of cocktail party so I could meet the is who he can meet the other ambassadors wouldn't means so much to them\nAnd he did it to me two years in a row even though as advisors are telling you when you need to go you need to do other things he said if she wants me to do it I'm doing it since\nThat's their relationship and I think that's called mutual respect we also asked him I asked ... how do you feel about ever running for president she certainly I Would never run in twenty twenty against this president\nSo she never ruled it out governor from South Carolina who spoke up for civil rights we also know what what she's done as a family person whose husbands in the military and now she goes and gets the international credentials in a position\nShe has man or she leaves Hi this question is can you leave this position not do anything in public life and then come back in twenty twenty four that makes me think that the fact that he tweeted out friend of mine big announcement\nI get the sense that this may be a hiatus maybe family or health related and maybe she'll be back ... and\nYeah without having to get some headlines from the ... the president says the to Nikki Haley has done an incredible job a job the president says that Haley told him six months ago that at the end of the year\nWelcome back everybody one eight six six eight seven six six nine I have two reports some sad news Nikki Haley's resigning as UN ambassador\nWe don't know the reason except for the early indications are that she made it clear she's only gonna last year or two in the job because he has a younger family or ... in the military and she's leaving South Carolina for New York city and this job requires a lot of travel\nAnd with the president does is he empowers people trust if you notice that you know both of us got free reign secretary of defense is be the secretary of defense the one he didn't like the president was tuition and he didn't like his he didn't think Tillerson was on board with him so he didn't give me almost any responsibility and under caught him one possible\nNikki Haley was never on to cut by the president the president liked or give her direct contact silver unit Basset or to have direct contact with the president and said to me and everybody else\nI think everybody else but at least to me\nThe thing about the president is you talk to them and he listens\nSo they're leaving on the highest no possible leaving for now is what's been relayed Thomas listened W ... J. B. Thomas we know the pools sprays happening as we speak as we get read out I'll interrupt you but what's on your mind\nI think I'm I'm speculating here but I don't mind speculating I think that she's setting yourself up to be a a the vice president and twenty twenty to run I think it's going to step aside and Haley is going to jump in and that's going to help him with his gender gap\nAs you say by definition speculation but if Mike Pence is done anything it's set himself up to be president and for him to step aside for the next four years when he's done a really good job is never cut the president out he doesn't leak his staff doesn't leak I think there's anybody secure\nThomas it's uh the vice president Meek who's got news Ninety six five and ... do leak\nOr you know I'm I'm more thought his name on their number one Sarah payment reveal who feral or you move and number two pound bunny from Florida\nPam Bondi your embodied more of a legal expert I Would think that if she was going to make a huge leap it might be the next attorney general\nBut I Would not say but I'm not saying you're wrong I Would say there'll be a huge leap because it's such a ramp up time\nWith with the president taking on China been trained reestablish relations with India between trying to find a way out from North Korea while enforcing sanctions well boy upping the pressure on Russia and bushy or Assad\nWhile now putting pressure on Saudi Arabia to find out answers with the Washington Post reporter is this is a valuable position which I think\nWould require someone with some\nWho was more of a resume or for the international affairs but Pam Bondi might be a leading contender for attorney general\nMight be I Know the president certainly likes her glacier listening on a strict on the stream hey glacier\nHello oh I'm so disappointed I understand why she's leaving but she's so dynamic I don't know who's going to replace\nHer okay she's like the Clint Eastwood of un it's like don't mess with me absolutely and I mean like there's\nNo way around it you you know and she is talking to you she leans business that's what we want that are going to do don't mess with me okay\nSo um yeah I'm I understand completely ... she's got a family and stuff but I'm so very sad it's just like no no no but I understand\nSo I I don't know if there's going to replace him yeah I have no clue\nYeah I mean we were brought up a ... minute ready I brought up Kelly Ayotte a former senator from New Hampshire who's done a lot of international work with Lieberman and Lindsey Graham oh we shouldn't be replaced Lieberman is one of the three musketeers with John McCain or that that will be a very interesting I don't know who they could bring back from the Bush years to\nGet along with the president but if Mitt Romney was running from Senator from Utah I Would think that would have been something but you have to realize and I know you do when my colors do\nThe reason why Nikki Haley did so well is because she clearly ... for the president the reason why to assume was so ineffective doesn't matter what his ideas were it was clear he was not speaking for the president in fact this present with under caught him\nThe reason why a pump pale has worked out is because there's mutual respect their and pump a understands who's the boss even though he's with the west point background mad as as far as I Know you might I don't think he leaks but\nPublicly he never goes against the president remember he got mad at me that statement a made\nThat statement after the NATO meeting when the president said you know NATO has got to start paying their fair share and everything like that mad is at the end they said what a disaster those meetings were Madison those used in these one of the best NATO meetings\nOf the bit of Puerto Eric ... W. N. I. S. Hey Eric\nRan a great time or listening to your show and everything I Am a little um about a naked Haley stepping down but I did say that it was a ... it's not unprecedented [noise] um and the reason I say that\nThere's a lot of the founding fathers one\nThey would do that as well they would take time off but then they get reelected in\nTheir their duty to\nServe was so strong that they were put behind their family and go sir yeah George Washington's great example repeatedly go home to like Mount Vernon last fall the founding fathers would do this so you know my my hopes are are a little bit of that she's leaving but my hopes are also\n... I'm not too done because I Believe she's coming back better than ever in a better position\nI I think she definitely will be back in as you mentioned that the other person I heard we'd be back as Gary Cohn and I think it would have helped if he did come back because he's so smart\nBut he he undercut the president was constantly who reportedly leaking about the president\nSo it over shot the good the things he did with the economy and tax reform\nBut if you like history that much it obviously do I hope I'm going to see you on the twentieth Saturday at seven thirty because I'll be talking about all three history books and taking questions and we'll talk about stuff like this ah Erica WN I guess I'll go to Brian ... dot com or for that Denise was going to F. and news talk Ninety seven one insane\nIt was hey Denise yeah Hi\nYou're on my first time that Nikki believing she's done a wonderful job my idea is Michele Bachmann there's nobody that it's more name recognized had\nReputation worldwide she has been working with the UN in religious capacity um\nI wouldn't say it's out of the question I did not know that Denise about uh worked with the un religious capacity\nI Know between our foster kids she's willing to double figures she's a like a wonderful person thought that it has been out of the free for a few years I think are more of a domestic policy conservatives\nThought walked off by the way I'll be in\nSt Louis at the county library October twenty six\nTake one Adam of nitrogen and bonded with one out of oxygen and boom you just created nitric oxide it's a miracle molecule your own body makes the fuels your cardiovascular health keeping you vibrant but as we all age your body's need help generating more natural nitric oxide\nSuper beach by human has harness the power of nutrient rich beat and created a super food that helps you and your body make more nitric oxide on its own\nThe core philosophy of human is it develop heart healthy products for your body one teaspoon of super beach daily support your cardiovascular health\nAnd blood pressure levels to giving you the natural energy without the need of a quick caffeine cake or sugar high we're going to we were talking real healthy natural energy who do you know that doesn't need energy I Know I Need I Need a weekend during the same time around three o'clock and that's where I reach for super beach\nGo eight hundred five twenty five sixteenth or you could do the same thing will go to Brian speech dot com you get free shipping two and a free thirty supply with your purchase eight hundred five four and twenty five sixteen O'Brian beach dot com\nThree years ago my mom my sweetheart who had type two diabetes heart disease and we didn't know that if you have diabetes your two to four times more likely to develop cardiovascular and what's truly shocking to me and millions of\nPeople living with diabetes aren't aware of the increased risk of heart disease or what will it take to think\nIf you have type ... diabetes you know your heart your risk of heart disease you know your risk of heart\nBuying knowing your risk disease and diabetes are no matter how you have to really [noise]\nSunni you your heart disease\nThe more you can\nFor your heart dot com\nWho your risk of heart you\nWhen you asked me about ... er Cox media group station [noise] one of those twenty four hour news whether an from five and a um seven fifty\n\nGot boring it's two o'clock I'm Mark hey line live from the devil you asked me twenty four hour news center\nWell he'll he'll\nOf warnings from these officials the storm could kill you that from Florida governor Rick Scott as hurricane Michael closes in with up to Thirteen foot storm surge and hundred twenty mile an hour with water will come miles ensure and could easy rise over\nAnd she did we'll find out the exact reasons why my sense is family you know governor in South Carolina you could still be home although the hours along with a husband in the military in a family that still needs around as opposed to in college and gone I\nThink that could have played a role of the things to pay she keeps joining us now is Michael good when Michael I'm your thoughts as as a columnist I think it's hard to put I I don't remember anybody writing negative things about Nikki Haley do you\nWell just recently Ryan remember that all your friends\nTried to take her with the fifty two thousand dollar curtains for the residents before having to effectively retract a story and you can see that the decision was made under ... Obama's administration but you're right I think in general she ... the lack of any uh coverage of her\nWould be a positive because of the way the media has Savage and picked off like they're trying to call the herd of every member of the Trump Administration so they haven't gone after her directly in the same way but a\n... ... am neither neither have they complimented her I think to to the extent that she deserves it I think she has been\nA fateful representative of the president's policies at the United nations and by doing so I think she has shown an incredible a fearlessness a an accuracy in ... in a consistency and pushing forward\nAmerica First ideas that we are happy to be part of the United nations for the good things that does but we will not be it\nPast the we will not be opinion data and we will not give our money\nTo to wasteful a program that encourage violence and terrorism as with the Palestinians and we will not go along with his demonization of Israel we will use the UN for good purposes but this idea that a block Obama\nPushed that somehow to be a citizen of the world was to uh she'd American decision making to the global body\nWhen the global body is just a group of individual countries all of whom want to put themselves first and many in many cases greedy and corrupt diplomat who live like kings in\nNew York yeah or even as they cry poverty at home so I think that she blew the whistle on a lot of ...\nAnd then now at the at the United nations I think in in the best spirit of Jeane Kirkpatrick and Daniel Patrick Moynihan who are held\nThose positions and also John Bolton who I think was a clear scourge\nOn the United nations that's what we need there and I I'm Sorry to see her go but as you say she's got she's got a life to live she's got I think at least one child it was still in high school ah and ah her husband in the military I think it's it's been a complicated life for her\nAnd I think it is that the nonstop pressure nonstop decision making it's probably taken a toll but I Hope she'll come back into public life soon\nWe will Michael a good one with us now so she's going to finish at her job to the end of the year gives the president some time to replace her\nNumber two is the president empowered her and they had a direct line that has everything to do with it so it it became clear to other nations that she has power and the president's ear she gets more respect the one time she didn't she blasted Larry Kudlow for saying something like she got confused no one ever did that again to Nikki Haley\nThe other thing she told me behind the scenes she says the funny thing is all these people who evidently don't like with Donald Trump's done to this country when he comes he is like a rock star every one of these ambassadors wants their picture with them everybody wants that moment with the shaking hands and then she said I asked the president for one thing\nI said we can do can we do a cocktail party will you just give me twenty minutes to meet the other end bachelors now his people told them you can't do it has no time he says if Nicki wants me to do it I'll do it and not only did he do it last year he asked her again this year\nYou need me to do that again and she said yes so it's just the respect they could that permeates into American policy\nShe has saved money she has taken on North Korea pulled back from North Korea one demanded also personally went and visited the Syrian refugees and made that her cause I just yeah I Can't say enough about her\nYeah I think she's terrific Brian and and you know there's a I I read a little of a thing in the paper about uh\nUh in the paper called the spectator that how President Trump is viewed positively in Africa by the general population's fifty six percent of Kenyans and fifty six percent of Nigerians\nThink Donald Trump as a positive force for their countries think about that you would not hear that at the United nations itself and that's what Nikki Haley was up against that that these polls Tate sees these\nPotty mouth at the United nations do not really represent the mass public in their own countries they are divorced from them they are\nThe elites of their countries and this is what Nikki Haley was up against and she constantly blew the whistle on it I think it it it's it cannot be a\nA said too many times how difficult that can be the pressures to conform all the time she took her marching orders from the president you clearly embrace the president's view\nAnd I think that's what makes her so special\nYeah I Want you to hear more was coming across right now it's been a slight delay\nSo let's listen together more from Nikki Haley in the president\nI Want to say on her so am I going to come out in this way on them and honor and I you know I said I Am\nBelieve they bring in a country I'm not very really\nBut I'm not going to work at\nThe end I said Tom porn time now the United states different reasons why\nI say\nIf we say we're going to do something we've already heard that whether the whether it was saying on our country to pay their share of whether you were given I may not\nSo it's true I mean she very remarkably productive sometimes that seats almost invisible in this case it isn't I imagine she'll be back in a couple of years\nIf the president wins re elect you know you'll have some type of role you don't know how long it has to be a step up that's the issue and it's got to be a step that enhances her resume and gets already uh for the next challenge now I've got to ask you a Mike Goodwin\nHow do you feel about my premise in the hope that the president will not bring up the word hoax when it comes to Dr Ford will not talk about a sham but we'll talk about Kavanaugh's being on the bench in fighting through the turmoil I just worry about the Supreme Court losing its non political nature after\nThings like this happened I like to go back to court as usual like it did after Thomas do you agree with that\n[noise] I Do to a certain extent Brian and I was thinking something similar watching the president last night I thought it was one of the most remarkable ceremonies have ever seen in government um I mean what the Kavanaugh family went through in for the president to apologize on behalf of the nation\nWas incredibly important I think it struck all the right notes and I agree with you there were hoax\nUm and maybe even it has proven innocent I I don't know about all of that but it but I Do think that they're these things are not just intended\nFor those who are who supported Kavanaugh\nThey're also intended for the other side and I think this is this is the genius of Donald Trump that often gets overlooked\nHe is signaling to the other side\nWe we will deal with you every time we we will not turn the other cheek we will unload on you just as you unload on us and that's a really important signal I mean the Democrats have to know they were trashed here and the president is not in a Haley mood if they want\nTo play by the that's fine but if they want to fight he'll continue to fight too I think so I think that that is that it is a hidden message to them don't screw with us again\nAnd you're seeing any seems to be the only president they can really help out in the midterms where all the other presidents or might have been have higher popularity ratings but we're basically told to stay home just another thing different about this ... this uh this administration Nikki Haley also praised Jared in a bunker let's listen\nI Can't say things about Jared and\nNo one can read even after the on the way we're not done working with him on the mentally he's only going to do a lot of\nThings I Wish more can come down because we're not our country there and\nSo that's interesting Jared ... again yeah brought a silk just when you think fading away does that mean in the beginning Kelly was pushing them back but now they've stepped forward but they don't want the credit is an interesting they don't have to credit\nJared Kushner or does a lot of things I mean the the Mexico when she mentioned NAFTA I think it was primarily his he's been in Mexico a number of times talking to the current president and the new president of the old and the new\nMichelle France on ABC News I read that the coverage of hurricane Michael continues with double USB meteorologist

here it all I'm not Brian kill me Joe I wanted to\nDo this because Nikki Haley\nTo the United nations has been very special to me she's done an incredible job she told me probably six months ago she said you know maybe at the end of the year the other two years of areas of the end of the year [noise] I Want to take a little time off\nAnd that's why with that we were the stunning news ambassador Nikki Haley will be calling it quits at the end of the year she'll be tough to replace I just don't know anybody who's been critical of her performance or who is more empowered in her job who actually elevated the job in ...\nBecause she was speaking for president that you had direct contact with him in the nose that well as ... there's been some very competent people in and around the president\nThey just don't feel empowered they leave\nThat's not the case with investor Haley my right Corey\nRyan you're exactly right look ambassador Haley had weekly meetings in person with the president\nOr she would fly down from New York she'd sit in the oval office they would be on the same page on every major foreign policy decision and she brought that message back to the United nations\nAnd re asserting us dominance to the United nations taking some very tough positions of what this president wanted the world has noticed it she got a very very good job of the UN ambassador\nSo how surprising is that you know about this\n[noise] you know I I didn't know about it and I can tell you from my friends on the building that I've talked to and if he didn't know this was coming and you know if this is uh something that the president and the ambassador spoke about six months ago than it was kept as a very very close secret I spoke to\nA number of people who work in the building today none of the news coming it's now being reported\nA Ambassador Bolton didn't know it was coming national security advisor Bolton a secretary ... didn't know it was coming but that's okay because there was a transition period here and what the president just said and I'm sure you saw this was\nIn the next couple three or four weeks he will be naming a replacement from Pasadena Haley and I'm sure there are a number of very serious very confident people who can fill that role\nOr so in terms of a real affection you could read through the the jargon like nobody else 'cause you know the president when it was just you and him trying to get your campaign underneath you try to establish yourself I sense to do is a real respect back and forth let's listen to a little of it\n\nNow there's no personal reasons I think that it's just very important for national I understand why not try to and I haven't given everything you've got these last days here and I do they have a\nOther people who find\nSame energy and power and you're like really in a lot of people are going to want to say there's a lot of rain finally than than than I Want to make sure that I find that\nIt was a blessing and going from the UN was high on her every day and defend America and I'll always be our never truly\nFighting for our our pay that time\nSo she thinks it's time and the president just through ah through praised it her so see we'll see where this goes but because I think that unlike Tillerson who had a more prestigious job he didn't have any power so we'd go to me with these world leaders and they knew he's not speaking for Trump\nRyan you're exactly right every there was no question that went Nikki Haley spoke at the un she was speaking directly for the president of the United states his policies on full display\nEvery time that she went out to speak she she understood what he wanted to accomplish she implemented his agenda regardless of what that was and it was the right thing for the country in every world leader knew that when she made a phone call or she spoke to them at the un she was speaking on behalf of the\nCountry with the full support of the administration and she's not only had a good relationship with the president but also the vice president secretary palm pilot it is a very sharp contrast to her relationship with the president to what was rex Tillerson's relationship with the president and so\nYou know as you go forward what she said was she went into the un every day with body armor\nOn because she has to be ready for that fight fighting for America first putting our values and our agenda at the forefront of the UN which is the job of the un and bashing she's done a phenomenal job but I have to think that in and out every day that weighs on somebody trying\nTo move things in your direction regardless of if you're the most powerful nation in the world it is a fight it is a battle every day and she has done a phenomenal job in
