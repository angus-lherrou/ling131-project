I Am frightfully biased on this one credit unions are co ops owned by their members\nSo there is no stockholders to pay dividends to there's no stockholders are trying to make a profit on the

because they serve a different purpose they are serving their members that own it\nIs entirely different experience than being at a bank\nBut credit unions aren't for everybody in many cases if you

know a big bank or regional bank they both of those do a terrible job of serving a small business and the same time credit unions generally are wired all about serving a consumer an individual family\nAnd they're not really about serving a small business some are but that's generally not what their purpose is in their goal so I Would say the dividing line is consumers will be much better

Party number one if you listen to a speech he thought about it too I don't agree with the premise a and our decision but\nSo watch Republicans have to grow up because someone doesn't vote your way you don't hate them you don't vilify them if when it comes for which he's up for reelection a few years go ahead maybe you want to push you know the candidate forward but people should understand and the president should understand\nThat you cannot lose one vote and Democrats might be furious at Joe mansion you keep pushing them you lost them entirely\nHe is the most powerful person I Believe in the Senate right now a Democrat there has to be won over for every vote\nAnd I think he just won't even though he's up by seven of the real clear average was probably if he did a it probably on route to winning would have been a lot closer I voted against it I think the White House likely will pull back a little in West Virginia\nBut if the Republicans want to change the tone in tenure and don't just want to vilify Democrat it starts by not vilify Lisa Murkowski yeah it's it's a tough vote\nWasn't there for the party when they needed her but she might be there next time but I guarantee you one

I didn't I didn't clerk for him in the in the nineties so I I Can't say but I can say certainly right now he is someone who on the right has really achieved rock star status I mean he I think is the the kind of person that that uh people see as a real leader\nOf the entire a constitutional is weighing of the court and um so I I feel like he's he's he's well past at this point that this is a problem with with people on doing damage to someone's reputation they're still you know a a sizable minority of people out there who\nAre always going to have that in the back of their mind despite the fact that at the time of the hearing it twice as many Americans believed him as believe tail but you get people who do the revisionist history et cetera so so I think in some sense it's there's always some people will be in the back of their mind that he's the kind of person that you can you just say you know what\nI'm I'm moving forward you you learn a humility from that process and I think that's going to be the case for justice Kavanaugh's well uh you know you can't you're you're gonna always have people out there who are who are going to be an\nOpponent but um if anything I think it it remind them that that's not that's not your target audience as Justice Thomas would always say I didn't take an oath to you know just to New York times editorial board or that their nose the

naive with China that we had this kind of sense that if we cooperated and played nicely that China would eventually reciprocate and we see that hasn't worked so the Trump Administration has\nBeen much tougher on China a label competition with China as the number one priority of the United states national security strategy and we're seeing that and trade and military elsewhere are pushing back and uh it's a it's a better approach than what we've had in the past\nYou know the one thing they're saying is that it's like well we've heard this in the past we've only heard it behind closed doors\nNow when Mike Pence makes his speech on I think it was friday or Saturday taking on China I think it was probably friday or they're going to China he called them out on everything's theft of intellectual property you're feeling to play fair the building of those islands and many were stunned that he came out front and center\nWhat about that strategy of coming out like that\nBut I think it makes a lot of sense and it's it's not just the statements it's also the actions behind them as you pointed out China's not playing a fairly when it comes to international trade and so the Trump Administration is heading back\nOut with terrorists and and other measures um and uh in the south China Sea as you pointed out China's military rising islands so the Trump administration's increasing defense spending to the United states can better deal with that but also encouraging our allies to do more so Australia Japan\nOr India working together to counter China um so it's the tougher language yes but also the tougher or action backing it up\nA and but we are so economically tied to them we will people wonder how we're going to pay the price or are we because they need or market more than we need their stuff\nWell there's no doubt that I'm by getting tougher on trade that this could have a some negative effects on the U.S economy uh the the Chinese are practices have been unfair but they've also been benefit\nShe'll in certain ways by subsidizing their firms are they've Chinese imports to the United states have been cheaper than they otherwise would be that gives Chinese firms in unfair advantage but it also means American consumers pay less for Chinese products are so as we get China to stop these unfair practices there will be\nA some possible uh consequences for the U.S economy but I think that the fundamental point you make is is the right ones are more vulnerable to this than we are and so the purpose is to increase the pressure and the short term to get them to\nChange their practices to get them to play by the rules\nAre and then a four competing head to head and nobody can compete with the U.S economy a ... an affair level playing field\nI Want you are a little of Mike Pence the vice president I'd states are taking on China cut the top one\nChinese security agencies have masterminded the wholesale theft of American technology including cutting edge military blueprints and using that stolen technology the Chinese Communist party is turning Ploughshares into swords on a massive scale\nSo that's pretty direct and but it's up to American companies to also maybe we've got to put some rules in place not to be selling this technology for a quick pay day that helps their family but her to our country so do you think that we have to be more discipline here\nAnd cracking down our businesses for ... for falling prey to big dollar deals\nYes so the national defense strategy of the United states or the the national defense authorization act mandated the Trump Administration to come up with a comprehensive strategy to deal with China and that will certainly be part of part of it so ... reforms and basically making it more difficult for Chinese companies to invest\nIn the U.S economy and sensitive national security areas but also export controls for us and our allies to make sure that we're not exporting\nI'm sensitive technology that the Chinese can then use a ... in this competition so you know one area in particular is artificial intelligence which many military experts think could be a really the future of military competition or right now there are many American a\nVenture capitalist investing and artificial intelligence in China because they see an economic upside to it and they're very well may be a but it could also mean giving China military capabilities that would threaten us in our allies so reforming all of these things this untangling our economy to some degree I think is the right stuff\nUm but it it won't be easy\nThey won't be easy let's go fast forward to North Korea this is I I get it or people that study diplomacy and nuclear proliferation say I can't believe that the template the president's following a first to bring us to\nThe brink of conflict because we're at the brink of conflict we just weren't acknowledging it and then it ends up in Singapore summit and then nothing's fulfilled so we break off and now it seems like we're back on\nWhat how how do you view our relations with North Korea right now\nYes I think it would be helpful to begin with a broader context of this has been a major problem that's but doubled administrations for decades\nThe Trump Administration came in with a clear strategy maximum pressure and\nEngagement so increase the pressure early on was sanctions military pressure uh and that was to set the table for the engagement face and that's where we are now so Kim Jong Eun has agreed in principle to denuclearization and uh we're trying to make progress on that\nIt's been a little bit slower than I think some and probably even the administration would have hoped but we have to give this some time\nOr see how it plays out but I don't think the administration will have unlimited patience a sewing and short I think we do have a clear strategy and we are making making progress\nBut man would you also see I just give you with the president's a secretary said the president tweeted out secretary Pompeo had a good meeting with chairman Kim today in uh in North Korea progress made on Singapore summit agreements I look forward to seeing chairman Kim again\nIn the near future so they're working on a return a summit the secretary of state tweeted this out arrived in Seoul to brief prison a moon and are in their prime minister\nAbout my meeting with Kim I look forward to working closely with\nA South Korean friends and allies to ensure progress on an inter Korean relations is a in lockstep with progress on denuclearization so he wants to make sure South Korea doesn't get ahead of us is knee\nYes that's right uh you know one of America's greatest strength says it's network of democratic capitalist allies in Europe and Asia and so in Asia South Korea and Japan or two of our closest friends\nAnd they have a strong interest in this as well North Korea is a in their in their backyard or so on one hand ... in Japan\nHas been pretty hawkish on North Korea may be even tougher than Trump\nAnd so we need to make sure that they're on board with the engagement on the other hand president moon and South Korea\nOr has been moving kind of full steam ahead on trying to improve relations with North Korea and so we just need to make sure that all three of us are on the same page or that enter alliance unity is going to be very important ah for for addressing this issue\nAnd that the one thing that bothers me most bother you is the fact that Russia says okay if America is talking to him\nI'll talk to them yes America in Russia having better relations me will break these sanctions on these barriers shyness same thing and he was like after we meet with them these other leaders these communist leaders or these dictators want to meet with them again is that to make sure that\nAmerica knows that they are they're not who really influence as North Korea or do they getting panicky there were starting to move directly with North Korea and not going through them\nI I think it's both a I think that China and Russia want to be great powers they want to be involved and so this idea that the United states South Korea and North Korea\nOr the center players in this drama\nWorries them they want to make sure that they are are still players on the international stage about the second part of it is I think especially for food and uh he sees what's good for the United states is bad for Russia and vice versa so I think he's looking to play spoiler here\nAnd the economic pressure on North Korea has been important to get us to this point and so I think Russia and China are I'm looking to defuse that\nA pressure a little bit which is going to make it harder to get a deal fight 'em so\nI Know I Know that you you or your devising Mitt Romney for awhile and Marco Rubio to people that have had conflicts with President Trump\nWhen it comes to foreign policy your resume is unbelievable and so diverse and some people who

audience entrance into their side show sort of a diluted everything\nI certainly like a Senator Kennedy said turns of phrase the foothills of the ... is going to end up being a memorable phrase I I Do

joined us right now welcome Jonathan\nHi how's it going\nA good idea how do you feel about which Democrat Senator Chris Coons just said\nWell you know what's interesting is I I didn't find the allegation particularly critical but uh I did find it strange disconnect you know the Democrats came out and said that the accuser always\nI should be believe and I thought it was interesting that when ... got to the uh concluding line he said well the Republicans didn't leave\nHer eyes so it's a strange politics of\nA sexual harassment and the me too movement for democratic uh Coons was clearly signaling that he didn't believe these allegations otherwise he would have been objecting to the treatment but he prefers to say the Republicans didn't believe her or so there there's this weird environment where we're living in instead of just saying look\nSexual harassment have a right to be heard not to be believed I everyone has due process rights in fairness right but for some reason a lot of the Democratic members can't get themselves to say that 'cause they don't want to appear that they are or anything but totally in favor of\nThe me too movement and I think that ultimately this hurt the me too movement a bit uh I think that it's clear that this final allegation did undermine the previous to allegation\nCapital vote that he is not going to necessarily follow

because you're lost\nAn election meanwhile speaking of the part of the United states uh within the last ten minutes he was able to speak to some reporters before we got another chopper and rude to

was one of the most performers I've ever say\nWell here's here's a thing or the president probably we had a caller last hour to say the president should bring up\nThat all Democrats are bad we wants the old Democrats that he used to be he wants them part of the process he thinks that they can he can do what Reagan did they were Reagan Democrats they were simply word or else he wouldn't have one forty nine states Mondale won his home state in his reelection let me think about that that will never happen with anybody\nNow the price of the United states actually brought that up today let's go to the third or the second cut\nI think a lot of Democrats are going to vote Republican because I have many friends at the demographics of the main base of the Democrats if this so far\nLeft that will end up being done as well I Would end up being Venezuela\nI think a lot of Democrats are going to be voting Republican\nThat could happen and I think it'd be so smart to do or don't find the party vilify what is it has become I think that's the way to go the other point that I have today as we bring in mark ...\nOr the other point is mark on how you feel about this this could be a key turning point for debt for Republicans and Democrats\nBut I don't want Republicans I don't want democratic to vilify Joe Manchin I don't want Republicans vilify and Senator Murkowski you can go ahead and praise counts as a Republican but it don't attacker viciously him personally and threatened her or threatened to give her death threats because she didn't vote the way you want it\nAt the beginning this has to be beginning of civility and not want to see it in those three cases\nI think you're absolutely right Brian we we have got to remember that we elect people to make difficult decisions even if we don't disagree with the outcome they reach ... we have an a recourse for that that's called the ballot box and we can question it we can we can oppose it but these are human beings we to treat them that way all folks on all sides\nI think it is it time and the president said Murkowski is going to have problems but you should know more you are you going to need mccaskey for other initiatives you're going to need Collins further and issues if you're a Democrat you're going to need Joe Manchin to caucus with you if he goes Republicans you lose a seat if he goes independent you lose a seat\nIt doesn't behoove you to yelled shame in his face or a or ignore him in the halls and not include them in advance why don't people understand that\nWell and and I'll take one thing as as hopefully a sign of better things to come we didn't get a lot of coverage I Know Senator McConnell talked about it but at the same time we were going through these confirmation hearings and the bitter partisan nature of those\nYou also had the Senate passing with huge overwhelming bipartisan majority a bill to fight opioid addiction\nAnd so we can come together and get things done and we have to that's what that's the American people are trusting their elected officials to\nDo a Jen Psaki former White House communications director under President Obama\nHe's not over the fact she is not over the fact that counted and vote the way she wanted and she like many other Democrats want to make this men first woman issue men are in control men have too much power no one believes women cut ten\nIn Congress really struck a nerve for me and I think millions of women across this country including in Maine because she's trying to have it all away and you can't say somebody as credible and then completely question that story 'cause she struck a nerve to me and what she said and how she voted because that's political\nPower to 'em that is somebody who is pretending to be a feminist that that is fake feminist on\nTo pretend to be never said she was a feminist which he said is you listen to her speech it was very organized it made it was very linear and made total sense something happened to her but no one can corroborate the story so I don't want to destroy him why does that to be men verses women\n... you're exactly right and unfortunately we've seen this too many times that the left will will\nBasically did invite someone from their own definition of whatever it is they're talking about if they don't agree with you ... you saw how the left ... lost their mind when Kanye West said something nice about the president you see them calling Susan Collins a fake feminist\nWe we've got get beat on these kinds of labels and\nIt it just doesn't do our democracy any good\nYeah Mike Pence
