hear your show talking about the\nDon't say yes when someone calls and says can you hear me now until a week after it happened to me\nWhen we did happen to you\nRight film that that's what what's going on what happened was it was very fast so I really didn't have time to think much the phone rang I answered it\nAnd the voice said this is Joe or something like that from customer service can you hear me okay oh and I just you know you just kind of knee jerk I think yes and then I think as I recollect he went out and say something and I said I I said something like\n... who are you or something like that and that way immediately something's wrong well he didn't hang up\nOh you did not hang I hung up on him okay\nGot it suddenly dawned on me I thought wait a minute customer service where and I just said yes and\nI thought of those years ago how they used to talk about elderly people getting taken from magazines and things sure\nYes but I just thought oh well maybe I'm OK because he doesn't have my information I didn't talk to them but then I thought you know I heard your show and I thought ooh you know\nI said don't don't panic OK okay and and there are three steps I'm

they come in the mail or if you have online access and look for bogus charges okay we have a heightened risk bogus charges\nMaybe for as much as the next six months okay and the other thing is the thing with your phone bills with weather notice crayons where phony charges are put through on it\nAnd they will have a recording or you say yes that you want blah blah blah and you never heard that question but they have a yes to that question saying you wanted them to charge you know Nineteen Ninety five a month for horoscopes or whatever on your cell phone bill uh-huh so because your credit's

the fact that I was in public life are quite well um [noise]\nAnd ah of course she was in public life herself she was chairman of the school board and Salem um got elected to that she was chairman of the Republican Party of the state of New Hampshire before I got into politics\nWhile so I didn't know you guys going to be in Studio right away but I didn't know this and I am going to break format a little bit because you're from New and you're the governor ...\nI Am yes you know and I plan to be for a while yeah drug enough to uh\nBut there was a guy that was a guest speaker keynote speaker in New Hampshire but the Democratic party he is Alec Baldwin\nAnd he is an interesting choice to their little gym at least twenty five democratic candidates for president and they need New Hampshire and they need Iowa Denise South Carolina but Alec Baldwin hours after leaving the set is SNL mocking Donald Trump\nBurst your thoughts about the Democratic party picking him a shameful\nFrankly it really is I mean when you look at a an individual like that and his background you know I mean Democrats Maine's mainstream Democrats whether you're in New Hampshire or national really have to decide I are you going to going to stand up and want to work with folks and get things done or you're going to be part of this you know extreme fringe Hollywood liberal\nLeaders and that that comes out of there it it's not it's it's definitely not New Hampshire whether you're talking about Republicans Democrats independents were very purple state right so the fact that he comes up given a lot of the things that he set in the past the fact that they have someone like him headlining their party I think it's it's\nDisgraceful ... governor you got to a John I guess I don't feel\nComfortable I'm I'm just short of that show that he was out\nA little without boulders remarks which are just as ridiculous as you would imagine first what's worse than\nThe way we implement change the way we implement change in America is through elections we change governments here at home in an orderly and formal way and in that orderly and feminine way\nAn awful way we need to overthrow the government of the United states under Donald Trump [noise]\nYou know the Democrats love talking about dog whistles telling me that that overthrow is not a dog whistle to the mob\nOr that there has been assembled would Soros money across the country from what you saw in Portland what you saw in Washington\nOr during the Kavanaugh hearings all this insanity and and threats of violence than actual implementation of violence they've got to watch their language or something horrible it's going to happen the Democratic party has become the irresponsible party and and people don't understand that especially with only three weeks left in the election and\nChris or a governor um there's a sense that this is Donald Trump started it I'm going to play their side Donald Trump started with Israel looking ways since they got so beat and everybody was so surprised and they're watching these rallies they're saying we have to do that too that's what the people want or they missed reading him of\nCourse no of course look they're misreading America or it's what the people want it shouldn't be it it they have this mentality of us versus them us versus them whereas if you want to get something done you got to be able to work work with people and you got to be able to talk to a family or business or an individual and see what their struggles are find a way to implement a solution and simply get it done\nAnd that that's what people want and so I find that the folks especially in New Hampshire really they they want to meet you write we talk about retail politics knocking on the doors to talking one on one with folks they want to look in the I I'm I I tried to govern with retail management right we do the same thing what what is the need out there where did the system breakdown how do we make it better\nBut really focusing on that kind of stuff you get things done and at the end of the day I always think that's what's going to win out now in an election\nTwenty two days into the midterms which will be the Senate and house on the side there were twenty six governorships up Democrats seem to have the advantage here more Republicans are up a first off how do you approach that you don't really look for the national message right you look for that state miss most\nStates implement on their own and and when you look at the most popular governors in the country they're all Republican because they bring 'em a kind of those business ideals family ideals\nAre conservative ideals in terms of governing and implementing new ideas for for the citizens and and and they get results so the Republicans have a lot of seats to defend this time around or to to be sure but I have no doubt they're going to be successful because\nThe key is not letting the negativity the ugliness of Washington defined your constituency to to find the success that we're having a New Hampshire Charlie Baker savvy in Massachusetts or feel Scott Vermont or or you could go down the entire list you can't let that Nick negativity defined ourselves and governors do a great job of separating ourselves and focusing on results\nSo uh I I agree with Leslie Stahl said\nThat this president's really understanding the job more who could it's tough to anybody you be the most you could be a President Bush forty three and still watch your dad and the job watch Reagan and the job and still have an adjustment period

president he has learned how to take a little bit of the rough edges off\nUm he is I think is\nEven though I'm a his rhetoric cars still pointed and sharp I think it is it is less a it is more tolerable for some people than it used to me and I think he's made great how headway and I think if the Republicans managed to hold the house it will because\nThe because Donald Trump has been able to

I've asked secretary of my mom's house\nImmediately get on a plane and go to Saudi Arabia is there a place that would be probably\nWith regard to the show to hear that\n[noise] so he's talking about the the killing\nOf a ... and this looks like to kill him because he's disappeared for twelve days now and his fiance wrote an editorial today in the Washington Post I Believe of the wall Street Journal\nSaying that he went in to say we had a big day plans he was going to come and get his official divorce papers and we were going to get married and he did live in fear of its safety and he did think the Saudis headed out for him because they felt as though he left their prey he was riding negative things about the new revamped as Saturday a government\nAnd they the Saudis put out word that he was a he was sympathetic to the Muslim Brotherhood\nSo together he answered the answers air there's rumors about his apple watch recording the audio the shows he was interrogated tortured killed and cut up\nA distorting the New York times today say someone walked in there with the bones saw I don't know how they would know all this\nBut now they say uh the Saturday the Turkish officials are allowed to go in and investigate inside\nThe Saudi embassy inside turkey notice he didn't say he's going to see the crown prince whose evidently the person that thirty something year old Syracuse grad who evidently dad to everybody's tight with and that so much hope with when he did is American Tour they're going to see the king many people think\nThe king has a little bit of dementia going so that's going to open them up there's some criticism although it is kind of smart because let's go to the king if there's a problem but when the crown prince probably knows exactly what's going on\nSo the question is why did Saudi Arabia I think they can get away with this how could they a country like China who thinks they know America show will play something a misplaced something so bad Marco Rubio was on all the shows talking about this cut thirty seven\nAs far as arm sales I Would not have set up the way the president said it arms sales are important not because of the money but because it also provides leverage over their future behavior you know they don't need our spare parts don't need our training and those are things we can use to influence their behavior but I Would not take cutting that off off the table\nBut the problem is the president said listen I cut off the arms sales but why am I doing that to rate the on why am I doing it to Boeing because if we stopped we don't sell them arms and weapons and planes Russia and China do so why why did my hurting my industry because they might have done something terrible to what they were calling a Saudi citizen\nJonah Goldberg oftentimes Trump critic once again cut thirty four\nI Wish somebody would ask him okay so how many journalists with Saudi Arabia get to kill before you it might jeopardize that right I mean there's a problem with the rhetoric that's also a problem with the relationship\nAnd it makes a lot of sense to me or which is currently defensible to have a better relationship with Saudi Arabia to work this out as a counterweight to Iran all those things are fine or at least defensible\nBut has to be when you get into this situation it is clear no one communicated to Saudi Arabia that if we're gonna go down this path you cannot embarrass us or put us in a situation like this and so now we're at the stage where there are no really very good options um the White House\nA bind on this and it's because they went down this cul de sac to begin with without a proper line of communication someone when the Saudi Arabian government to believe that they could get away with it that this wouldn't be a problem and that's why it's a mess now\nNo I don't think anyone would say I do it's okay to go kill a journalist nobody would say that I think that's too big of a leap Jonah Goldberg one of the smartest\nMost insightful people around I agree with some of what he said be misinterpreted that it's okay but I think it's wrong to say that in a minute stretching anyone would say we can to not go kill you can go kill a journalist or columnist that you don't like\nNo way and by the way the president's been tough on rhetoric but he's being somewhat he's being reserved\nBecause he does not know what happened he cannot believe that they had this type of stupid judgment\nTo jeopardize relationships with the nation we need in the region and where the country they need we have the number one energy producer now they need to diversify the economy they need the American investment but yet they will put an\nOvert rich to take out a columnist because he had to do bad things to say about the Saudi Raleigh role family\nSued prison is keeping his powder dry but no he's going to be pushed to do something and he will and so Congress Republicans and Democrats would you have to understand when

also visited a disaster recovery command center getting the info about just how bad Georgia agriculture got slammed\nPedaling the sound of generational damage what does that mean that how long does it take to get that already\nIn place a federal disaster declaration for Georgia that ... started USB\nAdvocate Richard one oh one sixty nine degrees double directory meteorologist Kirk Melosh but it's cloudy skies overnight lows in the low sixties showers possible on Tuesday high Seventy six eighty one virus most accurate and dependable forecast kinda got help workers on the front line see more cases of flu here in Georgia\nYou Brian so do you notice the difference oh\nSure I'm among the other interviews that he did a I had one with him last week also\nAnd it is it is incredibly comfortable I think in the in the choices he is making and particularly I think when he goes out to these rallies and these enormous crowds that continue to grow\nUm I I think that really lift him I I I think they they give him confidence uh he said to me you know there's a lot of love and those people\nAnd I think that it it like all\nPresidents you know when you get out of the bubble and you get to to talk to people and hear them and see how they react to what you say even if it's just from a speech a I think you get a sense of where the\nCountry is and I think he feels very connected\nTo the heartland of the country and and to the voters who elected him he you know he says I I have kept my promise is I've actually done more than I thought I Would be able to\nAnd what is seeing gives him the confidence that this is the right course that that that are married and of course and you see the statistics whether it's this you know the stock market since he's been elected\nUh the unemployment rates for not just the country as a whole a but for the for African Americans Latino Americans for women I mean this is a boom this is a real economic boom we are experiencing and it is broad base it is not\nTrue that it's only benefiting or the wealthier people this is a true a growth a agenda for the\nMiddle class working class and I think the Kanye West thing is another example of Trump's breaking down barriers I I mean I don't know that Kanye West is going to lead a revolution of black Americans becoming more conservative\nBut I think the mere fact of what he's doing and the reaction is getting from some other black conservatives\nAnd the attacks that he's taking Kanye West is from black liberals tells you that there is there is movement think that the old the old a gridlock of group think a and a\nParty allegiance is breaking up you have the never Trump or just going crazier and crazier these are these are Republicans essentially conservatives on the other hand you have people like Kanye West coming over to the full so there's there's a real alignment\nGoing on with in the country which I happen to believe is very health very healthy for our republic because every vote but it's it's something that should be earned by every politician there should be no group identity with a party I mean I just believe that that has been a killer\nFor our country a couple of things he made it clear to us we saw\nThat I don't trust everybody around me that's working for me and that's what ... said do when she was in Africa and talked to ABC\nShe goes I don't see them you know we'll see we'll see this going to be some changes uh I think they would you see what he said about Madison was kind of interesting to a Chris Christie thinks it the Mattis was getting a message he was asked about the secretary of defense is as well he's more of a Democrat will see ... with the\nPresident managers and I think what he was doing there was something dramatic message\nWhich he when he was saying get out no no what do you think was if you want to get out now's the time if you don't think it'll twenty twenty\nI think that's the message he was sending to matter that I I liked him I think he's a good guy we get along great we had lunch all the positive things might be a Democrat maybe is going to leave everybody's coming back the way the president managers George and that's when he managed the Trump Organization that's what he's managed his White House for two years when\nHe's right right\nYeah look I think I think the president or as you said earlier Bryant has gotten more comfortable I mean you go back to you think of that White House or Sean Spicer\nWorth a Steve Bannon with Gary Cohn I mean people who weren't really even McMaster people who are you know sort of all cobbled together because the president was such an outsider that he had no sort of government on the shelf as most presidential candidates to forget for rock Obama\nTook a lot of Bill Clinton's people uh\nGeorge Bush took a lot of the Reagan people on his father's people uh everybody needs some government to start with Donald Trump had no government to start with I think gradually he's an outsider keep cobbled together administration six months later he changed it\nA and he continues to change it I think if she gets more comfortable and and as as look these jobs don't people can't stand\nThem forever I mean there there's a lot of these jobs are burnout jobs not everybody can has the stamina of Donald Trump but I think I think he is getting a government that matches his personality and his policies\nYeah I think you're right so what other things did you gleaned that maybe didn't appear in your column about the president when you were with them you've you've known him for years\n... yes look I I think that they um you know the issue of who he will run against is is of course very much a on his mind in twenty twenty I mean he I think obviously he he believes the crowds are a good sign for the midterms\nJob but we talked we talked about a Hillary Clinton book tour for example Hillary and Bill Clinton he said he said he he doesn't think it's going to help the Democrats at all things are going to hurt the Democrats and he relishes the idea of running against Elizabeth Warren whom of course he calls Pocahontas\nOf of Cory Booker he thinks that Democrats are going so far left\nThat there'll be unrecognizable by twenty twenty\nAnd you think you'd want Hillary per rematch\n... he doesn't think she was going to run he said it was ... he doesn't think it's likely I disagree with him on that I think she wants to run and I think this speech speak speaking tour with her husband\nIs all about testing the waters without having to announce is keeping her front and center there'll be out there raising money by selling tickets she's got her little slush fund already that she's a raising money with called onward together I think she's setting up a potential rematch\nHe's saying he's saying not persuaded of that uh although he does think that her going out there is bad for Democrats but why should going out there I mean she doesn't need the money I think she's going out there\nTo test the waters to see if there's any receptive to her candidacy again uh outlook as I as I said before Brian\nShe is kind of default nominee until somebody knocks or off and I don't know who that can be right now [laughter] I just don't think any of the Democrats we hear 'em there has any kind of a national\nFollowing you have that make that may happen soon but as of now none of them have a national following the way she does\nSo I think the most part is the president ready starting to bulk up with a replacement for Don McGahn I understand it's going to be official soon but does he ready poor light if the Democrats get the house\nI'm going to be a tough situation for him um I I'm I think the you know he's clearly hoping that if they do take it will be a small measure\nBut I think that ah the crowds that each generation you know when he goes out there he's talking about both the Senate and the house I think they're picking the districts that they think are winnable or the Senate looks pretty good at this point for Republicans\nBut the house has a problem I don't I don't get a sense\nThat he has given up on it but but I think that he is concerned that ah it's gonna be hard to get things done and I think part of what you're saying with his attacks on the Federal Reserve\nIs very much in keeping with that that the economy is so important to his re election to this fall that the that ... when I spoke to him was in that swooning of a couple of days or with the stock market and he was out there saying nice and I said to me too that\nYou know they don't know what they're doing they're making my job harder and he compared it to the European Central bank the Chinese banks which which basically are funding these deficits for their governments to to the central banks to be accommodating he said you know they're much more accommodating but those are our competition\nSo our job is harder and harder than American businesses\nAnd so I think he's very attuned to the political impact of everything he says and does it\nVery interesting and what about uh what about in the in the big picture he wants to go out and he wants to campaign he wants to nationalize this whole election\nUh in terms of in terms of where we're at right now as a a as a race I think it's a very interesting to see a lot of experts not willing to guarantee that the house is going to go to the Democrats here is Loni Jen uh the Hoover Institute on meet the press got twenty\nMid term elections are a lot about convincing voters more than that you stand to lose what if you stand to lose and and for Republicans the pitches a Democratic Senate gets elected you're going to lose these judges for Democrats if you have a Republican Senate gets elected you're going to lose Obamacare\nAnd that's why the pitch has focused in on judges and health care so thoroughly and I think the challenges in in some of these days you know Arizona Nevada you're starting to see the race creed away from Democrat and it's happened in a slow but steady massive in Nevada jak euros and the Democrat has not been had had an a public pool since the end of September\nIn Arizona you back here in cinema all this opposition research coming out on her recently being out of touch with Arizona so these races are creeping away but the met a narrative here is really about what do you stand to lose and I think Republicans have prosecuted that case effectively\nCases around the state and I urge you to get your flu vaccination a woman's dad her husband

I had my taxes the biggest\nTax cutting history actually the biggest tax cutting history's first first tax reform in three decades it's\nA huge accomplishment but it's not the biggest tax cutting history I mean he's got all the these are sort of you know you're you're you're in New York or I'm In New York it's sort of New York everything the biggest the best of New York you know he he\nTends to exaggerate says stuff like that in faith in the same things quite frankly that you know he's not sure of are untrue they don't have a big fact checking department in the White House like in the speechwriting shop the way they did when I was when I was working there but\nThe main barometer of presidential honesty in my view at least do I think truthfulness is important in all aspects but the main problem in the presidential honesty is does the president keep those promises and by that\nStandard he's probably the most honest president we've had in modern times I mean if you just go down the line of the things that he promised during the campaign and delivered on me take just like you know he move the embassy to Jerusalem three previous presidents all promised to do that not one of them came through he did it\nHe promised to destroy ISIS there now launching the operation on the last uh on the last section of their of their caliphate and when that city has taken in a in an Iraqi Syrian border the Calif it has\nGone a he promised to impose a travel ban I'm not a fan of the travel ban personally but he said he was going to do it he did it\nUh you know he ... he kept Obama's promise of the you know that it's Syria's chemical weapons that are he'd he'd he'd he'd do something about it and I'm like my mom uh he actually did he promised to put Supreme Court justices like ... in this ... we've got two of them he promised to transform the bench with the way he's confirmed twenty nine\nAh the appellate court justices with most of any president in history a tax reform regulatory roll back you just go down the line or even on trade again in an area where I'm not I'm not a fan of terrorists I think terrorists or a bad idea but\nHe promised that during the campaign and he's doing it so you just have to go go down the line of everything you said for better or for worse something from a lot for the better some for the worst he's doing exactly\nWhat he said uh so that's you know that's it that's the standard that most Americans care about the most\n... also you can you say hey I got to redo NAFTA he'd read NAFTA and the south Korea we did that he said the European Union been ripping us off he's got a framework to redo that\nAnd I'm going to hook up China in the beginning I thought wow he's kind of backing off a little bit well he was for a while and now not any more to the point where the pressure is so great it's affecting the market and he says I'm not even ready to speak to to a chairman or or president chi right now so this is what he's doing\nAnd I mean look he's got his son deals as you say with Mexico Canada and South Korea he read those uh he's close to getting a deal with the European Union China's gonna be a much tougher\nNut to crack because it's not just tariffs its industrial policy there where they're subsidizing are all sorts of sectors where we can't compete and also there's there's intellectual property theft so that's going to be the hardest thing but one of the things also is that you know the U.S economy under Trump\nIs booming and the rest of the world is slowing and so I think he figured out that we've got a built in advantages right now that we can sustain\nA showdown on trade in a way that some of our trading partners trading partners are trading adversaries in the case of some of these countries can't and so you know if your economy slowing a and all of a sudden Trump put tariffs on you that's going to put a lot more of a squeeze on you whereas in the United states if they're going we're doing so well right now that we could we could we\nAbsorb a some terrorists for a short period of time in order to in a showdown and they're going to in a game of chicken they're going to blink uh so that's what he's doing but I mean ... you know and even in the areas where he hasn't kept his promise like building the wall or repealing Obamacare he's been trying\nA you know the because of democratic obstruction that he hasn't done that and then you know in the food too rare instances where he has backtracked like you know he promised during the campaign to pull all our troops out of Afghanistan he actually studied the issue very carefully if you read the Woodward book it's actually very comforting the process by which he went through or yes really tough questions the salary\nAnd and he can he concluded that he was wrong and that was that's that's\nGood or bad is said to him with that is said to me was Mr President matter what you accomplished in your term if there was another attack coming from Afghanistan he pulled the troops out that's all anyone ever remember and that's where it hit home with him\nOf forgotten America today because the ... can Republicans are ... Trump is just trying to wrap up the all the ... elections used to be ... you get your base energized and then you're going to go out and try and persuade the persuadable right\nNobody's trying to persuade persuadable anymore it's just about at the ... the leftist throwing you know we're going to destroy Brett Kavanaugh and accused him of gang rape and we're going to destroy these people and get their people fired up we gotta we gotta impeach Trump and then Trump is out there saying we're going to destroy the Democrats and get it through red mistakes to his crowds\nAnd nobody in the ... is trying to go out there and and and when the people over in the middle\nAnd so they're the real forgotten Americans and there's so much support sitting on the floor waiting to be picked up if\nDonald Trump which would just try to do to win those people over there is no reason his support should be in the forties right now with his record the economy the way it is and it's just it's a tragedy for somebody like me who who wasn't a huge Trump supporter but wants him to succeed who wants them to be successful want the president has said it's very frustrating that he doesn't try\nMark Thiessen thanks so much that gift maybe listen to one eight six six eight seven six six not\nJealous steady for your brain it's Bryan kill made [noise]\nHe was not he by five and a um ... the double you asked me a\nCake one atom of nitrogen bonded with one atom of oxygen boom you just created nitric oxide the miracle mile ... your own body makes the fuel your cardiovascular will help keeping you vibrant\nBut as we all age your body's need help generate more natural nitric oxide super beach by human has harness the power of nutrient rich beach and created a super food\nThat helps your body make more nitric oxide on its own the core philosophy of human is to develop heart healthy products for your body one teaspoon of super beach daily support your cardiovascular health and blood pressure levels giving you\nNatural energy without the need of a quick caffeine kick or sugar high we're talking real\nHealthy natural energy so called eight hundred five point one twenty by sixteen to go to Brian speech dot com and find out how you can get a thirty day supply of super beach and free shipping with your first purchase\nField but one plus one equals boom affective super beach called eight hundred five for one twenty five sixteen we'll go to Brian speech dot com today\nHi I'm Joan London when I needed to find senior care for my mom I really struggled to find the right fit until I found an advisor who had been through that before\nPlace for him on the nation's largest senior living referrals ...\nWho will help you at the right question and find the right place\nTo place Vermont today\nTo speak with a local senior living advisor column place mum on at the number two to five nine three zero six that's eight hundred two to five nine three zero six\nVermont has helped over two hundred thousand families find the right in your care for their parents benefits and living too independent living even all pirate care\nHave a local in ... that can help explain your options at no cost you\nTo speak with a local senior living advisor collar placed Vermont and eat on average two to five nine three zero six\nThat's eight hundred due to five nine three zero six calls today\nHard guys this place is in shambles\nOne of the strongest hurricanes to ever hit the U.S three thousand houses without power in the state of Georgia right now the storm steam rolled through Georgia and do you make\nEggs I said the government to round the clock was amazed talking about for decades to Atlanta's news traffic as the beer weather station news ...

Twenty one days will determine you know whether it's small or medium I don't think it's going to be said on me\nBut you know people who say there's going to be a red wave okay we'll we'll see but I doubt it because it [laughter] that's that's not what even Republican\nOr polls were private tracking polls are showing\nA when you say okay I'm going to go back to the lease actually thing about it and that's the governor's race as we know ah when it comes to the governor's twenty six governorship syrup I N Dems had the advantage so first off why do you think that the Democrats are going to have a take some of these Midwestern states\nWell there's a there's a classic a blowback or flip back that's happening that often occurs in mid term elections\nYou had normally democratic states like Michigan uh like Pennsylvania Wisconsin has been more democratic than not you you had Iowa was another example Ohio\nYou had a these these states in Ohio and I really normally democratic the other ones are you have them going I'm more Republican for Trump and twenty sixteen and they often return\nTo their original voting inclination in a midterm election this happens in both parties depending on who's operating and who's controlling the White House so I think that's a that's what his\nDoing it for the governorships and the fact that Republicans as you mentioned have twenty six\nOf the governorships Democrats have only nine it's exactly the mirror opposite of the Senate where Democrats are defending twenty six seats\nAnd Republicans are only defending nine it helps to be defending less territory it helps to ah to be the opposite party a controlling the White House in the mid term election\n[noise] uh yes and some of the big stories I think he's going to be first off on the Florida Senate race Bill Nelson and Senator Scott\nA choose me Governor Scott he wants to be Senator Scott now do you believe that this is going to be an action based election where you're gonna watch Scott again in the ... doing something he's been pretty good at and that's reacting to a natural disaster which is this hurricane that will help\nI actually see the mayor of Tallahassee are doing a little bit more Gillum then I Do this at this as the next governor I don't see dissent does anywhere\n[noise] yeah I think the saved his his campaign needs a shake up where they needed to shake the candidate up one way or the other but on the Senate race it it's very very close and you were right to point to the hurricane because\nUh and it's horrible to talk about a disaster like that in political terms but that's what political analysts do and clearly it's helping Scott because he's in the news every day he's down they're\nSurveying the damage and trying to fix the damage US Senators can come up with money you know they can pass and appropriations agenda or something like that but they can't they can't actually be doing what a governor's doing so that's a natural advantage for Scott\nI'm I wanted to go to or the other Senate races number one in Arizona mix Sally in cinema\nI think they make salad just dump pure merit is going to pass some of the edge she's running a phenomenal and they just highlight what she's done she was the first female fighter pilots he's been in Congress been affected she's a good communicator and from actually from Arizona so I mean I look for her to pull away to your polls reflect that\nWell I'm going to know more than flying to Phoenix today and I'll be there tomorrow and I certainly want to take a closer look at that Senate race I think that's a really close when ... and ... Nevada to western states currently controlled by Republicans those are\nThose are really really close races and I wouldn't I don't want to say until I see 'em up close\nBut what about that can help my show I'm not I didn't want my today on\nYour show is not my priority just rang and you went to monitor cello and I didn't see you you were in this area over your system\nYour sister did contact me on friday and unfortunately I was out of town but you gave me no notice when I should have been a priority but who cares really who cares what the president said about about something ...\nAbout a very long behind us you know who cares\nIt doesn't matter who care so I'm not going to hold that against you very long\nWell I was in mind that show for Fox Nation beginning a seven o'clock in the morning tour so I could do my teacher before even the Jefferson family woke up still saying there do they stay with me how they do\nThey stay with me on the lawn have comfortable more comfortable accommodations monitor cello you know it's just so wild so many people like you come there\nRight uh and I went to a ... row with you I think it's really important going to make sure that besides that that's the work of the slaves or they kept that plantation going which was what five thousand acres hadn't seen it in about they said they have about two two point five now\nYes and I'll tell you one reasons I'm convince other the genes why\nThomas Jefferson live to for them the ripe old age of eighty three was because he ate so much a fresh fruit fresh fruit fresh vegetables grown\nUp there in ... I mean it was for the time just outstanding it was a better diets that almost anybody had he was also a near vegetarian I bet you didn't know that\nNo I did not know that I had it but how did you on the air for that's always a who drank every day and was about sixty pounds overweight it looks like some some of the sketches we don't have any photographer she was\nNot overweight at all he was slim and trim\nJohn Adams God I oh I thought you meant to Thomas\nJefferson somebody had to John Adams live so long\nOh John out yeah well John Adams lives so I guess it was genes I don't know maybe he ate will too but you're right he ate too many fatty foods and too much\nCarbide right but they didn't know about that back then yeah like the overly critical\nI won't be my last thing was hit by a by say they like to the same story the election was today or the Senate stays there how splits\n[noise] yeah I think the Senate stays I think Republicans could even pick up a seat or two in the house I Would say probably it goes over the twenty three I'm not going to save definitely and I'm certainly not going to put a number on it until we\nGet closer to election day because as we all know lots of October surprises unfold even up to election eve we saw that in the twenty sixteen and we may see it again\nThis year is the prison helping or hurting with his rallies\nOh well he's helping a lot in the Senate because he's going to deeply red conservative states which will determine who's controlling the Senate and whether Republicans pick up seats so I didn't notice that's where he's focusing mainly although he did go down and try to help my former student Andy bar there and\nAnd Kentucky's a tough race for reelection and I you know he got an egg in my class and the bar did he did and that's something for you to aspire to write I'm\nEyes ... classes they're always sold out\nTargeting Asian Indian families in precise Fulton and going at counties\nYour ZIP Code is being used by insurance companies to determine how much they can charge you for auto coverage\nA contract extension will keep manager Brian Schmidt gr and the Braves dugout for at least the next two years\nWe were shut out the Dodgers to go up to games to one and the national league championship series Red Sox an Astros game three of the A.

footage\nOr we're going to ask the king not the crown prince\nAnd he might have been real killers that's what everyone's running what what do you mean real killers Bret Baer joined us special report hey bread did the president helping fill up this morning\n[laughter] what what he did was talking about a conversation that you had with the king hum and I think just relaying with the king told him now\nThere is that by the time I I don't know obviously sending sector stayed over there to talk to you directly or the king and the ground friends um you know the intelligence community may enlightened is a little bit more about what they have or don't have when it comes to evidence\nYeah we'll see a real killers it seems that everyone is saying what do you mean by rote killers but but you know bread she's not that simple I mean you if you if you just decide I'm going to break up the relationship with Saudi Arabia you've lost your counterweight to a run\n[noise]\nYeah I mean there has to be a standing up of values um you know and I think that that's where this is really a tough thing um\nYou know sometimes you are dealing with bad characters that said um this is pretty brazen and pretty stupid\nIf every way every way it's stupid if somebody hit this uh thinking that somehow it wasn't going to\nGet a figure it out or I\nMean this is a really dangerous thing for the Saudis to have done should they have done it\nHere are my morale weighed in on\nCBS and here's what he said about what the Turks are saying about what they picked up off the apple watch and what the other picked up maybe with the surveillance video Katrina\nI think the Turkish narrative is more compelling um because they say they have evidence um and there's the ... the Saudis have done no explanation so I think that is more compelling and that's where most people have gone but but the bottom line or is that we still don't know what happened inside that constantly\nAnd when Bob Corker told us this on friday cut thirty two\nWe've had our alliance with them but\nLook it's a it's going to be hugely damaged and uh I Know that Congress there at the lowest point\nWith Congress that they've ever ban

this point I Would not be successful in that on the floor to die and I I don't know that I Would even attempt\nTo be successful I probably am now moving in another direction with them\nAnd right now the you know the crown prince said he says for the last year and a half the Saturday she's been acting very arrogant and that really coincides with when the crown prince came here to do was a media tour with the press and let everybody know it's a new day in Saudi Arabia it might not be a new day\nYeah and listen I'm Saudi Arabia spread a lot of money are chronic money around Washington and the\nBiggest indicator that they have serious serious problems is that some of those firms on K Street are now saying you know what we don't want the money and I'm just knowing what they know not even knowing the full story the whole\nTurkish apple watch things seems a little far fetched a turkey might as well just admit that they had the conflict bug and come forward with the evidence\nAnd um and show somebody because that's how you get to the bottom of it perhaps that's why ... jury on players going over there to look at the Saudis in the eye and maybe meet with the Turks\nAre we talking about bread bear a bread uh right now we're looking at the map and not many people are saying that the Senate is even in play anymore what a difference from Labor Day and now the house is not locked
