S. B. paint on it [noise]\nGood morning and welcome to business in the black with the wand a black\nMorning thank you for coming back to the show you now um Atlanta has been\nDeemed one of the leading\nA city or sex trafficking and ... as they say it is right in front of our faces and we don't see it we don't recognize that is what's happening\nFulton County commission chair Rob pitch joined us this morning because he has organized a sex trafficking taskforce right here in Atlanta so that we can all be a part of this so I could I mean that's that's something that land that does not with a title we don't want right commissioner\nThat's absolutely right in fact you write a it's a land but it's also more than Atlanta's fully county and the\nMan we're we're recognized\nAround the world is probably one of the top spot in the world for sex trafficking and people don't believe it when I tell them\nYeah it's the fact is crazy so\nI don't know a lot of great that may have added a\nBlack mark on us and I am determined to eradicate that like Mark\nWhat tell us about what you doing this task force that you've created\nWell when it was first brought in my kitchen how serious the problem is a actually a Leslie grab a member of the Atlanta\nA school board that involves the we're talking she said you know less than three or four foot ball fields so we are office girls young girls she had a loving twelve Thirteen fourteen years old\nAnd sometimes boys it'd be traffic and you got to be get it and I said well we have to\nDo something about this now made a decision right man to call to gather a group of people who work in a combat this problem for some time to chat with the gas for some of it when we met as less I'm not interested\nIn a study this study but uh you guys are the experts I Want to know what we what can we do right now you begin to tackle the problem in the first day it came out one of the members said well the first thing we can do is to force the law that's already on the book mhm\nI was not aware of a law last rape or wherever the law but chicken ladder is backing toy Fifteen state of Georgia passed a law uh\nAnd it required some Fifteen different types of establish supposed to have signage posted\nIn front of their status plus any restroom including government buildings we didn't have it at a folk jolly city doesn't have a state of Georgia doesn't have it and the businesses that were required I said well that's the first thing that we ought to do\nWe\nI went to our bathrooms about did find one sign that was just on a piece of white papers Iraq sucked give it a wall\nAlong with with Scott state ...\nAbout this can't be so we really did sign and put them all over every bathroom throughout all the Johnny ... buildings\nAnd began to make a make some progress now problem at Fulton County is that a sense now if you live in full gamut you live in one of the fifty a city we can't tell the city's what\nTo do Mm So what we do they'll still have control over there at one part in the south for county uh that's known as a photon industrial district we control everything there so we got without police chief and say OK chief\nThis is the law if shall we have to do she for thirty eight businesses that are required to have the signage\nWe we uh maybe it was signed a met with the business owners enter their credit every business in a in a every effect does it affect you required to have to find a job in that part of south for the county\nNow of each one has a sign as good as are signs up\nThe dishes that uh because of the publicity that uh we were able to generate\nUnder the leadership of ALS along a fellow Willis\nIn a new city itself ... they now have a very aggressive campaign going they call it you know hey sign saves signed it but it's going up all over the a new city of Sao Fulton that's my area do\nYeah mhm okay that your gum is for the council on Gordon she's taking up the battle there a year this shit is following in live in Iowa or mhm yeah a lot of a city of a of a Alfa reta is going to is the law\nIs just what happened was that uh people want to wear of it\nAnd the other hand I mean we've done at the Fulton County I don't\nLot but there's a lot a lot to be okay or\nThe other thing that we are we what was missing from state law restaurants were not included\nConvenience stores are not included in gas faces when not included\nSo it Fulton County we amend that law from Fulton County point of view but again you can mine we only have control over that one little section in South for yeah but we've added those were at a gas station convenience stores in a restaurant\nSo come January will be asking him to the state legislature to add those so that it will be a part of the state law as well\nWell what I'm saying is there one of the science well\nIt says that if you're a big traffic here's what you did yeah\nYeah and it gives you a number to call and and so that's a first step ... the next thing we did I say well okay we need to get the word out even\nMore so I called up on a friend of mine a job as a well know advertise mhm I can\nHear us to do with money but I Need you to do something right away pro bono is it okay I got it\nAnd he developed the camp a forced me to be a cap a TV spot and uh\nThat's been rowdy on a sheet TV station F. G. T. V. now and that's a very good spot very classic spot and the great news is we've been meeting with CNN and they're grown apart and it was a should have a a several\nAnd that'll be displayed an airport and ... maybe even the world so we're making a lot of progress last lady uh uh\nYou've probably seen around town uh outdoor billboard campaigns as well they've joined in with us and say that we just aren't going to tolerate this before said last I'd be going to be that this was going to be an ongoing effort for us\nDoing consistently working even\nAfter you didn't win the competition we want to talk to you and that's really how I ended up with let's eat like me and was like she's still working at the ... and that's the thing I got better over time a lot of times people like I should be famous I was on a reality show right now I'm\nThis it takes time like I can look at myself back then and say I needed work back then when I was on TV\nNow you if that confidence and you grow with that but it's all a journey so whatever people are trying to do it you can't just jump out there and say I'm going to be starving\nRight now are it's not going to laugh at it sure was not going there is no longevity\nWith that so you take the bumps in the bruises but you get to that final point and you can actually have a story to tell behind it and inspire people to do it\nSo I'm In the ground I think it's\nAmazing your whole story is amazing tell us about the food network out oh let's eat\nWell it's it's such a great show I describe it as the most delicious thirty minute he will have in your

Clark Howard show how are you doing\nGood how can I serve you\nWell thank you for taking my call I really think the show for a long time\nWell I'm Glad to have you here\nThank him and twenty five years old and I don't have any ... other than like ... ... or ... and I make about forty five a year and my question is can make Jean line by that he is a test\nOr ... out of ... going fine until they each have okay tied anything can happen at that and there's nothing guy he could fall back on my ... it had to have paid off\nAnd said the only way thinking about how quickly we seem to have to go and lift off at in\nAnd said that left ... when my question is why it\nWow how interesting so if your parents were to pass away and they own a home free and clear and you're trying to come up with how are you going to have enough money to support your young brother you are a real sweetheart to be more of trying to come up with the solutions for this good\nFor you in care so the idea of at time of your parents passing to turn the home into a rental property that I guess you would manage for the money hanging a benefit to your brother I think\nThat that may be unduly complicating the situation where what I Would think would make more sense is to sell the home\nAt the time that your parents might pass away and besides we don't know unless your parents or an extreme failing health they could be with us for decades to come right\nRight so so that possibility of the home being a potential answer for your brother it's just too hard to say that right now\nSo I like the idea of better of your parents instructing and there will that if you are to be the executive tricks that the ...\nIt'd be sold and the proceeds be put into a trust that you manage for the benefit of your brother\nWell okay\nAnd that way you you have no idea what's going to be going on in your life all the years later hopefully your parents are going to live a long long time and who knows what circumstances will be at the time they would no longer occupy the house no longer be on this earth\nAnd so there there's more flexibility if you didn't have money that you then have available to see that the care of your brother\nOkay yeah we can think about that and now like that that fail it probably a ... that guy down there and I guess I started out we had that as an option that ... it into she chaired by you know\nWhat you can do some things right now potentially for the advantage of your brother they can set up what's known as a um five twenty nine ABLE account\nA buddy Holly this is an account for children or dependence have special needs of some kind of grown and so it's an account to your parents\nCan contribute fourteen thousand dollars maximum to each year and the money can then turn around and grow tax free\nFor your brother's benefit and then when the money is spent on his needs and care than the money is spent what's in it and all its earnings tax free\nOh these are new accounts and if your parents have looked at this stuff before they may not even be aware that this is a new opportunity for people to put money aside for a child who has a you can be various types of special needs\nNo farm okay yeah we didn't know that that would that would make great\nDo you think your parents can't afford to put aside that kind of money for your brother each year\nNow and now I don't think they can\nOkay All right so let's talk about one other possibility either your mother your father or either both of them in good health\nYeah than X. not how\nSo another way that people funding needs for a child that they're worried about when they're gone is to buy of life insurance policy where the proceeds have better paid into a trust for the benefit of your brother\nOkay\nAnd that is a relatively low cost way to take care of your brother's needs in the future\nAnd to keep it simple your parents would ah in the insurance policy that they would each by they would name you is the trustee and you would administer the trust\nBecause then it's a whole lot cheaper than if you hire a third party like a bank to handle this for a for your brother\nIn fact well that sounds like a plan in Keystone line\nAnd if you're here in a certain part of any association for autistic children if they are in any support group there'll be people in their who've done this stuff that\nWe're talking about and we'll be able to be of some help to them likely\nOkay fine yeah you have to go ... miles on it than that\nBut you got a lot going on in your own life but I'm so proud of him no debt and you own your own home at twenty four yes\nIt's great that is wonderful how you're handling your finances Robert's with us on the Clark Howard show hello Robert\nHello Clark thanks for taking my call\nSure you want to talk about life insurance\nI Do I Do I'm I'm sixty one years old Clark I've been paying on this policy sense so true which is roughly almost forty thousand dollars I'm at the air we have longevity in my family which uh if I go to Ninety One\nI'll have a total of about a hundred and twenty thousand dollars into a hundred and fifty thousand dollar life I'll see\nExcept for you not in a participating one where the actual cash value will rise overtime above the stated amount\nNo it will not rise above the state or amount\nNo\nReally correct so you know hey over those decades a total and it would equal roughly Seventy five percent of the face amount of the policy\nThat's correct that sounds like a pretty lousy policy yeah it [laughter] yes I Believe it is and that's really why that I met the eight hour\nYou know we won't need those benefits we don't eat those benefits at this time we have resources that are ... you know more of a substantial pay for any funeral expenses so my question was does it come to the point where I cashed out to just get term insurance level term\nOr just continue our\nI'm going to give you a process where you'll know exactly what to do with it exactly have enough money at stake you want to do what I'm about to tell you\nOkay there is a nonprofit organization called the consumer federation of America has a service that evaluates existing life insurance policies or they'll be able to tell you with the exact precision\nIf you should keep this policy dump it converted borrow against it\nIt out what would be the right move for you and it's pretty involved what they do so it costs a hundred and twenty five dollars for them to do evaluation but compared to the money you have a stake that slapstick\nAgree I agree\nSo I'm going to give you a website you can go to that is a dedicated Web site to this from the consumer federation of America where you can see exactly what documentation you've got to get together for them to run the full analysis for you\nVery good\nWebsite is a value weight life insurance dot org\nOkay\nAnd they're basically only charging you what their time costs is to do it because this is a non profit\nOn

their parents did\nAnd then where people in America are living as well or better than their parents did\nAnd I tell you particularly last decade when we had the banking scandals and the great recession immediately following when I Would give speeches I Would ask\nWho thinks their kids are going to have a better life and they had who thinks they're going to have a worse like well those were very pessimistic days but overwhelmingly people would say that their kids were going to have a worse life economical even they had\nAnd that is not how it's worked out overall in America\nKids continue generally have better economic success than their parents have had\nBut there's a clear divide and it was also clear geographically generally in the southeast\nKids are not doing as well as their parents\nIn the mid west kids are doing much better economically than their parents which is interesting if you think about the years that the mid west or suffered to as the rust belt and all that and lack of jobs and everything\nBut what was clear looking around the country and I just gave two examples there the dividing line was absolutely education\nThat in areas of the country where there's a big emphasis on education kids do significantly better than their parents have done economically\nIn areas the U.S in the southeast more than most anywhere else\nEducation is not valued as much and going to college not nearly as valued and college participation rates in a number of southern states or some of the lowest in the United states\nKids do not have the economic mobility or economic success of their parents\nCollege is not for everybody and it's not even necessarily about college but it's about going on to technical school state supported technical school trade school where you learn skills that are in demand in the marketplace\nBut in an economy that now demands more and more knowledge and skill\nIt's not getting the education\nIs what creates what's known by a condom is\nBy the awkward and terrible phrase downward mobility I don't want that phrase they have to be used I Want your kids to have upward mobility that is what you want them to have and so I encourage you to encourage your kids wherever you live in the country\nTo understand the importance of education and training\nTo get into a career and education and training threw out there working lifetime so they have more economic mobility and more economic success\nDiane is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Diana how are you doing\nAre going to get better invite\nAll right well I Hope
