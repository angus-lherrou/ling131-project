us to get him it's high time in the tax payers now\nWhat's going on Trump's ministry ... that the Republicans have refused to look into a and I think that if they do take the house one of their

mandates or store and you know if the Democrats\nAnd you listen to all the investigations you went on a Jared Kushner a and WhatsApp conversations I don't even know what that's about what's that about\n[noise] well Jared Kushner the reporting from the intelligence to me as we know a lot of people a lot of things have been a leak out about the Trump Administration bite from within the administration out of concern\nAnd so you know we saw leaked out from the um and I say\nHis revealing of classified information to the Russians in the oval office a ... there is concern that the purge that um that uh the crown prince um\n[noise] the purge that he conducted right after he met with Jared Kushner in Riyadh for um\nThis big visit last year where they stayed up all night and they you know they they forge disclosed relationship that concern in the intelligence community at the time was that I shared with communicating with him not through the proper official channels but through um\n... conversations off line on one up um and that can be hidden obviously and that perhaps he might have shared intelligence from the presidential daily brief which motive helps the crown prince know who had been disloyal to him because the purge took place within a few days\nAgo the Trump Organization has ties to Saudi Arabia\nTrump Organization I mean the Trump President Trump has done business with Saudi kingdom many many many times he doesn't he likes to say that he doesn't have any projects in Saudi Arabia but um they have bought from him they still owned the government still owns a floor in Trump Tower and it's it's\nIt it ... if anybody was in the presidency obviously if Hillary Clinton was there I Would be screaming for this I don't care who Obama W the list goes on everybody needs to know what they were both financial relationships are between our commander in chief from foreign governments as they try to protect us and conduct foreign policy\nAnd you give me a agree blueprint of how this would be because what happens is is president who's so unorthodox in many ways in a typical in many ways also is an international business person so when he is Saudi Arabia goes to rent the poor in Trump Tower years ago he's not even running for president\nSo that and that is why if maybe maybe an examination of this completely exonerate salmon it's fine he doesn't have current ongoing financial interests with them but if he does that is a real issue\nI and I think people should know that that that's all I'm saying ah you know if if the Trump Organization through through Eric and John junior continues to do business um that has had ties and may have current ties and we're not entirely\nCertain um but all those monuments cases you know the people are bringing as the president and ... those have them all listed you can go to cruise website you know but that's a that's a concern that they never separated from interests with aren't connected to foreign governments and that foreign governments obviously Brian would be interested in trying to buy influence\nBut as I told you I promise I Will give him credit I I gave him credit when he said he would take on and on the n._r._a. and then he flipped\nUm I gave him credit I gave him\nThe most I ever given him was when he invited the Parkland families the victim's family is into the White House and sat there with and they all could have screamed at him and he did the right thing he he let on that issue and Chile buckled\nAnd any buckled after people like Tucker and everyone everyone around him for saying he was going to take on the n._r._a. and he was going to take the\nGuns or wherever he went to our whatever he said it\nSo I'm you know the bill of love I've heard a lot of promises and I'm going to give him credit if he comes in the middle of Joe that I Am\nAnd this is my prediction ab if he does more town halls in purple areas then uh then rallies in red areas at least for the first six months a year of his thirty I think he he would do it I think that'd be great advice if he was asked me to go\nA mayor absolutely he has to come out and persuade people that don't support him he's

that's that's a total distortion and I think it it really does show that uh\nThe the hatred for President Trump knows no limits I mean this is\nThis is a sorry moment in America this is a horrible tragedy that speaks to a a deep seated evil and to try to politicize are to blame the president for it I think just shows how far are politics have strayed from the original purpose I mean this has nothing to do with\nAnything anybody said this is like saying the guy has leprosy it's somebody's fault I mean this is insane talk\nOr you don't think either a van to the the fake bombs mailed to Trump painters or and or or disagree here's a and this incident you don't think it's going to affect them in terms of why\nWell look I I think it could I mean I\n... the headline is you know goes a little further that I Would prefer but I think that the odds are\nThat it will not reshape the mid term set the terms are on a trajectory right uh I mean I think Kavanaugh was a very the cabinet confirmation was a very very big thing I think it it galvanized the Republicans or Democrats were galvanized\nA on November in the November of ... they've been waiting for this moment for more than two years now but I think that Republicans were lacking and enthusiasm even though they are\nThere Ninety percent support for Trump there wasn't a lot of enthusiasm things were going okay you're you're not full of hatred you're not full of anger so therefore you're less likely to vote but I think that the Kavanaugh situation galvanized Republicans in the same way it was a sense of threat\nThe sense that they are being attacked ... and that they must respond by voting um I think the caravan is doing something similar I mean President Obama not withstanding those pictures are not a figment of our imagination those pictures of people saying we're going to get into America One way or another and my wife\nWe already know about the laws how easy it is how people come in they make these asylum claims as the lawyers are coached them to do and then there into the wind until they're hearing which will they'll never show up for it so that's the reality of the Swiss cheese border [noise]\nUm so you need men comes these two incidents the bombing a male and the\nBomb one second for people to they didn't miss it you know Saturday\nA busy day and if ... if you down the south was beautiful if you're in the northeast was pouring sea might have just taken a break from politics but I Want you to hear ... about this actually friday night listening to him on the Caribbean ...\nSuddenly it's a group of [noise]\nEverybody like what what what what what we're being invaded where where\n[noise] ... you\nIt every time and do often\nIt works you can't you\nLet me tell you something if you remember the whole controversy with separating a women are the families in their kids or the or the people perceived to be kids if you knew the outrage we was the election move then this has been an obsession to the president to somehow get immigration reform and cracked\nDown on a boat or is this is you know election day folks the caravan was not put forward by the White House to alert people to illegal immigration or border and no one's a parade we just care about our country and border security the president former president acting like that\nIs beneath him and also as an insult to us who act as if we're too timid to attack in ... and we're concerned about impoverished people were not concerned about impoverished people there is a method to get in here and they are just obliterated what is wrong with him\nAnd ... and I I agree with your shut down one thing I don't think it's beneath for arc Obama I think that as Hoover arc Obama is that too is always been a ... his great skill was to pretend to be somebody else a a during\nCampaigns but what you see there is is the ... rock Obama and and don't forget a lot of the the aim on the left has been to de legitimize Donald Trump's election and so this is a pattern that\nOh it's all bamboozled it's all ... up so none of it's real right it's really just Russia that's all the trailers Russia um so I I think that this is a sort of thing Brock Obama I think will energize the Republican voters probably more than Donald Trump will\nBecause Obama is basically telling you don't believe what you see believe me I'm and I think he he did that with Obama Care you know doctors that they would rather cut off your legs and give you an aspirin because they make more money that way you can keep your doctor I mean\nThe the nonsense the Iran deal was not what we said it was it was not ran some ... billion and a half that was not rent some more ... of course it was\nSo ... Brock Obama is is a stranger to the truth when it comes to these politics\nAnd so he talks about Obamacare and he said well this guy just slice he knows he knows very well we didn't get the whole deal in Iran he knows the money that we had to the checks we had the rights of the Paris accord\nHe also said we're going to reinforce the red line\nHe also sees you keep your plan you can keep your doctor both things aren't true and save your money so because he's got so much charisma and presidents and he has more of a professor ... delivery we're supposed to believe him more than President Trump does he know that that he's got all these skeleton in his closet\nWell look I think he's counting on the same uh you know\nCheerleading from the media that he that buffet at him for eight years while he was rarely held to account by the media for any of this but look at their resolves the American people saw through it then the American people rejected\nObama's party they rejected more than that they're rejected Obama is that why Donald Trump was elected because of the failures and the lives of the Obama administration because Hillary Clinton\nCan because of our own character flaws but also because she she promised to double down on everything Obama did\nI mean that I think was the horrifying moment and when you didn't agree with her when you didn't support her you were deplorable your ear redeem mobile you were hardly American\nThat I think is the tone that elected Donald Trump and so when Obama goes back to that when Hillary Clinton is out there now when Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi when they want you to believe\nThat Donald Trump is evil that he's illegitimate that the caravan is not real it's made up I don't know I see those pictures everywhere they don't look like made up pictures to me that does like real people\nAnd coming to this border in a way that is very hard for the United states to resist\nBecause of our laws um our laws Michael ... once said our constitution is not a suicide back\nI mean I mean our constitution does not require America to give rights to the world that would destroy America\nAnd I think that is the point we're facing here now how is this caravan going to be turned back or denied if Mexico won't do it if Guatemala won't do it\nUh then I think it's going to become a real issue at the border and President Obama came to rail about it but in fact he never did anything about the border\nUh he was quite happy to pretend that it was all about humanitarian\nGestures but where where is the humanitarian gesture to the actual taxpayer whereas this them why does it never end the burden put on the taxpayer\nPay more pay more pay more pay more blood in the world take care of the world don't worry about your own children you know the government will provide for you that kind of mentality is been thoroughly rejected by voters that's why\nA suspicious package to prior street post office in downtown Atlanta was addressed to

when he was through he was Nineteen Seventeen letting Wilson and the birth and the new world disorder ah it's got to be available November twenty eight on paper back uh Arthur welcome back deck it's pleasure being here going to be writing history about this this time how long ago was right now where President Trump\nI mean as an historian watching all this happened watching all the paradigms about how politics in America works about beauty logical divisions in America what's happening around the world it's a it's a it's a front row seat if you're an historian for events that are we are not going to forget\nFor a very long time and I would say to Bryan probably from a foreign policy standpoint the most important president we've had in about a hundred years in what way well in the sense that he setting where I was saying before setting a new paradigm\nHe's really going back to the paradigm that Teddy Roosevelt set for what America's interests are and how America defense them and acts as a great power and as I explained in my book Nineteen Seventeen Woodrow Wilson introduced to a different paradigm which was is that America had this a God given mission to go out and save the world\nAnd that American power was really legitimate if it was used to help others to promote democracy or to repel and resist aggression\nAnd that was a mission that sustained us through a World War two through the Cold War I'm not saying it was a bad mission many ways it accomplished a great deal and brought a lot of stability and peace too large sections of the world\nBut it also made us assume certain kinds of burdens and allowed others to shift the burden to us that now Donald Trump is saying\nThis is not this is that where America is going to be on my watch and this is not where America needs to be a globally we have so many our allies and partners who could shoulder more bird like NATO we have so many world hot spots\nIn which the United states doesn't have to send troops are put boots on the ground in order to deal with an hour to limit the the the destruction and instability the results from took this new paradigm from the last hundred years so Newt\nGingrich had a different take not necessarily against us but he was ... marked within a last night on life liberty and lived in cars forty seven\nAnd so from because he was running as a Republican and because he he he has no hostility to conservatism is just isn't to think about a much\nAnd he has an enormous hostility to political correctness and liberalism\nBecause it just doesn't fit how he thinks the world works uh and so I think we ended up with somebody who I I compare frankly there Andrew Jackson has one of the most disruptive presidents we've ever had because because he's not afraid to take on the

sixteen and some of 'em are districts that Clinton wanted twenty sixteenth\nBut if Republicans they went Eighteen or those thirty tossup states that you know keep control the house\nThat as Tom ... politics she does things on average and looks at trends\nAnd says this is the pathway for\nOr they're still out there for Republicans to book tradition in history and keep the house and the Senate the Senate which was in jeopardy on Labor Day uh I don't think anybody Arthur Herman as a story in as well as someone who follows news much say on a anyone thinks the Senate is going to do anything but expanded the Republican reach\nI think there's no doubt about that and I would even say not a not only I think that there probably is going to keep the house but I think in the Senate they may gain for possibly even five seats\nIs this the greatest number of silence supporters you've ever seen for any candidate because of the backlash a lot of people get in their family and friends for

I'm Michael with your with your background I'm surprised you're tight a at a tight race after all this red district you're Greenberg guy very suggestible businessman your book warrior diplomat which chronicles ah what\nYou did not only in uniform but at a uniform working with a vice president Dick Cheney right so that set you up to want to get this thing but you're in a dog fight right now right\nWell we're in a dog fight not so much because of the ideas are present my background more than a dog fight just because national Democrats and liberals are pouring millions of dollars\nInto the seat just last week Michael Berlin Bloomberg dropped another million in Nancy Pelosi has put half a million in George Soros and his family have given directly to my opponent\nNancy Soderberg here's a lifelong liberal so they're trying to essentially buy the seat from New York Boston right you see in LA\nSo you're you're about uh talking about the the a caravan you're concerned about illegal immigration Republicans have been for a while actually ended up border security and then when you saw the behavior of the way the Democratic jak were Brett Kavanaugh on the high school in the year book they that was an embarrassment they thought they were going for the knockout they knocked themselves out with that\nOh it's really blown it's really blown back on I mean the Republicans heck a lot of conservative Democrats that I talked to an independence or we're just disgusted by the entire thing and it's all the more reason that I think we need real leadership\nUp in Washington DC and as a as a combat veteran up and as a as a CEO of ... leading my entire life and you know the great thing we have Brian I've told you the statistic before or in the Nineteen seventies repeat eighty percent of the Congress Senate and house where veterans now we're at a record low and Seventeen percent\nIn our nation's history and I think that that declined explains a lot because in the foxhole nobody cares about identity politics nobody cares about race religion and creed party it's not like I'm getting on the black helicopter a night and asking what party belonged to it's about missions about country and the more people we get there the better\nTwo things are on the national stage right we watch those uh those bombs those packages arrived and those who just prototypical bombs they're

more\nThe more that we have again back to my theme of the east coast in Congress eat those in this country of national service of serving your community of serving your neighbor\nA serving your country or you know I can tell you a number of Democrats that I could disagree with long\nBut we ... we put our life on the line for this country we can have a beer at night and say okay how are we going to find common ground how will do report I absolutely will do that I've done it um my entire life and that's what I'm looking to do moving forward\nI mean that's how we're going to move this country forward heck I've even advocated for getting us back to national service that's not a draft\nThat's not necessarily in uniform that is inner city tutoring rural medicine\nPeace Corps national park how do we get Eighteen Nineteen year olds off the couch off their phone off their video games and serving a broader costs but there's a sociological effect that we've missed in this\nCurrent generation post draft frankly you know back in the day you took Eighteen Nineteen year old kids from downtown Detroit from LA from west Georgia and you're all put together I talked to a veteran the other day just coming from the segregated south the first African American he ever spoke to ever was his bunk made in the navy\nRight and then they became lifelong friends so that that kind of forcing effective getting people from all different aspects of our society is missing something I Want to get back to not just nationwide but in our politics as well\nAnd they do indeed have a major role to
