died I bark a wind live from the devil you asked me twenty four hour news center\nThere already is urging vigilance for any packages that may still be out there after discovery of several address two prominent democratic figures including the Obamas and the Clintons they contained a parent pipe bombs inside ABC senior justice correspond appear Thomas has more\nSources telling ABC News each device contained a digital clock explosive powder batteries of power source and wiring\nTo travel a spark for the nation or the bombs did not detonate investigators believe they are dangerous based on components in construction of those six pipe bombs discovered so far investigators fear of the intent of the centers was to me or kill\nThere's now being a seven to package discovered that address to Congress only Maxine Waters in California President Trump at a rally in Wisconsin said\nThe president his party was down I mean history the Democrats the president's unconventional ways had them thinking they're going to have a shot at the Senate and they've locked up the house neither thing is correct Jonah Goldberg ...\nAnd it's clear particularly in most swing states that Trump is an unemployed benefit for Republican Senate candidates because it brings out rural voters people not amused can testable congressional districts in ways that sort of put them over the top you know plus the backlash up there at the cabin off and\nWhat's interesting to me about the house races and I do I still think that the Republican or Democrat there and take back the house but probably narrowly\nThey only need to win one out of three and the competitive races\nFor what's interesting is that in the competitive races the generic ballot has basically even doubt\nFor democratic advantage and the generic ballot takes into account all these intensely blue parts of the country where it doesn't matter whether they have a huge advantage or not and the actual races where it's close it's much more of a race\nAnd here's a I'll give you some stats and an overwhelming but the Washington Post teamed up with a short school people and they asked this question\nOf the contested or when it comes to the house part of that the house remains close in hard fought according to this poll\nOr in these sixty nine most contested districts in the nation with Democrats holding a statistically the Democrat told they typically insignificant lead over Republicans which brings me\nBack to the issues of the day who could have predicted that Brett Kavanaugh would get this type of\nPassion going across the country who could have predicted that made for TV horror show of\nThousands of refugees on foot steaming through Guatemala from Honduras through the borders of Mexico en route to the U.S eighty five percent are undocumented men if they get into our country\nWho are determined to come in well the president says I'm going to put the military on the border they show not enter who could ever predicted these events\nIt's may put everything in play and I like it is for example there they used to have a college football poll to decide who the national champion was and then they decided to play a championship game\nI just said good let's do it on the field that's how I feel about this election\nLet the issues play out not in theory like Cory Booker I'll give every kid on a disadvantage to fifty thousand dollars cash but just for being born\nOr I'll give every person Medicaid for all like a Andrew Gillum we know that ... the uh financially not going to work now and I'm watching the issues play out before me and we're making we're making these politicians take a stand before we vote\nChris star walk is looking at the numbers you'll be with us on election night he'll be up for forty eight straight hours cut to\nWhat was training earlier this cycle with the Republicans were in big big big trouble in the suburbs especially those places that the president won by only a point or two or that Hillary Clinton actually want and it was going to be really tough sledding for them what this fall found is that yes\nWhile Democrats leading the generic ballot in urban areas by as many as forty points and Republicans a lead in rural areas by more than thirty points his dead even evenly magic\nIn that generic ballot in those suburban areas so what we see now but what's really been true all along is that yes Democrats having a geographical they have a map a advantage because of where the races are that the Republicans are playing so much defence twenty nine of our thirty one tossup races are all Republican held seat\nBut the Republicans still have a fighting chance because that's evenly matched\nAnd a lot of it has to do and I'm going to ask about a leader McCarthy about this Mike Bloomberg he's put zillions of dollars into these house races\nHis hope that the house goes Democrat and all these candidates will feel allied with him and support him running against President Trump in terms of the caravan if you wanted to hurt the president with this caravan you've had the opposite effect in my mind\nBecause and I'll play this later us Brock Obama as senator you of former majority leader Harry Reid US Senator Schumer all talking about the need to reinforce our borders the idiocy of chain migration and in the case of senator Brock Obama\nHad the the danger of allowing people just across the border illegally how unfair it is to others Mike Pence on how this started cut fourteen\n[noise] there's some estimates north of seven thousand migrants so the group is growing out of\nThe United states of America intervenes and prevents ten terrorists or suspected terrorists from coming into our country every day so it's just inconceivable\nThat there would not be individuals or from the middle east as a part of this growing the care of him for president Hernandez ...\nTold me the the care of and the snow making his way through Mexico credit for the southern border was organized by leftist organizations and financed by Venezuelan\nGood luck now Mike Pence and Donald Trump ... worst nightmare this guy has run that real oil rich country into the ground so now eating their pets and zoo animals to survive and he takes money to finance a caravan to us\nI mean how diabolical how how we how horrible\nWell as people store good luck with socialism that's\nWhat you get Venezuela listen and majority leader standing by he if they are going to hold the house Republicans he will be speaker more than likely he ...\nHe is standing by to talk about not only what is it like trying to hold on to seats were forty one Republicans have retired but also what it's like to have a Boulder through through thrown through your headquarters or with all your workers they're\nJust doing the best they can to make sure you win a seat and California doesn't stay\nA bright blue a busy day busy a busy show don't move this is the Brian kill me show frying

you listen more you'll know Brian kill made\nIt sort of became a\nWe're not supposed to use that word you know what I Am I'm a nationalist okay [noise]\nAnd the president doesn't mind using a word that he doesn't care about the history of the word he needed to uh because he wants to explain to everyone he is not a global list he also says this is another one word to describe America First strategy\nSo of course everyone goes through the roof the president's he has a dog whistle for white supremacy he told you in the oval office has nothing to do with that doesn't even know what you're talking about he has no understanding of that history if you know anything about the president who takes all questions all the time especially\nThe last two weeks he let you know exactly what he's thinking he doesn't even know what a dog whistle is or how to use it he's got a bullhorn or he's got a tuba you can't mistake his message don't see there's a new ones or a gray area to it it's no such thing with him\nRich listening on the Fox is ready weapon patch of New York hey rich\nHey Brian thanks for taking the call\nReal quick if the Republicans are serious about maintaining control of Congress they need to immediately reconvene submit a bill to the floor\nFor one hundred percent funding of the wall and then get it over to the set it that way every congressman everybody's going to be on the record where they stand this is an issue that's in everybody's eyes right now it's like a scab that's been picked raw and the people in the middle of the country\nThe independents they want to know that we are going to do something about it and if possible\nThey can repeal the OPM policy of other than Mexicans and they can uh be fun sanctuary cities those are three things that the majority of the country supports and now's the time to do it better than any campaign out there on the trail they do this and the whole country I'll sit and the Republicans will maintain control of Congress\nI okay here's the thing we know that we just had a guest on Kevin McCarthy I burn up on TV I didn't bring it up on radio\nAnd what he did is he is as a fund the wall or he's got a twenty five billion dollar wall funding bill out there and secure the border so he I Believe it's pretty much symbolism though you get the house but they're already gone to vote on it and it's going to die in the Senate\nI I'm done with those symbolic votes I just have no patience for them and bottom line is Republicans have stopped the president from doing that\nNothing you know we'd Mitch McConnell has and put a stiff arm hasn't used the Heisman but for the most part he's indifferent about it there is some Texas congressman like will hurt who don't want it\nSo the president is right on this he doesn't need and he's come off the fact that he says I Want this huge wall across the border he understands is that's not practical he gets it now\nSo he wants to finish off he's got about six to twelve billion to do this and continue the wall he needs the rest of it and he does he and he says he's been convinced by border patrol that some of it's got to be see through to see what is going on on the other side of the war\nAnd for those who say it's a primitive medieval way to keep your enemies away tell that to Hungary tell that to tell that to\nA Florida communities guy obviously I'm running against an anti law enforcement failed mayor I'm a former prosecutor I've worked arm in arm with law enforcement we've had a historic drop in crime outside of Tallahassee were domes mayor\nThat doesn't happen by accident do Brian it requires a lot of hard worker ... men and women to go out in uniform and and risk themselves for our community requires elected officials to support their mission um and so I'm going to continue to do that because I think when you start skipping on public safety and you can have a good economy you could have a good environment but\nIf people are safe and their community than it doesn't amount to as much\nWhat did you learn about Andrew Gillum debating Andrew Gillum Sunday\n[noise] well look this guy he is somebody that uh is is more glib then I think focused on the back\nUh for example he was running commercials two months ago talking about single payer health care\nAnd I was asked Campbell how could you take ... you know this Medicare for all is basically single payer takes away Medicare Medicaid put seniors on it takes away private insurance dumped so everyone there on a single payer plan and ... do not want that and you know and I asked\nHim I was like whoa whoa why should someone lose their plan out there and she acted like he had never heard of single payer before he endorsed it didn't last long\nBy Bernie Sanders he wouldn't say whether he would sign a bill in Florida even though he's previously said he wanted the single payer confederacy with a New York and California so I think he was\nSomebody that was really running from his record a and wasn't wasn't being honest with the voters\nBut that is now you know coming out and get for respect\nParticularly with the FBI investigation and the fact that that he was whining his pockets with gifts from this undercover agent and with lobbyists who had business before him as mayor and he was just gotten a lot I mean the documents that came out refuted what he said and I think he's going to have a tough time explaining that are way tonight when we have our next debate\nSimply going all the FBI and him whether it was a trip that he said it was financed by a donor reciting it and then something pops up today and the news about Alexander Hamilton tickets now shoot you as a politician be able to accept tickets and the answer is no you shouldn't you can't do it even though it's tempting and they don't give you a lot of money so he said well my brother gave me the tickets\nAnd it turns out to be a totally different story and ended up being an FBI agent it was a set up\nYet so the FBI agent was Andrew thought that the FBI agent was a contractor who was trying to get business with the city at Tallahassee so you know when when that agent\nOr giving Andrew the ticket you know which is that at least hundreds of dollars maybe even a thousand dollars depending on you know when you when and how they got 'em um he's doing that with business pending before\nAndrew so in Florida you know you're not allowed to accept gifts or if somebody is trying to influence a policy of yours and so that obviously would violate Florida law\nUm and it doesn't matter if that was given through Gillum his brother as a proxy Gillum knew that it was from the FBI agent based on the text messages we saw though so that's a distinction\nWithout a different um but then also the Costa Rica trip where there was he went on this\nLuxury get away to Costa Rica or with the lobbyists who are trying to get money from the city of Tallahassee um he claimed he paid four hundred dollars cash for four nights and the luxury villa nobody nobody everyone says like hey I he never gave me an e cache but it but it just the trip was much more expensive than that though he basically got\nFree accommodations from lobbyists and then lo and behold short time after that um he\nHe authorized two million dollars\nTo this lobbyist project to build a restaurant in the city of happy so Andrews getting things he shouldn't have gotten and then he's given the lobbyists exactly what the lobbyists was looking\nFor and it does not look like his explanation is accurate and I'm Wondering why people don't seem as curious about that as they normally would especially over something that matters so much to the election cycle and that's the governorship of Florida now once why\nPeople may they may be right now I mean I think that this is something you know bright and most of this stuff was not being vetted at all by the press um they they were not following up\nOn a lot of their you know the the grand jury seated people were not investigating getting so this was really triggered by a he's also under ethics investigation with the Florida ethics commission and so this is these documents were subpoenaed produced and so they were released in conjunction with that\nSubpoena but I think now people this may be the first\nTime they're really starting to get the sense of what this guy was doing you know in the city at Tallahassee and I think from what we know a lot there's a there's a definitely a live possibility that were he to be elected he could find themselves getting indicted or either before he gets an officer wallet\nOkay there's a robocall out there are once again in ... races robocalls attacking a attacking Andrew Gillum and it's I don't want to go to the vet verbatim of it but you have nothing to do with this right\nNow of course on the total garbage Brian the reason that was put out is to try to distract from the FBI bombshell better they're they're trying to change the narrative trying to make it about race I Want a full investigation of who they said I Want them exposed I've called for Andrew to help us identify\nI the culprits here but I think this is all part of a of a just information I think they're trying to distract from the core issues um and so we should give it no credence at all and we should absolutely expose whoever it is\nA few now are trailing in the latest Quinnipiac poll by six points how do you close that gap if it's if that is accurate in Thirteen Days\n[noise] well I I mean Quinnipiac has had both Governor Scott and me way out of every other all so I mean I just that's not the numbers were saying I mean we are seeing a very competitive race\nUm you know I'm I think I have the edge at this point um yeah we need to do a good debate we need to work like act and we need to just keep turning out voters I mean at the end of the day the polls are great um but you know in my Republican primary or the real clear\nPolitics average had me winning by five I think and I won by twenty other real clear politics average didn't even Gillum didn't even register on that for the Democratic primary and he won right I think a lot of it is who you're turning out are you getting your plan and so far Republicans are doing that and Florida run and if we do that then I think well when\nLast question have you done a good job getting adding an Adam Pertman and other Republicans after you won a difficult primary was not easy [noise] have you done a good enough job getting them to unite behind you along with the president\nI think so for sure I mean we've done events with you know people like Pam Bondi governor Jeb Bush I mean really the whole spectrum of the Republican Party or in Florida and so I I think everyone's on board I don't think there's much division I think it's just a matter of us you know making sure we get a\nBig turnout and the more people learn about yellow him the more they realize that this is that election they need to participate and they can't sit on the sidelines\nAnd Leslie or we have ten seconds the Hispanic vote a we had a woman come up to me and say listen you guys keep can't generalize the Hispanic vote we're all different do you agree\nAbsolutely and I got strong support Cuban American idol or Venezuelans because I've been very strong against ... we're going to do well with and I've been active with Puerto Ricans I think we're going to do\nBetter than expected there so and we're going to do well with Hispanics both I think it's just a matter of making sure we turned out ah you know our core base and if we knew that I think we're going to be in good shape\nGillum first to say at this round is at this thanks so much weight by the way ask a Gillum to come on no response yet\nBecause this way I Want you to take one out of nitrogen and bonded with one out of oxygen and boom you would have created nitric oxide a miracle molecule your own body makes the fuels

can really feel welcome\nA we understand the CNN was on the air Jim Shooter was on the air at the time of the evacuation and the ... new news coverage immediately switched over to the offices in Washington because a pipe bomb type\nDevice a similar to the pipe bomb with wires hanging out was found so the NYPD is all over that too\nYeah well look I'm you know people here have had experience with that our colleague at the New York Post's Marc Cunningham runs the editorial page I mean he was anthrax tier years ago and so forth so [noise] um it just highlights were\nAll very vulnerable local reporters are tweeting at a device was also address to Governor Cuomo right at a big debate last\nNight well we don't know whether it's all coming from the same person or not um I mean that's one of the things the investigators will have to do but they'll trace it back and I'm pretty confident the FBI will get their man or a woman who's done this and I think I think this nation is United on that these people\nUm should there should be no mercy vision faced the maximum punishment that they can\nYeah so bill migrants you of the wall Street Journal so bill or this caravan has changed things but I have not seen a Democrat to speak out and say this worries me right I've not seen as Democrat come out and say we should let every one of the main I've seen pundits right but I haven't seen a lawmaker\n[laughter] well you know are we had an editorial a earlier this week are talking about um [noise]\nYou know the origins of this and Honduran politics an effort to embarrass the pro American governmental simply dates back to that as well I may go up there along well that's part of the effort\nFunded by Venezuela to embarrass a pro American government in Honduras look I have no doubt that a lot of these people are just seeking opportunity and stuff but if I were a bad guy I'd be seeking this is a good way\nInfiltrate people and so I mean none of those reports are surprising that doesn't mean that most of them aren't just trying to improve their lives but do you see how it benefits president Oh yes I mean that's what I'm saying this thing that's designed to embarrass a an an ally the United states a pro American president in Honduras 'em\nAnd possibly President Trump by\nForcing unpleasant scenes at the border you know where where people are going to be repelled uh it seems to me if you were a mastermind Republican strategist you could have asked for anything better because as you say the Democrats are unable to denounce it didn't end\nI don't know why I think the American people are very generous and uh I'm\nPro immigration myself but I Want to law school system and the lawlessness that's become associated with the Democratic positions on immigration sanctuary cities abolish ice I'm let these people bum rushed the border I think that you know decent and good Americans just can't abide\nThat Lewis second you said a against that who's against that his bronco bomb against that yes he was two thousand cut twenty\nSimply cannot allow people to pour into the United states undetected undocumented unchecked as circumventing the line of people who are waiting patiently diligently unlawful life or the become immigrants in this country\nIs he reading Donald Trump's prime [laughter]\nWell it sounds like Donald Trump was reading his uh his you know it's from a from back then look I agree with them but we want a system that the worst part of the system right now is the lawlessness and chaos and it benefits no one we want a system that people can understand and that they can obey the law now my my three\nDaughters are immigrants are adopted from China or you know I dealt with the immigration service it is not a pleasant experience and we were doing everything lawfully and had all the papers\nAnd was a nightmare and in fact I was able to do it because I had a friend in Washington\nThat got me an appointment at one point but the average Joe trying to do this stuff it's it's very complicated very unwieldy and it it it doesn't uphold the law\nGovernment policy pushing migration there isn't any a sense of ... what ... is simultaneously orders and acknowledging person out of this area\nSo she was upset about what's happening at the border what about Harry Reid about the lottery system cut twenty two\nBecause of relative based immigration system in in ... unfair [noise]\nCongress has been forced to adopt even more of a certain majors to deal with the demands of people\nTo be any wonder that the American people think gardening immigration policies are a joke\nWhen we select fourteen thousand new am I going to say here\n[noise] yeah I'm not so sure lotteries a bad idea if you look through and you weed people out for their their backgrounds and they're qualified um you know how do you choose between a and B if they're if they're qualified and they haven't committed crimes and so forth\nUm you know and there's a limited number of seats I'm not sure that's the worst aspect to the overall yes to them is just it's just it's incoherent it does not server and chain migration and and one of the problems is that on both sides there are people who think\nThey'd rather have the issue because they figure get their side riled up than a solution that was certainly President Obama's position when he was in the Senate right um I was there in the Bush administration will try comprehensive it a reformed Ted Kennedy supported it\nAnd Brock Obama sabotaged it um 'cause you'd rather have the issue he got in to be president he could have done anything you wanted those first two years and he didn't push immigration 'cause I I think you would rather use it right around Republicans ... I guess you are a\nMuch more savvy than I Am much more street smart because I Believe it when it comes to raising\nTaxes I think there's a lot of people on the down the right to left and really feel like the rich habit too good for too long I I I think that they're sincere in their beliefs\nThis is showing me the same players still in power have reverse their position making it harder to come to an agreement now if you just disagree it makes it hard you got to figure out leverage to get that person the table but they actually agree enter pretending not to that's where I have so little patient right\nWell I think look a lot of figures in the Democratic party now take their cue from Donald Trump in in an opposite way if he says blue they say ... you know if he says a sky they say ocean they just pick the opposite point of view and it doesn't matter whether they held that view before they just cannot\nFind themselves in any way to agree with Donald Trump look um\nThere's there's a straight I I Wish I think the president missed an opportunity on the wall to get funding for the wall in exchange for a deal with the dreamers and I think the White House than piled up too many conditions which was chain ... but there is a good I mean that would be a good chunk to bite off and achievement\nNow Graham on you and John Kelly told the president don't do that and Miller gotten his ear\nWhile the other and yet but the other problem is now and then see below sea I Believe she says there's nothing we would give\nFor a deal I mean if that's how we're going to start now maybe that just are opening bid in a negotiation but that doesn't offer well for a deal I mean there's no way you can have a deal now or in the lame duck but maybe next year after the midterms I'm President Trump could go back and try to bite off pizza this 'cause 'cause one of the things that's\nThe ... immigration policy is not only that it's bad news incoherent butter legislatures have\nFailed for like three decades to come together make the necessary compromise to fix the thing improve not not necessarily a perfect system but a better system in a more lawful system\nAll right I Want to be ... ah yeah I when we come back I Want to get your take on what's happened with Saudi Arabia and as we leave here to the president said yesterday and we'll pick up where we left off can we put that soundbite Eric did you pull that today a when he talked about a Saudi Arabia okay\nThey never thought about it [noise] should have never been done [noise] once they thought about it [noise] everything else they did was asked to cover up was horrible the execution was are what they should have never been in the execution or a cover a physician and never happened feeds Brian kill made [noise]\nNinety five five and am seventh empty you asked me\nA DUI conviction could get you fired get your license suspended and increase your insurance rates got a DUI problem be smart called George Stein the DUI lawyer hey it's Eric ...\nMy best advice never drink and drive but I Know good people sometimes get an a bad situation I only trust the recommend one guy to help you put something this serious my friend George Steiner the DUI lawyer don't be caught off guard by the\nSusanna cues kidnapping you're young woman in downtown Athens may be responsible for similar crimes near the UGA campus\nWhich divides Powerball jackpot six hundred two point five million dollars is rolling over seven hundred fifty million dollars for a Saturday Night drawing winning numbers three Twenty one forty five fifty three and fifty six the Powerball is twenty two college but\nOh George jak getting ready for a road game in Blacksburg, Virginia tech that Thursday died on ESPN\nSaturday on WSBIU radio number seven Georgia faces number nine Florida in Jacksonville tailgate eleven thirty AM kickoff three thirty ... home with the dogs NBA can't raise more leads hopped with thirty two points\nAs Atlanta beat the Dallas Mavericks after new state bar Marino one eleven to one oath for World Series Red Sox down to the Dodgers fortitude to go up to games to none and the best of seven LA will host game three on friday and Chavez Ravine dog you asked me news time is one thirty two\nAnd a half or your nine AM to noon a weekday house Iran W.

Brian good morning a\nBreaking news here I mean it's not unusual we're watching threats verbal which was ... we see the shooting of Steve squeeze out of baseball practice and now we have suspicious packages or was leading figures in the Democratic party\nGet it this is a visit beyond scary right and I don't think I mean a lot of people are trying to plus has us right now Bryan but um let me tell you I'm I'm ... trial attorney and we did a lot of dirty tricks to blur\nThe Hitler's harmonica about that but things cross the line and obviously I don't care what's going on right now needs to be bipartisan that's unacceptable\nI mean at the federal level the investigations going on right I mean you had to think that there was something going on when Soros gets targeted people tried to find out who sent it and now you have a situation where it comes to if it's coming to the postal system don't you feel as though there are cameras and do you think there are moving rapidly\nYou would hope so but um that ... in my experience from some of those type of stuff and dealing with the government I don't know that uh I think sometimes we get technology unless scare away a lot more credit than it really has and I don't know that they're being tracked especially not as much as for us but the one thing that I I Can't get over the fact\nOf what's going on with the Clintons because you're not talking about a president and first lady that are Twenty years out I mean how are you just ran for office two years ago she was secretary state in the last ten years how they got that the ... and that's really frightening\nRight okay Brian let's move voting on a lesser known will track all those stories are what are the most intriguing racism these midterms who just Thirteen Days away is what's happening in Florida you had a you had\nA Governor Scott come forward and say a blister the polls that show him trailing to Bill Nelson he says am I going to get an apology when I when this thing I Am surprised that a success will two term governor within invisible democratic senator and Bill Nelson\nIs having is even in that neck and neck race but he's trying to flip that seat what's his problem with the pollsters\nI don't know posters being based in Florida Brian I'm Governor Scott has got to Rodney Dangerfield complex I know respect complex like Governor Scott but nobody's really given him credit for what he's done in Florida over the last eight years\nIt's been it's been really remarkable like you look in the fourth quarter Tampa Orlando West Palm we have unprecedented low job numbers are high ... high or high employment low unemployment\nScotch just not a charismatic guy you want to talk about the anti Trump type of per se that's him and that allows somebody like Senator Nelson who got and living in Florida just while Shirley raindrops in seems to get reelected every time to be able to to get in on Scott\nBut he was down by the does he have a case against the pollsters said the pollsters in Florida routinely short change him [noise]\nThey do um I\nI think that you know as far as from a legal perspective and I actually know law firms that are going to be watching your monitoring on election day in Florida and work with them closely um I think his bigger issue more than I Am of polls is what's going to actually happened on election day we do have problems in Florida from time to time with\nUm with what happens election day from a voting perspective and I think unfortunately somebody like Scott and his supporters they might not get\nBut if they want to the other one is very intriguing is wrong to say it is again a congressman who has the president's support is able to win the typical primary inside them putting them put them in the established Florida candidates many people thought it was his time the ... the President Trump back the wrong horse\n[noise] ah no and and I mean we got to talk about this because it was about uh Hamilton anyone is saying that you know who lives who died and who gets free tickets for Hamilton I mean that that's the question here today with with Andrew Gillum apparently somehow getting a free tickets for Hamilton\nWell Andrew Gillum the Democratic candidate who don't want it very difficult primary and he has a showed himself now that will lead in almost every poll that come out and today a new revelation\nYeah yeah I I think that I think it's gonna be closer than it is I mean the Santa's isn't Iraq veteran it's got to really likeable I'm good looking family I my understanding is that I'm the president likes him on and and you know the president\nWith alpha king from forest factor it's never been easier just one small pill a day for a serious boost in total testosterone alpha king

that sounds like a fire alarm here will keep you posted on that but to have projectiles that that is a a feature you'll often see in bombs the terrorists you know the Afghanistan elsewhere ISIS has use that that kind of bomb or doesn't mean it's exclusive\nOr just to those kinds of terrorist groups but that is a significant development Tom point to it if you're still hearing a sphere\nAnd that it was a little of CNN when they got word that they had to evacuate the building and tell us over the Washington bureau there's been three packages that we know of and maybe a fourth\nA one to the Clintons home oh the Obamas offices and CNN New York offices we do know this uh there's some develop and there are the bumps cause the best of getting those suspicious packages now at Debbie Wasserman Schultz is office uh\nUh the building that houses her Debbie Wasserman Schultz his office in sunrise\nFlorida was evacuated after suspicious packages arrived in the mail now she used to run the DNC she has been as low profile as you can be since running the DNC data Brazil's book reveals she left in scandal or shame\nSo now I'm I'm Wondering why you would target her but at the same thing with acquaintance I mean they're not exactly the new face of the Democratic party President Obama's back to see what this go so CNN is reporting on their own story\nWe're looking at their own packages and there's really not much to report until you can get some of the bomb squad to unwind what these packages war with the bombs were\nThey say they're rudimentary as you know and\nAnd basically who did it but that takes a while I mean remember how long it took the Unabomber you remember how long it took with the anthrax so\nIt took years so I'm not too sure going to get a quick resolving this unless it's somebody who is somewhat of a somewhat a disorganized\nSomewhat no not well thought out if it is somebody who's highly skilled is going to be very tough [noise]\nMeanwhile as far as what we've been covering here we've been looking at Cher Carter's reporting to what a great job in Guatemala trying to figure out what started these caravans yeah I mean caravans as a second maybe a third beginning it turns out a lot of his Venezuela to embarrass the government of doors and also it really cause they throw into the side to Donald Trump\nBecause you know the socialist leaders destroy this country\nAnd that could be one of the reasons number two we're also looking at the midterm elections and I'm a mid term elections as it relates to what's going on with the breaking news there seems to be changing a trading a changing just about everything and the last thing to bring up do we have not discussed\nAs John Bolton was dispatched to\nRussia at which time they talked about a meeting with Vladimir prudent and the price of the United states that could come to pass but the big story was we are withdrawing from a nuclear agreement that really stopped us from doing developing the latest weaponry because we believe the Russians were already developing this uh so why with the ... a former why would we\nActually go and he'd do anything different so the president said and I'm making a hard choice I'm leaving this I Am leaving disagreement\nNow the question would be what do you do with China because China is a nuclear power they used to be two major sophisticated nuclear nations doubt China has to be in those talks to so why should Russia in the U.S hamstring themselves if China's going to be sprinting ahead [noise]\nThe other major story is with the president charge tried to do with some words using the term national is people fear that word because of white nationalist and what it means in other cases\nWhat he's trying to do is say that say one word meaning for what I'm about and being a nationalist for me is putting America First is patriotic among the people that are outraged by this Jeffrey to been cut thirty five [noise]\nI don't think there's anything wrong with the term nationalism and I would hate to see it co-opted entirely by these reactionary forces theater Roosevelt program was called\nThe new nationalism I mean the struggle in American foreign policy between international is an isolationist sometimes called national is\nA rather than isolationist I mean that's a real thing in this country and I don't think nationalism is just a code word for white people look he does so much actual racism I think we shouldn't criticize them\nFor the actual racism rather than a what I think is is an unfair criticism\nAnd here's Charles Trump using the word cut thirty six\nIt's sort of became a nationalist\nNot supposed to use that word you know what I Am I'm a nationalist okay [noise]\nSo senator Massey Hirono of Hawaii who loves a spotlight cut thirty nine\nAnd we should stop giving him the benefit of the doubt that he doesn't understand what he knew he prefers to national anthem on any of these ... these are not just with our planet phone lines\nIt's racism basically for ... and ... um anti ... he knows very well when he's talking about even if he's professor found them I\nYeah I'm going to go Jeffrey tubing on this one are listening we're following the story as big as it relates to the suspicious\nPackages in three maybe four locations will do that also uh we will continue to follow the news as it breaks if you have to leave us now go ahead if you have to take an hour out of order or understand or they will be covering it off for the midterms on down this is the price to meet ya [noise]\nAll right everybody wants to

Democrats have always felt they had a shot at Texas and a shot at flipping Georgia which are usually solid Republican enclaves cutting on\nYou put that poll up on the screen for eight forty eight [noise] the other day and keep in mind is the Georgia is sort of unique among states and if they've got this general election between the Democratic nominee in the Republican nominee\nBut they also have a runoff provision in Georgia and there was a libertarian candidate who was at that debate last night and it doesn't happen a couple of times in the last generation in Georgia you sat libertarian candidate gets three and four percent of the vote in this race that even as these polls are showing you know and get fifty percent\nThis thing has to a runoff in modern history runoffs in Georgia and this would be tested this year I think but the modern history of runoff from Georgia is that the sort of a surge democratic participation and they do\nGeneral election was dropped off in Republicans have done well in these runoff election there was a famous one right after the Nineteen Ninety two election Bill Clinton carrying the state of Georgia defeated George W. Bush the Senate race when what right off the Republican on the Senate race Brock Obama\nGot one in five points in two thousand ain't in Georgia the Senate race went to a run off\nThe Senate race they went to the Republican by a lopsided double digit margin for the Democrats have been sort of pull all their efforts to this general election in November ... formula here in particular to try to expand the electorate get that search turnout but if this thing kicks over to a runoff Democrats than you can try to replicate that a few weeks later\nSo and one of the issues is going to be Kevin how they
