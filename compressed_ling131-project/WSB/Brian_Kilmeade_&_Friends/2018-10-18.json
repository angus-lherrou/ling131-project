sunshine Thursday highs around Seventy ladders most accurate and dependable forecast kind of got a Robert targeting subway restaurants metro Atlanta has been arrested in Tennessee\nYou have an uphill battle\nJust because Donald Trump is atypical controversial uh unorthodox you'd think that he's vulnerable but the more you look at the machine that he has and the way he's consolidated the Republican Party which the month think Abul even a year ago\nYou have to wonder if some Democrats are going to think twice I remember how thin the uh the the uh the race was\nOn the candidates were to get the Republican nomination when Bill Clinton was running for reelection I mean is is a poll numbers are in the high fifties and it was coming off impeachment Republicans took their best shot and lost so Bob Dole was the one who got the nomination with very little competition a Jack Kemp was running against him but he never had a shot\nAnd then when you saw the race wide open you saw double figures for the Republicans not as many for Democrats because the incumbent was almost civil recurrent and\nNow you see double figures for Democrats because they think this president's vulnerable they just don't see it that way I think it's going to be a lot harder than they understand but when it comes to the midterms first things first the part of the United states was asked a question and he was asked basically in the past past presidents have gone out and they've campaigns at the midterms and it hasn't worked out well\nBill Clinton pulled off the road by George Stephanopoulos when they said you're actually hurting these candidates first midterm you know ah George Bush never really went out heavily in the mid term elections Brock Obama got show lacked his first midterm those were his words in particular when he lost the house and almost lost the Senate he would eventually lose both\nSo Donald Trump's out he came out and say you know what I don't really think I'm hurting I think I'm helping them with the headlines were Donald Trump says if we lose it's not my responsibility\nHow is that right by the way that was with the headlines on drugs as well which is shocking to me\nBut just let's look at the mid term elections and see we're at right now the blue wave is not going to happen a blue taking of the house could happen however the Senate seems secure where we are we talking on Labor Day that the Senate was in jeopardy but now Texas is studying out for Cruz Marsha Blackburn\nSeems firmly in control for now in Tennessee Governor Scott is close to taking that seat from Senator Bill Nelson who's just ancient and ineffective\nAnd you know you're dealing with a joke and it sounded like you know you're trying to take a Marco Rubio a Republican in his prime you turn to take out a Democrat who is just in visible in the Senate and then you have John James is going to be a guest on a different our in our show he's closing in Michigan\nMcCaskill's in trouble in Missouri so we'll talk about that so Donald Trump is just saying this about a blue wave cut three\nWhen I keep hearing about the enthusiasm blue wave [laughter]\nBut I think we have tremendous enthusiasm I think justice Kevin or the way he was treated is an outstanding human being an outstanding man of great accomplishment and the way those Democratic senators traded him was horrible it was a disgrace\nTo our country and I'll tell you what since we've been energized anyway but we're more energized since justice capital\nHowever uh if you look at a deficit for the president it cuts on gender lines uh he had the majority of white women fifty three percent but didn't have the majority of women against Hillary Clinton kinda logical first major party major nominee who heads the ticket\nHowever now if they say the president's abrupt style and direct attacks they say it's a turn off to women\nI'm not going to speak for women are but I'm just telling you what the posters are telling me yesterday the president did not help himself on the lawsuit which was a major victory for the president and defamation that he was accused of of stripper porn star Stormy Daniels it was thrown out and guess what they even turned around and told Stormy Daniels\nPay Donald Trump's legal fees any way you look at this it's a loss for Michael ... and a ... a blow to Stormy Daniels so the

as the president looked at as I'm attacking her not all women um attacking her as a as a president and a person not all Republicans\nBut it doesn't help Republicans because it gives Democrats

mind\nCut twenty four how do I engage Saudi Arabian when NBS the de facto leader of the country is this brazen district disrespectful for the international norms that we fight for he is toxic there's

accept that we can I can do that and so there has to be ramifications of consequences for Saudi Arabia and if this young man is going to be the face of Saudi right we'd have to say what a push away I think that we have to move away from this either or thing we have to be embraced Saudi Arabia more because\nYou know Iran is so bad you know we we don't need to associate with any type of hate us

change is a big thing that hurricane a Michael's\nSlams and just cars up most of Florida in parts of Georgia and then people say well they're related and the president ended up getting a series of questions like that on sixty minutes which by the way it was extremely highly rated\nI think the president's getting an advantage up right now because he wants to talk about immigration and for the Republican perspective he thinks it motivates his base and right now there is a caravan heading up from Guatemala\nActually as emanates from Honduras\nThrough Guatemala El Salvador the president won all three countries as well as Mexico stop these this three thousand person caravan before it gets to our border because we saw the chaos it started last time it should be hitting maybe it's just

people from coming here now for me personally I see these people that I see their families and I feel bad for them because they obviously don't have a choice however\nWill be great if we could work with these countries to make their nation's better and we go through our process of admitting people whether they're refugees are not because we're jamming the floodgates overwhelming border security coming up with lines to get you a asylum\nOr getting ankle bracelets and never coming back for court\nThat is not working out for us we used the word is its virtual catch and release and it's very troubling to the border patrol and they in fact when their stories happening right now we're able to monitor these thousands coming up here they say this is by a lawmaker who's no longer lawmaker but\nThe department of homeland security Katie Waldman said that she's a spokesperson on Monday the current caravan is quote what we see day in and day out at the border as a result of the well advertised in well known catch and release loopholes\nSo catchy released vilified by the president the president's been unable to change it because politically\nIt's been a time bomb remember catch released separate families didn't go well now they're saying this the catcher released will be converted to twenty days we will hold you with your kid\nOr kids you got to show that it's yours ... son or daughter\nNever to then you gotta have a choice of twenty days they can stay and be jet up to a relative and you can go or you can stay together and you both go that is I think the plan that they're going to be an acting but they will not an act yet because\nI think they sense that there's a chance that could flip on him and be played wrongly Thomas Homan now with boxers contributor on with Laura last night cuts sixteen\nAnd more important thing we need to educate American people around the spy that control our borders by now\nOn this caravan because of the curve and comes across the fun to write because all the loopholes that Congress shoes effects are going to be released which one it ties more of a calm but at the money we're bankrolling the very criminal organizations that smuggle these people are the same smuggle our shame organizations that smaller drugs while I'm gone to kill more of a choice it's\nSo it's a there's a there's gangs there's people legitimately say they have no choice they have to run they wanted something better for the kids regardless it doesn't matter every country uh worth its salt has control over their borders Mark Krikorian Center for

things that could change I even talked about this uh like you mentioned the other day on stage we were looking at what happens this year we're looking at what happens in twenty sixteen they're twenty Eighteen in these midterms\nAnd I said okay so we've got one estimate that has said the Democrats at two hundred and twenty six seats over the the two hundred and Eighteen\nBut what happens if all of these folks who tell us in the polls that they're showing up\nFor the first time in a midterm don't show up right and they haven't voted before so we can take them at their word and we do we put them in the polls but if they haven't done it before well what happens if this time around they say yeah yeah it's going to be like last time and not going to show up something gets in the way they mean to do it but they're they're busy if they don't show up\nThen the Democrat number drops and drops under a majority in the Republican hold the house so\nMy the lesser to shut this will certainly the better for the party in power just Republicans in particular\nThat looks right now better for the Republicans in particular if it's a low turnout election that's what our model showed\nAnd and the idea behind that is not to just to tell what might happen in twenty Eighteen but your question about what are we making these polls shattered poster give you these scenarios give it and people terms

one\nI got an email from a democratic strategist who I trust the other day saying is obviously what I said several weeks ago doesn't hold a little Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota absolutely and this is not a favorable math but you have seen with Kavanaugh as it's kind of opposite directions in terms of solidifying the Republican base in terms of\nThe Senate but in these districts in the house there are too many retirements I think for Republicans to overcome that I think the way these districts are carved up I also think we haven't talked about one important issue in terms of democratic voters which of the gender gap so to speak out against that'll\nTake that one by one first off a did things change since Kevin\nI'm a little bit yeah and I think that's generally right I think the Republicans at this point are favored to hold the Senate and the mechanism oh you're not willing to say that it's likely\nI'm I don't go with what with weeks to go I mean here's another thing about you mentioned twenty sixteen right let's let's look at the range of possibilities here I'm not going to say that it's likely but at this point okay what's happened since Kavanaugh is\nThat these red states these Republican states Tennessee Texas had on the Texas um you know you got you well you know you've got to Arizona Nevada the Democrats are trying to\nBut but North Dakota Montana Missouri all these places the predominant most of them voted of course for President Trump at the time\nThe election has nationalized to a large degree and the president wants to well I think I I don't know what he wants what I thought he was\nWell we'll talk about that in a second 'cause he's he's a major factor especially in the house but you know speaking of the Senate look you've got now by two to one people telling us that they are voting on national issues as opposed to local one interesting so you remember you know that'll all politics is local pasta and not so much this year okay\nSo when it becomes nationalized we look at that and we go okay well what's the hardest and break out in the states while they're red states that Republican states and that is making it harder for either democratic incumbents in these places to to hold on a or or for for them to get traction in a place for you mentioned Texas\nAs well we still got you know cruise ahead of her work there so that's an example of where that nationalization of the election has at this point any way kept the Republicans in in in maybe favorite don't send a couple of things uh it looks\nLike Marsha Blackburn one from trailing almost the entire time with Bob Corker was I I told you so and now is Bob Cooke was reluctant to endorse served as he ... a dead now Democrats do breads and but now he's doing a fundraiser for and she's considered to be up um I don't want to tell the poster the number but six\nAnd then you look at the same roughly seven by cruise so we re established himself as someone said you know that was on a to point race that seems to have happened since Kavanaugh Heidi Heitkamp is down double digits it looks like it's lost and then in Montana we have test drove by one or two\nYeah I had him up by three Tatar advisor um we also had a had black burn up in ah in Tennessee and we pulled there a couple of weeks ago and how much uh we had eight or some other places that had it like you said six I've seen double digits I've seen another one just out that has the march and a little bit smaller\nBut it's a consistent pattern of her being up there\nBut again that's ... you know I I I haven't measured yet the Taylor Swift endorsement effect will so we'll see you know at that as anything to do it got to a different set of social media um you know we'll see if if registrations or people you know get turned on her activated because of that but having said all of that\nYou know we've got a case here again nationalized election I mean that the British and cases that is a perfect example of where the Democrats might have wanted to make it about state issues about local issues as long as it's nationalized attracts a attract\nSaturday a month and he's here and he's a the name of his book is where did you get this number the outstanding poster with CBS just bring us inside the numbers Maggie room as the other statement that she made is this your gender gap\nSo what did you find on the gender gap we know that Hillary Clinton won the female vote but didn't win the white females hotel where they think it was fifty three percent went to Trump where we're at now\nOh there is certainly a gender gap yeah you've got a you know Nineteen points on the difference between a how men are voting men are voting Republican women voting voting for Democrats but there's there's something a here's what's underneath that and this is in these competitive house districts\nWhat's happened is there's ... there's a lot of women a lot of black voters generally we think it's about a third of everybody\nWho said that the economy is good you know typically that would favor the party in power right the economy's good therefore the direction of good and I think just\nCame out with the most competitive country in the world for the first time since two thousand eight you would think that that that could be just paved pays you wait till the election\nAnd and you know one would suspect that would be the way I've seen interviews now uh with with a number of Republican officials that that's the way some of them had wanted to run and argue the case in the metro but um these folks at the same time they say the economy is good and there's like I said there's a lot of a lot of women in this group\nThey say they do not like the direction of the country\nAnd those two things are sometimes correlated but they're not for these folks they they don't like the direction of the country you unpack that a little bit\nAnd frankly they do not like the way the the president is handling his job they give him a very\nLow approval rating that's part of what do they see as echo a race that he's number forty one um it's in the ... it's in the low forties and it has been I mean look we I think we've talked about this before it's one of the more stable is the most stable approval ratings we've said what are you on board yeah you know it it doesn't move that's a function of partisanship too but the point here is\nIf if the president is a factor for these folks and and he certainly is and they don't like the direction of the country they're breaking Democrat for that reason despite the fact\nThat they say the economy is good and that's one of the things that's under pending that gender Capra\nI so when you were on Sunday you said something about where the house is trending you said since this summer what has happened\nSince the summer that our Model S had creeping slowly but towards the Democrats so there's this two twenty six I I told you about earlier it's a little over the two Eighteen you know we had a just a seat or so over the majority line earlier in the summer not a dramatic swing but it's it it is one\nBut that's why I also want to emphasize there's there's a couple of things going on one is that turn out when is the fact that you know one five of these voters said they haven't voted before you take them out of the equation the Democrats\nDo not do as well Republicans do better\nBut you know the the other part of this is that difference between the house and the Senate and part of the reason for that is that these districts are the kind of suburban and a little more affluent they're the kind of voters where there might be a little more swing and that's why we're that's why we're watching I'm so close\nI Want to talk about national trends and talk about the Senate so you see it's spreading out right now if uh after you believe that the election was this afternoon you believe that house goes to Democrats\nWell that's what the model says but it's a but like I said I really want to emphasize that turnout point and and that is a big variable here or that and the difference of that's why you know if it were today yes yes and if it were today we've got the Dems have two twenty six\nBut having said that a lot of these racist why the individual races are really close I mean I Would not be surprised if each of these comes down to a few thousand votes so I'm going to have my hands full and election\nWhen guys like you were saying all these these uh election had Hillary Clinton up a too close to call I said why don't you think you could go the other way up see if she they're telling you it's too close to call\nJust because somebody's up by one or two points it doesn't mean it's going to go their direction and ended up going ah Trump's direction and a lot of those states Michigan or Wisconsin where to come back a few more minutes I Want to ask the question is it possible to be a compromiser and be successful in politics today\nHave fry and kill made [noise]\n... von ... entertaining on independent thing or listen to weekdays nine to noon right here on W.

front of the other end and things have been opening up a including this race um there's ways to spin opening up and we're we went\nFrom a double digits down now single digits and that was before the debate and that was before we went up on TV we outraged Debbie Stabenow last quarter three point six to one point eight she has\nThree point O. and hands to our two point seven we are really going down the stretch strong because people believe in this message people want to believe in the American dream again and I'm living in American Dream and I want to protect your future generations\nWell

failing our inner cities and how I'm going to work to\nNot only rebuild vital infrastructure but also take a look at transportation and transit\nOr taking a look at increasing public safety growing our businesses with people and lift themselves out of poverty a these are all things that resonate and people recognize that uh my core values or faith and family got in country service but for self\nAnd they recognize that Debbie Stabenow is running because she can't do anything else and I'm running despite the fact that I can\nI Love every body and I wanted to bring my experience in the

something stupid I'll call them out there that's that's that's what it's all about we have to put God and country first in that order and then I'm going to represent the state of Michigan not a party Debbie Stabenow represents her party she boats with Chuck Schumer Ninety five percent of the time and she goes to Hillary\nClinton Ninety three percent of the time she hyper partisan and that hurts Michigan right now with Michigan if your commonsense impartial and objective\nHaving a Democrat Senator and Gary Peters who we're going to make the senior senator and having me a as a\nAs an independent thinking conservative in the Republican Party on the list and that that means that Michigan has a voice Michigan has a seat at the table with garbage who's in the majority or who's in the White House that's a much stronger position from Michigan to be in and it makes logical good sense and having the experience that I have a in the top of environments\nIn Iraq and ask also growing

with yesterday a there are unloading stuff that they saw again in a ... this isn't surprising in the least and let me be clear here what we've seen in this market is they pulled back\nIt is not a correction it's not a bear market or the bull market the great bull market at the last nine years is not over it continues and a little context here pulled back happen once every nine months\nI think we've had about eighty five of them since World War two so this is a once a year a current sometimes to hear a not surprising happens all the\nTime so what do you think about this new ranking they came out and says we are our economy's number one in the world\nLove it love it well and you got to say hey we're growing faster than Europe China's in the toilet right it's a U.S it is doing really well right now there was a\nFamous mutual fund manager today who's calling for people to rotate out of Europe and into us stocks nobody thought this was going to happen I have to tell you the heavy betting was elsewhere because we've had such a strong market for so long for so many years you know the natural assumption a odds would happen at the market can couldn't continue this long\nBut it's fundamental striving that's right I mean this is reality this isn't a lot of air this isn't a lot of nonsense isn't it isn't a lot of who we\nAre this isn't the dot com melt down there's actually great earnings behind this or we just had Netflix announced that they had a seven\nMillion new subscribers in the quarter and a quarter right and they think and they're and they're throwing money at this business like you cannot believe they have had so much success\nOr I think ... has not done tech has a way to go here everybody said fang I'll forget the Sox are over ... so that Facebook that's apple that Amazon that's Netflix that's Google may go up anymore\nNot true my friend you know what the dirty little secret of this market is is that everybody every journalist in New York and Washington thanks oh you've gotta have Trump Trump is terrible but in reality they're making so many people wealthy in this country\nThat he's got a lot of converts because of that\nSo you know what it takes to take a movie you need investors and to do that that extra money by definition no go out and I'll pay into music or take a take a risk on a movie\nBecause I have extra money you don't usually make your living on movies so sweet she's going outside to get those funds and now you see more movies being made you see the salaries going up so you see Los Angeles Hollywood or wherever they decided to film sometimes in Canada maybe less\nThey are feeling the effects of a booming economy\nThat has you know he was going to feel the effect Albuquerque New Mexico where Netflix is building its next big a studio where they going to have like thousands of people go and the other thing they're doing the Hollywood through their hands up on and gave up on his rom coms that that the romantic comedy is back and it's on Netflix\nWhich is good because I'm a hopeless romantic really know [laughter] 'cause they don't ever fall for that again\nLet me let me say that what you what's not clear about this and it was actually in the earnings statement they're talking about how many millions of followers these young stars have on Instagram Seventeen million for the leading Scott star from Netflix so you know forget everything you know about what works in Hollywood they're rewriting the book here\nSo does it bother you at all these other store they came out that our deficit is now a seven hundred and thirty billion dollars\nI don't well they don't love it we have to finance it rates are going higher the debt will cost us more period full stop don't love that we have to find a way to spend less\nWe we we did bringing additional revenue but it does know strip the automatic withdrawals from our checking account\nWell yeah we're good at that they are what we know how to do right\nAnd be the person who would say because I needed the money for defense I had to trade off on some of these social programs jury at some point maybe it's a re election of President Trump someone's got to go in there and a bipartisan Simpson Bowles way again and present some type of political cover way to make spending more sustainable\nSo you're saying no Medicare for all is that what you're telling me I mean that's one thing I mean I think that or we have you uh do you or just saying even the defense department says we have enough missiles we have enough right thanks\nSo okay so it's not really about defense it's really about the entitlement programs that's the thing that really drives us over the edge to the question is how do you manage that right or is that about having people as they approach their elderly year's\nFall out of these programs at early I mean you don't you get into them later in life because our lifespan is so much longer I think that's a closer answer but this idea of Medicare for all\nDoes not work and why does it work because of the money the dollars and cents we can't afford that and why why why would you at Tel corporate America to stop\nGiving your employees healthcare insurance this is a program has worked since World War two hundred and fifty three million Americans get their coverage through their employer for the love of God don't put a knife in the back of that well\nWe love it a news Corp we got great health care and I love it and if you will to business and say I got news for you don't have to spend on health care they'll high five you and say thank you very much I guess what the quality will go down nobody\nReinforces in Medicare they all need supplemental I Know that for a fact that's right and so that's for some people
