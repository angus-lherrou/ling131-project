and for just a few bucks a month you can watch the show you can get the pod cast chat with all the great folks in the chat room because they're fabulous by the way and\nWe have contests you can come see the show and the list goes on and on the on the head over to get Kim Dotcom once again that's get Kim Dotcom get all three hours of the show it's great for when you're walking exercising driving because after all knowledge is power a time in Scottsdale, Arizona hello there Tom\nBlow their Kemp what's going on well I have a\nQuestion uh I'm just give it a little set up here I'm a dentist\nAnd ah have ah a website that I have one phone line right now I Want to try to put together for another part of my practice and I've been toying with the idea of putting a ... a function I'm not sure what you call it a in the website to where people could ask questions before they came in\nAnd the question I Would have for you is it is a beneficial or that you you would do is just so easy to do and of course what kind of back up to I Need to have as far as the employment of people to support that to the question is and what have you\nAlways all yeah all really good questions by the way Tom I'm you know we read deployed shop dot commando dot com\nAnd ah you know we put a chat function in the shopping website oh my gosh it's amazing you know uh how how many people have basic question than him by you having a human being\nThere it really will help with your return on your investment are you thinking that you're going to get overwhelmed by these questions\nWell obviously I have to have someone to play so I just recently was approached by a company that said what they would do is they would have ah\nThey employ individuals to support the ah the ... function and how that would work as they would give me thirty quit or I Would give them thirty questions ... ... a perspective of clients would ask them the nose so the third question so I Would give them the interest as well so\nAs I as a person would call him they would get a hold of this company and they would have if they asked a question of if she had the the canned answer that I've already given\nBut of course I'd almost shouldn't ... she goes to one of those dirty question yeah\nAnd I got and here's the reason why I'm hasn't paying the fact is that I think if you were dealing with a product okay and I'm not saying that you're dentistry is not a product\nBut you're also providing a very personalized service right and I don't know if that would work with a personalized service such as yours doctor I'm like we we looked into that for the shop to but part of us\nIn our business is that I Want people to know that you know we're with them right we're not a bunch of robots that they can depend upon us they can trust us and to a large extent is that I have to trust you with my family members and friends and also with myself or my oral history and my real hygiene right\nSo so I Would be hesitant to doing that I Would put a check up on the Web site see what kind of volume that you get and you you are able\nTo turn it off you can say that it's only available from eight to five so maybe there's a gallery guy in the office that you could say you know what you're going to get it a couple of hours a day you're going to get a couple of hours a day a couple of hours a day and you may find that you are truly\nIn fact getting the same question time and time again\nOf which then you know that you need to put maybe a different button on the website make something more prominent or maybe there could be part of those thirty questions later on\nBut I think you'll find that the volume isn't going to be that high and the people that will that you'll engage will be people that you can convert to a a paying client\nBecause they're going to feel that human touch now when you start looking at different chat depending upon where you get your website it may already be built in as a function may cost you a couple of hundred or maybe a couple of bucks a month for that\nIf you're building your site from scratch they have names like than desk chat is free uh there's also a live chat and there's also live agent um are you building the side or somebody building it for you\nOr your school though the we do have a website it's already been built and we have another company building a another website all over but but when we have a third tempting as calling me about that in this chat function\nAnd I don't I wouldn't I wouldn't add I wouldn't let the third party do it yet I Would I Would I Would just I Would encourage you just to test the waters do kind of questions you get\nAnd then you can also lift some of those questions under FA cues as part of the website but if you have a person behind this instead of an automated robot and I know that there's a lot of AI that's happening in chats and box and things like that\nOr is it you're able to say you know now that I've helped you can we make an appointment right now the doctors able to see you next Tuesday so then we can immediately convert that inquiry into a paying customer thank you so much for your call come back we're going to talk about browsing

Supreme Court today and how important those nominations are how pointing you know important on those appointments are and I think our kids need to recognize how it's going to affect them and their children and possibly\nBoy thank you so much for saying that that is exactly right and what makes it even more important\nIs that this case which was decided which which essentially was the first case that led to the Jim Crow laws that came to African Americans in central slavery for a century that case was decided on the same judicial philosophy\nAs the as the four justices the conservative justices on the court which will be five of justice Kavanaugh's confirmed yeah so this is a story that is it is then but it is also now\nAbsolutely and then you think about how long ago that was how long it's been going on but tell us about\nThis give us to just that the story\nOn Easter Sunday Eighteen Seventy three a group of a hundred and fifty heavily on white supremacists invaded a small town in Louisiana cold cold facts and the town was defended by an equal number of Friedman which were African American ...\nThey were lightly armed they feed the African American surrendered almost immediately there were totally out on\nThe white supremacist took their guns and then slaughtered as many as a hundred were burned to death or shot stabbed\nBecause Louisiana was not going to do anything about this these murders federal government indicted Ninety eight of these white supremacist invaders for violating the freedom is writer free assembly\nFree were convicted they appeal to the Supreme Court and it Eighteen Seventy six the court handed down a ruling that not only freed the murderers\nBut set in motion a series of other cases which as I said before resulted in the Jim Crow laws so this case United States versus corruption\nWhich by the way not not even that many law students read about ... was one of the most important decisions Supreme Court history and I thought this story the full story should be available to high school students and their parents because we're not going to make any progress as a nation if we don't\nAcknowledge what our history\nI drew was very true week we can't change what we don't acknowledge and that certainly I even say that a lot of people may not agree with me but tearing down the Confederate statues and not look good is that that's the part of history had happened\nYeah it well\nOne of his statues that was torn down\nWas a statue dedicated to the white supremacist invaders in New Orleans wow it praise them for defending white supremacy so one of those statues it no longer exists because the white white school to the cold facts massacre of\nX Y it excuse me people on the other side of the cold facts massacre so these people this monument actually praised a hundred and fifty men who's a hundred and fifty men who slaughtered a hundred other man\nThat's ... ... it should have never been out but nonetheless it's a part of history but tell me how do you run across as there are where you researching looking for a new story how did you run across\nThis this ... court case well I\nI'm a I'm a constitutional law scholar by training and I've done a number of of books and one of the books I did for adults traced the Supreme Court decisions I was interested in plus ... versus Ferguson to separate but equal case and I discovered\nIn researching that that the beginnings of that went way back when way back to just after the civil war\nAnd in research in those cases crook shank just jumps off the page at you and the\nCircumstances and how it was decided and the justices that decided it and what their ... the fact that what they did was sit the constitution into their social and racial views that struck me as a terribly important story\nAnd a big cause of the current political environment I must say I'm there were publishers who might have not\nBeen so anxious to publish this not shied away from it they didn't think anybody would be interested\nIn and now one of the really\nGood things that are happening is that I think people are interested no democracies and unforgiving system if\nYou don't get involved the other guy gets to run the show and\nI think that now maybe we are getting people to where they recognize the need to be involved and I think these stories need to be there to help them\nAbsolutely I I I Hope more than ever in these next few elections that people are waking up and they're seeing you know the demise of America kind of take place right before their eyes and do\nWe complain if you don't have anything to your right right right right\nNow so I'm used to this story um began in Philadelphia is independence hall with the signing of the constitution and so what do you mean by that\nWell the the way the constitution is is how people\nI'm ... tell us a little bit about the history of women I forgot heart\nOkay I'm back in Nineteen Ninety eight I had a pretty high pressure job and I was stressed and feeling overwhelmed and I thought let me find somebody to help me and I'm\nSure that the women who are feeling like this and just help us worked through these challenges because the deal was just too heavy and\nSo I've been praying or who do you say send the right lady and one mourning the loss of lady [laughter] oh I invited some ladies over to my home and we had a prayer breakfast we called it and\nUm we had a great time and then one of my neighbors ask me or can we do that again I get your house and she said well if I found a place can we meet again and that's how a Wieber Waco I felt like\nWe were going to get it right if we could get it right everybody around us five families in our communities can get it right and that was Twenty years ago\nYou know and I'll bet that every woman who is going through what you were going through at that time 'cause I I got both my hands raised up\nUm you know you're saying yes we need that we need that fellowship we need a time where we can kind of let go and be vulnerable because when you're in the workplace and it's a pressure cooker and you're moving and shaken\nThere's nowhere to go and you can't let him see you sweat so you got to be able to let your hair down somewhere\nYes yes and God blessed us um and that I had I have a um background\nAs an educator so I took those skills as an educator and began to develop Mosley sessions where we could have a safe environment interact with one another and and I don't just stand there and talk we actually help one another\nYeah because you know the one thing about it is that um women like to have a safe place to talk and to to talk about their feelings and all of that where it doesn't go out and nobody judging them um I can just say this it'll be okay with that\nExactly yeah that is actually what attracted me to Waco and I've been a member for Seventeen years and came in um after a really bad breakup with the job I'm not working\nConfidence was destroyed a little bit depressed and walked in and the women that were there and ... mhm and more importantly as the ... was talking to stop to that now wait a minute I Know I'm not the Lone Ranger here\n[laughter] and it was that like resetting ... ... that I have found the place where I can feel and then after you heal you go help someone else he ... and that's been our secret sauce all these years\nAnd that's such a blessing because we need it and a lot of women don't have women friends and we all need that\nYeah yeah you really do I know that you um you provide mentoring to teenage girls talk about that for a moment\nCafe you want to talk about that\nSure well it's I W times of crisis a program and it's a twelve mine a leadership development personality development Christian living skills development program and I say it\nIs how we teach young ladies you can be young hip and cool and still live a Christian license\nRight and go\nThrough 'em we give them different practical skills\nHow to balance a checkbook how to look at a I'm In college how to handle dating one about premarital sex what does that mean yeah all of those those classes are facilitated by\nSubject matter expertise women and our ministry who have that kind of training and\nIt also more importantly helps them is that Bush or reestablish their relationship with Jesus Christ and we're saying it gives me chills even just talk about it we have seen young women\nTurn their lives around in their teenage years\nThat is changing this war oh\nYeah yeah\nAnd then they go out and and we have some on our board now that have come back to the Atlanta area we have others that have started a coating schools for minority kids with doctors lawyers have entrepreneur\nThat next generation is safe because we know what we've the seeds we've planted\nYeah and those young women\nMhm mhm [noise] um tell folks where they can go to learn more about women after God's own heart

David's Bridal service are both very legit how much is the one from David's Bridal\nTwo options and Sally a thirty dollar or Seventy dollars service and they're offering you a ten dollar discount if you sign up on the email that they and\nAnd the one from hitched which is similar I think it goes up maybe the high end so little higher but not a lot and so I think that's a perfectly legitimate way to do it but um this is an area I'm so glad you asked me about this you never want to use some UFO site to do the name\nChange and\nAnd do you think that it's better to go through one of these surveys or to try to do it yourself I Know you start the security off\nAnd yeah this is completely a convenience question and I'd say if you're doing it for convenience go with a higher level when for either those sites because they do more of the work for you\nOkay that's really get to know Christianity that and I never thought about the identity theft guided that I was thinking about how much work I've been going to be to get all of that switched over to\nThink about that you know you try to save work and may create a big hassle for you with that entity theft and again Heather congratulations on your upcoming festivities Michael is with us on the Clark Howard\nShow hello Michael hey clock I was a great thank you you have a three year old who's already ready to start saving money like crazy [laughter] what kind of what kind of job does your three year old ...\nAs he is pretty much an eater and fire that's about it [laughter]\nSo he's in the Gulf three year old very well what are you trying to do for him with money\nI really want to do and I know there's a nine year old cleric or college yes and I really want to hear\nThat are ... literature another state\nYes completely unless there are a small number of states\nThat have a pre pay tuition plan which is a form of a five twenty nine plan and those transfer very unfavorably to a different state but a traditional five twenty nine plan which is one that is an investment plan\nThat you put your money on it grows tax free it's spent tax free is usable\nAny of the fifty states for school and you're eligible once a year that let's say you don't end up liking your state plan you're allowed to even as he remain a resident of your state you're allowed to move\nThe money to a different state plant okay and I have you seen my five twenty nine plan guide ahead not and that's where I have at Clark dot com\nOr my list of the best plans in the country and I have hyper links because a number of states have multiple plans and they may have to good plans and three bad plans or something like that so I've got a link to the best plan available in each state\nOkay no college is one thing what are the odds that\nIn your family culture is your three year old going to college no matter what\nA ... I'm going to ... they're just hoping it will\nThe reason I asked that he's you know with the five twenty nine and they're great and less\nA kid doesn't go to college and you don't have another child you can you can move the money to ... the tax treatment or five twenty nine money is great if it's used for eligible college expenses and his plane rotten if it's not used for college\nOkay yeah we're going to ask if there's something else [noise] [laughter]\nWell that's why I asked the question because if the odds favor your child going to college then you just go ahead and do the five twenty nine because it's the best choice\nFor a kid but my preference is always for you to save the maximum you can\nIn your own name first before you look at options that might be available to put money aside for a child and my default go to is to you and your bride should be saving the maximum under the law\nIn a Roth IRA before you even consider putting money in a five twenty nine for your child\nOkay because the raw has so much flexibility to it and it grows tax free and then you spend it tax free and retire\nOkay and\nAnd that would be that would be a choice I Would do way before I Would start looking at other things to put money aside for your son\nHow fast and that raw whatever because it's time to use it for college with that so\nSo there's an interesting twist with the wrong if you Fifteen Years from now want to use some of that money for your son's college as long as you leave the earnings of it behind you can pull your contribution money out tax penalty free\nOh okay\nSo it provides an additional level of flexibility that you don't have with the five twenty nine plan you're listening to the Clark Howard show\nDo you hear voices those nagging little voices in your head the voice that remind you every day of all the things you need to do\nMaybe you've been skipping your twice yearly maintenance on your front is an air conditioner not good\nIt's time to get that done right now and get back on track\nSix hundred twenty million for Powerball on Wednesday people in Georgia and around the country are buying lottery tickets by the thousands ws Washington correspondent Jamie ...

available over forty hours each week you're the cart dot\nCom scroll down a little you'll see the phone number or an hour's that off the air advice is available to you\nSo I wanted to talk to you about something that I've been getting a steady number of questions about on the air and ask Clark says well parents trying to figure out\nHow to do allowance to school age kids or how to pay\nSchool age kids for chores whatever's required in your family\nIn order to get allowance and how to do that because how did you used to do that you gave people cash but now more and more\nThe parents have young children don't carry cash themselves I mean why our ATM's disappearing\nAll over the place because caches use so much less than it used to be\nParents using plastic it's all the kids ever see 'em do and the kids plastic is cash so that's led to a bunch of products that it's been a steady stream of product introductions where\nYou have rewrote double cards you as a parent can monitor on an app on your phone or on our website and you can even with some of these cars you can control where your kids spend money\nNow the downside with these card programs is usually you have to pay fees to be part of these programs so you're paying money to be able to give money to your kids which I've never a fan of\nOne in particular though has been really intriguing to people on that screen why\nWhich allows you to use green light as a way to try to encourage your kid to save you know I'm so into the daddy match on retirement plans where\nMy kids is teens as they are the two older ones raging out of this but as they would save money from jobs I'm match it dollar for dollar\nGoing into a Roth IRA to encourage saving not spending\nBut we're talking about where the green light having one of those cards it costs you sixty bucks a year to have the card sixty\nSo that's a lot of money to pay to then have the ability to encourage kids say within the card plan\nSo this is going to be weird\nI Want you to turn back the clock\nAnd what I'd like you to do instead\nIs allowing to your kids were that archaic thing called money give them money you won't have to pay any fees for it kids get the finite and is with the actual money in their hands that they don't get with a plastic cart\nAnd if you can afford to do a match like greenlight does when you allowance a kid if they're willing to save money that they then turned over to you periodically for you to put it\nThe savings account or put an investment account or something like that you tell them the incentive is every dollar they don't spend you're going to match with a dollar to create that concept so somebody comes up with a free card like usa\nNow my kids grew up with usa spending cards or whatever they call them where you have parental control and all that it's all free\nI get free I don't get paying for these things but ultimately I can tell you with my kids even a usa spending card was not nearly as effective teaching the finite and has some money as cash\nGrayson is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Grayson how you doing\nInteractive exhibition about the global refugee crisis presented by Doctors
