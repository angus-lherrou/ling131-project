that this is sort of of vacuuming process you bring in all this data and then you you analyze\nThat can be exceptionally harmful not just to a target or subject like Kavanaugh it can be harmful to other witnesses\nI could and other individuals mentioned they're not saying that these are true statements all they're sharing is the information so historically these have not been made public when we deal with them and litigation\nWe deal with them very carefully or we don't talk about three oh choose until it's been vetted and dealt with by the court and by the prosecutors and defense counsel precisely because they are so unreliable in in the sense of having ... verified information\n[noise] a couple of things John in a while the Republicans are the Democrats are now saying his temperament or they can vote for him because his temperament they didn't like to have some of his sarcastic grin and tough to re towards a Democratic senators after their questions when they asked him about his year book and things like that or does it does temperament bother you\n[noise] I I'm not concerned about his temperament look I Wish he had not talked about the Clintons and made some of those aside or they didn't help\n'em or they played into this narrative but there is nothing in the record\nAnd this guy's but on the court a long time to suggest that he has a temperament problem to the contrary I lawyers speak glowing Lee of them they say that he's actually a very civil that he's very professional he gets very high marks in that sense I think that you have to consider the subject matter\nThis man was accused of being ... not just someone who attempted to salsa woman I in high school but has another woman who is who essentially saying that he led a virtual raped gang in high school\nYeah yeah it it\nMost of us would be a bit ticked off and on top of that he\nFelt that he was unable to speak for ten days as he just took the shall after shall under the water law\nSo hundreds of law professors signed a petition to make sure Brett Kavanaugh doesn't get on the spring of the Supreme Court are among the people that would not sign it is Alan Dershowitz a cut twenty four\nSeven hundred law professors signed a letter to ask me to sign it I refused I wrote a dissent saying he now no longer has the judicial temperament well can you imagine if this were a liberal who had been appointed by liberal president who had been accused and it would act and similarly\nI don't think a single one of those professors would have signed that letter they will fail the shoe on the other foot test\nSenator Booker why I like to know is just dead wrong this is all about partisanship iffy opposite\nWhat's happening and if it was the Democrats who are putting a candidate everybody would be having the opposite way and so it is partisanship and I think the premise of our constitution never intended the confirmation process to look anything like\nSo liberal attorney or a liberal attorney would not sign a a former professor a and he's happy being liberal or would not sign onto this evening fact he's a little offended by it or you\n[noise] uh well I actually these there's a couple of letters out there I also declined to sign\nUp by the although I don't sign these letters general it because I've never understood their value a there are hundreds and hundreds of law professors and you can line them up\nOr in any number of ways by and so I I generally don't sign these letters even when I agree with them I don't agree with this one\nBy the the the problem that we're having with with the cabinet or\nA nomination is that you have the stereotypes being put forward by that somehow become\nThe true you know the the you know many professors were taken aback by Kavanaugh's reference to the politics\nOf the moment should he have done that no he should not have done that because it worked\nAgainst his interest also you know judges or justice are expected to just sort of stand aside and quite frankly he didn't have to everyone else was making those points but does that mean that it is now the temperament no none of these professors none of us\nHave been under this type of pressure you know it it is unimaginable to have people on national news talking about you being part of a high school raped gang and you have to be silent and then suddenly you walk through a door and they say All right\nAnswer those charges and yeah he looked like he was going to blow a gasket but you know that's a very human response and so I think that we have to have some degree\nOf logic here that just because he was angry and I think he was angry in that hearing doesn't mean necessarily he's an angry person\nAnd I see a lot of good judges they can lose their temper uh and they're still good judges are there are people um [noise]\nUh you got to keep your composure I guess uh down in the ... he's never been angry John this or how does that play out today we

in Kaiser an old friend affords that the alleged party those people along with\nThree more work question But Kevin wasn't in either was Dr Ford and that bothers people but we're already watched them and they would buy the scope of what the\nWhite House told and Senate Judiciary committee said to go after so they wanted an FBI investigation and guess who's very upset Chuck Schumer who can never look up has to read everything as if it's in another language and Dianne Feinstein they're both addressing the press right now are talking about how inadequate\nThis FBI investigation was\nOf course the FBI says I'm taping everything I'm going to tell you the scope I'm going to tell you we're supposed to do and here is the result of the lead me out of the politics so when we pull some of that down oh you know what's happening with that uh as uh the investigative press coverage is going on right now in fact you want to dip into a little Chuck Schumer\nThe army\nOr raining or call to make the directives\nThat the White House and counsel McGahn sent to the FBI public because we believe it greatly constrained the investigation\nFrom the get go the fact that there's only one document in there for a hundred senators is another example [noise]\nOf constraining the ability of all senators and the American public to see the whole truth and nothing but thank you [laughter]\nWhat is he talking about the fact is just one copy is this thing called privacy when you do a background check the one thing the FBI does well is not leak out what's in it\nBecause they care about your privacy you're applying for a job in the government they want to make sure you don't have a a an ugly past it needs to be uncovered once they find that out in green light you didn't will turn around and say\nHere's what we found\nSo that's why they had one copy that's why they're moving through it that's operations and isn't it amazing that Senator Schumer a is so concerned about the scope memo when Republicans have been asking for ... them or the Russian investigation and that's been going up for two years and we still have no idea what the scope mammal looks like\nSo right away the background check and the FBI investigation that was called for by Dick Durbin and others that Kavanaugh was pushed to ask for himself and they got seven days and they are so unbelievably let down by the conclusions\nHere's Diane Feinstein listen close what we review\nToday in a very limited time I was there I had to leave a report is in part and I had the opportunity to reach some but not all of it it looks to be a product of an income\nPlease investigation that was limited perhaps by the White House I don't know\nWhat the White House certainly blocked access to millions of documents from judge Kavanaugh's record high knows that and ensure that Ninety percent of his emails and memos weren't available for the center for the public and the hearing\nYou really see what she's doing now she's bringing up the old issue since this guy's got so many documentation and they put them five hundred thousand pieces of paper on Kavanaugh's background she's bringing up his candidacy in general and a

and what I think I think people are finding out now is it is to have questions about Dr Ford or Deborah Ramirez but on the ... is not to not like women\nIt's to be kind of attracted to the way we conduct our legal system and understand that a lot of women looking at this has sons brothers and fathers and they say themselves if they were in this spot\nWould they not want a presumption of innocence\nAnd just because women have not had a fair shake through history in America not being able to vote slowly understanding below force in the workplace and maybe not being getting enough attention with sexual assault delegation in the past\nDoes that mean good men have to suffer with allegations and be destroyed without any proof and when women are up there they're not just resent representing themselves there is at representing the male people in their lives whether it's uncles friends\nOr the teacher that they like whoever\n... people have sons and daughters I hate to tell

out kick the coverage and all throughout the brand new book Republicans buy sneakers speakers to how the left is ruining sports with politics clay was that the last straw does that help sell the premise of your book that ad buy Nike\nVote is that a good answer you\nKnow I was a I was disgusted when I saw the ad and I thought that Nike was going to be paying calling ... millions of dollars but simultaneously I was like man this just further proves the thesis of my book which is\nHard left wing politics as an infiltrated and in fact the sports and it's starting to make things awful um and it was I think you can trace it back to ESPN decision to give Caitlyn Jenner and and I asked her bravery I think covering Michael Sam like he was a modern day jak\nYou Robert sick which is the way he was covered I think all of those things have conspire to makes for the my opinion the toy chest to Hawaii a place we go to escape\nThe serious things in life they turned it into an ESPN in particular has turned into a A R left wing political organization and the NFL struggles over the past two years with their ratings dropping ... percent I think are emblematic of that struggle is just not an ideal situation\nAnd it continues to get worse and worse than that my book is kind of punching back against that idea what I Love about sports is the ultimate American meritocracy doesn't matter if you're that\nDoesn't matter where you went to school doesn't matter anything about your life other than argue better than the guy or girl in front of you and I think that's why we all his race in sports so much in this country\nYeah definitely winners and losers and there's a way to track it I'll give you an example I mean might be out to his wrapped in what the sixtieth around to the baseball draft but you know ... favorite time of the ... but he went out and proved himself\nThurman months in son gets drafted he was not able to get a double a it doesn't matter who your parents are you got to perform on the field and I think that's important what I also heard is things might be changing ESPN I talked to an author that's there and he came on Fox and he says the mandate came down\nNo more talking about politics no more tweeting anything with social media about politics or you could be terminated clay they see the desperate they see how bad is getting\nYeah look I mean I think the ah the fact that Bob ... yoked Disney here's a sensible head of ESPN came out and said hey we got to political\nRatings have started to collapse it's been making a substantial impact and worse than that\nI'm a First Amendment absolute is right I think that we should all have a robust marketplace that we should be able to go out to argue whatever we believe that when you look at the way that ESPN treated a guy like Curt Schilling\nThey fired him for saying hey you know what I agreed with North Carolina that you should be using the public bathroom all your birth certificate right spot like an opinion that a lot of people agree\nGo crazy or right wing opinions they fired him for that and Janelle hill comes out and calls the president the United states a white supremacist and says his entire cabinet it's built a white supremacist and said that everybody who voted for Donald Trump as a white supremacist and they don't do anything to her and so I think\nWhat a lot of people who are reasonable across the country from all different political persuasion was wait a minute it's one thing if you\nSay no politics at all it's entirely something different if you were war some aren't for say the United states is a white supremacist and then you hire somebody else for having an opinion about a transgender bathroom laws which wants to be honest everybody has an opinion on that if you're a private life why should not be able to share what you believe about politics\nAbsolutely be clear where do you say that people will go wait Muhammad Ali and Jackie Robinson and Jack johnson move the needle in America through sport and that's all that's continuing today what do you say to people like that\nWhile I Would say several things and it's a good argument I spend a lot of time on that first of all Mohammed Ali was dealing with something that impacted everyone ... he was drafted into the Vietnam War he chose not to go because he didn't agree with the decision to to fight that war\nAnd he suffered amazing consequences for their he faced prison time they stripped away his championship felt he had for years the inability to earn a living at all\nCalling Catholic the president of the United states came out and said very brave of you to be protesting like this call it a he got a continued to play had zero impact to his multi million dollar contract status and now\nNike is paying him millions of dollars a year to be in an advertising campaign despite\nThe fact that he's not even an apple it to me there's a difference in a big way between paying Charles Barkley who's very outspoken millions of dollars 'cause he's outspoken and he's good at sports and just paying somebody for being outspoken the other thing at\nAmerica in two thousand Eighteen is nothing like America in Nineteen sixty eight in ... because of guys like Jackie Robinson\nAnd Mohammed Ali the best or your gets to play regardless\nOf what the color of their skin is on guard was of what their sexual orientation is as I say in the book what if Bill Belichick found out that a you know transgender war was the best quarterback in the NFL does anybody doubt that go belly check would play him the NFL is the open mic meritocracy\nYeah he ... he helped cut the parents in a claim you real quick I think that's a that's a great point you brought up and what bothers me most about Colin Kaepernick and that ad\nThey are choosing colon Catholics point of view over law enforcement black white has yeah like you're in law enforcement he's against the inequitable a oppression of minorities in this country law enforcement but hasn't uh opposite opinion that\nNike sided with Capra Nick it's a you know he's in by the British freedom he's a backup date to Gail gathered and he could get on the field\nHere to things that ... that Nike is paying him millions of dollars to break ... said she had imminently\nPolice are modern day slave doctors said that he also war socks depicting police officers as pigs ... for the NFL for the San Francisco forty niners I'm that to me is inexcusable I don't know why you would want to alienate people I don't know why any brand for that matter\nWants to walk into an athletic apparel store and think when I'm buying for one of my three kids wait a minute what's the call\nIt's a bit of this company I just think it's inexcusable I think it's a bad
