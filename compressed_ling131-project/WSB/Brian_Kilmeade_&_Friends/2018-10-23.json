back\nI think it is Brian but it's going to take time but I think it's also going to take\nA a lot of people to stand up and say no and I think the most uncivil thing we've seen in our country was the treatment of Brett Kavanaugh during the confirmation here which is why I thought it was so important a matter of fact Mitch McConnell rallied Republicans Lindsey Graham\nA Chuck Grassley end the president of course and Kevin himself just say no we're not giving into this we're not going to\nWe're not going to behave the same way we're not going to stand up and scream and through and through\nAnd throw things that people but we're going to stand our ground and I think that's what they did and I think that's what a lot of people simply have to do is just say no we're not going to scream back at you were not going to throw things we're not going to engage in violence but we're going to say no to you and we're going to do the right thing and be have the right way and that's going to prevail\nMaybe a I say I don't love the fact that they're too close to a screamed at either a I don't think that's right right I mean bottom line is\nA she's a Seventy seven year old woman who is accomplished a lot in her life I Would agree with the way she approaches things I also think she's being selfish in maintaining leadership and not turning it over to another generation but she deserves to be treated with respect I thought that they used to be a fear of treating someone disrespectful because of the backlash\nMy hope is that both sides stop with the name calling at the top as they run it very intense elections and start saying you know treating people the people who are in a civil way at the top maybe it'll filter down to the grassroots well look\nThat's what we can hope I mean I I Am share your concern that we could reach a tipping point in this country uh where we do sort of get into more and more violence and then it becomes tit for tat escalates\nI've written that that's how World War one started nobody wanted World War one none of the great powers but they all thought the other guy would link first\nUm and of course nobody blinked and I think that's what we have to worry about in this country\nThat's why I think that that you know people should understand there are now two opposing forces or the ... the right can be as violent as or the left it hasn't been in in the ... current atmosphere but it could become that and and so then we really would have more and more violence I Try I think the answer is for good people\nNot to give and not to be cowed by this but but the same token not to engage in\nTears cut eight this is what I was talking about Mitch McConnell [laughter]\nSo what happened is that people in that diner stood up to the guy who was acting in a blue during fashion image but kind of later stuck around later he thank everyone for standing up to him\nYeah no and that's exactly what ... what has to happen I mean good people have to prevail but you don't sit there by me and just be quiet that doesn't work in this environment you have to stand for something\nYou know an old friend of mine a set a wonderful line years ago which I used in the circumstance which is you have to join the side you're on so if you feel Mitch McConnell in that instance is being treated badly you have to stand up and say so you can't just sit there and quietly root for the good guy you have to join I mean that's what\nThat's what America is about we have politics is no shame and engaging in politics is no shame in standing up for what you believe in\nRight here is a Chris Christie after we saw this on Sundays this week with George Stephanopoulos cut not\nOpt to circumvent any pro folks who are outside\nOf acting by hand enacting without any type of civility and I don't care what side of the Florida from when you do that it's wrong to mix public officials have become hostage just inside the real thing you don't want to go out there you're not going to see them you're not going to be able to get a feel for what they're like other than what the cause is worse\nThan I also think the Trump officials but the only place they really feel secure is at Trump a Trump Hotel yeah and that's where they happy as a and that's almost like an enclave arrest but a safe base yeah look at it\nThat the capital of the country ... what we don't want public service to become its own punishment\nI mean this is after all fundamentally an American construct of citizens who come into the government and then go out it's it's not it's not a career as a ... we're not you know it's become that for too many people but fundamentally it is about public service for a brief time in your life\nAnd so I think we ought to him on some level treat these people with a certain level of respect we don't have to agree with him we don't have to approve of them but we cannot get into the gutter I think that way ... madness\nSo there's something

the middle east [noise] they killed this guy I mean you've got everything except the actual crime itself\nLook what advantage to Saudi Arabia have to putting the risk of relations with the United states what is it about this ... what am I missing to think that they would say that this is a good idea\nMy sense is now in the rearview mirror they don't think it was a good idea and I don't think it was a good idea from the beginning how could they miscalculated is way\nSort of extraordinary chose a sign of arrogance if in fact it's true as alleged ... seems to be and and as a ... but see what's even worse and it's how they're dealing with it afterwards and the fact that they're eking out admissions as we go and continuing to ah\nTo not be forthcoming that's going to be a real issue\nWhen we had a we had less outrage after nine eleven about Saudi Arabia would still do the journey of hijackers then we do now so we're seeing here is do you think it's the media outraged that somebody in the media was shot and this is a self interest thing\nNo I don't think at all I think the the Braves and this of this particular act of factors media I think is minor and the fact that it happened in another country because clearly president everyone and his government are are pushing the issue pretty hard\nHere is a what a Bob Corker said cut twenty five\nHe also has made some mistakes and obviously if he's gone fourth and\nMurdered a this journalist um he's now crossed the line and there has to be a punishment at a price to pay for that and and again I'm not rushing the detriment though I think he did it yeah I think he did it\nAh let's let's finish this investigation we have the best in the world at being able to do that we obviously have intercept\nFrom the past that point to involvement at a very high level of less let this play out\nChairman of Foreign Relations Republican so general you have to in the world that I have not experienced but studied you have to deal with bad people in order to achieve your objective you did all the time in Afghanistan obviously in Iraq\nSo Saudi Arabia is not the type of government that we want to emulate but they've been vital to us or you know four fifty sixty Seventy years knowing that there are a counterweight to Iran\nIs it is it not in our best interest to be cavalier and break off relations in an arms deals\nIs there to be street smart is to is to have an objective to keep relations would send a message or do you just say well this is not what we stand for must make a break\nWell it's interesting I think the near term thing right now is the evidence is piled up is to be outraged and make an immediate break with the Saudis but we need to think about tomorrow when do you think about long term be mature we're gonna have a relationship with the kingdom of Saudi Arabia tomorrow next week next year and we should and that's very important so I don't think we should be\nA fought not thoughtful approach on the other hand the farm or a ...\nPort and part of this our our values and how we portray those in the world that's going to be more important long term or legitimacy and credibility in the world so I think we need to take a very firm stand\nBut make sure we're making it for the right reason and to the rest of the world carefully Saudi Arabia is going to pay a price in the relationship with us but there's also going to beat him off\nBecause you know with Iran did to us in Iraq and it might have killed people that you're friendly to you or people that served under you and to allow when Saudi Arabia is diminished or there's a break they flourish\nThat's right I mean you've gotta look at the holistic part of the region in the world and an Iranian outrages we started to take for granted and so we we can't go out of control but at the same time there's no way we can turn our back on this\nTo you wonder why turkey seem so sanctimonious and all this when what they've done to journalists in jail people in this alleged coup from a few years ago do you wonder what their motivation is\nWhen I think you think they're just looking for justice no I think it's interesting I think all countries try to take the moral high ground when given that opportunity and leaders do that and and they suddenly say look what other people are doing because certainly it takes the heat off them and in some ways it brings them a little closer to the world community again so I think it's totally in their interest\nAll right I got to bring it to something else US Army brigadier general Jeffrey smiley was confirmed to be one of the two Americans wounded in Thursday's attack\nThat killed a police chase we were talking about in southern Afghanistan who you said was a very a very powerful figure they're a what a brigadier general a shot what does that tell you about where the where the wire is\nWell I I'm not sure it tells us anything specific apparently it was a ... bird the security detail pulled his weapon and kill general regime can will do generally you don't know who your\nFriends are so your own security turned gun\nExactly and and that's pretty hard to to draw big conclusions obviously it's a challenge I think more importantly it just shows they continued instability in Afghanistan and the difficulty of reaching something that we're all comfortable with but I don't think it's hopeless and I think it's still important\nThe Iranians are in there and the Russians are now in there that's a little different from when you were in there so it's even more complicated however we've gotten a lot tougher with Pakistan what do you like what where do you stressed about in this in the Seventeen year conflict\nWell I think the fact that inside Afghanistan the political reality is they haven't yet been able to hit stability with a popular president and ineffective parliament and working internally\nThey're still the biggest part of the problem\nBut now that you've got Iran Russia China to a small extent Pakistan of course in India and other players [noise] it makes it awful hard now that's Afghanistan's history people always wanted to keep Afghanistan unsettled because then the great game it was in all of their interest to do so\nWhat we've got to do is try to work past that because an unsettled place in the world now is a haven for terrorists or for the problem you say we did make mistakes we made a lot of mistakes but whether well you know we tend to look at the graveyard of empires story and and there's some truth to that Afghanistan has always been hard\nBut I think as Bob comb are set about Vietnam we did Vietnam ten years one year at a time\nAnd I think that that's what we've done in Afghanistan in fact we've been very cyclical and how much effort we put in initially we put way too little in terms of military force money then we put more we had political lack of conviction and our part we couldn't build confidence on the part of all of the players\nThat we talked about pulling out the day we surge stats\nThat try and so whenever you do that you create uncertainty and when people are uncertain about the future they hedged their bets they don't commit entirely they don't join the army they don't invest they don't do whatever you want him to do and that under cut your chance of success\nFeel as though if they only let me finish the job\nWell that's what ifs personally I Do think we were in the right direction but but I Can't tell you with\nGeneral Stanley McChrystal here general you this is a a a book about leaders myth in reality ... a lot of people did you is one of the great ... could you as one of the great channels of this generation are you still learning about leadership\nCompletely I in fact I went through life being educated to be a leader being trained getting opportunities at every level to execute leadership\nI wrote two books before this about leadership and then I came to the understanding I didn't really understand the essence of it there was something missing so we went back to Pluto parks lives the first century\nStudy of forty eight leaders Greeks and Romans to try to find out what it is we don't get and why if we got it wrong and what what we learned as we did this as leadership is not what we think it is and it never has been\nWe've looked at it through three deaths that distort our view of leadership one is a formulaic mission that says that if you do the right things have a checklist\nThat you're going to be effective the second is that the leaders are responsible for all of a success and failure in an organization and that's never borne out by the data\nIn fact it's it's a fact of followers in context and then the finalists that we pick and follow leaders you produce results the bottom line if it's a commercial company or commercial success and the reality is that's not true either we follow leaders who are homeless cereal failures in many cases\nWe look at leaders in an emotional unrealistic way we put them on the pedestal we say we want humble leaders but narcissistic are over represented in senior leadership roles so it's this dichotomy between what we think we want and need and what we do in practice\nDo you think fundamentally we're looking for somebody better than us to show us the way well\nWe're certainly looking for somebody to show is the way we like to think that they are better than us out of the smarter or more successful or stronger\nBut in reality that's that's a fool's errand because people are people and follow wars have much more responsibility for the outcome than we want to pretend if you look at general Jackson and his great victory down at New Orleans that you wrote such a great book about\nIt was his army and all the players wasn't Andy Jackson that did that alone he was important but he wasn't the guy and yet history tends to put the spotlight on the star the show\nNow at on paper back by the way I got him our but our generals got to talk of his was difficulty about\nSome of the leaders that he outlined alone with Jeff Eggers and Jason manned Joan a General Stanley McChrystal hear the name of the book as leaders Mitt than

kill made\nA General Stanley McChrystal back in Studio the great thing about the general writing books never when we get to see his book but you also get to see the general Hi he only he\nUm he will be a great guest on every single major issue would you pick and choose your places and yet this is one of your places the name of the book as leaders Smith in reality you go and even for a great leader in your own right you want to learn more and it is is this written for the future military leader at the future or is the future pedestrian civilian\nIt's written for all of us and it's written not just for people who are likely to be leaders but it's gonna it's written for people who are likely to follow leaders or judge leaders which is all of us\nAnd it doesn't give you a checklist for how to be a great leader or even ready to lead or\nWhat it does is it builds the complexity of the situation and if you step back and go this is how hard it really is you have a better understanding for it you can elect people better you can select you can promote better and we can predict what leadership is going to be needed for the future with a little more clarity right\nAnd you are we already what over a well Disney what are some other leaders that you wanted\nTo highlight here whether it was interesting we we took on Coco Chanel and you'll be surprised to know I didn't even know she was a person before we read this book\nAnd yet Coco Chanel an orphan born in ...\nBecomes an extraordinary business person but she also establishes maybe one of the first brands and the brand was her she lived a life style became a persona and made people want to buy her products because they wanted to be like cocoa\nWhile at the same time she was a rock hard business person through some pretty difficult years\nThere were some others like Abu Musab al Zarqawi the the leader of al Qaeda in Iraq who my organization killed in June of two thousand sex\nAfter going after him for about two and a half years of bloody pursuit and struggle against him [noise]\nHe had a very difficult upbringing wasn't very well educated but found that if she\nWas the most convicted person made me the most intense believer in the organization and he could constantly demonstrate that in the book we talk about him first trying to remove tattoos on his arm\nWith bleach when that didn't work yet as I wrote a razor blade smuggled into the prison and he got a tattoo off and on the other prisoners saw that and\nWhat they saw with somebody who believed so deeply were so rigorous in his adherents to Islam that he became a naturally magnetic person for them later when he led al Qaeda in Iraq although he was a very effective leader in terms of moving around the battlefield it was that white hot\nYou sell a tree that made people attracted to him\nWell it's so in a way as much as he was evil and he was your number one target on some way you respected him\nWell and I learned from it as well because in reality he was very effective and had I been on the same side as him I think he would have been a tremendous comrade and yet ... obviously I was opposed to him and we have to count\nSo uh so Leslie about what's going on in the world today a UC that we still have a war on terror ISIS has been a diminish\nAh Iraq has a shot if they could finally pick a a new government Afghanistan is very much up in the year when you look in the region do you look at a run at the root of most of the problems like this administration does\nAround huge contributor to it and if you look at the Iranian Quds Force in other parts of their military that are [noise]\nAre helping Hamas Hezbollah other organizations and certainly for sure I'll Assad's regime yes what we're we seem to be evolving past just a terrorist period al ... in Iraq and ISIS and we're almost into regional great power politics between Iran Saudi Arabia the major players\nHow that plays addict could play out in ... in a major conflict or it could continue to burn up the periphery like Yemen\nAnd die in Lebanon [laughter] I Know the general or admiral McRaven was extremely critical of the president came out and gave some a blistering accounts or do you think he was right to do that I Do and because you agree with what he said or if you're a civilian you can answer at any\nOn the daytime blues in uniform would you\nKnow I don't think in uniform you should do that and I think the military have to be very particularly retired military you have to be very thoughtful about when we weigh in but I think apple McRaven op eds you're talking about where he laid down the line I have just incredible regard for Bill McRaven any operates on values\nAnd you are not a fan of the president is that safe to say\nWell I think I think we as Americans have got to decide what kind of person we want in the presidency and not argue about who it is now ... gonna be next\nWe're to go back ... first principles and say what do we want our president to be how much integrity [noise] how much forthrightness how how smart we want them what kind of experience and I think if we did that if we had a conversation on that in America we might come to a different appraisal of our current president but also who we need for the\nBut I Do think that these people are financed I Do think they're closed I Do think they're push forward and I do think a lot of them inside our legitimately looking for a better life and want to save their families we just can't be their answer\nWe can't wholeheartedly taken forty five thousand people were taking hundreds of thousands a year we have millions here legally why do people think that it's selfish to act in your self interest is the responsible thing to do Michael W. when I say Michael\nHigh and also a thank you for coming to knock off a last Saturday I got a great trip for you about coalition building or a based on the um Roy Disney and Walt Disney and General McChrystal's\nPlan you you'll find\nThis kind of civility\nIn American politics the essential a cold or off the ... of the United states in a way that makes them look like perfect\nGentleman we need in America\nAnd by the way of uh that was in a in a development there they artist that's making that you know a was born in Texas He is from Mexican heritage he is Mary\nJo ... a Russian from Siberia\nAnd uh I watch it again the whole of the ...\nThere are at an offer because his wife is a rising star\nAll right thanks when I go and uh I'm a big fan of General McChrystal he's just he's not the biggest fan of President Trump and that's perfectly okay everybody has different styles I mean I look at a President Trump I don't think President Trump fires General McChrystal I think that President Obama fired General McChrystal about hearsay said to a ... a left wing magazine\nNothing to do with him this guy was featured on sixty minutes set to author the surge was going to settle Afghanistan and he's pulled out of there because disparaging things were said about Joe Biden and the lack of leadership from the White House this White House this president\nWho got over his battle with\nA Ted Cruz over his personal animosity with Marco Rubio got through the fact that Nikki Haley didn't endorse him and said some negative things about him and then hired her General McChrystal saying negative things however choose me General McChrystal staff\nSay never negative things about vice president Biden and the president then Obama would never have gotten President Trump to fire him he just wouldn't do it he reviewed publicly absolutely\nBut that'll be about it put thing uh I just I was like to thank all of everybody who came out in Tampa I like to thank everyone who came out in Norfolk on Saturday everyone who came out in Nashville, Tennessee yesterday at the city winery in the afternoon at the ... in Norfolk\nAnd in Tampa we were at the jab theater all these dogs America great from the start

the punch drunk ended up being entertaining time for really drunk they in every now\nAnd you never know that could be the that could be the answer hey a quick thing I wanted to bring up before the showers complete and it's a bit of a it's a bit of a right turn but I Do want to bring it to\nAnyone who says the ... the United states has been easy on Russia has not taken account that he expelled sixty or sixty or members of the Russian delegation close the Seattle a consulate\nOf course uh gave lethal weapons to Ukraine and now a allows them to fight a and stick up for themselves against the Russians which President Obama never did and also isn't take into account there were about to pull out of the IMF treaty that the Russians have been violating here's Lindsey Graham cut thirty five\nAbsolutely the right move the Russians have been chanting the Chinese are building up a uh their their missile or I like President Trump being tough\nHe walked away from the Iran they'll call us it was a joke of the deal you know Obama tried to ignore end up paying the Iranians and see what you got I don't want to ignore and opinions to Saudi Arabians because the many things to change a light being tough on Russia\nAnd walking away from this deal is a good decision cost the Russians never honored their end of the bargain and the Chinese are moving forward with our weapons program and we need to counteract\nThat is a Senator Lindsey Graham who is critical to prison for not being stronger against Saudi Arabia has called out the prince\nWho said you better step but he said you better step aside the same time stuck up for Brett Kavanaugh because he believes Brett Kavanaugh was the right guy was being just skewered by Democrats who saw nothing but political gain in labeling him a sexist or drunk\nOr which is not true in either in either case and again Lindsey Graham calling balls and strikes but loves the fact that the prison\nIt's going up the Russians you know what happened when we signed this agreement are indeed goes out the window they're allowed to develop and cheat and we don't see you have no choice\nBut to pull out [noise] meanwhile I have to tell you uh take one

o'clock or cable line live from the ws twenty four hour news center one what county middle school students in custody another hailed a hero following the stabbing of a teacher in her own classroom stabbing happened\nDuring class change it trick a middle school eighth grader ... as a fellow classmates stabbed his favorite teacher in the chest with an eight inch butcher night he immediately went to the teacher's aide and held his honey on her ... and tell help get a ride\nAnd I just tried to stay calm and as like comfort that I could be to her because I didn't want her\nTo prank right to be with you\nTell them what I Know your big average guy you don't overreact to any one poll that's that's what real clear about is taking the average but this Wall Street journal poll I found I found really a really interesting number one that has the president's approval rating is forty seven percent basically higher than President Obama's at the time how that happened\n[noise] [laughter] that's a good question it was a like a six month six point net gain for him over the last month um and ah\nThis this is a good trend for Republicans with just a couple of weeks left me\nI obviously as you said um you know we don't try and focus on too much on any individual poll one poll but certainly this has good news for Republicans and the trumps getting more popular and he certainly\nYou know if you look at it he's not getting more popular among Democrats they hated him from the beginning they still have them they don't give them any credit for anything so these games are really coming among Republicans and also independence and that's important or as\nYou know because these elections are going to turn on who goes out to vote in a lot of these swing districts and to the extent more Republican turnout and more independents are arguing the president favorably that's potentially really good deals\nFor ... years which not a when asked is your preference for the what is your preference for the outcome of this November's congressional elections who would you want to have power forty one percent say Republicans forty eight percent said Democrats\n[noise] yeah and that was that the top line national generic ballot number and nine percent that's a strong number for Democrats completely\nJibe with the idea that they are on the verge of of taking control the house of representatives getting you know well over the twenty three seats they need to to win control\nOf the interesting part about that though Brian as they sat in the in the wall Street Journal article that in competitive swing districts that the Democratic advantage has almost disappeared and it's ... they're basically running even and so what that suggests is that Democrats are maybe over pulling\nOn the generic ballots really strong and very very blue areas of the country um but but much more competitive in some of these swing districts and again that's good news if you're a Republican running and again suburban districts and in some of these various states\nUm so keep an eye on that I mean I'm I'm I'm got a real close eye on the generic ballot but also\nUm how that plays out in these individual districts because that would really matter\nThen well a couple of the things I Want to bring you to what is the most important factor in deciding your boat\nOr this is the first time I've seen this number one economy and jobs Twenty one percent that could explain the the approval rating going up for the president healthcare Seventy percent it's about even though the ... Democrats did not run on Obamacare they now think they have the advantage on health care\nAnd changing Washington fourteen percent immigration is six does that change with this this image of a caravan storming our border\n[noise] sure I mean the good news will certainly Dr what ... what what voters are paying attention to and what their concerns are if you go back and look right after the Parkland shooting in Florida gun control shot up on the list of voter concerns\nOr to the top for a very brief period of time and then sort of settled back down to you know states has its its normal position in the in the issue matrix\nUm immigration has typically been\nPretty low um as a general election or mid term election it's it's certainly higher on the concerns of Republican voters to care of and the amount of attention that this is getting on news will definitely drive that that issue up the ladder um the longer it stays in the news events election I think that's probably\nA benefits Republican because that's one of the\nIt's one of Trump's her signature issues or it's one that he's seen as being really strong line and also put Democrats in a really tough spot I mean what are they what are they going to say that voters are they going to say no I I you know I Want everybody to come in um you know they have to sort of it puts in a tough spot with their constituency in terms of security\nThe border which again is not something that the the base of the party wants to hear but it would also turn off independents if there was a yet we just want to bring all seven thousand of them in um that the humane thing to do\nA very interesting I you know I just see these laws are so corrected well to stop it on a separate note elections aside I'm wonder if the president would do better to define what exactly the two thousand eight law they gave that signal the Central Americans to come here because Dianne Feinstein is behind it\nAnd that will be a very specific about people that everybody knows rather than something that's overly broad where Democrats one open borders which leaves them open to or rejoined or\nUh I'm just curious to see how that plays capital was unexpected now the caravan is somewhat unexpected the one thing we know Tom is something that's going to happen that's unexpected whether it's going to be with Saudi Arabia and international affairs situation and security which Democrats seem to think they can make some ground on\nNow I sent the average American doesn't really expect much from Saudi Arabia\nAnd thinks they did this and things we still have to be allies with them because in a bad area they might be a somebody we have to deal with do you think Saudi Arabia is an election issue\nNo not really I think most Americans uh you know obviously they they to the extent they know anything about this news there there you know\nHorrified by the fact that the journalist was killed and it was a gruesome or heinous acts but in terms of it in motivating people\nTo vote one way or another I don't see it happening I'm you know the kind of thing that would motivate people is is it a terrorist attack and event of that magnitude on our soil that was really sort of\nShock and galvanize the electorate but absent that it's typically not the case that you're going to see you know\nStuff that's foreign policy related or this or a day in day out type of foreign policy related news\nAround the world is not really going to move voters at a significant way\nAll right we're talking with Tom Bevan real clear politics cofounder I Want you to you with Jonathan Martin said about these midterms are the New York times and told me if you agree 'cause his teeth\nFor this different from past midterms is that there does not seem to be an appreciable fall off in the intensity and either party you know you guys know and two dollars and six Democrats won big in part because the pay was depressed\nIn twenty ten and twenty fourteen Democrats could not get their votes revved up from President Obama was not on the ballot this time got it seems like both parties are fired up ready to go\nAnd it is and the numbers reflect that do you think is going to be over fifty percent of the population goes to vote\nI Do I think it's going to be huge and I'll tell you what it wasn't like this until the Capitol hearing Republicans were really having trouble getting their voters energized and getting them to pay attention and and all that Kavanaugh hearings changed that\nAnd the question was whether it was that the intensity the outrage all that stuff was going to sustain through the election um\nAnd you know we're halfway there two weeks basically until the election and it looks like it is at least for the time being the Republican energy has risen to match the enthusiasm of the Democrats pretty darn close to it\nAnd now that doesn't translate necessarily into votes but it certainly does appear that both sides is look across all ... all different demographic categories everybody seems pretty far enough to vote\nYeah let's go to the Senate if we can the president was in Nevada it seemed to me the difference Dean Heller was once arch enemy in the Republican Party has a point ... all one point seven percentage average lead in Nevada said trending in the right way for Republicans\nIt is a he was trailing in that\nIn the polls therefore I Would say the better part of three or four months again until the cabin on her and then you saw all Republicans coalesced behind them are behind Heller and uh you know I think Trump's\nTrump's appearance there helped helped also juice the base the most recent poll we have out of there as hell or up seven points that's a big number for him but he had gone without leading in the polls for um [noise]\nSince all the way back to the end of July and now he's led you leading in the last polls that were taken in the end of September and the first two weeks of October so that's a pretty remarkable turnaround for Dean Heller of Nevada\nEspecially a state that Hillary Clinton won\nCorrect in a state where Democrats feel part of the problem too for Democrats we've seen this appear in polls in Texas and Nevada and even a certain degree in Arizona they're not getting the support\nAmong Latinos that they mean Dean Heller is getting thirty seven thirty eight thirty nine percent of the Hispanic vote democratic cannot afford to give up that much of this ... expect to win either of these races\nOr you know that's counterintuitive treatment will Republicans thought they thought if you talked about building a wall and uh and if you took on DACA or a chain migration that would be a debt to the Hispanic vote that's not playing out\n[noise] it's not it's not because um and we talked about this before I mean his tax code is not a model is a you know you see older Hispanics are much more conservative much more supportive actually of of legal immigration but opposed to illegal immigration\nIt's the younger cohort of Hispanics who are much more liberal much more open to that sort of open borders type message\nAnd and really vote in pretty heavy number against Republican but it's not just a you know the Hispanic ... population votes is a solid block against Republican so that's where I think folks like Dean Heller and and Ted Cruz have done a good job or communicated communicating to the span of committed\nBy by the way on a side note on that issue the president just tweeted this out Guatemala Honduras El Salvador were not able to do their job of stopping people from leaving their country and coming illegally to ours we will now begin cutting off substantial reducing the massive foreign aid ... routinely given to them [noise]\nGame on Arizona I find fascinating because uh the fighter pilot makes Sally up point seven on the average but dad is training to hurt camp\nWhich is worth one point six billion dollars falcons beat the giants twenty three to twenty on Monday Night football World Series gets underway Tuesday in Boston game one between the red Sox and Dodgers is it in white part\nThat will do you ask me news time to thirty
