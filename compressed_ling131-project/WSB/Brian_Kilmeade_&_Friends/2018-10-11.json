some of these reporters are doing their their dramatic for no reason but she sounded like she was visibly shaken by that wow\nRight that that seemed like genuine emotion there\nAnd they think about

morning at two o'clock I'm Mark ... from the U.S twenty four hour news center the very latest on hurricane Michael coming up\nYou ask me twenty four hour traffic center where we have on the west the expressway and Douglas County all lanes still walk from this multi vehicle entry crash by twenty he's about before you recently\nWrote exit forty one your best option is highway Seventy eight getting over towards stay route six for an alternate more details on our pool traffic up there and a few minutes reporting live in the tropics center Steve Winslow ws be\n[noise] well I don't know but I Would say this to me there's there's less there there were so used to twist interns and things not being as they appear I think for the most part to scream Lee stressful position I think she wanted a break\nBut it's still going to get it but she would still get the same amount of break if she waited until the day after the midterms\nBut then it would lose kind of give eggs and her break and when I was like hey it didn't go well let me get out\nWell and that's what everybody who leaves after the the ... no matter what it will inherently create the sensation\nUh after mid term when you know the administration goes through a a cycle or as everyone does\nA and if it happens after what's expected to be a setback for Republicans\nThat it will have the rats from sinking ship and why are they doing that so getting this out early take some of that off of that and certainly that's a reasonable that's a reasonable point of view but there still seems that the the timing is just doesn't it it it's not it's not helpful\nAnd I will say that on our own here that are going to ask about twenty twenty now I'm not running for twenty\nI can tell me she went out and found for disappointing and\nSo that's one thing is clear and she said that to us on our show on Fox and friends last week or two weeks ago now that I'm not running and I'll campaign for him I think he'll she'll take 'em up on that especially\nBecause I think she's extremely popular more popular now than when she was a few years ago\nBut what does it tell you in the big picture you just put your analysts had on for a second that he could have rivals like Nikki Haley who is very critical of him during the campaign and who endorsed Marco Rubio and wants to bat with Marco Rubio and still join and have power and exit like this\nOh it's a good thing I mean the good cabinets and successful administrations rely on presidents who are able to balance voices\nFrom competing factions most famously a most notably Abraham Lincoln who ... who took not just rivals but mortal enemies moral political enemies and brought them into his cabinet and that was back in the cabinet had considerably more power\n[noise] um but I think in this case\nWe see here\nAre more important question the long term question about what does Nikki Haley do is she going to run and twenty twenty and all of the machinations about is it going to be Lindsey Graham comes in to replace Jeff Sessions and da da da da da da and maybe you know this answer who's going to be\nFive a few ... entries we came up with and I think they're genius OK Allison\nCame up with Joe Lieberman a you know Alison Mansfield ...\nFamiliar with are excellent work yes or write\nA good she's listening so it was a very good [laughter] I number two I think the Kelly Ayotte remember she was out there to replace Lieberman is one of the three musketeers when they were traveling the country are there that will be going I also think Ryan Zinke he would be a good move because\nHe is he understands that President as well as anybody any certainly he fights wars huge de understands a diplomatic thing and he's already proven pretty effective cabinet member\nAnd of course we got the other ones that everybody's talking about and that's Rick Cornell and Dina pal\nUm I I Would say right now it would look like from a Washington perspective it looks like zinc he\nAh and up how heavy inside tracks and of course there are factions within this administration and you know how the president makes these choices is that if the scorpions in a bottle they fight their way through a and then the the winner gets the spoils\nUm and I am sure that we will see a playing out over the next couple of weeks\nOr a tough fight for that but I think that in in either zinc heat or pow totally different ways to go a power would be in a keeping more with Nikki Haley's model\nI'm well how did he described her as the glamorous a Nikki Haley um but a more a diplomatic or a welcoming face for the world at the un ah but still tough I'm sure\nA zinc he goes the other way which is more of a John Bolton approach ah which says look or you know we think the UN's got serious problems are and uh we are here to demonstrate that and thank you certainly also would have the advantage of a successful mind meld with Trump\nSo we want to see what the cabinet that go beyond the midterms I Know we're about a month away do you think of any of the way things fade up and down\nI Believe the Republicans uses his momentum to keep it going but I also there was many people thought a couple of weeks ago that the Manafort story and Michael Cohen's story would hurt the president and the midterms that is such a review mirror right now\nSo who do you think who do you think has momentum coming out of the cabinet catastrophe\nAh the cabinets atrophy [noise] um I I Would say this\nOr you played a clip from Britain earlier I think he was he's he's on the money which is the this did a great thing for Republicans which is it it fuse together conservatives in populists um the culture warrior president and his and his base of supporters\nWho aren't idiot logically conservative in the same way the traditional Republicans are but they do see themselves locked in a in a prominent and very bitter culture war with the left\nAnd they and and making this about me too\nAnd sort of a reaction to me me too the backlash um brought together the two short of warring wings of the Republican Party a and gave a reason for everybody to get back together um among is a long time um but I Would say this\nThe net effect here and we've seen it already in polls [noise]\nThe net effect here as if you are Republican running in a a Democrat leaning or a state or district it's bad news or if you're a Democrat running and a Republican leaning state or district it's bad news\nThis is revving up the base for Republicans but it's also further even further intensifying for Democrats are good news for Republicans it will save seats\nHow many will depend on what intervenes over the next month but four Republicans this will definitely have the effect of saving say for sure\nI'm so I'm going to say with political wrote today and and and they said prior to the cabinet decision a confirmation they wrote this a total of six ... currently held by Republicans that are firmly in play rate is lean Republican or worse for the geo pay\nOr the Democrats have only about a half dozen like that they say there's political two hundred nine seats firmly or leaning in the Democratic column in the house only nine shy of the two hundred and Eighteen that the party needs\nSo there's a lot of gray area a lot can happen remember too close to call states seem to all go to Trump in twenty sixteen well Trump's going to lose but he is too close and a lot of these states and they ended up going to Trump and a lot of cases\nHe well he he he lost some of the uh too close to call states um any one in places where we didn't expect them to\nUm we didn't think that Wisconsin was too close to call 'em but he did when we didn't have enough polling um and we made some gases analyst made gases based on prior performance or that we're not borne out um what we're going to see this\nTime we would remember this turnout in\nMidterms is about a third less than in quadrennial presidential elections so you have a smaller electorate\nA and a smaller electorate in which the intensity of base voters therefore ... matters a great deal more um people who are not partisan are less likely to vote in a midterm daycare they ... they care less about the parties and they therefore they care less about voting generally speaking\nAnd as a consequence or it matters\nA great deal that's why we care about these intensity question so much what we don't know yet and this is the and this is the big don't know is how big is the pool and in Fort Trump\nHe was helped enormously by the fact that the pool got real small in the upper Midwest a lot fewer people turned out to vote in those states than we expected there were millions of missing voters that was a reflection of weak democratic enthusiasm in places like Michigan and Wisconsin\nAnd this had a lot to do with urban voters and African American voters will those voters show up to vote as a proxy war against Trump and if they do and if they if if they if that share shows back up the Republicans are going to get their clocks cleaned in the upper Midwest and they would lose enough that they would come close to losing enough seats in those states alone\nUh especially on the governor's level to make it a good outcome for Democrats so we just got to see who who who is really going to show up how many people\nSo he would what percentage of the population being that we are in in this unprecedented time of anger and passion right what do what would be a number that we have not seen in a while at the midterms what can we expect and what do you expect\nIn two thousand fourteen in the last midterm election we had the lowest voter participation of any ... any election dating back to Nineteen forty two it was thirty four percent it was bad it was real bad\nUm and that worked out well for Republicans in a lot of places Republicans generally do better\nAt any given Republican temps devoted to higher frequency than any given Democrat that has to do with\nIncome that has to do is educational attainment\nThe richer and more educated you are the more likely you are to vote 'em and that for a variety of reasons and some reasons we don't even probably no but that's the way it is and so the Republican base has more reliable than the Democratic base generally speaking a lower turnout affairs generally are better for Republicans than they are for Democrats [noise]\nThe kind of history most votes would rather not have had\nMade Michael became the first category for hurricane to make landfall in Florida a veteran storm chaser was in Panama
